40|$|The ARENA is a {{scientific}} underwater cable network having a mesh-like cable topology. It will deploy {{many kinds of}} sensors in a vast research area in the deep sea, and will provide long-term continuous data. The most challenging technical issue to realize a mesh-like cable-network is <b>power</b> <b>feeding.</b> The constant current <b>power</b> <b>feeding</b> system with current to current converters {{is one of the}} promising system as it is robust against cable shunt failure. The authors conducted computer simulations on the startup procedure of the <b>power</b> <b>feeding</b> network and behaviors of the network when cable shunt faults occur. It was confirmed that the proposed <b>power</b> <b>feeding</b> system is stable and can continue to provide electric power even if there is a cable shunt fault...|$|R

40|$|Data center power {{infrastructure}} incurs massive capital costs, {{which typically}} exceed energy costs {{over the life}} of the facility. To squeeze maximum value from the infrastructure, researchers have proposed over-subscribing power circuits, relying on the observation that peak loads are rare. To ensure availability, these proposals employ power capping, which throttles server performance during utilization spikes to enforce safe power budgets. However, because budgets must be enforced locally—at each power distribution unit (PDU) —local utilization spikes may force throttling even when power delivery capacity is available elsewhere. Moreover, the need to maintain reserve capacity for fault tolerance on power delivery paths magnifies the impact of utilization spikes. In this paper, we develop mechanisms to better utilize installed power infrastructure, reducing reserve capacity margins and avoiding performance throttling. Unlike conventional high-availability data centers, where collocated servers share identical primary and secondary <b>power</b> <b>feeds,</b> we reorganize <b>power</b> <b>feeds</b> to create shuffled power distribution topologies. Shuffled topologies spread secondary <b>power</b> <b>feeds</b> over numerous PDUs, reducing reserve capacity requirements to tolerate a single PDU failure. Second, we propose Power Routing, which schedules IT load dynamically across redundant <b>power</b> <b>feeds</b> to: (1) shift slack to servers with growing power demands, and (2) balance power draw across AC phases to reduce heating and improve electrical stability. We describe efficient heuristics for scheduling servers to PDUs (an NP-complete problem). Using data collected from nearly 1000 servers in three production facilities, we demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce the required power infrastructure capacity relative to conventional high-availability data centers by 32 % without performance degradation...|$|R

40|$|We studied {{effect of}} film growth {{uniformity}} for low temperature silicon epitaxy using 60 MHz Very High Frequency Chemical Vapor Deposition (VHF PECVD). High quality, high growth rate epitaxy silicon {{can be obtained}} at low temperature using VHF PECVD. The major source of the film uniformity appears to be voltage distribution across the plasma electrode, and the uniformity could be improved by using double symmetric <b>power</b> <b>feed</b> using shielded cable. Use of double symmetric <b>power</b> <b>feed</b> around {{the center of the}} plasma electrode greatly reduced the voltage non-uniformity, and the shielded cables made stable power transport. As a result, the film thickness uniformity was improved from 21 % to 5. 8 % with our modified reactor configuration...|$|R
