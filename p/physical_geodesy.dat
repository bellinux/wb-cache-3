50|$|The {{shape of}} the Earth is {{to a large extent}} the result of its rotation, which causes its {{equatorial}} bulge, and the competition of geological processes such as the collision of plates and of volcanism, resisted by the Earth's gravity field. This applies to the solid surface, the liquid surface (dynamic sea surface topography) and the Earth's atmosphere. For this reason, the study of the Earth's gravity field is called <b>physical</b> <b>geodesy</b> by some.|$|E
50|$|After {{studies of}} astronomy, {{mathematics}} and geodesy {{he worked in}} Germany {{and later in the}} National Survey of Austria. Later he set up the scientific department of the Federal Office for Metrology and Survey (BEV), Vienna.

TT was defined to be a linear scaling of TCG, such that the unit of TT is the SI second on the geoid (Earth surface at mean sea level). This left the exact ratio between TT time and TCG time as something to be determined by experiment.

50|$|His {{research}} covered many {{fields of}} geodesy. As {{a result of}} his doctor’s dissertation“A contribution to the methods of optical distance measuring, specially with regard tothe problems of automatic plotting“ and for his refinement of the modulation systemof the Swedish EDM instrument Geodimeter he became one in the record of Swedishinventors. However, many geodesists (and mathematicians) know him for the firsttime for his new matrix algebra with generalized inverses, published in 1955(in Swedish) and 1957 (in English). Seven years later, fascinated by M.S.Molodensky’s new approach to solve the basic problems of <b>physical</b> <b>geodesy,</b> hepresented his original idea of analytical downward continuation of the gravityanomaly to an internal sphere (“the Bjerhammar sphere”). Among other areas of interest are his original proposals of recovering theEarth’s gravity field by using the energy integral for satellites (1967) and by thetheory of general relativity using atomic clocks (1975 and 1985) as well as his studieson the correlation between the gravity field and the Fennoscandian land upliftphenomenon (post-glacial rebound) in the 1970s. He is the author of about 200 scientific articles,including two textbooks, many of the articles published as internal KTH reports. Hechaired the International Association of Geodesy study group on Statistical Methods in Geodesy (1963-1967).|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the United States Department of Defense, {{together}} with scientists of other institutions and countries, {{began to develop}} the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS 60). The term datum as used here refers to a smooth surface somewhat arbitrarily defined as zero elevation, consistent {{with a set of}} surveyor's measures of distances between various stations, and differences in elevation, all reduced to a grid of latitudes, longitudes, and elevations. Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the spirit level, plumb line, or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see <b>physical</b> <b>geodesy).</b> As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the geoid, a surface that is not readily found using satellite geodesy. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping. Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the geoid.|$|E

40|$|To {{formulate}} {{the fundamental}} formula of <b>physical</b> <b>geodesy</b> at the physical {{surface of the}} Earth, the gravity anomalies are used instead of the gravity disturbances, because the geodetic heights above the geocentric reference ellipsoid are not usually available. The relation between the gravity anomaly and the gravity disturbance {{is defined as a}} product of the normal gravity gradient referred to the telluroid and the height anomaly according to Molodensky's theory of the normal heights (Molodensky, 1945; Molodensky et al., 1960). Considering the normal gravity gradient referred {{to the surface of the}} geocentric reference ellipsoid, this relation is redefined as a function of the normal height (Vanícek et al., 1999). When the orthometric heights are practically used for the realization of the vertical datum, the geoid-quasigeoid correction is applied to the fundamental formula of <b>physical</b> <b>geodesy</b> to determine the precise geoid. Theoretical formulation of the geoid-quasigeoid correction to the fundamental formula of <b>physical</b> <b>geodesy</b> can be found in Martinec (1993) and Vanícek et al. (1999).

40|$|For the {{determination}} of the earth" s gravity field many types of observations are available nowadays, e. g., terrestrial gravimetry, airborne gravimetry, satellite-to-satellite tracking, satellite gradiometry etc. The mathematical connection between these observables {{on the one hand and}} gravity field and shape of the earth on the other hand, is called the integrated concept of <b>physical</b> <b>geodesy.</b> In this paper harmonic wavelets are introduced by which the gravitational part of the gravity field can be approximated progressively better and better, reflecting an increasing flow of observations. An integrated concept of <b>physical</b> <b>geodesy</b> in terms of harmonic wavelets is presented. Essential tools for approximation are integration formulas relating an integral over an internal sphere to suitable linear combinations of observation functionals, i. e., linear functionals representing the geodetic observables. A scale discrete version of multiresolution is described for approximating the gravitational potential outside and on the earth" s surface. Furthermore, an exact fully discrete wavelet approximation is developed for the case of band-limited wavelets. A method for combined global outer harmonic and local harmonic wavelet modelling is proposed corresponding to realistic earth" s models. As examples, the role of wavelets is discussed for the classical Stokes problem, the oblique derivative problem, satellite-to-satellite tracking, satellite gravity gradiometry, and combined satellite-to-satellite tracking and gradiometry...|$|E
