40|$|Tensiometers {{sense the}} {{chemical}} potential of water (or water potential, Ψw) in an external phase of interest {{by measuring the}} pressure in an internal volume of liquid water in equilibrium with that phase. For sub-saturated phases, the internal pressure is below atmospheric and frequently negative; the liquid is under tension. Here, we present the initial characterization of a new tensiometer based on a microelectromechanical pressure sensor and a nanoporous membrane. We explain the mechanism of operation, fabrication, and calibration of this device. We show that these microtensiometers operate stably out to water potentials below - 10 MPa, a tenfold extension {{of the range of}} current tensiometers. Finally, we present use of the device to perform an accurate measurement of the equation of state of liquid water at pressures down to - 14 MPa. We conclude with a discussion of outstanding design considerations, and of the opportunities opened by the extended range of stability and the small form factor in sensing applications, and in fundamental studies of the thermodynamic properties of water.

40|$|In {{perfusion}} experiments, {{the hydraulic}} conductance of stem segments () responds {{to changes in}} the properties of the perfusate, such as the ionic strength (), pH, and cationic identity. We review the experimental and theoretical work on this phenomenon. We then proceed to explore the hypothesis that electrokinetic effects in the bordered pit membrane (BPM) contribute to this response. In particular, we develop a model based on electroviscosity in which hydraulic conductance of an electrically charged porous membrane varies with the properties of the electrolyte. We use standard electrokinetic theory, coupled with measurements of electrokinetic properties of plant materials from the literature, to determine how the conductance of BPMs, and therefore, may change due to electroviscosity. We predict a nonmonotonic variation of with with a maximum reduction of 18 %. We explore how this reduction depends on the characteristics of the sap and features of the BPM, such as pore size, density of chargeable sites, and their dissociation constant. Our predictions are consistent with changes in observed for physiological values of sap and pH. We conclude that electroviscosity is likely responsible, at least partially, for the electrolyte dependence of conductance through pits and that electroviscosity may be strong enough {{to play an important role}} in other transport processes in xylem. We conclude by proposing experiments to differentiate the impact of electroviscosity on from that of other proposed mechanisms. Michael Santiago, Vinay <b>Pagay,</b> and Abraham D. Strooc...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: High {{temperature}} stress {{has been linked}} to detrimental effects on berry composition during ripening. This study aimed {{to assess the impact of}} an evaporative cooling system located inside the grapevine canopy to mitigate extreme temperature effects on grape berry composition during ripening. Methods and Results: During three seasons (2012 to 2015), an intra-canopy sprinkler system at the bunch zone was tested on Cabernet Sauvignon vines. The system cyclically sprayed (20 [*]s/ 10 [*]min) for an air temperature above 38 °C, cooling the air inside the canopy by 3 to 5 °C. This is in agreement with an air cooling simulation model. The relative humidity in the canopy also increased in the sprinkler-cooled canopy. No differences were detected in TSS, although sugar per berry was significantly higher in treated vines because of increased berry mass. There was a tendency for higher anthocyanins and phenolic substances per berry in cooled berries measured from two seasons and higher concentration of anthocyanins in wine from cooled fruit measured only in one season. We define indices that can be used to assess the efficiency of sprinkler cooling and to demonstrate the high efficiency of intra-canopy sprinklers compared to other systems. Conclusion: Despite cooling operating only over a small duration of the ripening period, the increased berry mass indicates that high temperature, even for a short period, has a profound effect on berry growth. Other berry compositional properties and wine, however, were not impacted. Significance of Study: This research demonstrates the potential of an efficient intra-canopy sprinkler system to reduce heat stress during ripening. L. Caravia, V. <b>Pagay,</b> C. Collins and S. D.

40|$|Various {{amounts of}} {{pelletised}} oil cake {{were applied to}} mature, non-astringent ‘Fuyu’ persimmon (Diospyros × kaki Thunb.) trees from 2011 to 2013, to evaluate the most appropriate rate of application of the organic fertiliser to improve tree vigour and reproductive growth. Treatments included application of 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 % of the recommended amount (RA) of oil cake, respectively. Oil cake application at 50 %, 75 %, or 100 % of the RA increased dry matter (DM) production by > 1, 500 kg ha⁻¹ compared to the 0 % RA control. All rates of application of oil cake increased the pH, organic matter content, macro-nutrient concentrations, cation exchange capacity, and electrical conductivity of the soil at depths of 0 – 20 cm in 2012 and in 2013. Consequently, all applications of oil cake increased leaf N concentrations by > 1 %, and resulted in more than four water sprouts (shoots) per tree compared to the 0 % RA treatment in 2012 and in 2013. Light interception by the central region of the canopy of each tree was reduced as rates of application of oil cake increased (R² = 0. 559). All rates of application of oil cake increased mean fruit weights by > 8 g, and fruit firmness values by > 1. 4 N, compared to the 0 % RA controls. The 3 -year average fruit yield was highest (29, 110 kg ha⁻¹) in the 50 % RA treatment. Gross incomes from the 50 % RA treatment in 2012 and in 2013 were approx. 19 % higher than those from the 0 % RA controls. Together, {{these results indicate that}} 50 % RA was the optimum rate of application of oil cake to increase fruit yields, nutrient levels, and the profitability of non-astringent persimmon trees.
