5000|$|<b>Polysulfides</b> are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds containing chains of sulfur atoms. There are two main classes of polysulfides: anions and organic <b>polysulfides.</b> Anions have the general formula [...] These anions are the conjugate bases of the hydrogen <b>polysulfides</b> H2Sn. Organic <b>polysulfides</b> generally have the formulae RSnR, where R = alkyl or aryl.|$|R
50|$|<b>Polysulfides</b> are ligands in {{coordination}} chemistry. Examples {{of transition}} metal polysulfido complexes include (C5H5)2TiS5, Ni(S4)22−, and Pt(S5)32−. Main group elements also form <b>polysulfides.</b>|$|R

Natural oil polyols derived from castor oil and other vegetable oils are used to make elastomers, flexible bunstock, and flexible molded foam.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its effects}} similar to nitric oxide (without its {{potential}} to form peroxides by interacting with superoxide), hydrogen sulfide is now recognized as potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease. The cardioprotective role effect of garlic is caused by catabolism of the <b>polysulfide</b> group in allicin to , a reaction that could depend on reduction mediated by glutathione.|$|E

30|$|In {{the last}} few decades, several {{strategies}} have been tested to overcome these challenges, such as encapsulation of the active material within nanostructure, development of novel electrolytes, and binder modification [6 – 9]. The insertion of an interlayer between cathode and separator can significantly improve the capacity retention by trapping <b>polysulfides</b> [10 – 12]. However, a low adsorption capacity of carbon for <b>polysulfides</b> still restricts the cycling performance of Li/S batteries. Studies demonstrate that PPy is a proton-doped type of conductive polymer. This type of conductive polymer can adsorb <b>polysulfides</b> by H bonds. Therefore, PPy is suitable for fabrication as an interlayer to suppress the shuttling of <b>polysulfides</b> [13]. Also, the polar metal oxides can form chemical bonds with <b>polysulfides</b> to decrease the loss of active materials [14 – 16]. Yu et al. [17] have reported that ZnO coating could effectively confine <b>polysulfides</b> during cycling. However, these metal oxides reduce the utilization of sulfur due to their low electrical conductivity.|$|R
40|$|<b>Polysulfides</b> of {{the general}} form ⁻SSπS⁻ occur {{naturally}} in sulfur rich waters and can be formed by the reaction of sulfide with elemental sulfur to yield water soluble <b>polysulfides.</b> Inorganic <b>polysulfides</b> {{have been found to}} form organic polysulfanes in the environment, and in water, oxidation of <b>polysulfides</b> can produce thiosalts and sulfuric acid, resulting in acidification of aquatic environments. <b>Polysulfides</b> are unstable and readily undergo changes in speciation, analysis is challenging and complicated by lack of standards. A series of <b>polysulfides</b> were synthesized to be used as standards. They were stabilized by methylation to form dimethylpolysulfanes and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection, and matrix assisted laser desorption MS (MALDI-MS). The various dimethylpolysulfanes were fractionated using semi-preparatory HPLC; the fractions containing individual dimethylpolysulfanes were analyzed for sulfur content by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrophotometry (ICP-OES). Stability studies were also carried out to confirm that the stabilization approach was effective...|$|R
40|$|Coumarins and {{coumarin}} derivatives {{as well as}} diallyl <b>polysulfides</b> {{are well}} known as anticancer drugs. In order to find new drugs with anticancer activities, we combined coumarins with <b>polysulfides</b> {{in the form of}} di-coumarin <b>polysulfides.</b> These novel compounds were tested in the HCT 116 colorectal cancer cell line. It turned out that they reduced cell viability of cancer cells in a time and concentration dependent manner. Cells tested with these coumarin <b>polysulfides</b> accumulate in the G(2) /M phase of the cell cycle and finally they go into apoptosis. A decrease in bcl- 2 level, and increase in the level of bax, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, cleavage of caspase 3 / 7 and PARP suggested that coumarin <b>polysulfides</b> induced the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Comparison of these new coumarin compounds with the well known diallyl <b>polysulfides</b> revealed that the coumarin disulfides were more active than the corresponding diallyl disulfides. The activities of the coumarin tetrasulfides and the corresponding diallyl tetrasulfides are similar. The novel coumarin compounds regulated the phosphatase activity of the cell cycle regulating cdc 25 family members, indicating that these phosphatases are implicated in the induction of cell cycle arrest and possibly in apoptosis induction as well. In addition, coumarin <b>polysulfides</b> also down-regulated the level of cdc 25 C, which also contributed to the arrest in the G(2) -phase of the cell cycle. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either <b>polysulfide</b> or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|E
500|$|Iron {{reacts with}} {{oxygen in the}} air to form various oxide and {{hydroxide}} compounds; the most common are iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4), and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). Iron(II) oxide also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. Despite their names, they are actually all non-stoichiometric compounds whose compositions may vary. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see bloomery and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of ferrites, useful magnetic storage media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is iron pyrite (FeS2), also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster. It is not an iron(IV) compound, but is actually an iron(II) <b>polysulfide</b> containing Fe2+ and [...] ions in a distorted sodium chloride structure.|$|E

50|$|<b>Polysulfides</b> are {{compounds}} that have chains of sulfur atoms. This {{is a relatively}} new reactant, but it has been tested on the field in treating TCE and in comparison to EHC. The use of <b>Polysulfides</b> is a type of abiotic reduction and works best in anaerobic conditions where iron (III) is available. The benefit of using <b>polysulfides</b> is that they do not produce any biological waste products; however, the reaction rates are slow and they require more time to create the DVI (dual valent iron) minerals that are needed for the reduction to occur.|$|R
30|$|To better {{understand}} {{the effect of the}} mechanical and chemical characteristics among electrode components, the binding structural viewpoint of S with AHP and commercial linear binders (such as PVDF, PTFE) are expected to be different (Fig.  1 c). During the discharge process (Li insertion), owing to the formation of insulating Li 2 S on the carbon matrix, linear PVDF or PTFE are forced to mechanical stretch or moved by the expanded <b>polysulfides.</b> The volume density of Li 2 S (1.67  g/cm 3) is much lower than that of S (2.03  g/cm 3), which would cause a volume expansion of the S cathode of ∼ 22 % compared to their initial state during the whole discharge process. Upon charging (Li desertion) in the same cycle, the <b>polysulfides</b> shrink back to their original state; the linear binders, however, cannot fully follow the shrinkage of <b>polysulfides,</b> thus leading to an inevitably contact loss of electroactive materials from the carbon matrix, coupled with <b>polysulfides</b> dissolution, result in inferior performance of most sulfur-carbon composites. This issue becomes more prominent over extended cycling. On the contrary, AHP have plentiful amide side groups physically/chemically entangled to grasp <b>polysulfides,</b> leading to reinforced binding ability with <b>polysulfides</b> via hydrogen bonding [29, 30]. Thus, in this polymeric AHP binder provides multidimensional noncovalent interactions with the <b>polysulfides</b> surfaces through the amide groups. These interactions not only allow the AHP binder to accommodate the massive volume expansion of S cathodes during discharge process but also keep the polysulfides-binder interactions even during charge process.|$|R

This contrasts with conventional lithium-ion cells, where the lithium ions are intercalated in the anode and cathodes. Each sulfur atom can host two lithium ions. Typically, lithium-ion batteries accommodate only 0.5–0.7 lithium ions per host atom. Consequently, Li-S allows for a much higher lithium storage density.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the formation of the}} solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium electrodes in the presence of an ionic liquid electrolyte with a particular focus on the influence of <b>polysulfides</b> present in the electrolyte on the SEI. The electrochemical performance of symmetric cells with lithium electrodes and electrolytes composed of N-Methyl-(n-butyl) pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (PYR 14 -TFSI) and LiTFSI, with and without the addition of <b>polysulfides,</b> were analyzed as well as the chemical composition of the SEI, before and after cycling. The cycling behavior of the symmetrical cells shows that the SEI films are relatively stable in the ionic liquid electrolyte, also in the presence of <b>polysulfides.</b> However, the presence of <b>polysulfides</b> results in a higher SEI layer resistance (R-SEI) and a higher activation energy. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra (XPS), with argon-ion sputtering for depth profiling, we find that the SEI is formed by decomposition products from both cations and anions of the electrolyte. The XPS spectra show that the presence of <b>polysulfides</b> alters the decomposition process of the electrolyte, resulting in a SEI film with different chemical composition and structure, in line with the results from the electrochemical performance...|$|R
