50|$|The {{mechanism}} of seed dispersal via animal link vectors (endozoochoric dispersal) may explain how most Burseraceae {{were able to}} expand their range so efficiently across the globe. Beiselia, Boswellia, and Triomma have dry fruits better suited for wind dispersal, but most Burseraceae have fleshy, edible fruit that is eaten by many animal dispersers. The seeds may provide a high reward in fat (24-73%) and protein (2.7-25.9%) if digested, but many animals eat just the fleshy part of the fruit and either discard the endocarp right away or excrete it some time later. Some known Burseraceae fruit consumers include hornbills (Buceros bicornis, Ceratogyma atrata, C. cylindricus, Penelopides panini), oilbirds (Steatnoris caripensis), fruit pigeons, warblers, vireos, orioles, flycatchers, tanagers, woodpeckers, loeries, <b>primates</b> (Cercopithecus <b>spp.,</b> Lophocebus albigena), lemurs (Varecia variegate subsp. variegate), and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus). The fruits {{may also have been}} water dispersed.|$|R
40|$|In {{human and}} nonhuman <b>primates,</b> Shigella <b>spp.</b> cause bacillary {{dysentery}} by invading colon epithelium and promoting a strong inflammatory response; however, adult mice {{are resistant to}} oral Shigella infection. In this study, intraperitoneal challenge with virulent S. flexneri 2 a (YSH 6000) resulted in diarrhea and severe body weight loss in adult B 6 mice. Of note, virulent S. flexneri 2 a could invade and colonize not only systemic tissues but also the serosa and lamina propria region of the large intestine. In addition, epithelial shedding, barrier in-tegrity, and goblet cell hyperplasia {{were found in the}} large intestine by 24 hours post-intraperitoneal Shigella infection. Of note, predominant expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were found in the large intestine after intraperitoneal challenge. Monocytes {{played a critical role in}} attenuating diarrhea and in providing protective efficacy against intraperitoneal Shigella infection. Most importantly, mice prevaccinated with attenuated S. flexneri 2 a (SC 602) strain were protected against intraperitoneal challenge with YSH 6000. When taken together, these findings show that intraperitoneal challenge with virulent S. flexneri 2 a can provoke bacillary dysentery and severe pathogenesis in adult mice. This model may be helpful for understand-ing the induction mechanism of bacillary dysentery and for evaluating Shigella vaccine candidates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{ecology and}} predator–prey {{dynamics}} of large felids {{in the tropics}} have largely been studied in natural sys-tems where wild ungulates constitute {{the majority of the}} prey base. However, human-dominated landscapes can be rich in potential prey for large carnivores because of the high density of domestic animals, especially in tropical countries where pastoralism is an important livelihood activity. We report the almost complete dependence of leo-pards Panthera pardus on domestic animals as prey in the crop lands of Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, India. From analysis of confirmed leopard scats, % of the leo-pard’s prey biomass consisted of domestic animals, with % consisting of domestic dogs Canis lupus familiaris alone. The only wild species that occurred in the leopard’s diet were rodents, small indian civetViverricula indica, bon-net macaque Macaca radiata and other <b>primates</b> Semnopithecus <b>spp.,</b> mongoose Herpestes spp., and birds. Interviews conducted in households distributed random-ly in the study area documented a high density of domestic animals: adult cattle Bos taurus, calves, goats Capra aega-grus, dogs and cats Felis catus occurred at densities of,,, and per km, respectively. Ivlev’s electivity index indicated that dogs and cats were over-represented in the leopard’s diet, given the higher densities of goats and cattle. The standing biomass of dogs and cats alone was sufficient to sustain the high density of carnivores at the study site. Our results show that the abundance of potential domestic prey biomass present in human-use areas supports a relatively high density of predators, although this interaction could result in conflict with humans...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{and adult}} worms of the humanlymphatic filarial parasites (Wuchereria bancrofti,Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori) are located mainly inthe lymphatic system and {{occasionally}} in aberrant siteslike subcutaneous and conjunctival cysts. Lymphaticpathology ranging from dilatation of lymphatic channelsand lymphangiectasia are detected on ultrasonography inapparently healthy, amicrofilaraemic, but filarial antigenpositive individuals in endemic areas. Microfilariae aredistributed in various organs {{and may be}} associatedwith immune mediated pathology at these sites; tropicalpulmonary eosinophilia is characterized by intenseimmune mediated destruction of microfilariae in thelung parenchyma. In the spleen and other sites, nodulargranulomatous lesions can occur where microfilariaeare trapped and destroyed. The finding of Wolbachiaendosymbionts in all stages of lymphatic filarial parasiteshas provided new insight on the adverse reactionsassociated with anti-filarial chemotherapy. Inflammatorymolecules mainly lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -likemolecules released from endosymbionts on death of theparasites are {{largely responsible for the}} adverse reactionsencountered during anti-filarial chemotherapy. Prenataltolerance or sensitization to parasite derived moleculescan immune-modulate and contribute to both pathologyand susceptibility/resistance to infection. Pathologicalresponses thus depend not only on exposure tofilarial antigens/infection, but also on host-parasiteendosymbiontfactors and to intervention with antifilarialtreatment. Treatment induced or host mediateddeath of parasites are associated with various grades ofinflammatory response, in which eosinophils and LPSfrom endosymbionts play prominent roles, leadingto death of the parasite, granulomatous formation,organization and fibrosis. The non-human <b>primate</b> (Presbytis <b>spp.)</b> model ofBrugia malayi developed for the tertiary screeningof anti-filarial compounds has provided uniqueopportunities for the longitudinal study of the pathologyassociated with lymphatic filariasis. The pathology in thisnon-human primate model closely follows that seen in human lymphatic filarial infections and correlates withclinical evidence of lymphatic pathology as detectedwith ultrasonography. These studies also show thatsuccessful treatment as detected by loss of motility andcalcification of worms on ultrasonography is associatedwith reversal of early dilatations of lymphatic channels...|$|R
40|$|Nematodes of {{the genus}} Trichuris, known as whipworms, are {{recognized}} to infect numerous mammalian species including humans and non-human <b>primates.</b> Several Trichuris <b>spp.</b> have been described and species designation/identification is traditionally based on host-affiliation, although cross-infection and hybridization events may complicate species boundaries. The main aims {{of the present study}} were to genetically characterize adult Trichuris specimens from captive Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) and grivets (Chlorocebus aethiops), using the ribosomal DNA (ITS) as molecular marker and to investigate the phylogeny and the extent of genetic variation also by comparison with data on isolates from other humans, non-human primates and other hosts. The phylogenetic analysis of Trichuris sequences from M. fuscata and C. aethiops provided evidences of distinct clades and subclades thus advocating the existence of additional separated taxa. Neighbor Joining and Bayesian trees suggest that specimens from M. fuscata may be distinct from, but related to Trichuris trichiura, while a close relationship is suggested between the subclade formed by the specimens from C. aethiops and the subclade formed by T. suis. The tendency to associate Trichuris sp. to host species can lead to misleading taxonomic interpretations (i. e. whipworms found in primates are identified as T. trichiura). The results here obtained confirm previous evidences suggesting the existence of Trichuris spp. other than T. trichiura infecting non-human living primates...|$|R
40|$|Introduction A sero-epidemiological {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} {{to detect the}} circulation of arboviruses in free-living non-human primates. Methods Blood samples were obtained from 16 non-human <b>primates</b> (13 Sapajus <b>spp.</b> and three Alouatta caraya) that were captured using terrestrial traps and anesthetic darts in woodland regions in the municipalities of Campo Grande, Aquidauana, Jardim, Miranda and Corumb&# 225; in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The samples {{were sent to the}} Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC) in Ananindeua, Par&# 225;, Brazil, to detect antibodies against 19 species of arboviruses using a hemagglutination inhibition test (HI). Results Of the 16 primates investigated in the present study, five (31. 2 %) were serologically positive for an arbovirus. Of these five, two (12. 5 %) exhibited antibodies to the Flavivirus genus, one (6. 2 %) exhibited a monotypic reaction to Cacipacor&# 233; virus, one (6. 2 %) was associated with Mayaro virus, and one (6. 2 %) was positive for Oropouche virus. Conclusions Based on the positive serology observed in the present study, it was possible to conclude that arboviruses circulate among free-living primates. The viruses in the areas studied might have been introduced by infected humans or by primates from endemic or enzootic areas. Studies of this nature, as well as efficient and continuous surveillance programs, are needed to monitor viral activities in endemic and enzootic regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{spinal cord}} is {{involved}} in local, ascending and descending neural pathways. Few studies analyzed the distribution of neuromediators in the laminae of non-human primates along all segments. The present study described the classic neuromediators in the spinal cord of the non-human <b>primate</b> Sapajus <b>spp.</b> through histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) method showed neuronal somata in the intermediolateral column (IML), central cervical nucleus (CCN), laminae I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and X, besides dense presence of nerve fibers in laminae II and IX. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity {{was evident in the}} neuronal somata in laminae V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, CCN, IML and in the Clarke’s column (CC). Immunohistochemistry data revealed neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) immunoreactivity  in neuronal somata and in fibers of laminae I, II, III, VII, VIII, X and IML; choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in neuronal somata and in fibers of laminae VII, VIII and IX; calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was noticed in neuronal somata of lamina IX and in nerve fibers of laminae I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VII; substance P (SP) in nerve fibers of laminae I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, CCN, CC and IML; serotonin (5 -HT) and vesicular glutamate transporter- 1 (VGLUT 1) was noticed in nerve fibers of all laminae;  somatostatin (SOM) in neuronal somata of laminae III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX and nerve fibers in laminae I, II, V, VI, VII, X and IML; calbindin (Cb) in neuronal somata of laminae I, II, VI, VII, IX and X; parvalbumin (PV) was found in neuronal somata and in nerve fibers of laminae III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and CC; finally, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) was present in neuronal somata of laminae V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X. This study revealed interesting results concerning the chemoarchitecture of the Sapajus spp. spinal cord with a distribution pattern mostly similar to other mammals. The data corroborate the result described in literature, except for some differences in CGRP, SP, Cb, PV and GABA immunoreactivities present in neuronal somata and in nerve fibers. This could suggest certain specificity for the neurochemistry distribution in this non-human primate species, besides adding relevant data to support further studies related to processes involving spinal cord components. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the Brazilian Amazon region, malaria {{caused by}} Plasmodium malariae is {{considered}} to be a zoonosis because of cross-transfer of the parasite between humans and Neotropical primates. To contribute information on this issue, we investigated occurrences of natural infection with Plasmodium sp. among Neotropical primates in the Maranhense Amazon (Amazon region of the state of Maranhão), in the northeastern region of Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 161 Neotropical primates of six species that were caught in an environmental reserve (Sítio Aguahy) and from captive primates (CETAS-Wildlife Screening Center, municipality of São Luís), in Maranhão. Plasmodium sp. was diagnosed based on light microscopy, PCR, qPCR and LAMP for amplification of the 18 S rRNA gene. Serum samples were also assayed by means of indirect immunofluorescence for IgG antibodies against P. malariae/P. brasilianum, P. falciparum and P. berghei. Parasites were detected through light microscopy on five slides from captive <b>primates</b> (four Sapajus <b>spp.</b> and one Callithrix jacchus). In the molecular tests, 34. 16 % (55 / 161) and 29. 81 % (48 / 161) of the animals sampled were positive in the qPCR and PCR assays, respectively. In the PCR, 47 / 48 animals were positive for P. malariae/P. brasilianum; of these, eight were free-living primates and 39 from CETAS, São Luís. One sample showed a band in the genus-specific reaction, but not in the second PCR reaction. Anti-P. malariae/P. brasilianum IgG antibodies were detected in four serum samples from Sapajus spp. in captivity. In this study, circulation of P. malariae/P. brasilianum in Neotropical primates was confirmed, with low levels of parasitemia and low levels of antibodies. The importance of these animals as reservoirs of human malaria in the region studied is still unknown. This scenario has an impact on control and elimination of malaria in this region...|$|R
40|$|A infecção por Toxoplasma gondii é um problema para a manutenção de primatas não humanos em cativeiro, sendo as espécies do Novo Mundo altamente suscetíveis à doença. O objetivo deste trabalho é relatar um caso de toxoplasmose aguda em um macaco-barrigudo (Lagothrix lagotricha) adulto, proveniente de vida livre, que morreu e foi encaminhado para necropsia. Os principais achados anatomopatológicos estavam no pulmão, baço, fígado e linfonodos, com a visualização de estruturas compatíveis com T. gondii no exame citológico, histopatológico e na imunomarcação positiva com anticorpo policlonal anti-T. gondii – achados esses que condizem com os casos encontrados na literatura. Como os primatas neotropicais normalmente desenvolvem infecção aguda e fatal, ressalta-se a importância do manejo {{preventivo}} e suas possíveis vias de transmissão em cativeiroThe protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{is one of}} {{the most}} common parasitic infections of man and other warm-blooded animals. Toxoplasma gondii is a coccidian obligate intracellular parasite, with a sexual cycle (enteroepithelial cycle) in the definitive host (domestic cats and other member of the Felidae family) and an asexual cycle (extraintestinal cycle) in intermediate hosts (man, many mammals and birds). There are three infections stages of T. gondii for all animals: tachyzoites (individually and in groups), bradyzoites (in tissue cysts), and sporozoites (in oocysts). This protozoan represents a problem for the maintenance of non-human primates in captivity, especially the New World primates that are highly susceptible to this infection. The objective of the present study is to report an acute toxoplasmosis case in an adult free-living woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagotricha) that was sent by IBAMA from Roraima State to Criadouro Conservacionista Toca da Raposa in São Paulo State. This monkey was lethargic, anorexic, and it died two days later. This dead animal was sent to the Animal Pathology Laboratory at University of São Paulo for post-mortem examination. Necropsy revealed cachexia, pale mucous membrane, heterogeneous red-colored and consolidated lungs, severe splenomegaly, mild hepatomegaly and enlarged and red-colored lymph nodes, mainly mesenteric. The cytology exam by imprint of the lungs, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes showed compatible T. gondii tachyzoites free or in macrophages (individually or in small groups). Sections of all tissues were collected, fixed in 10 % buffered neutral formalin for 48 hours, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 µm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and submitted to a light microscopy examination. Histopathologically, exams revealed nonsuppurative, acute, diffuse, severe pneumonia; nonsuppurative, multifocal, mild myocarditis; nonsuppurative, moderate hepatitis with severe, multifocal necrosis; interstitial, nonsuppurative, multifocal, moderate nephritis. The spleen presented lymphoid depletion and moderate necrosis with haemorrhage and histiocitic splenitis. In the lymph nodes, which were mainly mesenteric, multifocal to coalescing severe necrosis with haemorrhage was observed, as well as moderate diffuse histiocitic lymphadenitis. Intralesion, individual or in small groups, T. gondii tachyzoites were visualized free or within macrophages in the lungs, liver, spleen and lymph nodes. Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were sent to the Immunohystochemistry Laboratory at Adolfo Lutz Institute. Immunohystochemistry (IHC) was performed with the streptavidin-biotin peroxidase technique and the use of polyclonal antibodies against T. gondii. IHC showed a specific antigen-antibody reaction which was very intense in the lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, moderate in the kidneys, and mild in the central nervous system, heart, and adrenal glands. These findings were in accordance with the lesions reported in literature. Toxoplasmosis is considered to be a fatal parasitic disease in some animals, such as New World primates. This disease {{is one of the}} main diseases in New World primates, and there are many outbreaks in zoos and private breeders in Brazil and in other countries. According to literature, free-living New World <b>primates</b> (Cebus <b>spp</b> and Alouatta spp) have had antibodies against T. gondii. They are much more susceptible than Old World primates, rarely surviving the disease. The reasons for such high susceptibility are not clear; however, data suggested that, due to their arboreal habits, these primates were isolated, during their evolution, from both felids and T. gondii oocysts; as a result, they failed to develop a resistance to toxoplasmosis. Moreover, data suggest that vertebrates of this type do not develop an effective cellular immune response to T. gondii. Normally, New World primates die without premonitory signs having been observed, indicating the acute nature of the disease. If the clinical signs are present, they are not specific, such as lethargy, malaise, anorexia, and the animals die in few days In previous reports and in the present study, the gross and microscopic lesions were similar. These lesions were characterized by necrosis in the lungs, liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and absent or variable lesions in the gastroenteric system. The presence of the tachyzoites or cysts of bradyzoites was detected in the histology, mainly in the lesion or associated with inflammatory cell infiltration. Toxoplasma gondii may be transmitted by the consumption of infected meat, by the oral-faecal route, or congenitally. Experimental studies indicated the possibility of aerosol transmission of T. gondii to squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) 6. In many cases described in literature, the route of T. gondii transmission to New World primates was not identified. It was then assumed that transmission had occurred by ingestion of infected raw meat or food or drink contaminated with sporulated oocysts. As New World primates usually develop acute and fatal infection, this fact militates against the use of therapeutic measures, and it is important to emphasize the need for rigorous prophylactic procedures to prevent the occurrence of these parasites in captive coloniesLa infección por Toxoplasma gondii representa un problema en el mantenimiento en cautiverio de los primatas no humanos, siendo que las especies del nuevo mundo son muy susceptibles a la enfermedad.
