5|$|Mithyātva (Irrationality and a deluded {{world view}}) – The deluded world view is the {{misunderstanding}} {{as to how}} this world really functions on account of one-sided perspectives, perverse viewpoints, <b>pointless</b> generalisations and ignorance.|$|E
5|$|In 1971–72, {{he wrote}} four books, most notably, Genes, Dreams and Realities, which caused great {{controversy}} {{due to its}} strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable {{and that it was}} <b>pointless</b> to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.|$|E
5|$|In February 2005, Hansen {{made his}} debut with the Danish men's team, {{competing}} in qualification {{play for the}} 2006 Winter Olympics. He notched an assist over three games as Denmark finished third in their group, failing {{to qualify for the}} Olympics. He returned to the men's team for the 2005 World Championships, going <b>pointless</b> in four games. Denmark finished in 14th place out of 16 teams.|$|E
5|$|Näslund {{made his}} first {{international}} appearance for Sweden at the 1989 Four Nations Tournament in the Soviet Union. The following year, he competed in the 1990 European Junior Championships, an under-18 tournament. He went <b>pointless</b> in six games, but helped Sweden to a gold medal finish. He improved the following year with a tournament-leading 14goals. His 16points ranked second overall to teammate Peter Forsberg. Sweden failed to defend their gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life <b>pointless.</b> For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
5|$|After going <b>pointless</b> in {{nine games}} early the {{following}} season, the Stars waived Malhotra on November 19, 2003. Two days later, {{he was picked}} up by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Malhotra improved with the Blue Jackets, notching 12 goals and 25 points over 56 games following the trade. He missed the final six games of the regular season with a bruised ankle. His ice time rose from an average of nine minutes a game with Dallas the previous season to 14 minutes in Columbus.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly <b>pointless.</b> All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) is sick of Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) <b>pointless</b> text messages. After one text, Darryl tells Andy {{that he is}} one bad text {{away from}} being blocked, but Andy wagers that he is one good text from a high five, to which Darryl agrees. Darryl then gets a text from Andy telling {{him to come to}} the parking lot, where there are pigeons eating an ice cream cone. Darryl laughs and gives Andy a high five.|$|E
5|$|Glenn (Steven Yeun), at {{the urging}} of Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn), finally tells the group that the Greene family's barn is full of walkers. The group {{inspects}} the barn, and Shane (Jon Bernthal) believes they should clear the barn, but Rick (Andrew Lincoln) believes they need to get Hershel (Scott Wilson)'s blessing since they are still guests on his property. Shane criticizes Rick for continuing the seemingly <b>pointless</b> search for Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, infuriating Daryl (Norman Reedus).|$|E
5|$|Hansen {{made his}} {{international}} debut with Denmark in Division I {{play of the}} 2002 IIHF World U18 Championships, held in Slovenia. At 16 years old, he was the second-youngest player on the under-18 team; he went <b>pointless</b> in four games. Denmark narrowly avoided relegation to Division II, beating out Japan on goal-differential by one. At the 2003 IIHF World U18 Championships, Denmark finished first in their Division I group, earning a promotion to the main tournament for the following year. In Hansen's second tournament appearance, he tied for sixth in Group A scoring with seven points over five games.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full season with the Kings, Miller played in 74 games for the team, scoring five goals and adding 12 assists during the 2001–02 season. At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, Miller was named the winner of several Kings team awards: best defenseman, best defensive player and the teams unsung hero. During the playoffs, he went <b>pointless</b> while playing in all seven of the Kings' games. Abdominal surgery and a broken foot limited Miller to 49 games with the Kings the next season, recording one goal and five assists for six points.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly <b>pointless.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 21 December 2005, Ehrhoff {{was named}} to the German Olympic team, along with Sharks {{teammate}} Marcel Goc, for the 2006 Winter Games in Turin. His lone goal of the tournament came against Canada, a 5–1 loss. He added an assist in the tournament for two points in five games as Germany failed to win a preliminary game, missing out on the playoff rounds. Four years later, he {{was named to}} Germany's Olympic team for the 2010 Winter Games in his NHL hometown of Vancouver. He went <b>pointless</b> in four games, while leading his team in ice time. Germany was eliminated by Canada in an 8–2 qualifier for the quarterfinal.|$|E
5|$|Shirokov first {{played in}} the Russian Hockey First League (RUS-3) with HC CSKA Moscow's second-tier team in 2001. He spent several seasons at that level and debuted with CSKA's senior team in the Russian Superleague in 2004–05, going <b>pointless</b> in eight games. The {{following}} season, he recorded 14 points playing 39 games in the Superleague. Shirokov was then selected 163rd overall in the sixth round of the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Vancouver Canucks. The sixth round draft pick was acquired by the Canucks in a trade with the Florida Panthers.|$|E
5|$|Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of {{chromosome}} number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced gametes. While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be <b>pointless,</b> it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. Triploid bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.|$|E
5|$|The DS {{version of}} the game, which was {{significantly}} different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish. GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief. 1UP found that even though The Simpsons Game parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a <b>pointless</b> endeavor.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} ratings {{near the}} season average, and garnered generally positive reviews from critics. Brown's performance was praised, {{as well as}} the twist in his character's storyline. Also applauded were both Sam's confrontation with Dean over his recent reckless behavior and the resulting reconciliation at the episode's end. Many critics found the presence of character Bela Talbot (Lauren Cohan) in the episode to be <b>pointless,</b> while the critic for TV Guide enjoyed McNab's cameo and wished it had been longer.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Hansen {{was plagued}} by injuries, initially suffering a broken thumb in the pre-season with the Canucks. After recovering, {{he was assigned to}} the Moose in early-October, but was re-called by the Canucks within a month. In January 2008, Hansen was re-injured, suffering a concussion. Later in the campaign, he earned his second call-up of the season in April. Finishing the season with the Moose, he finished with 43 points in 50 games for the third-highest point-per-game average on the club, as well as a team-high plus-minus rating of +23. In NHL play, he was <b>pointless</b> in five games.|$|E
5|$|The rampant and {{unsustainable}} hunting was {{not just}} financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was <b>pointless</b> and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{he acted}} {{on the ground}} of his enemy's choosing, not of his own, and {{on the basis of}} meager {{information}} and almost no understanding of the ground, he broke all the military tactical rules of his own devising. He had thrown his infantry into the teeth of gun fire; he compounded this folly by committing his cavalry piecemeal in <b>pointless</b> charges across soft, spongy ground that was divided by streams, requiring them to attack in long, drawn out lines, rather than en masse; of course, he could not send his cavalry en masse because several natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—made this impossible on some of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|Through his career, Weber has {{represented}} Canada at several international ice hockey tournaments. Weber's {{first experience with}} Hockey Canada came for the national junior team, when, on December 22, 2004, he {{was named to the}} roster for the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Grand Forks, North Dakota. There his play with Dion Phaneuf formed the team's top defensive pair, helping Canada win its first junior gold medal since the 1997 tournament. Despite being held <b>pointless</b> throughout the tournament, Weber finished tied for third among plus-minus leaders with a rating of +10.|$|E
5|$|While {{training}} as a teacher, O'Reilly joined the Sydney University Regiment, {{a unit of the}} Militia Forces (Army Reserve). He did not enjoy his time in the military, and along with most of his peers, regarded the commanding officer as inept. O'Reilly was a non-conformist who did not enjoy taking orders, and was unimpressed with the firearm drills, because the recruits were armed only with wooden sticks. However, he signed up for a second year to raise money for his education. Fed up with military routines he considered to be <b>pointless,</b> O'Reilly volunteered to be a kitchen hand.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Vashyron and his comrades learn the full tale from Juris, Rowen {{is in the}} midst of a crisis of faith due to his control over the Zenith System through his ring. During the party's {{confrontation}} with Sullivan where he threatens to destroy Leanne's quartz, Rowen shoots Sullivan to try and prove the existence of a higher power through Leanne's survival. The three then confront Rowen directly and fatally wound him, but Rowen's control of the Zenith System preserves his life. Vashyron calls Zephyr and Leanne off, seeing further fighting is <b>pointless.</b> During the game's credits, Rowen uses his power to resurrect the Cardinals, then leaves the control ring on Frieda's grave, and Sullivan is seen reuniting with Rebecca. In a post-credit scene, Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron explore the now-clean world beyond Basel, and Leanne's quartz is revealed to have been safely embedded in her hand.|$|E
5|$|Havock began escorting supply convoys in June to Tobruk, Libya {{until the}} ship was damaged in October. She was {{repaired}} in time to escort a convoy to Malta during the First Battle of Sirte in December and was badly damaged by the Italian battleship Littorio whilst protecting another convoy during the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942. Repairs were attempted in Malta, but {{the ship was}} further damaged in an air raid in early April. The Admiralty decided that further attempts to repair her at Malta were <b>pointless</b> and ordered her to Gibraltar for permanent repairs. On 6 April, while on passage to Gibraltar, Havock ran aground near Cape Bon, Tunisia, and her crew was interned by the Vichy French at Laghouat in the Sahara.|$|E
5|$|In 1694, two Franciscan friars set {{out from}} Guatemala {{to see if they}} could succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor López left Cobán in August 1693 to seek out the hostile Lakandon Ch'ols in the depths of the rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the Manche Ch'ol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. Disappointed by their failure, in April 1694 the friars wrote a letter to the {{president}} of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating their belief that any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch'ol peoples were <b>pointless,</b> and that the time had come for military action.|$|E
5|$|In February 1799, Adams {{surprised}} many {{by sending}} diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. Napoleon, {{realizing that the}} conflict was <b>pointless,</b> signaled his readiness for friendly relations. At the Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and {{to allow for the}} peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States was then free of foreign entanglements, as Washington had advised in his farewell address. Adams brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army. Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season with the Black Hawks, 1934–35, Morenz played in all 48 games for the team, scoring 8 goals and 34 points, an {{improvement}} over the previous season. The Black Hawks reached the playoffs, though Morenz was held <b>pointless</b> in the two games played. The following season was not as good for Morenz. He did not feel comfortable in Chicago, and was being benched, playing fewer minutes than he was used to. After 23 games with the Black Hawks, in which he scored 15 points, Morenz was traded {{for the second time}} in his career; he was sent to the New York Rangers on January 26, 1936, for forward Glen Brydson. Playing 19 games for the Rangers, Morenz scored 2 goals and had another 4 assists for 6 points, giving him 21 points over the season.|$|E
5|$|Näslund {{made his}} senior {{international}} debut {{later that year}} at the 1993 World Championships in Munich and Dortmund, Germany, where he earned another silver medal with Sweden. He contributed a goal and an assist over eight games. Three years later, he was added to Sweden's roster for the 1996 World Championships in Vienna, Austria, after the Canucks were eliminated in the NHL playoffs. He was <b>pointless</b> while competing in one game, as Sweden failed to medal. Several months later, Näslund competed in the inaugural 1996 World Cup, but was again limited to one game. Sweden reached the semifinal, where they were eliminated by Canada. Competing in his third World Championships in 1999, Näslund helped Sweden to a bronze medal with a 10-point effort in 10games.|$|E
5|$|On September 14, 2011, Tavares {{signed a}} six-year, $33 million {{extension}} with the Islanders. He {{is scheduled to}} become an unrestricted free agent in July 2018. After being held <b>pointless</b> {{in the first two}} games of the 2011–12 season, Tavares had back-to-back four-point games against the Tampa Bay Lightning and New York Rangers. From December 29, 2011, to January 21, 2012, Tavares had 21 points in a 12-game point streak, seven of which were multi-point games. He was selected to play in the 2012 NHL All-Star Game. In his first career All-Star Game, he recorded one goal and one assist. Additionally, during the 2011–12 season, Tavares was named as an alternate captain for New York.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was <b>pointless,</b> while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{endured a}} {{disastrous}} {{start to the}} season, suffering two shutout losses in their first three games. The second, a 3–0 loss to the Florida Panthers, ended with Flames fans loudly booing the team as it left the ice. Three more players were lost to injury, Raitis Ivanans and Rene Bourque (head injuries) and Adam Pardy (shoulder), while the team's top scoring line of Jarome Iginla, Olli Jokinen and Alex Tanguay was held <b>pointless.</b> The team's early struggles resulted in a lengthy meeting between the players and coaches about the team's need to compete harder. The team responded to the meeting with a stronger effort in a 5–3 victory over the Oilers in which Iginla and Tanguay scored their first goals of the season alongside Matt Stajan, who took Jokinen's spot on the top line.|$|E
5|$|When the Christian Alfonso VI of Castile retook the Kingdom of Toledo {{from the}} Moors in 1085, an Arabic {{translation}} of Aristotle's works, with commentaries by Avicenna and Averroes emerged into European medieval scholarship. Michael Scot translated much of Aristotle's biology into Latin, c. 1225, {{along with many}} of Averroes's commentaries. Albert of Cologne commented extensively on Aristotle, but added his own zoological observations and an encyclopedia of animals based on Thomas of Cantimpré. Later in the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas merged Aristotle's metaphysics with Christian theology. Whereas Albert had treated Aristotle's biology as science, writing that experiment was the only safe guide and joining in with the types of observation that Aristotle had made, Aquinas saw Aristotle purely as theory, and Aristotelian thought became associated with <b>pointless</b> scholasticism. The scholastic natural philosophy curriculum omitted most of Aristotle's biology, but included On the Soul.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing a}} three-year contract, worth $850,000 per {{year with the}} Canucks on May 4, 2006, Bourdon earned {{a spot on the}} team's 2006–07 opening roster. He played his first NHL game on October 10, 2006 against the Minnesota Wild, but after playing nine games and scoring no points, he was sent again to the QMJHL for further development. On January 8, 2007, Bourdon was again traded in the QMJHL, with Moncton sending him to the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles in {{exchange}} for Mark Barberio and a first round selection in the 2007 QMJHL draft. As a Screaming Eagle, Bourdon lost in the QMJHL semi-final against his former team, Val-d'Or. He finished the 2006–07 QMJHL season with 20 points in 36 games. When the Canucks did not qualify for the playoffs, they sent Bourdon to play five games for the Manitoba Moose, who {{were in the middle of}} the AHL playoffs. He was held <b>pointless</b> through five AHL playoff games. Including his participation in the 2007 World Junior Championships, Bourdon played for five different teams throughout the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|At 13:00, {{two ships}} {{emerged from the}} gloom {{to the east and}} Lacrosse turned away rather than risk his {{passengers}} in a <b>pointless</b> engagement. The ships persisted and were soon revealed to be the frigates Indefatigable under Captain Sir Edward Pellew, and Amazon under Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds, which had taken on supplies at Falmouth and then returned to their station off Brest. As Droits de l'Homme steered southwest, the winds increased once more and the sea became choppy, preventing Lacrosse from opening the gunports on his lower deck without severe risk of flooding and snapping his topmasts, which reduced his ship's stability. Realising his opponent's difficulties, Pellew closed with the larger ship and began a heavy fire. At 18:45, Amazon came within range and the frigates combined to repeatedly rake the French ship. The combat continued throughout the night, punctuated by short breaks in which the more mobile British ships repaired their battle damage out of range of Lacrosse's guns.|$|E
5|$|Becoming a {{restricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season, Morrison was given a one-year qualifying offer with a reported value of approximately US$500,000. With the Devils unwilling to increase their offer, he left in September 1999 for Třebíč, Czech Republic, where fellow Devils restricted free agent Patrik Eliáš was also holding out. While overseas, Morrison and Eliáš played for Czech teams SK Horácká Slavia Třebíč and HC Pardubice {{as they waited for}} contract negotiations to resume. Morrison was <b>pointless</b> in two games with Třebíč and recorded seven points in five games with Pardubice. On October 24, 1999, Morrison and Eliáš agreed to new contracts with the Devils. After recording 26 points over 44 games with the Devils, Morrison was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on March 14, 2000, alongside centre Denis Pederson, in exchange for winger Alexander Mogilny. Both Morrison and Pederson were struggling offensively and were unhappy with their roles on the team.|$|E
5|$|By 9 July, {{his ground}} forces had made {{significant}} gains in cutting off a vital road that connected Kaunas to Daugavpils. Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders {{to attack the}} rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance. At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most {{probably not going to}} easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be <b>pointless.</b> He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia {{by the time of the}} offensive. He attempted to convince them otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of Šiauliai to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July.|$|E
