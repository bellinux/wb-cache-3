40|$|Transformation {{kinetics}} {{studies were}} started on Ag - Zr alloys. Tensile properties of Th alloys with additions of 2 and 4 % Ti and varving C content were determined. The production of U - Al alloys {{by reduction of}} UO/sub 2 /F/sub 2 / in a cryolite slag was demonstrated. Dynamic corrosion experiments including impact tests on commercial-purity titanium samples exposed to oxygen-preseurized UO/sub 2 /SO/sub 4 / periods in excess of 500 hr indicated that no change in impact behavior occurred. Similar tests on Zircaloy 2 gave like results. Corrosion tests on stress relieved stainless steel weld specimens indicated a generally superior corrosion resistance of welds that had been heated to 1000 deg F for 6 hr compared with as-welded specimens. Data on behavior of materials stuitable for bearings and hard facings in molten fluorides are given. Materials tested in contact with liquid lead include alloys such as 25 % Mo- 75 % Ni. 2 % Si 14 % Cr- 84 % Fe, Hastelloy B, Ti, Co, Be, and 13 % Cr- 87 % Fe. Studies are in progress on the mass transfer characteritics of various structural metals in contact with fused hydroxides. Evaluation of materials for brazing alloys was continued on the Ni-P eutectic along with studies on other brazing alloys such as Ni-Ge, and Ni-Cr. Data on the stress rupture of sheet Inconel specimens in molten fluoride salts and argon at 1300 to 1600 deg are presented. A program was initiated to develop and produce stainless steel steel and control-rod components for long-time service in 10 -Mw <b>package</b> <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> plants.

50|$|Chain {{reactions}} naturally {{give rise}} to reaction rates that grow (or shrink) exponentially, whereas a nuclear <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> {{needs to be able}} to hold the reaction rate reasonably constant. To maintain this control, the chain reaction criticality must have a slow enough time-scale to permit intervention by additional effects (e.g., mechanical control rods or thermal expansion). Consequently, all nuclear <b>power</b> <b>reactors</b> (even fast-neutron reactors) rely on delayed neutrons for their criticality. An operating nuclear <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> fluctuates between being slightly subcritical and slightly delayed-supercritical, but must always remain below prompt-critical.|$|R
