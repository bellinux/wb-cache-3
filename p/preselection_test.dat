40|$|The {{ability of}} the United States Air Force (USAF) to sustain {{a high level of}} {{operational}} ability and readiness is dependent on the proficiency and expertise of its pilots. Recruitment, education, training, and retention of its pilot force are crucial factors in the USAF 2 ̆ 7 s attainment of its operational mission: defense of this nation and its allies. Failure of a student pilot during a training program does not only represent a loss of costly training expenditures to the American public, but often consists of loss of human life, aircraft, and property. This research focused on the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps 2 ̆ 7 (AFROTC) selection method for student pilots for the light aircraft training (LATR) program. The LATR program is an intense 16 day flight training program that precedes the Air Force 2 ̆ 7 s undergraduate pilot training (UPT) program. The study subjects were 265 AFROTC cadets in the LATR program. A variety of independent variables from each subject 2 ̆ 7 s higher education curricular background as well as results of <b>preselection</b> <b>tests,</b> participation in varsity athletics, prior flying experience and gender were evaluated against subsequent performance in LATR. Performance was measured by a quantitative performance score developed by this researcher based on 28 graded training factors as well as overall pass or fail of the LATR program. Study results showed participation in university varsity athletics was very significantly and positively related to performance in the LATR program, followed by prior flying experience and to a very slight degree portions of the Air Force Officers Qualifying Test. Not significantly related to success in the LATR program were independent variables such as grade point average, scholastic aptitude test scores, academic major, gender and the AFROTC selection and ranking system...|$|R
40|$|Using x-ray {{refraction}} analysis it {{has become}} possible to indicate with high accuracy a dimension for individual fiber adhesion in composites. It was shown that the dependency of refraction values on the fiber volume content of the CFRP samples is given by specific characteristics which unambiguously characterize the process parameters. By analyzing such characteristics {{it was possible to}} achieve an optimization of the production process of CFRP tapes. For example, it was possible to quantitatively determine that the roller pressure and the number of rolling passes are important parameters which considerably influence the quality of fiber impregnation. Similarly, increasing the rolling temperature of the TU test facility led to a 50 % improvement of fiber impregnation in the composite. Soft x-ray radiometry of thermoplastic UD CFRP sections permits a quick assessment of heterogeneous structures such as fiber-matrix demixing and fiber-misorientations. Radiographic <b>preselection</b> of <b>test</b> products reduces the effort and increases the accuracy of mechanical testing. X-ray topometry is capable of unambiguously discriminating ambiguous contrast structures for analytical purposes. (orig.)

40|$|In the Petrol Station Replenishment Problem with Time Windows (PSRPTW) {{the aim is}} to {{optimize}} the delivery of several petroleum products to a set of petrol stations using a limited heterogeneous fleet of tank-trucks. More specifically, one must determine the quantity of each product to deliver, the assignment of products to truck compartments, delivery routes, and schedules. The objective is to maximize the total profit equal to the sales revenue, minus the sum of routing costs and of regular and overtime costs. This article first proposes a mathematical formulation of the PSRPTW. It then describes two heuristics based on arc preselection and on route <b>preselection.</b> Extensive computational <b>tests</b> confirm the efficiency of the proposed heuristics.

40|$|The {{following}} material {{presents the}} results of two temporally remote administrations of an identical projective personality assessment device (Rorschach Inkblot) using crew members aboard the 90 -day test. The first administration took place during <b>preselection</b> crew psychodiagnostic <b>testing</b> in the period extending from mid-December 1969 through mid-January 1970. Second administration took place in late May and early June, 1971, approximately one year after termination of the test. During the 90 -day program duration, the subjects participated in the crew training program, were selected and served as onboard crew during the 90 -day test. The testing was undertaken {{in order to determine the}} character and extent of change (if any) in basic personality dynamics accompanying or caused by participation in the 90 -day test program. Results indicate that significant personality changes occurred in three of the four onboard crew members. A detailed discussion of the results is provided. Objective scores which served as the basis for the discussion are presented in the Appendix...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} concern that most current published research findings are false. The {{probability that a}} research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding {{is less likely to}} be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser <b>preselection</b> of <b>tested</b> relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research. Published research findings are sometimes refuted by subsequent evidence, with ensuing confusion and disappointment. Refutation and controversy is seen across the range of research designs, from clinical trials and traditional epidemiological studies [1 – 3] to the most modern molecular research [4, 5]. There {{is increasing}} concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims [6 – 8]. However, this should not be surprising. It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false.

40|$|The fragile X {{syndrome}} is characterised by mental retardation with other {{features such as}} a long face with large, protruding ears, macro-orchidism, and eye gaze avoidance. This X linked disorder is caused by an expanded CGG repeat in the first exon of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR 1) gene which is associated with shut down of transcription and absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Molecular testing is used for detection of patients and carriers of the fragile X syndrome.  In a screening programme for the fragile X syndrome in the south west of The Netherlands, 896  males and 685  females with an unknown cause for their mental retardation were scored on seven fragile X features. All were tested by DNA analysis and 11  new cases were diagnosed. The seven item checklist allowed exclusion from further testing in 86 % of the retarded males (95 % CI 0. 83 - 0. 88) without missing either any of the newly diagnosed cases or, in retrospect, any of the 50  previously diagnosed cases known to our department.  These results showed that clinical <b>preselection</b> for DNA <b>testing</b> in mentally retarded males is feasible using a simple scoring list, which will increase the efficiency of further testing eightfold.    Keywords: fragile X syndrome; screening; checklist; preselectio...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} study, {{principal}} component (PC) {{analysis was used}} {{to reduce the number of}} predictors in the estimation of direct genomic breeding values (DGV) for meat traits in a sample of 479 Italian Simmental bulls. Single nucleotide polymorphism marker genotypes were determined with the 54 K Illumina beadchip. After edits, 457 bulls and 40, 179 SNP were retained. Principal component extraction was performed separately for each chromosome and 2466 new variables able to explain 70 % of total variance were obtained. Bulls were divided into reference and validation population. Three scenarios of the ratio reference:validation were tested: 70 : 30, 80 : 20, 90 : 10. Effect of PC scores on polygenic EBV was estimated in the reference population using different models and methods. Traits analyzed were 7 beef traits: daily BW gain, size score, muscularity score, feet and legs score, beef index (economic index), calving ease direct effect, and cow muscularity. Accuracy was calculated as correlation between DGV and polygenic EBV in the validation bulls. Muscularity, feet and legs, and the beef index showed the greatest accuracies; calving ease, the least. In general, accuracies were slightly greater when reference animals were selected at random and the best scenario was 90 : 10 and no substantial differences in accuracy were found among different methods. Principal component analysis is entirely based on the factorization of the SNP (co) variance matrix and produced a reduced set of variables (6 % of the original variables) which may be used for different phenotypic traits. In spite of this huge reduction in the number of independent variables, DGV accuracies resulted similar to those obtained by using the whole set of SNP markers. Accuracies of direct genomic values found in the present work were always greater than those of traditional parental average (PA). Thus, results of the present study may suggest a possible advantage of use of genomic indexes in the <b>preselection</b> of performance <b>test</b> candidates for beef traits. Moreover, the relevant reduction of variable space might allow genomic selection implementation also in small populations...|$|R
