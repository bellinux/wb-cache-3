40|$|The {{interaction}} of tumor cells with laminin {{is thought to}} be critical in invasion and metastasis. We found that an endogenous lectin, carbohydrate-binding protein 35 (CBP- 35), is the major laminin-binding protein on human colon carcinoma cells and that its surface expression suggests involvement in metastasis. We identified CBP- 35 by laminin-affinity chromatography and immunoblotting. Surface expression of CBP- 35 on eight human colon carcinoma cell lines was compared by flow cytometry. <b>Poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines and DLD- 2, a signet-ring carcinoma cell line, expressed more surface CBP- 35 than well-differentiated cell lines. <b>Poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines and DLD- 2 are characterized as aggressive cell lines because they adhere to and invade through reconstituted basement membrane significantly better than well-differentiated cell lines. These data suggest that CBP- 35 is involved in tumor cell-basement membrane interactions and that an increase in CBP- 35 surface expression may facilitate metastatic potential of colon carcinoma cells...|$|E

For this purpose, established cell lines were classified on the basis of several criteria that relate to degree of differentiation. These criteria include histology of the original tumor, histology of xenografts, in vitro morphology, and carcinoembryonic antigen expression. On this basis, the cell lines used were either moderately well or poorly differentiated. The <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines adhered to surfaces coated with laminin or reconstituted basement membrane extract (Matrigel) to a significantly greater extent than the moderately well differentiated lines {{with the exception of one}} moderately well differentiated line that was derived from a highly aggressive signet ring cell carcinoma. In addition, the <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines exhibited considerable spreading on laminin and Matrigel after adherence that was not evident for the moderately well differentiated lines. The adherence of these cell lines on fibronectin-coated surfaces did not correlate as well with differentiation although, in general, <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines adhered better than moderately well differentiated lines. None of the cells that adhered to fibronectin exhibited the extensive spreading seen on laminin. The specificity of tumor cell interactions with extracellular matrix glycoproteins was examined using synthetic peptides which correspond to sequences within these proteins that are recognized by cell surface receptors. The pentapeptide YIGSR-NH 2 significantly inhibited the adherence and spreading of the tumor cell lines on laminin, but not on fibronectin. The peptide RGDS, however, did not inhibit tumor cell interactions with laminin although it did inhibit their interactions with fibronectin. Thus, the interactions of colon carcinoma cells with laminin and fibronectin are probably mediated by separate receptors. Taken together, the data demonstrate that cells derived from colon carcinomas exhibit considerable variation in their ability to interact with extracellular matrix components, and that this variability is related to the degree of differentiation of original tumor...|$|E

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and the Institute of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2010. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 2010. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 132 - 143. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) kills nearly 600. 000 {{people each}} year and the only effective therapy for this cancer is liver transplantation or tumor ablation only when the tumor is small enough. These tumors are surprisingly resistant to conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Moreover, as HCC is almost always associated with cirrhosis, the treatment with cytotoxic agents is dangerous as they will also affect hepatic functions of the diseased liver. Therefore, there is urgent need to find novel therapeutic approaches against HCC in order to diminish death toll. Our overall goal is to discover “druggable target genes” in HCC. In other words, we wish to identify novel genes and novel mechanisms involved in these cancers {{in order to use}} them as potential therapeutic targets. During my thesis work, I developed different approaches to find new mechanisms and novel targets: 1 - Deciphering the role of canonical Wnt signaling in HCC: We classified human HCC cell lines into "well-differentiated" and "poorly differentiated" subtypes, based on the expression of hepatocyte lineage, epithelial and mesenchymal markers. <b>Poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines lost epithelial and hepatocyte lineage markers, and overexpressed mesenchymal markers. Also, they were highly motile and invasive. We compared the expression of 45 Wnt pathway genes between two subtypes. Likewise, six Frizzled receptors, and canonical Wnt 3 ligand were expressed in both subtypes. In contrast, canonical ligand Wnt 8 b and noncanonical ligands Wnt 4, Wnt 5 a, Wnt 5 b and Wnt 7 b were expressed selectively in well- and <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines, respectively. Canonical Wnt signaling activity, as tested by a TCF reporter assay was detected in 80 % of welldifferentiated, contrary to 14 % of <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines. TCF activity generated by ectopic mutant β-catenin was weak in poorly differentiated SNU 449 cell line, suggesting a repressive mechanism. We tested Wnt 5 a as a candidate antagonist. It strongly inhibited canonical Wnt signaling that is activated by mutant β-catenin in HCC cell lines. 2. Systematic screening of protein kinases and phosphatases as potential therapeutic targets: There is evidence of aberrant activation of several signaling cascades in HCC, and a multikinase inhibitor, sorafenib, has shown survival benefits in patients with advanced HCC. We used siRNAs to screen a large number of kinases and phosphatases to identify related genes involved in HCC cell survival. A total of 7 kinases and 5 phosphatases were identified as strong candidate targets. 3 -Screening of a set of selected epigenetic regulators as potential therapeutic targets: Recent studies have indicated that senescence arrest or senescence escape could be regulated by epigenetic changes on chromatin. We wanted to identify key histone methylation and acetylation changes associated with senescence or senescence escape, and select key histone modifying enzymes, as potential targets for “pro-senescence” interventions (therapeutic interventions that allow senescence induction in cancer cells). We identified ATAD 2 as an epigenetic target, and found ATAD 2 gene overexpressed in HCC compared to normal liver. We also found a stepwise increase of ATAD 2 protein expression in late stages with respect to pre-neoplastic and early stage during hepatocellular carcinogenesis. ATAD 2 knockdown using siRNAs in cancer cells leads to increase in global histone acetylation and inhibit cell proliferation and induce caspase- 3 dependent apoptosis in HCC and induce senescence in MRC 5 cells. Its potentiator role (coactivator role with estrogen, androgen and myc targets) indicates ATAD 2 as a potential therepeutic target for HCC. Yüzügüllü, HalukPh. D...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pancreatic cancer (PDAC) is {{characterized}} by an abundant fibrous tissue rich in Tenascin-C (TNC), a large ECM glycoprotein mainly synthesized by pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). In human pancreatic tissues, TNC expression increases in the progression from low-grade precursor lesions to invasive cancer.

Methods: Proliferation, migration and adhesion assays were performed on pancreatic cancer cell lines treated with TNC or grown on a TNC-rich matrix.

TNC-dependent integrin signaling was investigated by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and pharmacological inhibition. Results: Endogenous TNC promoted pancreatic cancer cell growth and migration.

Grossly, a major distinction can be made between papillary and non-papillary tumors. Histologically, most hilar CCs are well to moderately differentiated conventional type (biliary) carcinomas.

40|$|Background: Dedifferentiation {{and loss}} of {{hepatocyte}} polarity during {{primary culture of hepatocytes}} are major drawbacks for metabolic analyses. As a prominent profibrotic cytokine and potent inducer of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), TGF-β contributes to these processes in liver epithelial cells. Yet, a distinction between culture dependent and TGF-β driven hepatocyte dedifferentiation has not been shown to date. Results: Here, we show that in both settings, mesenchymal markers are induced. However, upregulation of Snai 1 and downregulation of E-Cadherin are restricted to TGF-β effects, neglecting a full EMT of culture dependent hepatocyte dedifferentiation. Mechanistically, the latter is mediated via FAK/Src/ERK/AKT pathways leading to the induction of the oncogene caveolin- 1 (Cav 1). Cav 1 was recently proposed as a new EMT marker, but our results demonstrate Cav 1 is not up-regulated in TGF-β mediated hepatocyte EMT, thus limiting validity of its use for this purpose. Importantly, marking differences on Cav 1 expression exist in HCC cell lines. Whereas well differentiated HCC cell lines exhibit low and inducible Cav 1 protein levels- by TGF-β in a FAK/Src dependent manner, <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines display high Cav 1 expression levels which are not further modulated by TGF-β.

RESULTS: Cell lines 6 and 30 expressed E-cadherin abundantly and this correlated positively with their degree of differentiation and organisation; however, both cell lines had loss of heterozygosity of E-cadherin. Interestingly, E-cadherin production was downregulated in the <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> line 1, and this was associated with major chromosomal rearrangements of 16 q. This cell line also had a mutation in the homophilic binding domain of exon 4, which was associated with disaggregation by low titres of a function blocking antibody, and an invasive phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: These multiple biological alterations further characterise the complex association that E-cadherin has with tumour heterogeneity and suggest that this series of cell lines may be a useful model of colitis associated or HNPCC associated tumorigenesis...|$|E

40|$|Primary {{synovial}} sarcoma (SS) of kidney {{is very rare}} and difficult to diagnose. Here, we present {{a case of a}} 21 -year-old female clinically diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma. Right nephrectomy specimen showed a cystic tumor in the upper pole of kidney with areas of hemorrhage and solid growth. Histologically, it showed <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells</b> with hemangiopericytoma-like vascular pattern. Morphologic and immunohistochemical features were compatible with the diagnosis of <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> SS of kidney. Primary renal SS is a recently described entity. To the best of our knowledge, approximately 34 cases have been reported till date and this is the eighth documented case of <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> variant. Most of the time, <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> SS of kidney exhibits hemangiopericytoma like histology.

40|$|In vivo binding assays using radioautography were {{employed}} to visualize epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin receptors in bone and the enamel organ of the rat. The same method was used to study the internalization of EGF within cells of bones and the enamel organ. EGF receptors were observed in three different cell types of bone: a macrophage-like cell, a rough endoplasmic reticulum rich cell and a <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell.</b> No binding of EGF was observed in osteoblasts or in osteoclasts. In the incisor tooth, EGF receptors were found in all the cellular layers of the enamel organ. A functional paracrine type relationship was shown between the papillary layer cells and the covering ameloblasts. EGF receptors were also observed in the ligamentous periodontal ligament and in the stratum germinativum of the gingiva. The radioautographic method permitted not only the detection of insulin receptors in bone cells, but also the identification of cells in the osteoblastic lineage {{at different stages of}} maturation. Insulin receptors were found in the cells of the osteoblastic lineage, in endothelial cells and in capillary associated macrophage-like cells. In the incisor tooth, insulin receptors were present in endothelial cells in the maturation zone papillary layer of the enamel organ. Finally, the penetration of insulin within cartilage, prebone and bone, predentin and dentin and enamel was observed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Dedifferentiation {{and loss}} of {{hepatocyte}} polarity during {{primary culture of hepatocytes}} are major drawbacks for metabolic analyses. As a prominent profibrotic cytokine and potent inducer of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), TGF-beta contributes to these processes in liver epithelial cells. Yet, a distinction between culture dependent and TGF-beta driven hepatocyte dedifferentiation has not been shown to date. RESULTS: Here, we show that in both settings, mesenchymal markers are induced. However, upregulation of Snai 1 and downregulation of E-Cadherin are restricted to TGF-beta effects, neglecting a full EMT of culture dependent hepatocyte dedifferentiation. Mechanistically, the latter is mediated via FAK/Src/ERK/AKT pathways leading to the induction of the oncogene caveolin- 1 (Cav 1). Cav 1 was recently proposed as a new EMT marker, but our results demonstrate Cav 1 is not up-regulated in TGF-beta mediated hepatocyte EMT, thus limiting validity of its use for this purpose. Importantly, marking differences on Cav 1 expression exist in HCC cell lines. Whereas well differentiated HCC cell lines exhibit low and inducible Cav 1 protein levels - by TGF-beta in a FAK/Src dependent manner, <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines display high Cav 1 expression levels which are not further modulated by TGF-beta. CONCLUSIONS: This study draws a detailed distinction between intrinsic and TGF-beta mediated hepatocyte dedifferentiation and elucidates cellular pathways involved. Additionally, by evaluating the regulation of the oncogene Cav 1, we provide evidence to argue against Cav 1 as a reliable EMT marker...|$|E
40|$|SummaryLiposarcoma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{malignant}} soft tissue neoplasms in adults; however, few reports of liposarcoma had been described the expression of leukocytosis and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In this report, we present the rare case of a patient who had de-differentiated liposarcoma and elevated G-CSF levels that resulted in a leukemoid reaction. The patient was a 65 -year-old man who had been lame for one month due to right thigh swelling. His body temperature was slightly elevated at 38 °C and leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (41500 /μL) was noted. The findings of computed tomography of the lower extremities indicated the presence of a malignancy. Therefore, an incision biopsy was performed. Based on the finding of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the biopsy pathology report, we diagnosed the patient with liposarcoma. Moreover, the preoperative serum G-CSF level was elevated (261. 8 pg/mL). An en bloc excision including the entire biopsy pathway was performed 5 days after admission. After en bloc excision of the tumor, WBC count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and G-CSF expression decreased. The final pathologic report confirmed the diagnosis of de-differentiated liposarcoma. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was detected in the follow-up image study, and the patient has remained asymptomatic 2 years after surgery. The case described here is a rare type of liposarcoma that produces G-CSF, which in turn, induces leukocytosis. Liposarcoma with elevated G-CSF levels resulting in a leukemoid reaction may indicate a <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> type and may be associated with a poor prognosis; however, en bloc excision of the tumor remains the primary treatment for this type of tumor. Moreover, the WBC count and G-CSF serum level can be as the tools monitoring the tumor recurrence...|$|E

40|$|Extrapulmonary {{small cell}} carcinomas (EPSCC) are rare {{malignancies}} with poor patient prognoses. We present {{the case of}} a 63 -year-old male who underwent surgical resection of a <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> small <b>cell</b> carcinoma, likely from a small intestinal primary tumor that metastasized to the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). A 63 -year-old male presented with mild left facial paralysis, hearing loss, and balance instability. MRI revealed a 15 [*]mm mass in the left CPA involving the internal auditory canal consistent with a vestibular schwannoma. Preoperative MRI eight weeks later demonstrated marked enlargement to 35 [*]mm. The patient underwent a suboccipital craniectomy and the mass was grossly different visually and in consistency from a standard vestibular schwannoma. The final pathology revealed a <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> small <b>cell</b> carcinoma. Postoperative PET scan identified avid uptake in the small intestine suggestive of either a small intestinal primary tumor or additional metastatic disease. The patient underwent whole brain radiation therapy and chemotherapy and at last follow-up demonstrated improvement in his symptoms. Surgical resection and radiotherapy are potential treatment options to improve survival in patients diagnosed with NET brain metastases.
