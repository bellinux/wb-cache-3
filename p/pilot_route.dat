40|$|The paper {{presents}} Old's {{approach to}} assessing and allowing access to heavy vehicles under the Performance Based Scheme (PBS) and specifically the longer class B vehicles.

The assessment approach includes policy development, planning and implementation choices and methodology. The new policy allows transport industry to fund route assessments of their interest by engaging registered and experienced transport consultants; the new guideline for Class B route assessments supplement to the NTC 2007 guidelines addresses issues identified in Qld like grades and floodways; the communication and engagement strategy saw transport operators and consultants speed networking to stimulate collaboration and develop an understanding for the new policy; and <b>pilot</b> <b>route</b> assessments undertaken in accordance to the policy provided further confidence in the PBS network expansion...|$|E
50|$|Pune was {{the first}} city in India to {{experiment}} with a Bus Rapid Transit system.

Most of these buses are not in service currently. The funding for the project came from the Government of India under the Jawaharlala Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

40|$|This {{presentation}} will {{outline the}} focus, scope and emerging {{findings of the}} evaluation project which follows and assesses a new route to Early Years Professional Status (EYPS) which {{is run by the}} Centre for Early Childhood (CEC). This status relates to leadership of practice with children under 5 yrs. The <b>pilot</b> <b>route</b> is an initiative sponsored by the Children’s Workforce Development Council. It aims to provide Early Childhood students with an opportunity to work towards their EYPS during their normal BA course. EYPS, despite its relatively short history, is beginning to shape the professional scene of early years professionalism. In order to achieve an EYPS, Early Years Professionals are expected to have accumulated a number of qualities and skills which allow them to develop a creative, critical and innovative approach towards leading and modelling good practice. The pilot project, being part of the BA course, involves some students with relatively small practical experience. From this perspective it is becoming even more important {{to address the issue of}} leading and modelling practice. Based on the analysis of the interviews with students, this presentation will focus on students’ own perceptions of leadership as they were at the point of entry in the pilot project...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{speed limits}} {{are one of}} the latest traffic {{management}} pilot in the Netherlands. Being dynamic they can vary during the day. Previous studies showed difficulties with noticing small changes, also called change blindness. These change blindness studies have mainly been conducted using static scenes or changing irrelevant objects or changing objects that are perceived as static. But what happens if the information changed is relevant for the task, can be perceived as dynamic and can be seen continuously in a dynamic scene? On a Dutch freeway dynamic speed limits were tested that increased from 100 km/u to 120 km/u at moderate traffic conditions. They were shown on rotation signs next to the road and varied several times a day. Loop data was used to measure average speeds of passing cars every minute and compared with the dynamic speed limits displayed. To minimize side-effects only data from speed limit increases for over an hour were used. The average speed before a switch is 107, 7 km/u, meaning that drivers are driving on the <b>pilot</b> <b>route</b> for approximately three minutes before passing the detector loop. Drivers passing the loop did not react immediately on an increase in speed limit. On average it took three to four minutes before car drivers increased their speed. After that driving speed starts to increase significantly. Drivers in the middle and left lane are quicker to act on new speed limits than drivers on the right lane. Three minutes of non-response equals the amount of time it would take the last car driver that could have seen a 100 km/u sign to pass the detector loop. This may mean change blindness is involved. Drivers that might still have seen 100 km/u signs before the switch do not act upon the new speed limit. Subsequent drivers who never saw the 100 km/u sign do; they never saw information that changed. The quicker reaction of drivers in the middle and left lane maybe due to their more active driving style. These drivers are generally busy overtaking other vehicles. This increases situation awareness making them more sensitive to changes in their environment...|$|E

5000|$|Two <b>pilot</b> <b>routes</b> were {{implemented}} in July 2010, with Cycle Superhighway 3 (CS3) connecting Barking in East London with Tower Hill {{on the eastern}} perimeter of The City of London and Cycle Superhighway 7 (CS7) linking Colliers Wood in South London to Bank in the City. CS7 was criticised by rival cycling commentators and campaigners for relying on [...] "blue paint" [...] and bus lanes to protect cyclists from motor traffic, without using kerbed cycle tracks. CS3 was more popular, although critics argued that much of it had existed already, and had simply been rebranded as a Superhighway. Campaigners argued that the Mayor's rhetoric prior to launch had promised a much higher standard of cycling facility, yet the Superhighways encouraged cyclists on to busy main roads in conflict with buses and other motor traffic, with significant risk of being hit by left-turning vehicles at major junctions.|$|R
