40|$|Abstract — A {{new class}} of {{low-cost}} teleoperated pan-tilt-zoom robotic video cameras can provide high resolution <b>panoramic</b> <b>displays</b> of remote sites for disaster response, environmental monitoring, and security applications. While the camera is teleoperated, the resulting video is transmitted back and inserted into an evolving <b>panoramic</b> <b>display.</b> Since small errors in camera position can produce large registration errors in the <b>panoramic</b> <b>display,</b> we address the image alignment problem. To quantify alignment error, we introduce a new metric based on motor error and image overlap. We use this metric to develop a fast minimal variance image alignment algorithm. We have implemented the algorithm and describe experiments demonstrating panoramic quality and that optimal alignment can be computed {{as fast as the}} camera can be tele-operated.

50|$|The display {{consists}} of an LED display apparatus including multiple LED <b>display</b> <b>modules,</b> an inner frame member, and a supporting unit. The LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> has an array of light emitting diodes mounted thereon, and a longitudinal axis. The inner frame member is disposed to confine the LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> therein, and has a size sufficient to permit movement of the LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> in opposite directions of the longitudinal axis. The supporting unit mounts the LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> in the inner frame member such that the LED <b>display</b> <b>module</b> is movable {{back and forth in}} the inner frame member along the longitudinal axis. As the drum spins, the system controls the lighting of each pixel at a precise location to produce a visible image.|$|R

(A "UT-Cave" is any PCbased immersive <b>panoramic</b> <b>display</b> which uses the CaveUT software.) The projection surface can be the clean white corner of a room, or some construction with adjoining screens.

The video was constructed out of six streams of images captured by PointGrey LadyBug 3 camera [4]. The camera was located in a remote operating location, and stitched video buffers were sent to a location where 3 -m hemispherical dome was installed.

The result of the thesis consists mainly of a Windows CE kernel and a schematic for a CPU card, on which it would be suitable to build the <b>display</b> <b>module.</b> Another major part of the report is the introduction of different techniques that could be of interest when designing a processor based system. The processor architecture that was chosen is the x 86. This is mainly due to CPU availability, but as well as the fact that existing software can be used on the <b>display</b> <b>module</b> without any significant modifications. Many interesting processors were sorted out because they hade a very high price on the development kits from the manufacturer and because the possible production volume can not manage this cost.

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} use of film-based periapical radiographs and digital <b>panoramic</b> images <b>displayed</b> on monitor and glossy paper in the {{assessment}} of the periapical status of the teeth. Methodology: A total of 86 subjects were examined. All participants underwent a full-mouth radiographic survey (14 periapical radiographs) and a digital panoramic radiography. The periapical status of all appraised teeth was assessed. Results: Periapical radiographs allowed the assessment of the periapical status of a significantly higher percentage of teeth (87. 4 %) Digital radiography had a significantly reduced potential to allow assessment of the periapical status (p< 0. 01). Only 58. 0 % and 34. 3 % of teeth could be appraised using digital <b>panoramic</b> images <b>displayed</b> on monitor and glossy paper respectively (p< 0. 01). The total percentage of teeth with periapical pathosis was four-fold higher when assessed with digital <b>panoramic</b> images <b>displayed</b> on glossy paper compared with periapical radiographs (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Periapical radiographs allowed the assessment of a significantly higher percentage of teeth when comparing to digital radiography, which had a significantly lower potency {{in the assessment of}} periapical status of the teeth. Digital <b>panoramic</b> images <b>displayed</b> on a monitor resulted in a significantly higher percentage of appraised teeth compared to digital images displayed on glossy paper.

In this paper, we present a case study on the LCMSP, which is taken from a final liquid crystal <b>display</b> <b>module</b> (LCM) shop floor in a TFT-LCD industry. For the case we investigated, the jobs are clustered by their product types and the machine setup time is sequentially dependent on the product types of the jobs processed on the machine. In LCMSP, the objective is to maximize the total profit subject to fulfilling contracted quantities without violating the due date and machine capacity restrictions. The LCMSP can be modelled as a multi-level optimization problem. The sub-problem of LCMSP can be transformed into the vehicle routing problem with time window (VRPTW). One can therefore solve the LCMSP efficiently using existing VRPTW algorithms. We present two new algorithms based on the savings algorithms with some modifications to accommodate the LCMSP. Based on the characteristics of the LCM process, a set of test problems is generated covering most of the real-world applications for test purposes. Computational results and performance comparisons show that the proposed algorithms solved the LCMSP efficiently and near-optimally...|$|R
