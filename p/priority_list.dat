5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its <b>priority</b> <b>list,</b> {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E

5|$|The Livestock Conservancy {{maintains}} a conservation <b>priority</b> <b>list</b> that divides endangered breeds of horses, asses, sheep, goats, cattle, rabbits, {{pigs and poultry}} into five categories based on population numbers and historical interest. The organization has published several books, and works with breed registries and other groups on several aspects of breed preservation, including genetic testing, historical documentation, animal rescue and marketing. Preservation of genetic material is of special interest to the Conservancy, and {{for a period of}} time it maintained a gene bank that was later transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture. It has also developed and published several heritage definitions, including parameters for heritage breeds of cattle and poultry.|$|E
5|$|The Conservation <b>Priority</b> <b>List</b> (CPL) is the Conservancy's list of breeds {{for which}} {{conservation}} is a priority. Published annually, {{the list is}} used {{as the foundation for}} all conservation work done by the organization. Each year, it gathers population data on all breeds of livestock, including registration data and, for poultry, census numbers gathered from members, hatcheries and breeders. This data is then used to divide breeds into five categories: critical, threatened, watch, recovering and study. Breeds are placed in the first three categories based on annual registrations with breed registries in the United States and estimated global populations. Recovering breeds are those that have exceeded the numbers needed for the watch category but that the organization still wishes to monitor. Breeds in the study category lack genetic or historical documentation but are still considered to be of genetic interest. Population numbers may be lacking on these breeds, or proof that they are a true breed, instead of a type or non-true-breeding cross.|$|E

25|$|The Indiana bat {{was listed}} as federally {{endangered}} under the Endangered Species Preservation Act, on March 11, 1967, due to the dramatic decline of populations throughout their range. Reasons for the bat's decline include disturbance of colonies by human beings, pesticide use and loss of summer habitat resulting from the clearing of forest cover. As of 1973, the Indiana bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (as amended), and additionally protected by the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988, to protect hibernacula on Federal lands. In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species {{as one of the}} 35 species of its worldwide <b>priority</b> <b>list</b> of conservation.|$|E

On December 21, 2006, the Salt Lake County Council created a <b>priority</b> <b>list</b> for the sales tax, saying TRAX and commuter rail should take priority. A letter of intent signed with the Federal Transit Administration on September 24, 2007 secured the remaining $500 million in funding for the light rail lines. These funds were used to finance the FrontLines 2015 expansion project, which added four TRAX extensions by 2015 (as well as an expansion to FrontRunner commuter rail).|$|E
25|$|A {{government}} commission came in 1882 with {{recommendations for}} future railway construction. They placed the Solør Line {{at the top}} of their <b>priority</b> <b>list.</b> In addition to it being perceived as having a good return on investment, the limited amount of funding available cautioned the commission to recommend trunk routes which would largely be futile unless completed to their intended termini. During this period there was a major controversy concerning rail gauge in Norway. Some lines were being built in standard gauge, others in narrow gauge. With the Kongsvinger Line being built in standard gauge, a deviating gauge in Solør with require transshipment. Pihl argued for narrow gauge, but standard gauge was ultimately chosen.|$|E

25|$|One of the Copenhagen Consensus panel experts later distanced {{himself from}} {{the way in which}} the Consensus results have been {{interpreted}} in the wider debate. Thomas Schelling now thinks that it was misleading to put climate change at the bottom of the <b>priority</b> <b>list.</b> The Consensus panel members were presented with a dramatic proposal for handling climate change. If given the opportunity, Schelling would have put a more modest proposal higher on the list. The Yale economist Robert O. Mendelsohn was the official critic of the proposal for climate change during the Consensus. He thought the proposal was way out of the mainstream and could only be rejected. Mendelsohn worries that climate change was set up to fail.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a <b>priority</b> <b>list</b> for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.|$|E
25|$|Alternate: Events {{which are}} {{played in the}} same week as a higher status tournament and {{therefore}} have weakened fields and reduced prize money. They are often considered an opportunity for players who would not qualify for certain events due to their world rankings, positions on the FedEx Cup points list, or position on the Tour's <b>priority</b> <b>list</b> to move up more easily or have an easier attempt at a two-year exemption for winning a tournament. Because of their weaker fields, these events usually receive the minimum amount of world ranking points reserved for PGA Tour events (24 points) and fewer FedEx Cup points than most tournaments (300 points instead of 500). Alternate events also do not earn Masters invitations. Fields for alternate events have 132 players. These events have 12 unrestricted sponsor exemptions, four more than the regular events.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, The Program for the Conservation of Migratory Bats between Mexico and the United States {{was started}} by a {{concerned}} group of international bat specialists {{in response to a}} decline of multiple bat species in Mexico. PCCM has been valuable in conducting censuses of the greater long-nosed bats in Cueva del Diablo. To reduce vandalism in Cueva del Diablo and promote appreciation of bats, PCCM created a series of children's books, educational activities, and TV reports. In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide <b>priority</b> <b>list</b> of conservation. There is evidence that the population in the United States has increased since 1984, with the population in Arizona one hundred times greater in 2000 than it was in 1984. Because it is a highly colonial species, disturbance at a single cave can have a significant negative impact on the entire species.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{because it}} was {{believed}} Pearl Harbor had natural defenses against torpedo attack (e.g., the shallow water), the Navy did not deploy torpedo nets or baffles, which were judged to inconvenience ordinary operations. As a result of limited numbers of long-range aircraft (including Army Air Corps bombers), reconnaissance patrols were not being made as often or as far out as required for adequate coverage against possible surprise attack (they improved considerably, with far fewer remaining planes, after the attack). The Navy had 33 PBYs in the islands, but only three on patrol {{at the time of}} the attack. Hawaii was low on the <b>priority</b> <b>list</b> for the B-17s finally becoming available for the Pacific, largely because General MacArthur in the Philippines was successfully demanding as many as could be made available to the Pacific (where they were intended as a deterrent). The British, who had contracted for them, even agreed to accept fewer to facilitate this buildup. At the time of the attack, Army and Navy were both on training status rather than operational alert.|$|E
