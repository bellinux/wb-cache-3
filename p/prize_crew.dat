5|$|In {{the seas}} off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous {{efforts to protect}} their captures; Corona was heavily on fire in {{consequence}} of her engagement with Active and the British <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the blazing mainmast collapsed. Problems were also experienced aboard Bellona, where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light the fuse. The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September, Confiance {{captured}} the Prize, from Calcutta, which had stored eight of her ten guns in her hold to improve her stability. Prize was {{sent off to}} Mauritius {{on the next day}} with an 85-man <b>prize</b> <b>crew.</b> Surcouf then steered for Ganjam, where he captured three smaller ships.|$|E
5|$|Surcouf {{then decided}} to sail to the Mergui Archipelago to load a rice cargo. On 8 December 1795, while in transit, {{cruising}} off the Ganges Delta, Surcouf captured his first prize, the ship Penguin, loaded with lumber, on which he detached a <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> under Lieutenant Péru before sending her to Isle de France.|$|E
5000|$|U.S. Coast Guard cutters capture vessels during drug interdiction operations, {{and then}} {{bring them to}} port using <b>prize</b> <b>crews.</b>|$|R
50|$|Astraea and Quebec also {{captured}} Constance, {{which was}} carrying tobacco. <b>Prize</b> <b>crews</b> then took South Carolina and Constance to New York.|$|R
5000|$|After this {{engagement}} Thor {{was ordered}} to rendezvous with the [...] to transfer men for <b>prize</b> <b>crews</b> for 's captured whaling fleet.|$|R
5|$|The {{first officer}} of Confiance, Joachim Drieux, was sent on Kent with a 60-man <b>prize</b> <b>crew,</b> while her {{passengers}} were released on a merchantman that Surcouf stopped {{a few days}} later. Confiance and Kent arrived at the Rade des Pavillons in Port-Louis in November. The capture of Kent became a sensation, and the British Admiralty promised a reward for the capture of Surcouf.|$|E
5|$|Boyles was {{not long}} able to enjoy his victory undisturbed: at 10:00 on 7 May, shortly after {{the removal of the}} French prisoners had been completed, sails were spotted on the horizon. These were rapidly {{identified}} as three French ships of the line that were making all haste to intercept and capture Swiftsure and Atalante. These ships were part of a squadron under Contre-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly that had sailed from Rochefort the day before in search of the American grain convoy shortly due in European waters. Issuing rapid orders, Boyles instructed Atalantes <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> to separate their ship from Swiftsure in order to force the French to split their forces; the frigate and the ship of the line fleeing on different courses. Atalante soon outran pursuit and escaped into the Atlantic, the <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> even managing to replace the damaged main topsail {{in the midst of the}} chase with the assistance of the French prisoners on board. Swiftsure was slower but Boyles was still able to increase the distance between his vessel and the French during the day, finally losing sight of his pursuers at 22:00.|$|E
5|$|Inman {{had lost}} all his {{personal}} possessions {{in the destruction of}} Lark and was forced to replace his uniform from his own wages when the Navy refused to provide compensation. Returning to Britain in the frigate HMS Pearl, Inman was promoted to lieutenant in 1780 and returned to the Americas in HMS Camel, transferred soon afterwards into HMS Santa Monica in the West Indies. Shortly after his arrival however, Inman was once again shipwrecked when Santa Monica grounded off Tortola. Although the crew reached the shore in small boats, the ship broke up rapidly and once again Inman lost all of his possessions. Remaining on shore service in the West Indies for the next two years, Inman was again employed {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of the Saintes, appointed to the <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> of the captured French vessel Hector for the journey to Britain. Hectors masts and hull had been seriously damaged in the battle, requiring lighter spars to be fitted and 22 of her 74 guns removed to make her more seaworthy. As the fleet could not spare men to man her, the 223-strong <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> was made up of men pressed in the Caribbean, principally invalids unfit for frontline service.|$|E
50|$|Astraea and Quebec {{captured}} Hope and Constance, {{which was}} carrying tobacco. <b>Prize</b> <b>crews</b> then took South Carolina, Hope and Constance to New York. Seagrove escaped.|$|R
50|$|Later {{the same}} day, Sérieuse {{captured}} the 14-gun merchant brig Expedition, which was sailing from Bastia to Livorno. <b>Prize</b> <b>crews</b> took Expedition and Alceste to Nice.|$|R
2500|$|Two German {{submarines}} {{captured in}} Europe stop at Argentia {{en route to}} the United States. U-Boats, sailed on the surface by <b>prize</b> <b>crews,</b> put in for fuel, repairs, provisions, and stores ...|$|R
5|$|The entire action {{lasted about}} forty minutes. The French were much {{worse off than}} the Americans in terms of casualties, with 7 Frenchmen killed and 33wounded {{compared}} to 3 Americans killed and 7wounded. A <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> from Enterprise was sent aboard Flambeau and sailed her to Saint Kitts where she was condemned. The proceeds {{from the sale of}} Flambeau were adjudicated to the crew of Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|A French frigate {{squadron}} sent to on {{a cruise}} in the Northern Bay of Biscay in the early autumn of 1793 was commanded by Captain Zacharie Allemand and consisted of the frigates Carmagnole, Résolue, Sémillante and Uranie with the brig-corvette Espiègle. On 22 October, the squadron sighted the 16-gun Spanish brig Alcoudia and Allemand ordered Uranie under Captain Jean-François Tartu to separate from the squadron and pursue the Spaniard. Uranie was easily able to capture Alcoudia, taking the prisoners on board the frigate and establishing a <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> on the brig. Two days later, Uranie was sailing southwards in company with the prize with the wind at the southwest, when a sail appeared to the north at 09:30.|$|E
5|$|After the victory, a <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> was put aboard Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had {{a good deal of}} trouble from the restive Americans, who outnumbered his own men. He had some {{of the leaders of the}} unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (holes) in the maindeck through which two 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{need to put}} <b>prize</b> <b>crews</b> aboard San Jose Triumfo and Phoenix {{strained}} Roach's resources. Instead, at {{the cost}} of sharing the proceeds, he arranged for [...] to take them into Freetown.|$|R
50|$|Astraea and Quebec also {{captured}} Hope and Constance, {{which was}} carrying tobacco. <b>Prize</b> <b>crews</b> then took South Carolina, Hope, and Constance to New York. Seagrove escaped. Prize money was paid in 1784.|$|R

5|$|In early 1798, after 14 {{months in}} Paris, Surcouf took command of Clarisse, a 14-gun {{privateer}} brig armed with four 12-pounders, ten 8-pounders, and manned by a 120-strong complement. He departed from Paimboeuf, Nantes, in February 1798, {{this time with}} a proper lettre de marque. During the journey to Isle de France, Clarisse chased a British slave ship, which escaped after one of her shots cut off Clarisse 's foremast tops. Surcouf captured a British brig South of Cape of Good Hope, which surrendered at the warning shot, on which he sent a <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> under Captain Dujardin, and arrived La Réunion on 5 December.|$|E
5|$|Laforey {{placed a}} {{boarding}} party aboard Castor, who discovered {{an officer and}} 18 British sailors held as prisoners below decks, {{part of the original}} crew of the ship. These men were freed and joined the <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> in bringing the ship back to Britain. The rest of the crew, including Captain Troubridge, remained on Nielly's flagship throughout the subsequent campaign and witnessed the battle of the Glorious First of June, at which Sans Pareil was captured by Lord Howe's fleet. The French fleet was defeated, losing seven ships, but the convoy had passed safely to the north during the battle and eventually reached France without interception by the cruising British squadrons.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1800, Clarisse {{captured}} a large rice-laden merchantman, the British James. On 3 January, she detected two American 16-carronade ships forming {{a line of}} battle; although Clarisse lacked the eight guns sacrificed to escape Sybille and 60 of her men detached on her various prizes, Surcouf engaged. Clarisse raked the rear-most ship, the Louisa, and boarded her, while simultaneously firing a broadside on the other ship, Mercury, which attempted to rescue her mate. Nicolas Surcouf led a 30-man boarding party to seize Louisa, while Mercury escaped. Clarisse could not give chase, her bowsprit having been destroyed in the collision with Louisa. Nicolas Surcouf took a <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> and sailed Louisa back to Port Louis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prize</b> <b>crews</b> {{took the}} three {{captured}} ships to Port Cornwallis on South Andaman Island. Troubridge received promotion to commander in September, and assumed command of HMS Celebes, the former Pallas. Commander William Wilbrahim replaced Troubridge in Harrier.|$|R
50|$|Caroline {{captured}} several ships, {{notably the}} two 20-gun East Indiamen Streatham and Europa on 3 May 1809, {{before returning to}} Saint-Paul. A third East Indiaman, Lord Keith, escaped. <b>Prize</b> <b>crews</b> took Streatham and Europa to Réunion, where the British recaptured them on 21 September.|$|R
60|$|Within {{but little}} more than an hour from the moment the victorious Zodangan {{squadron}} had risen to meet us from the camp of the besiegers the battle was over, and the remaining vessels of the conquered Zodangans were headed toward the cities of Helium under <b>prize</b> <b>crews.</b>|$|R
5|$|Admiral Graf Spees Arado {{floatplane}} {{located the}} merchant ship Doric Star: Langsdorff fired a shot across her bow {{to stop the}} ship. Doric Star was able to send out a distress signal before she was sunk, which prompted Harwood to take his three cruisers {{to the mouth of}} the River Plate, which he estimated would be Langsdorff's next target. On the night of 5 December, Admiral Graf Spee sank the steamer Tairoa. The next day, she met with Altmark and transferred 140 prisoners from Doric Star and Tairoa. Admiral Graf Spee encountered her last victim on the evening of 7 December: the freighter Streonshalh. The <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> recovered secret documents containing shipping route information. Based on that information, Langsdorff decided to head for the seas off Montevideo. On 12 December, the ship's Arado 196 broke down and could not be repaired, depriving Graf Spee of her aerial reconnaissance. The ship's disguise was removed, so it would not hinder the ship in battle.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00, {{a breeze}} pushed Boadicea forward {{and she began}} to close with her former consort, Rowley {{watching}} as all three of Africaines masts gave way and collapsed over the side one by one. By 08:00, Africaine was a dismasted hull and Corbet was dead {{in the bowels of the}} ship, although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy. By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and bore down on the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E
5|$|By nightfall {{some of the}} {{remaining}} French ships had entered Donegal Bay with Canada, Melampus and Foudroyant still in pursuit. The two forces repeatedly passed {{one another in the}} dark, and Canada almost drove ashore. Back at the battle site, Warren had ordered Robust to tow Hoche into Lough Swilly—this order later came under criticism, as Robust was in a battered state herself and the storms of the previous week had not abated. When a gale struck the pair on 13 October, Hoche lost several masts and broke her tow, only being prevented from foundering by the combined efforts of the British <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> and their French prisoners. Eventually, on 15 October, Doris appeared and took Hoche in tow, arriving in Lough Swilly without further incident a few days later. Meanwhile, Ethalion saw Bellone safely into port, and Magnanime and Amelia brought in Coquille and Embuscade respectively.|$|E
50|$|On 25 June Pasley {{captured}} the Spanish privateer felucca Golondrina off Cape St. Vincent. Golondrina was armed with two guns and small arms, {{and had a}} crew of 33 men, nine of whom were away as <b>prize</b> <b>crews</b> on a Guernsey lugger and a Portuguese schooner that Golondrina had captured.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1776, Captain John Manley, Continental Army, was {{appointed}} Commodore of the Fleet and hoisted his flag in Hancock. She captured two enemy transports on 25 January 1776, fending off an eight-gun British schooner in a brisk engagement while <b>prize</b> <b>crews</b> took the captured ships into Plymouth Harbor.|$|R
5000|$|She {{was fitted}} {{out as an}} Armed Boarding Vessel (ABV) by Cammell Laird in late November 1914. She was to have 100 {{officers}} and crew and was fitted out as an auxiliary, capable of carrying boarding parties and <b>prize</b> <b>crews,</b> and was put {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-Commander P. E. Haynes RNR ...|$|R
5|$|By {{the start}} of the operation, Bismarcks crew had {{increased}} to 2,221 officers and enlisted men. This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, Bismarck departed Gotenhafen and made for the Danish straits. She was joined at 11:25 by Prinz Eugen, which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona. The two ships were escorted by three destroyers—, , and —and a flotilla of minesweepers. The Luftwaffe provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters. At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's mission. At approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.|$|E
5|$|Captain Pulteney Malcolm on Donegal {{attacked}} Brave directly, firing his starboard {{guns and}} then crossing Braves stern, inflicting severe damage with a raking broadside, before pulling alongside again and engaging from close range. Badly damaged, Brave surrendered. Malcolm then ordered Captain Richard Dunn in Acasta to take possession as Donegal moved forward to engage Jupiter. With Donegal alongside Jupiter, Captain Samuel Pym in Atlas abandoned his brief {{engagement with the}} French ship and steered for the melee surrounding the increasingly isolated Impérial. Taking advantage of his ship's superior speed, Malcolm pulled ahead of Jupiter and then rammed her bow, securing the ships together to prevent the French vessel from escaping. Recognising that further resistance was hopeless, Captain Gaspard Laignel surrendered immediately. Malcolm then sent 100 men on board as a <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> and attached a towline to the French ship, just as the trailing Agamemnon finally reached the battle.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Boadicea {{continued}} to close until Victor {{was forced to}} abandon Ceylon and sail in support of Vénus at 15:30. As soon as the French <b>prize</b> <b>crew</b> was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz Gibbon, the remaining officer on Ceylon, rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed Boadicea to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching Vénus at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that the battered state of his flagship meant {{that he would not}} be able to adequately defend against Rowley's attack and ordered Victor to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon. Readying his ship for a token action, Hamelin fired at Boadicea as she came up but was forced to surrender within ten minutes.|$|E
5000|$|King Orry saw {{service in}} both World Wars. She was fitted {{out as an}} Armed Boarding Vessel by Cammell Laird's in late November 1914, and then made passage for Scapa Flow. There she spent her time on patrol, tending to the crews of {{stricken}} ships, challenging suspects, and putting <b>prize</b> <b>crews</b> aboard where appropriate.|$|R
50|$|As Nelson lay dying, {{he ordered}} the fleet to anchor as a storm was predicted. However, when the storm blew up many of the {{severely}} damaged ships sank or ran aground on the shoals. A few of them were recaptured by the French and Spanish prisoners overcoming the small <b>prize</b> <b>crews</b> or by ships sallying from Cádiz.|$|R
50|$|In October 1822, Louisiana {{assisted}} in the capture of five pirate vessels of 80 to 100 tons each. Two were burnt, the others were sent to New Orleans with <b>prize</b> <b>crews.</b> Only one crew consisting of 17 men were taken to Camp Galvas near Pensacola, Florida; {{the rest of the}} vessels crews managed to escape into the woods.|$|R
