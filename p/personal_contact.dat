On March 18, 2009, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled {{it would not}} hear {{arguments}} in the case, effectively ending the legal battle to make his e-mails with Katz public. Corzine spent approximately $127,000 of taxpayer funds to keep the e-mails secret. Nonetheless, on August 1, 2010, The Star-Ledger published 123 of the Corzine-Katz e-mails, revealing {{the extent of their}} <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> during negotiations over a new state government workers contract in early 2007.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without <b>personal</b> <b>contact.</b> As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} {{of personal and}} political is partially responsible for DiFranco's early popularity among politically active college students, particularly those of the left wing, some of whom set up fan pages on the web to document DiFranco's career as early as 1994. DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> and word of mouth rather than mainstream media.|$|E
25|$|Chick {{had limited}} <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with the public; he gave only one known {{professional}} interview after 1975.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{to what extent}} ethnic diversity in neighborhoods and municipalities in the Netherlands is related to <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> at work and at school with the ethnic in- and out-groups, among the native majority as well as ethnic minorities. Constrict theory, ethnic competition theory, and contact theory are used to derive hypotheses. A unique Dutch dataset with an oversampling of two large minority groups is analyzed with three-level multilevel regression models. The results indicate that ethnic diversity at the municipality level is negatively related to <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> with native colleagues and schoolmates, but positively related to <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> with colleagues and schoolmates from other ethnic groups. Ethnic diversity at the neighborhood level {{is not related to}} <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> at work and at school. This applies equally to native respondents and Turks and Moroccans, rejecting Putnam's hunkering down hypothesis and ethnic competition theory. Instead, ethnic diversity increases meeting opportunities with ethnic minorities while decreasing meeting opportunities with the native majority. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

25|$|Burton defied {{many aspects}} of the {{pervasive}} British ethnocentrism of his day, relishing <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with human cultures in all their variety. His works and letters extensively criticized colonial policies of the British Empire, even to the detriment of his career. Although his university education aborted, he became a prolific and erudite author and wrote numerous books and scholarly articles about subjects including human behaviour, travel, falconry, fencing, sexual practices and ethnography. A characteristic feature of his books is the copious footnotes and appendices containing remarkable observations and information.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{an urban}} growth model where {{learning}} through <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> {{could be more}} effective in a denser locale, whereas the effectiveness of learning through impersonal means of communications depends principally on the technology of communications rather than on the locale in which learning takes place. As a result of advances in communications technology, cities would be larger, and workers would spent more time on learning through <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> but may cut time on impersonal learning if the two kinds of learning investment are complements. Otherwise, cities could become smaller, while workers would spend more time on impersonal learning at the expense of time on learning through <b>personal</b> <b>contacts.</b> In a multi-sector economy, urban industrial diversity tends to increase or fall together with city size.

40|$|The {{available}} {{empirical evidence}} on the wage effect of finding jobs through informal contacts is mixed. This paper provides a simple theory where, depending on the efficiency of formal search methods, the use of <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> can lead either to a wage premium or to a wage penalty. New empirical evidence shows that, in fact, across {{the countries of the}} European Union, premiums and penalties to finding jobs through <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> are equally frequent and of about the same size. Furthermore, much of this cross-country vari- ation appears to be correlated with measures of the efficiency of formal search channels. In particular, the wage effect of finding jobs through <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> is higher in countries with more labor market intermediaries. Differences-in-differences estimates based on the Italian liberalization of the labor recruitment industry confirm this result...|$|R
25|$|The {{viruses that}} cause HFMD are spread through close <b>personal</b> <b>contact,</b> {{through the air}} from coughing, and the feces of an {{infected}} person. Contaminated objects can also spread the disease. Coxsackievirus A16 {{is the most common}} cause and Enterovirus 71 is the second-most common cause. Other strains of coxsackievirus and enterovirus can also be responsible. Some people may carry and pass on the virus despite having no symptoms of disease. Other animals are not involved. Diagnosis can often be made based on symptoms. Occasionally throat or stool sample may be tested for the virus.|$|E
25|$|Antisemitism did not {{cease to}} exist in the {{aftermath}} of World War II and continued to be part of Austrian political life and culture with its strongest hold in the political parties and the media. Bernd Marin, an Austrian sociologist, has characterized antisemitism in Austria after 1945 as an ‘antisemitism without Jews’, since Jews constituted only 0.1 percent of the Austrian population. Antisemitism was stronger in those areas where Jews no longer lived and where previously practically no Jews had lived, and among people who neither have had nor have any <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with Jews.|$|E

Following an investigation, on 30 January 2017, the Vatican's Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life ordered that Figari be “prohibited from contacting, in any way, persons belonging to the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, and no way have any direct <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with them.”.|$|E

25|$|From the 1970s, {{academics}} have researched attitudes held {{by individuals}} toward lesbians, {{gay men and}} bisexuals, and {{the social and cultural}} factors that underlie such attitudes. Numerous studies have investigated the prevalence of acceptance and disapproval of homosexuality, and have consistently found correlates with various demographic, psychological, and social variables. For example, studies (mainly conducted in the United States) have found that heterosexuals with positive attitudes towards homosexuality {{are more likely to be}} female, white, young, non-religious, well-educated, politically liberal or moderate, and have close <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with out homosexuals.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{the only}} system of {{collecting}} reports of large whales along the Japanese coast is the ICR Strandings Record – this {{applies only to}} stranded individuals, hence the limited knowledge about the biology of free-swimming right whales in Japan. There were more unpublished or unreported sightings of right whales confirmed by locals {{in recent years in}} which some important observations such as a cow-calf pairs observation close to shore are included (<b>personal</b> <b>contact).</b> For example, a sailor on a yacht had a very close encounter with a cow-calf pair breaching off Miura Peninsula in earlier 2000s. This sighting was later confirmed by a local marine biologist working at an aquarium.|$|E
25|$|Henosis for Plotinus {{was defined}} in his {{works as a}} {{reversing}} of the ontological process of consciousness via meditation (in the Western mind to uncontemplate) toward no thought (Nous or demiurge) and no division (dyad) within the individual (being). Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle but also various World religions that he had <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an ascetic character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as immanent, with matter as essential to its being, having no true or transcendential character or essence, substance or ousia. This approach is called philosophical Idealism.|$|E

25|$|Melton's major {{emphasis}} {{has been}} on collating primary source data on religious groups and movements. His approach to research is shaped by his training both in church and religious history and in the phenomenology of religion. His methodology has followed that of a historian seeking primary source literature, and so he has generally made direct, <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with the leaders or official representatives of a church or religious group. The purpose of such contact has been to obtain the group's main religious literature to ascertain their principal teachings and practices. His inquiries also comprise, gathering membership statistics, details of the group's history and so forth. He then incorporates these details profiles that {{form the basis for}} reference texts like the Encyclopedia of American Religions.|$|E
25|$|Jan van der Lans (1933–2002), a {{professor}} of the psychology of religion at the Catholic University of Nijmegen, wrote, in a book commissioned by the Netherlands-based Catholic Study Center for Mental Health, about followers of gurus and the potential dangers that exist when <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> between the guru and the disciple is absent, such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student (myth making and deification), and an increase of the chance of false mysticism. He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality, but, when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners, {{the distinction between the}} person who is the guru and that which he symbolizes is often lost, resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a boundless, uncritical personality cult.|$|E
25|$|Measles {{is caused}} by the measles virus, a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped RNA virus of the genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus was first {{isolated}} in 1954 by Nobel Laureate John F. Enders and Thomas Peebles, who were careful {{to point out that the}} isolations were made from patients who had Koplik's spots. Humans are the only natural hosts of the virus, and no other animal reservoirs are known to exist. This highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing via close <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> or direct contact with secretions. Risk factors for measles virus infection include immunodeficiency caused by HIV or AIDS, immunosuppression following receipt of an organ or a stem cell transplant, alkylating agents, or corticosteroid therapy, regardless of immunization status; travel to areas where measles is endemic or contact with travelers to endemic areas; and the loss of passive, inherited antibodies before the age of routine immunization.|$|E
