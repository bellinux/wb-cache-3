50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s {{there were}} regular train {{crossings}} at Schwarmstedt station. Four steam locomotive-hauled trains passed through the station, enabling connexions to be made.

50|$|The robbery {{took place}} on 29 January or 9 February 1791 (sources differ) at Ickles, on the Rotherham edge of Attercliffe Common. Broughton and his {{accomplice}} John Oxley stayed in Sheffield {{the night before the}} robbery and then walked out of the town on the Rotherham road where they met the mail coming towards Sheffield. However, they intended to rob it on its way back to Rotherham so they lay in wait for it to arrive. George Leasley, the boy driving the mail cart, described how he was led into a field, blindfolded with a handkerchief, and his hands tied behind his back and fixed to a hedge. After about an hour he freed himself and found his horse, but the Rotherham <b>post</b> <b>bag</b> was gone. Broughton and Oxley escaped towards Mansfield. On their way they went through the contents of the <b>post</b> <b>bag</b> and found that the only item of value was a French bill of exchange worth £123; they disposed {{of the rest of the}} contents in a brook and parted, with Oxley proceeding to London to cash the bill.|$|R

30|$|Rotational {{malalignment}} is {{a problem}} with closed intramedullary nailing [7, 22]. The rate of rotational malalignment in the present series (12.2 %) is comparable with the rates (0 – 28 %) reported in the literature [1, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 17, 26]. Studies using just clinical assessment reported a very low or no incidence of malalignment [9, 12, 17, 23, 27] but accuracy of a clinically determined rotational malalignment is poor compared with a CT-determined rotational malalignment [26]. We have used postoperative CT scan to assess malrotation as it is a reliable and more reproducible and therefore the preferred method [26, 28]. Now, we are not using CT scan in every patient. This was used only to standardize the present technique. We have used patella as parallel to the floor for lateral nailing in the present study. Other studies have also reported this method to achieve rotational alignment [17, 22], whereas Winquist et al. [3] assessed malrotation through careful attention to the skin folds. Control of rotational alignment seems to be more difficult in lateral position [13]. We have used <b>padded</b> <b>posts</b> on sacrum and anterior superior iliac spines to stabilize the pelvis, and this might have prevented secondary effect of pelvis mal-position. The <b>padded</b> <b>posts</b> are not costly and can be fabricated locally.|$|R

60|$|These {{roads were}} for the coaches. Young folks, who never saw {{anything}} nearer approaching to a stage coach than the drags some gentlemen keep, can hardly fancy what these stage coaches were--tall vehicles, holding four inside passengers and at least twelve outside and quantities of luggage. They were drawn by four of the strongest and quickest horses that could be procured, and these were changed about every five or six miles, so as to keep up full speed. The coachman, generally a big, burly man, with a face reddened by exposure to the weather, and often by a glass of ale at every stage, sat on the box in a drab coat, with many capes one over the other. The {{seat next to him}} was the favourite one with the passengers, and gentlemen would sometimes bribe coachmen to let them drive; nay, some gentlemen actually took to the trade themselves. There was also a guard, who in mail coaches took care of the <b>post</b> <b>bags,</b> and dropped them at the places where they were intended for. In the days when highwaymen infested the roads the guard had carried pistols, and still the guard of the mail wore a red coat, and blew a horn on entering any place to warn the people to bring out their <b>post</b> <b>bags</b> and exchange them for others.|$|R

40|$|Soccer is {{the most}} popular team sport worldwide, with {{approximately}} 40 million amateur participants. Most fa talities in soccer are related to player impact with the goal post. This study focuses on two case reports, a laboratory testing phase, and a pilot field testing phase of preventive equipment that can be used around the goal to prevent injury. Horizontal and vertical impact testing in the laboratory revealed impact force was di minished when the goal post was covered with protec tive padding (reduction of 31 % and 63 %) (P < 0. 05). These data showed a statistically significant decrease in force at all temperatures. In the pilot field testing phase of the study, 471 games were monitored. Soccer teams participating in youth, teen, and adult soccer leagues were included in this phase of the study. During the 3 -year study, there were seven player collisions with <b>padded</b> goal <b>posts,</b> and no injuries were recorded. The use of <b>padded</b> goal <b>posts</b> within the game of soccer has been documented to reduce the possibility of injury, both in the laboratory phase and in the pilot field testing phase...|$|R

40|$|The ensembling of {{classifiers}} {{tends to}} improve predictive accuracy. To obtain an ensemble with N classifiers, one typically needs to run N learning processes. In this paper we introduce and explore Model Jittering Ensembling, where one single model is perturbed {{in order to}} obtain variants that can be used as an ensemble. We use as base classifiers sets of classification association rules. The two methods of jittering ensembling we propose are Iterative Reordering Ensembling (IRE) and <b>Post</b> <b>Bagging</b> (PB). Both methods start by learning one rule set over a single run, and then produce multiple rule sets without relearning. Empirical results on 36 data sets are positive and show that both strategies tend to reduce error with respect to the single model association rule classifier. A bias–variance analysis reveals that while both IRE and PB are able to reduce the variance component of the error, IRE is particularly effective in reducing the bias component. We show that Model Jittering Ensembling can represent a very good speed-up w. r. t. multiple model learning ensembling. We also compare Model Jittering with various state of the art classifiers in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. This work was partially supported by FCT project Rank!
