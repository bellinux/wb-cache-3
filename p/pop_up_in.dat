5|$|That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season {{series against}} the Yankees. A 13-inning {{comeback}} win for the Yankees on July 1 was punctuated by a catch from Derek Jeter, who ran and dove into the stands at full speed and came out with facial lacerations when Trot Nixon hit a <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an area deep behind third base. On July 24, Jason Varitek shoved his glove {{into the face of}} the Yankees' Álex Rodríguez after Rodríguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodríguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11–10 come-from-behind victory. Both Rodríguez and Varitek were each suspended four games and fined $2,000 for the brawl.|$|E

25|$|With {{the opening}} of these routes, and the {{incorporation}} of Harrisburg as the State Capital in 1812, more and more traffic moved through the Palmyra area. The passage of more travelers encouraged taverns and hotels {{to be built in}} Palmyra to accommodate them.

Players can build transportation networks, which include roads, streets, avenues, highways, railways, subway lines, and bus stations.

[...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote [...] "lots of great moments <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> this excellent program. Bart’s rise to fame sparkles via its deft parody of instant— and fleeting— fame, and many wacky bits show up along the way such as Homer’s fear that Bart got turned into a box. [...] This might be Season Five’s best show." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A- and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5.|$|E

2500|$|Florida has {{the highest}} average {{precipitation}} of any state, {{in large part because}} afternoon thunderstorms are common in most of the state from late spring until early autumn. A fair day may be interrupted with a storm, only to return to sunshine an hour or so later.

Florida leads the United States in tornadoes per square mile (when including waterspouts), but they do not typically reach the intensity of those in the Midwest and Great Plains.

One may express the thing briefly by saying that, as far as Bream was concerned, Sam's unconventional appearance put the lid on it. He did not hesitate. He did not pause to make comments or ask questions.
