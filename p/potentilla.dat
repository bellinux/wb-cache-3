40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{research}} the anti-cancer {{mechanism of the}} Traditional Chinese Medicine Fanbaicao (Herba <b>Potentillae</b> Discoloris) oil in the human hepatoma cell line HepG 2. MethodsGas chromatography was {{used to analyze the}} components of Fanbaicao (Herba <b>Potentillae</b> Discoloris). We tested the inhibitory effect of Fanbaicao (Herba <b>Potentillae</b> Discoloris) oil on the human hepatoma cell line HepG 2 in vitro using 3 -(4, 5 -Dimet hylt hiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -dip henyltetrazolium bromide assays. Fluorescence activating cell sorter analysis was used to examine the levels of apoptosis, and western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect the expression of p 21, p-p 21 and CDK 4 proteins. ResultsFanbaicao (Herba <b>Potentillae</b> Discoloris) oil contains 45 ingredients, and L-ascorbic acid 2, 6 -bispalmitate was the main component and accounted for 44. 96 % of total drive-off peak area. Other components included (Z) − 14 -met hyl- 8 -exadecenal-acetal (8. 56 %), phytol (7. 74 %) and lauric acid (6. 31 %). Fanbaicao (Herba <b>Potentillae</b> Discoloris) oil treatment reduced the proliferation of HepG 2 cells and the half growth inhibition concentration (IC 50) was 2. 03 mg/mL. Furthermore, we also observed significantly increased HepG 2 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0. 05). Fanbaicao (Herba <b>Potentillae</b> Discoloris) oil significantly increased the expression of p 21 and p-p 21 and significantly decreased the expression of CDK 4 in HepG 2 cells compared with controls (P < 0. 01). ConclusionOur results showed that Fanbaicao (Herba <b>Potentillae</b> Discoloris) oil has anti-cancer activities in HepG 2 cells, which is probably related to the upregulation of p 21 and p-p 21 and downregulation of CDK 4 expression...|$|R

5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s <b>potentilla</b> (<b>Potentilla</b> breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E

5|$|Part of the {{disparity}} in genus sizes is attributable to historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as Ranunculus and <b>Potentilla.</b>|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{foraging}} theory {{predicts that}} predators prefer those prey {{species that are}} most rewarding in terms of reproductive success, which is dependent on prey quality and prey availability. To investigate which selection pressures may have moulded prey preference in an acarine system consisting of two prey species and three predator species, we tested whether prey preference of the predators is matched by the associated reproductive success. The predators involved areAmblyseius finlandicus (Oudemans),Am. <b>potentillae</b> (Garman) andTyphlodromus pyri Scheuten. The prey species are the apple rust mite (Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa)) and the {{fruit-tree red spider mite}} (Panonychus ulmi (Koch)). Reproductive success was assessed in terms of intrinsic rate of increase and for one predator also in terms of diapause induction. All three predator species reached highest reproductive success on the same prey species: apple rust mite. This was most pronounced for the predatorAm. finlandicus, because its larval stage suffered severe mortality when feeding onP. ulmi. An independent study on prey preference of the three predator species (Dicke et al., 1988) revealed thatAm. finlandicus prefersAc. schlechtendali toP. ulmi, whereas the other two predator species have the reverse preference. Thus, on the basis of current data, prey preference ofAm. finlandicus can be understood in terms of reproductive success. However, this is not so for prey preference ofT. pyri andAm. <b>potentillae.</b> Investigations needed for a better understanding of prey preference of the last-named two predator species are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{volatile}} kairomone {{emitted from}} lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) infested with the spider miteTetranychus urticae, was collected on Tenax-TA and analyzed with GC-MS.

Linalool and methyl salicylate attracted females ofAmblyseius <b>potentillae.</b> The response ofA. <b>potentillae</b> to these two kairomone components was affected by the rearing diet of the predators {{in the same way}} as was reported for the response to the natural kairomone blend: when reared on a carotenoid-deficient diet, the predators responded to the volatile kairomone ofT. urticae, but when reared on a carotenoid-containing diet they did not. The identified kairomone components are all known from the plant kingdom. They are not known to be produced by animals de novo. In addition to biological evidence, this chemical evidence suggests that the plant is involved in production of the kairomone.

40|$|The searching {{behaviour}} {{of individual}} predators of four phytoseiid species (Phytoseiulus persimilis, Amblyseius p o tentillae, Amblyseius bibens, Metaseiulus occidentalis) is investigated {{in relation to}} the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), which infests greenhouse roses. Especially the role of spider- mite webbing in the predator-prey relation is studied. Webbing interferes with searching, decreasing the rate of encounter per unit prey density. Low walking speeds and activity in webbing ensure that the predator is rarely disturbed after contact with other mites. Webbing also positively influences searching, as spider mites aggregate within the webbed area: prey density, defined here as the number of prey per square centimetre of webbed leaf area, is high, as is the rate of encounter with prey. The ability to capture a prey after tarsal contact depends on the food content of the gut, the prey-stage and, in two specific cases, the webbing; the success ratio of P. persimilis increased on a webbed substrate, that of A. <b>potentillae</b> decreased. Models to simulate rate of predation {{on the basis of the}} dynamics of the motivational state and the state dependent rate of successful encounter are proposed. The food content of the gut is chosen as an indicator of the motivational state. A stochastic queueing model simulates predation as accurately as a Monte Carlo model or a compound simulation model. The queueing model is preferred because of its economic use of computer time and the relatively few variables used. The model was validated in predation experiments. Systems analysis showed that the effect of temperature on the rate of predation is largely determined by its relation with the relative rate of food conversion into egg biomass and not by behavioural changes related to temperature. Also, it was shown that webbing has an important influence on the predation rate. A new model for the analysis of prey-stage preference is proposed. Predators invade the webbed leaf area after contact with the silk strands, irrespective of the presence of prey. The residence time in the prey colony is determined by prey density. Simulation of experimentally defined walking behaviour shows that predators remain in profitable prey patches by turning at the edge of the webbed leaf area. However, when predator density increases, the tendency to leave the prey colony also increases, even at high prey densities. Only A. <b>potentillae</b> avoided the webbed leaf area, preferring the thickest parts of the leaf ribs or other protected places on the plant. A survey of references on life history data is presented; emphasis is given to the role of food, temperature and relative humidity. Experiments by the author show that oviposition history of predatory females is a major factor in determining the actual rate of food conversion into egg biomass; and that the egg stage of the predators is very vulnerable to relative humidities below 70 %, though the evapotranspiration of the plant and the hygroscopic properties of the webbing buffer this to some extent. As the juvenile mortality of the phytoseiids increases above 30 °C, and that of the two-spotted spider mites above 35 °C, spider-mite control at temperatures above 30 °C is not effective. The four phytoseiid species are ranked on their capacities for numerical increase and predation: P. persimilis, A. bibens, M. occidentalis and A. <b>potentillae.</b> On capacity to survive on alternative foods they are ranked: A. <b>potentillae,</b> A. bibens, M. occidentalis and P. persimilis. Some trials with alternative food supply did not improve survival rates established for prevailing greenhouse conditions. The rate of increase of the webbed area per individual spider mite is quantified by experiment. This knowledge will enable continuous monitoring of the prey density during simulations of the predator-prey interactions on the population level. ...|$|R

40|$|What are infochemicals?Chemical {{compounds}} play {{an important}} role in interactions between organisms. Some of these chemicals are to the benefit (e. g. nutrients) or detriment (e. g. toxins) of an organism. Others are of benefit or detriment in an indirect way: through the behavioural response they elicit. The latter chemicals are termed infochemicals (chemicals that, in the natural context, convey information in an interaction between two individuals, evoking in the receiver a behavioural or physiological response that is adaptive to either one of the interactants or both; chapter 2). On an evolutionary time scale, the fate of an infochemical depends on selection pressures on each interactant. Selection pressure is determined by costs and benefits which result from all interactions of an organism in which the infochemical is involved. Yet, for pragmatic reasons, to analyse the function of an infochemical in the biology of an organism, a cost-benefit analysis is made for each interaction between two organisms separately. In this way the cost-benefit analysis is restricted to the smallest number of interactants possible, which ensures its simplicity. Consequently, for each interaction the infochemical is classified according to the corresponding costs and benefits for the two interactants (chapter 2; cf. Nordlund and Lewis, 1976). Moreover, classification also reflects whether the interaction under consideration is between conspecifics or between individuals of different species. This resulted in the terminology represented in Figure 1. 1 and Table 1. 1 (cf. chapter 2). Its structure and terms are based on those of semiochemicals. However, infochemical terminology differs from semiochemical terminology in two respects (chapter 2) :(1) Infochemical terminology regards compounds that convey information, whereas semiochemical terminology in addition also includes toxins (Whittaker and Feeny, 1971; Nordlund and Lewis, 1976; Nordlund, 1981). In some instances toxins or nutrients may convey information. If that is the case, these toxins and nutrients are classified as infochemicals when their role as information carrier is considered. When poisonous or nutritious aspects are considered, they are not classified as infochemicals, but as toxins and nutrients respectively. (2) Semiochemical terminology is based on origin of the compounds, in addition to the cost-benefit analysis. Although knowledge of the origin is Important to understand the interaction between two organisms, it may be very difficult to elucidate the origin (e. g. Brand et al., 1975; chapter 4). Therefore, application of the origin criterion may lead to ambiguities. Because the cost- benefit criterion by itself is good and useful, infochemical terminology is based on that criterion alone. Infochemicals in tritrophic systems. Infochemicals play a role in interactions between consecutive trophic levels (e. g plant-herbivore, phytophagous insect- entomophagous insect; Figure 1. 2) (e. g. Nordlund et al., 1981; Visser, 1986). Moreover, infochemicals may also mediate interactions between other trophic levels (e. g. plant-entomophagous insect; Figure 1. 2) (Price, 1981). Therefore, to understand the selection pressure on an organism, as a result of an infochemical, all trophic levels involved should be regarded. As a consequence, investigations of infochemicals in interactions between herbivores and their predators should also regard involvement of at least the first trophic level, the plant. The tritrophic system of this study: predatory mites, phytophagous mites and their host plants. The herbivore-predator system investigated most extensively in this thesis consists of phytophagous mites and predatory mites that occur in Dutch orchards. Figure 1. 3 a,b depicts the two most abundant phytophagous mites that occur as pest organisms in Dutch apple orchards: the apple rust mite, Aculusschlechtendali (Nalepa), and the European red spider mite, Panonychusulmi (Koch) (Van de Vrie, 1973; Van Epenhuijsen, 1981; Gruys, 1982). Several species of predatory mites occur in Dutch orchards. The most abundant of these are Typhlodromuspyri Scheuten (Figure 1. 3 c), Amblyseiusfinlandicus (Oudemans) and A. <b>potentillae</b> (Garman) (McMurtry & Van de Vrie, 1973; Overmeer, 1981; Gruys, 1982). All three species feed on P. ulmi and A. schlechtendali, as well as on other food sources such as several pollens (Overmeer, 1981; Kropczynska, 1970; Overmeer, 1985). In this system consisting of two phytophagous prey species and three predator species (Figure 1. 4 a), prey preference of the predators was investigated. Optimal foraging theory predicts that natural selection favours predators preferring prey species that are most profitable in terms of reproductive success (Krebs, 1978). Reproductive success is determined, among others, by development time, oviposition rate, mortality during development and offspring quality. Each of these components can be affected by the prey species consumed. As a first step in analysing which selection pressures may have moulded prey preference of the predatory mites in the system outlined above, I have tested whether prey preference is matched by the associated reproductive success. If this most simple explanation for prey preference does not hold, other explanations should be considered (see below). Do infochemicals play a role in prey preference ?Kairomones (Table 1. 1, Figure 1. 1) may inform predators on presence and identity of prey (Greany and Hagen, 1981) and thereby affect foraging decisions, such as where to search, how long to search at a specific site, which prey to accept and when to disperse on air currents (chapter 3). Investigation of the response to kairomones may therefore yield information on prey preference. However, the conclusion on prey preference must be restricted to the foraging phase that was studied. Relative costs involved in finding individuals of each prey species might differ for different foraging phases. Therefore, to obtain a comprehensive view of prey preference, several foraging phases should be investigated. Such analyses should be carried out independently to obtain complementary conclusions. In this study, prey preference was determined in three independent analyses. Two laboratory analyses were carried out:- Analysis of response towards volatile kairomones. This investigation regards decisions of the predators when prey individuals are not contacted, as is the situation after termination of aerial dispersal or after eradication of a prey patch. - Analysis of predation rates at different prey supplies. This relates to acceptance/rejection decisions during contacts with prey items. To complement the prey preference analyses carried out in the laboratory, an investigation was made under field conditions: - This was done by determination of diet composition by means of electrophoretic analysis of gut contents of field-collected predators. Spider-mite kairomones in a tritrophic context. Predatory mites distinguish plants infested by spider mites from clean plants by a volatile kairomone (e. g. Sabelis & Van de Baan, 1983). This kairomone seems to be a product of the interaction between plant and spider mites: after removal of spider mites from an infested plant, the plant remains attractive to the predators during several hours, whereas the mites alone do not remain attractive (Sabelis & Van de Baan, 1983; Sabelis et al., 1984 a). Current data on spider mite - predatory mite interactions do not explain the role of this infochemical in the biology of the spider mites (cf. chapter 3 for a review). It may, for instance, be an inevitable byproduct of damage inflicted on the plant by the spider mite, and/or have an indispensable function in the biology of the spider mite. Moreover, the plant may be involved in production of the infochemical. To elucidate the role of this volatile infochemical, its effects in interactions between plant and spider mite, between plant and predatory mite and between spider mites of one species should be investigated. Before this can be done, chemical identification of the infochemical is a necessary first step. These investigations were made for a tritrophic system consisting of Lima bean plants, the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychusurticae Koch and the predatory mite Phytoseiuluspersimilis Athias-Henriot (Figure 1. 4 b). This system was chosen for practical reasons. The plant and phytophagous mite can be reared throughout the year and therefore, this system is much more suitable to develop a method for the chemical analysis of spider-mite kairomones than a system in which the plant is a perennial. Origin and function of T. urticae kairomone in a tritrophic system. Two-spotted spider mites distinguish between a clean plant and a plant that is infested by conspecifics on the basis of a volatile infochemical (chapter 4). The spider mites move away from heavily infested leaves. This response is advantageous to spider mites on the infested leaf as well as to spider mites that avoid settling on these leaves: increased competition for food is avoided, cf. Wrensch and Young (1978). In addition, the spider mite that disperses thus avoids settling on a spot that has an increased risk of being detected by predatory mites (Sabelis and Van de Baan, 1983). Therefore, the infochemical in this interaction between conspecific spider mites is called a (+,+) dispersing pheromone. Biological evidence suggests that this pheromone is (at least partly) identical to the volatile kairomone to which predatory mites respond (chapter 4). Volatiles emitted from plants infested by T. urticae were identified and subsequent behavioural analyses resulted in identification of four kairomone components that attract the predatory mite P. persimilis : linalool (3, 7 -dimethyl- 1, 6 -octadiene- 3 -ol), methyl salicylate, (E) -β-ocimene (3, 7 -dimethyl- 1, 3 (E), 6 - octatriene) and 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3 (E), 7 -nonatriene.

40|$|During regular {{surveys of}} Lepidoptera {{in the coastal}} dune North Holland Dune Reserve, we {{observed}} larval cases and feeding traces typical for Coleophoridae on wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca L., Rosaceae). The spatulate or pistol shape of the cases excluded Coleophora violacea (Ström, 1783) and C. <b>potentillae</b> Elisha, 1885. According to the literature, C. albicostella (Duponchel, 1842), very rare in The Netherlands, was the only Coleophora species known to create spatulate cases on this host. We collected larval cases for DNA analysis on the larvae and for rearing, which revealed {{that none of the}} collected larvae belong to the Coleophoridae previously recorded feeding on this host, but a mixture of three other Coleophora species. We found that early instar larvae of C. lutipennella (Zeller, 1838) and C. flavipennella (Duponchel, 1843), normally feeding on oaks (Quercus spp., Fagaceae) only, may be found feeding on F. vesca in the fall. We also found that C. gryphipennella (Hübner, 1796), abundant on Rose (Rosa spp., Rosaceae) in the coastal dunes of The Netherlands, regularly feeds on F. vesca and rearing experiments proved that it can complete its larval stage on F. vesca. We therefore conclude that Fragaria is a new host genus for C. gryphipennella. After reviewing all the C. albicostella records from The Netherlands, we conclude that it is a very rare species, likely restricted to the southernmost provinces. None of the confirmed records are from reared specimens. The host range of C. albicostella in literature is possibly overestimated and may not even include Fragaria...|$|R
