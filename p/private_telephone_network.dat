50|$|A {{telephone}} {{numbering plan}} {{is a type of}} numbering scheme used in telecommunication to assign telephone numbers to subscriber telephones or other telephony endpoints. Telephone numbers are the addresses of participants in a <b>telephone</b> <b>network,</b> reachable by a system of destination code routing. Telephone numbering plans are defined in each of administrative regions of the public switched <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> (PSTN) and they are also present in <b>private</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>networks.</b> For public number systems, geographic location plays a role in the sequence of numbers assigned to each telephone subscriber.|$|R
50|$|Like {{a public}} {{telecommunications}} network, a <b>private</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> in an enterprise or within an organizational campus may implement a private numbering {{plan for the}} installed base of telephones for internal communication. Such networks operate a private switching system or a private branch exchange (PBX) within the network. The internal numbers assigned are often called extension numbers, as the internal numbering plan extends an official, published main access number for the entire network. A caller from within the network only dials the extension number assigned to another internal destination telephone.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A PBX, {{or private}} branch exchange, is a <b>private</b> <b>{{telephone}}</b> <b>network</b> used within an enterprise. The PBX telephone migration problem arises when an enterprise acquires a new PBX to replace an existing one. Phone numbers need to migrate {{from the old}} system to the new system over a time horizon. A penalty, assigned to the each pair of phones, is incurred if the pair is migrated in different time periods. The objective is to assign phones to time periods such that {{no more than a}} given number of phones is assigned to any period and the total penalty is minimized. We present a GRASP (greedy randomized adaptive search procedure) for this problem. 1...|$|E

25|$|The Telegraphy Administration {{proposed}} in 1913 that all ship radios should be {{operated by the}} agency. Motivations included a desire to accelerate installation of such systems, difficulties controlling systems, which {{was at the time}} a problem with shortcomings on <b>private</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>networks,</b> and to avoid private monopolies. The proposal was dismissed by the government For the coast stations there were no proposals of permitting private installations. Funding was kept down, as it was competing with grants to expand the telephony network. Lack of coast stations caused ship-owners to not install ship radios, which again caused the authorities to down-prioritize construction of coast stations.|$|R

At {{the end of}} 1930, the loans from the public body to local authorities allowed {{for the creation of}} a national <b>telephone</b> <b>network.</b> Nowadays, Caisse des Dépôts is investing in fast and superfast broadband infrastructure in France. In 2000, Caisse des Dépôts was entrusted with the creation of the cyberbase programme, the aim of which was to deploy digital public spaces over the entire French territory to encourage the development of Internet use and new information technology. Since 2003, it has been investing in the spread of Digital Work Spaces (ENT) which offers digital services to educational institutions (schools, secondary schools and universities).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical proposition {{for the application}} of the Linear Programming quantitative method in order to assist planning and control of customer circuit delivery activities in telecommunications companies working with the corporative market. Based upon data provided for by a telecom company operating in Brazil, the Linear Programming method was employed for one of the classical problems of determining the optimum mix of production quantities for a set of five products of that company: <b>Private</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Network,</b> Internet Network, Intranet Network, Low Speed Data Network, and High Speed Data Network, in face of several limitations of the productive resources, seeking to maximize the company’s monthly revenue. By fitting the production data available into a primary model, observation was made as to what number of monthly activations for each product would be mostly optimized in order to achieve maximum revenues in the company. The final delivery of a complete network was not observed but the delivery of the circuits that make it up, and this was a limiting factor for the study herein, which, however, brings an innovative proposition for the planning of private telecommunications network provisioning. </strong...|$|E

50|$|In 1985, The Great Northern Telegraph Company {{changed its}} name to GN Store Nord (GN = Great Nordic) with the aim of {{creating}} a new group identity and organizing its businesses. In this process, all subsidiaries were renamed to include GN: GN Danavox, GN NetTest, GN Automatic etc. A major change happened in 1991 when GN was assigned the attractive GMS concession from the national Danish telecommunication authorities. In March 1992, GN's new subsidiary Sonofon opened the first <b>private</b> mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> in Denmark. Although GN was not the only investor in Sonofon, it owned the majority of the shares. With the blossoming of the data communications and telephony industry, and a charismatic CEO Jørgen Lindegaard, GN was back on track and enjoyed massive success in the late 1990s. In 2000, the company sold Sonofon to Norwegian telecom operator Telenor for a price of DKK 14,7 billion. A large amount was invested in the GN subsidiary NetTest, which had evolved from the former Elmi and considered GN’s prospective core business. It was decided to let NetTest acquire the French company Photonetics for a price of DKK 9,1 billion. The optimistic view of the future was also reflected in the share price which had increased fivefold in only one year from September 1, 1999 to September 1, 2000. The focus and investment in NetTest, however, resulted in a serious downturn since GN had misjudged the market development of NetTest’s products. In 2001, net profit ended at DKK -9,2 billion followed by a share price decline equivalent to previous years’ gains. Thereby major parts of the yield from Sonofon was lost within one year, and shareholders were raging in the media and at the annual general meeting.|$|R

50|$|The 300 {{series was}} much more than just the Tele. 332. There was a whole range of {{similarly}} designed products. Fieldsets (Tappers), Headsets, Pendant Telephones, Wall Phones and the House Exchange System. Many <b>Private</b> <b>Telephone</b> Companies had sprung up in the UK. As these were banned by law from connecting to external lines, they contented themselves with producing systems for automatically dialling between company offices, within the same building or, via private wires, rented from the GPO, virtually anywhere. The GPO could only do this via PMBXs (manual switchboards), ranging from the 2 to 5 line cordless boards, via the 25 and 50 line plug and cord boards to the mighty PMBX 1A, which, with its modular construction, could be any size a large company might require. The GPO regarded the <b>Private</b> <b>Telephone</b> Companies as a thorn in their flesh and a great loss of potential income. They decided to tap into this lucrative market. Initially they produced a system virtually identical to the competition and called it the House Telephone System. This appeared, from the rear, like a Tele. 332 but the front sloped down and was covered in two rows of buttons, by which a few other, similar, extensions could be called. Like the competition this system was entirely internal and could not connect to the PSTN (Public Service <b>Telephone</b> <b>Network).</b> Unlike the competition, however, the number of extensions which could be incorporated was strictly limited. The GPO tried again.|$|R
