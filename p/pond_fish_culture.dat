Fermented fish processing is an artisinal activity and the processes used differ from one country to another. Three basic methods are identified in the report: fermentation with salting and drying; fermentation and drying without salting: and fermentation with salting but no drying. Fermented fish is used in Africa both as a condiment and as a food. These products contribute to protein intake of the people, particularly in the rural hinterland where fresh fish is not readily available. Curing by fermentation was found to be an important method of preservation because poor quality fish or unpopular species are usually processed in this way, which utilizes fish that would otherwise have been thrown away. In the light of the observations made some recommendations have been suggested in the book to improve quality in order to enhance intra-regional trade in fish and fishery products.

This study lends support to the thesis that marine fish culture is generally more sustainable than <b>pond</b> <b>fish</b> <b>culture,</b> owing to the fact that oceanic resources are relatively less scarce than land resources - even though the transaction costs of delineating and enforcing private property in the former are much higher. The case study gives a brief historical account of the evolution of the freshwater food fish and marine food fish culture industries in Hong Kong, identifies the technical inputs constraining the survival and prospects of these industries, and evaluates the relevance of the private property rights approach to their sustainability. Examination of the culture industries reveals the differences in property right characteristics of both industries. In addition to the differentiation in the degree of privatization between freshwater food fish and marine food fish culture, the major characteristics and inputs for culture practices in both industries are also examined. A qualitative evaluation of the relative significance of these inputs to the sustainability of the culture industries is provided.

Simultaneously, intensive Tilapia tank culture was developed to a pilot commercial scale. A small nature trail has also been set up with tortoises, hippopotamus, crocodiles, waterbucks, antelopes, and numerous other wild animals as well as plenty of birds. A small herd of oryx and elands is also successfully reared while snail, earthworm and wild fowl production experiments are under way. The principes adopted here constitute a very impressive example of how man can correct the environmental damage he is making, and that reafforestation and rehabilitation programmes can be effective under near desert like conditions...|$|R
