50|$|Amblyeleotris randalli, Randall's <b>prawn</b> <b>goby,</b> is {{a marine}} benthic species of goby native to {{tropical}} reefs {{of the central}} Indo-Pacific. This species {{can also be found}} in the aquarium trade.|$|E
50|$|Amblyeleotris steinitzi, Steinitz' <b>prawn</b> <b>goby</b> {{or simply}} Steinitz' goby, is {{a species of}} small fish in the family Gobiidae. It lives in {{association}} with an alpheid shrimp and is found from the Red Sea through the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Alpheus randalli {{was first}} {{described}} in 1981 from the Marquesas Islands in the Indian Ocean {{where it was}} found living {{at a depth of}} 18 m in association with a previously undescribed species of goby in the genus Amblyeleotris. This has now been given the name Randall's <b>prawn</b> <b>goby</b> (Amblyeleotris randalli).|$|E
50|$|Cryptocentrus {{also known}} as Watchman gobies, {{and one of the}} genera known as shrimp <b>gobies</b> or <b>prawn</b> <b>gobies,</b> is a genus of gobies native to {{tropical}} marine waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|R
50|$|The fauna that {{inhabit the}} waters of the island include scads, yellow tail barracudas, and jacks. Other fauna include blacktip sharks, giant clams, claw anemone fishes, {{decorator}} and spider crabs, coral shrimps, nudibranchs, <b>prawn</b> <b>gobies,</b> seahorses, ghost pipefish, flying gurnards, parrotfishes, rays and guitarfish. The indigenous plants include casuarina trees and pandan screwpine.|$|R
50|$|Amblyeleotris is a genus {{of fish in}} {{the family}} Gobiidae found {{throughout}} the Indo-Pacific region. This is the largest genus of the shrimp <b>gobies</b> or <b>prawn</b> <b>gobies,</b> so-called because of their symbiotic relationship with certain alpheid shrimps. The shrimp excavates and maintains a burrow used by both animals while the goby, which has far superior eyesight, acts as a lookout for predators. The shrimp maintains almost constant contact with the fish with an antenna.These species vary considerably in size from less than 30 mm to almost 200 mm standard length.|$|R
5000|$|Mahidolia mystacina (the flagfin <b>prawn</b> <b>goby,</b> flagfin shrimpgoby or smiling goby) is {{a species}} of goby native to the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean from Delagoa Bay, Mozambique to the Society Islands and from {{southern}} Japan to Samoa and northern Australia. This species occurs in marine and brackish waters, being found in coastal bays, estuaries and reef bases where the bottom is silty or muddy at depths of from 5 to 25 m. This species is a commensal with {{a species of}} alpheid shrimp, using its burrow as its home. This species can reach a length of 8 cm TL. This species {{can also be found}} in the aquarium trade. It is currently the only known member of its genus.|$|E
40|$|MSc (Zoology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Estuaries {{are among}} the most {{productive}} and diverse of aquatic habitats supporting a rich variety of plants and animals. They are nursery areas for many species of fish harvested by recreational and subsistence anglers. The Swartkops River Estuary (SRE) is situated approximately 10 km north-east of Port Elizabeth and the only major well-preserved estuary within a city, thus unique to South Africa. The SRE is surrounded by highly urbanized and industrialized regions in the Eastern Cape. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine and interpret the presence, levels, and distribution of selected priority pollutants in the food web of the SRE. Different components within the SRE were analysed for the presence of environmental contaminants. Seven sites were selected, some coinciding with previous studies in the SRE. Three of these sites are major discharge points that discharge directly into the estuary. Sediment, mud <b>prawn,</b> sand <b>gobies,</b> bird eggs, and various fish species were analysed. Samples were collected in the middle and lower reaches of the estuary, the areas known to receive major pollution loads from neighbouring sources. Heavy metals found in the sediments were compared to previous studies. Bottom sediments and organisms surrounding major discharge points showed higher concentrations of pollutants and compared to previous studies, these concentrations seem to be increasing. Due to biomagnification, higher concentrations were generally found in the top predators although certain elements did not show this trend. Some heavy metal concentrations found in the fish exceeded of the food guidelines and may in turn pose a threat for subsistence users of the SRE. There are indications of multiple different pollution sources. Bird eggs had detectable quantities of polychlorinated biphenyls, but its implications need more investigation. Master...|$|R
50|$|The Indus dolphin has the long, pointed nose {{characteristic}} of all river dolphins. The teeth are visible {{in both the}} upper and lower jaws even when the mouth is closed. The teeth of young animals are almost an inch long, thin and curved; however, as animals age the teeth undergo considerable changes and in mature adults become square, bony, flat disks. The snout thickens towards its end. The species does not have a crystalline eye lens, rendering it effectively blind, although it may still be able to detect the intensity and direction of light. Navigation and hunting are carried out using echolocation. The body is a brownish color and stocky at the middle. The species has a small triangular lump in place of a dorsal fin. The flippers and tail are thin and large in relation to the body size, which is about 2-2.2 meters in males and 2.4-2.6 meters in females. The oldest recorded animal was a 28-year-old male 199 centimeters in length. Mature adult females are larger than males. Sexual dimorphism is expressed after females reach about 150 cm; the female rostrum continues to grow after the male rostrum stops growing, eventually reaching approximately 20 cm longer. Calves have been observed between January and May and do not appear to stay with the mother {{for more than a few}} months. Gestation is thought to be approximately 9-10 months.The species feeds on a variety of crustaceans and fish, including <b>prawns,</b> carp, catfish, <b>gobies,</b> etc.|$|R
