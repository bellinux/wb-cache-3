We evaluate two representations, namely, singular value decomposition and spherical harmonics for their representation accuracy, storage efficiency, and real-time reconstruction of point light fields. We have applied our algorithms to both real-world and synthetic <b>point</b> <b>based</b> models.

50|$|When {{using an}} Ethernet or ADSL home {{backhaul}} connection, an Access <b>Point</b> <b>Base</b> Station must either share the backhaul bandwidth with other services, such as Internet browsing, gaming consoles, set-top boxes and triple-play equipment in general, or alternatively directly replace these functions within an integrated unit.

50|$|In 1976 Intel began {{planning}} {{to produce a}} floating point coprocessor. John Palmer, {{the manager of the}} effort, persuaded them that they should try to develop a standard for all their floating point operations. William Kahan was hired as a consultant; he had helped improve the accuracy of Hewlett-Packard's calculators. Kahan initially recommended that the floating <b>point</b> <b>base</b> be decimal but the hardware design of the coprocessor was too far along to make that change.|$|E

50|$|More {{recent work}} has {{developed}} the concept towards a head unit containing {{not only a}} picocell, but also many of {{the functions of the}} BSC and some of the MSC. This form of picocell is sometimes called an access <b>point</b> <b>base</b> station or 'enterprise femtocell'. In this case, the unit contains all the capability required to connect directly to the Internet, without the need for the BSC/MSC infrastructure. This is potentially a more cost-effective approach.|$|E
50|$|Access <b>Point</b> <b>Base</b> Stations {{are also}} required, since {{carrying}} voice calls, {{to provide a}} 911 (or 999, 112, etc.) emergency service, {{as is the case}} for VoIP phone providers in some jurisdictions. This service must meet the same requirements for availability as current wired telephone systems. Simply the phones must work if the AC mains grid is blacked out. There are several ways to achieve this, such as alternative power sources or fall-back to existing telephone infrastructure.|$|E

He is later the sole survivor of that group of scientists that escaped in the relic, along with the Segawa siblings and Agito Makishima's aids, after the destruction of the Relic's <b>point</b> <b>base.</b> The scientists were infected by a deadly virus as Cronos' means of keeping them under control. The only way to escape death is to be supplied with regular shots or to become Zoanoids. The only way to become a Zoanoid and yet not be slaves to the Zoalords is to become a Lost Number. Since supplies of the medicine were running out, they resorted to attempt to becoming Lost Numbers. Hayami was the only scientist that survived the process, becoming [...] "Bio-Freezer". He possesses the unique power to affect the temperature of the environment around him to a certain extent. Aptom finds him and, once he realizes what Hayami is, brings him to meet the Guyvers and their friends. Unfortunately, later on his mission with Sho to save Aptom from the three rogue Zoa Lords, he sacrifices himself to save the latter, knowing {{that he was going to}} die anyway, due to flaws in the make-shift optimization process.|$|E

50|$|Other {{regulatory}} issues {{relate to}} the requirement in most countries for the operator of a network {{to be able to}} show exactly where each base-station is located, and for E911 requirements to provide the registered location of the equipment to the emergency services. There are issues in this regard for access <b>point</b> <b>base</b> stations sold to consumers for home installation, for example. Further, a consumer might try to carry his base station with him to a country where it is not licensed. Some manufacturers are using GPS within the equipment to lock the femtocell when it is moved to a different country; this approach is disputed , as GPS is often unable to obtain position indoors because of weak signal.|$|E
