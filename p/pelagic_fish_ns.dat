40|$|Approximately 90 {{per cent}} of total catches in {{northern}} Sulawesi are <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishes.</b> About two-third {{of them are}} large <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> such as tunas (Katsuwonus, Thunnus, Euthynnus). However the National Assessment Stock Commission reported that availability of the large <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishes</b> in Sulawesi and Maluku Sea is just {{about one-third of the}} total <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> resources. Even in the last report the large <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishes</b> in the region are indicating nearly overexploited. In contras, small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> such as mackerel scads, travellies, sardine, needlefish, Indian mackerel, and flyingfish is less than 40 per cent of the total allowable catch (TAC) exploited. Fishing activities on large <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> by means of pole and line, longline etc. are mainly conducted by fishing industries based in the area of Bitung.

40|$|Small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> are termed “wasp-waist” {{species as}} they {{dominate}} mid trophic levels and comprise relatively few species but attain large abundances that can vary drastically in size. They {{have been found}} to exert top-down control on their prey species and bottom-up control on their predators and, in this way, appear to induce unsuspected ecosystem dynamics. Largely based on model results, this chapter explores these effects and associated dynamics, not only illustrating the importance of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> in structuring marine ecosystems, but also revealing the consistency of the role of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> across various upwelling systems in which they play key roles. The Northern and Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt, South Catalan Sea and North and Central Adriatic Sea ecosystems are compared in terms of the importance and role of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> using information gained from landings and ecological models. Trophic level of the catch, the Fishing-in-Balance (FiB) index and the ratio of pelagic:demersal fish are calculated from reported landings. Sums of all flows to detritus are compared across modelled ecosystems. Models of the Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt and South Catalan Sea are used to perform two simulations: (1) closure of fisheries on small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> and (2) collapse of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> stocks, to further explore the roles of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> in the dynamics of these ecosystems.

40|$|The {{consumption}} {{of fish in}} Croatia is relatively low for a Mediterranean country. One {{of the main reasons}} for this is the inadequate supply of fish. The supply of fish is usually limited to expensive species of whitefish, while the supply of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> is very scarce. <b>Pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> can rarely be found in restaurants, and in the fish- markets it reaches very high prices. The basic goal of the project "Srdela Snack" (srdela - Croatian word for sardine) was to set up and test a new model of commercialization of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> through franchise "fast - food" outlets. In the paper we will describe the concept of this new model which includes the whole distribution channel, from fishermen, through processors, restaurants to consumers. In this model fishermen supply fresh <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> to approved restaurant s (members of the franchise) which prepare the fish according to traditional recipes. In this way a completely new product is introduced in the Croatian market. The main idea was to offer a high- quality, simple and convenient meals made of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> from the Croatian Adriatic. This model of commercialization of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> was tested through a pilot project. In the pilot project the standards of food quality were determined, the traditional recipes for preparing the food were selected, and the menu, consisting entirely of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> dishes was made. Finally, the logo of the franchise restaurant was designed. The test restaurant was opened in the summer 2004. The visitors of the restaurant participated in a survey which was used to determine the degree of their satisfaction with the new product and the new model of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> commercialization. The results of the survey showed that there is a strong demand for <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> in the Croatian market. Most of the interviewed consumers liked the new product; they consider it very healthy, affordable, tasty, and typical for Mediterranean and Croatia. Fishermen and restaurant - owners also showed a great interest for this new model of commercialization because it could provide them with a bigger income. Since the results of the pilot project showed that this kind of innovation in the distribution channel is very successful, this model of franchise restaurants offering <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> "fast - food" can be implemented on the national level.

The indicator that used to estimate {{the presence of the}} fish was to looked at the sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a. The aim of this study were to see the relation between chlorophyll-a and the catch of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishes,</b> to see the relation of sea surface temperature and the small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> catches, and to determine the potential fishing ground of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> in Pidie Jaya waters. The concentration of chlorophyll-a and SST obtained from MODIS satellite by using SeaDas processing software. The data result of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishes</b> catches was obtained by observed the landed fish in PPI Meureudu, Pidie Jaya district. The total small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> catches on February and March 2016 reached 35. 258 kg. Relation between the catches and chlorophyll-a showed the higher concentration of chlorophyll-a tends to increased the catch of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> as it proved the phytoplankton play the important role as the main producer in ocean food chain, whereas the SST had no effect the catches, because the fish has a preferred temperature. The potential fishing ground during February and March 2016 showed at point A, B and E, while potential fishing ground on February and March 2016 occured on point C and D, and less potential on point F.

40|$|Mid-water baited remote {{underwater}} video systems (BRUVS) {{are becoming}} an increasingly popular tool for examining <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> assemblages in a non-destructive, fisheries independent manner. As {{the technique is}} relatively novel, critical methodological questions such as the most appropriate attractant for <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> to mid-water RUVS remain unresolved. In this study, we compared the relative effectiveness of 4 attractant treatments (sight: metallic reflectors, sound: bait fish recordings, scent: pilchards and their combination) {{on the time of}} first arrival, total abundance of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> and the relative abundance of 3 <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> species: Trachurus novaezelandiae, Sarda australis and Seriola lalandi. Recordings were made using mid-water RUVS in the Jervis Bay Marine Park, Australia. RUVS using a combination of all attractants recorded the highest abundances and shortest time of first arrival of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish.</b> This result was primarily driven by Trachurus novaezelandiae. Although not significant, the abundance of Sarda australis was also greatest on the RUVS with all attractants. In contrast, the type of attractant had no effect on the abundance of Seriola lalandi. Bait, the standard attractant used in BRUVS surveys, was a poor performer for <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> in all instances.

Small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> distribution was spatially correlated with simultaneous, continuous,high-resolution measurements of 4 m depth temperature, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll a, and dissolved oxygen to characterize water and habitat conditions. Small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> shoals were concentrated in five areas of northern and central parts of the gulf, {{along the coast of}} Sonora, and south of Isla Tiburón. About 62 % of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> abundance and 57 % of the biomass was echo-detected during the night, when small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fish</b> tend to assemble near the surface. Fish abundance in these areas (11, 210 km 2) was estimated at 6. 16 °— 109 individuals. Echo-integrated median biomass was 2. 6 °— 105 t.
