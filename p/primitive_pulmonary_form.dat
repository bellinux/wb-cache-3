40|$|Acute {{dyspnoea}} is {{a common}} symptom in the Emergency Room and differential diagnosis between cardiogenic and <b>primitive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>forms</b> is not always straightforward. The main fundamental elements used for differential diagnosis are medical history and physical examination, plus standard chest x-ray. The advantages and limits of radiological evidence are described, in particular its good specificity but poor sensibility, with a possible absence of congestion signs in up to one third of patients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure higher than 30 mm H 2 O. In addition, the radiological differences between cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and ARDS type oedema can be slight and difficult to interpret. Emergency Room physicians can now use new techniques. These are considered and described: BNP or NT pro-BNP biomarker assay and transthoracic ultrasound, evaluated {{in the light of}} recent literature. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is produced by myocardiocytes under stress and rises in cases of decompensated heart failure, which is useful in differential diagnosis between cardiogenic and pulmonary dyspnoea. Low values ( 500 for BNP and > 1000 for Ntpro-BNP), on the contrary, suggest a cardiogenic origin in the absence of septic shock. The limit of this method is the vast grey area of little differential use. Transthoracic ultrasound offers several advantages in that it is relatively easy, quick to learn and conduct and non-invasive. Ultrasound comet-tail images correlate well with interstitial alveolar syndrome and therefore with the presence of extravascular water. Sensitivity and specificity are both high (86. 7 % and 93 %, respectively) in diagnosing alveolar-interstitial syndrome. The technique’s main limit is that the presence of extravascular water does not help differential diagnosis between cardiogenic and injury-related pulmonary oedema. Despite being useful and valid, the new techniques are still inadequate and must therefore be considered a further element of support as part of an integrated evaluation procedur...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis {{anatomical}} classification {{is inconsistent}} in the literature, which limits current tuberculosis knowledge and control. We aimed {{to evaluate whether}} tuberculosis classification impacts on treatment outcomes at patient and aggregate level. We analyzed adults from São Paulo State, Brazil with newly diagnosed tuberculosis from 2010 - 2013. We used an extended clinical classification of tuberculosis, categorizing cases as pulmonary, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, extrapulmonary and miliary/disseminated. Our primary outcome was unsuccessful outcome of treatment. To investigate the reported treatment outcome at the aggregate level, we sampled 500 different "countries" from the dataset and compared the impact of pulmonary and extrapulmonary classifications on the reported treatment success. Of 62, 178 patients, 49, 999 (80. 4 %) were pulmonary, 9, 026 (14. 5 %) extrapulmonary, 1, 651 (2. 7 %) pulmonary-extrapulmonary and 1, 502 (2. 4 %) miliary/disseminated. Pulmonary-extrapulmonary cases had similar unsuccessful outcome of treatment compared with pulmonary (adjusted-OR 1. 00, 95 %CI, 0. 88 - 1. 13, p = 0. 941), while extrapulmonary were associated with better (adjusted-OR 0. 65, 95 %CI, 0. 60 - 0. 71, p< 0. 001) and miliary/disseminated with worse outcomes (adjusted-OR 1. 51, 95 %CI, 1. 33 - 1. 71, p< 0. 001). We found that 60 (12 %) countries would report a difference ≥ 10 % in treatment success depending on whether they reported all clinical forms together (current WHO recommendation) or <b>pulmonary</b> <b>forms</b> alone, overestimating the treatment success of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>forms.</b> The expanded anatomical classification of tuberculosis was strongly associated with treatment outcomes at the patient level.

40|$|ABSTRACTImmigrants are a {{tuberculosis}} risk group.

Immigrants with tuberculosis corresponded to 24. 5 % of all cases, 71. 4 % male, 93. 9 % black and mostly native from Cabo Verde and Angola. 73 % lived in Portugal for more then 5 years, 86. 7 % were new cases and 13. 3 % relapses. 174 were <b>pulmonary</b> <b>forms,</b> 70. 7 % of wich were D+ and 81 % confirmed (against 75 % in the non-immigrants).

The causative agent is, in most cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Genital tuberculosis is a cause of infertility. The definitive diagnosis is made by biology or histology.

40|$|Clinical mapping studies {{demonstrate}} that cardiac arrhythmias are often encountered at specific anatomical sites. The anatomical {{development of the}} heart and the cardiac conduction system are narrowly related. The thesis starts with a Chapter 1 that provides a general overview of the basics of cardiac development, development of the cardiac conduction system, markers for the developing cardiac conduction system and anatomical predilection sites for the occurrence of clinical arrhythmias. Next, attention is focused on clinical arrhythmias in adults in relation to cardiac anatomy, the treatment of these arrhythmias and imaging techniques used to visualise the substrate. Subsequently, in part I (Chapter 2 - 4) of the thesis, a developmental origin of clinical arrhythmias is hypothesized. The developing cardiac conduction system is studied and a developmental origin of clinical arrhythmias is hypothesized based on the spatial expression pattern of the conduction system marker CCS-lacZ in murine embryos. Furthermore, incorporation of the <b>primitive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vein in the left atrium is studied in sequential developmental stages in humans. In part II (Chapter 5 - 10), the treatment of clinical arrhythmias that are initiated and/or perpetuated at specific anatomical locations in the heart (particularly the pulmonary veins) guided by imaging techniques for visualisation of the substrate, is described.
