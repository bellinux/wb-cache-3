50|$|The Foundress {{starts a}} colony by {{constructing}} an egg cell in a cavity usually below the ground (aerial nests exist, {{but they are}} rare). The queen covers the egg cell with a <b>protective</b> <b>wax</b> coating. This foundress (also known as the solitary gyne) must assume complete responsibility before the first workers are spawned; she looks after the brood, and forages for the necessary nectar and pollen that are deposited into the feeding pockets that she attaches to larval clusters. Eventually the eggs of this initial brood mature into {{the first set of}} workers. Once this happens, the queen only rarely leaves the nest. The queen’s main job shifts to laying and incubating eggs.

40|$|The cuticle, a layer {{that covers}} the fruit epidermis, has a {{protective}} function against environmental stresses such as wind, temperature, chemicals and drought, not only when the fruit {{is attached to the}} plant, but also after harvest. Some postharvest procedures may influence the external layers of the fruit, like the cuticle. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of brushing in a classifying machine on the cuticles of apples under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two experiments were conducted to test brushing on the cultivars Fuji and Gala using heavy and smooth brushes. The experiments consisted of three replicates of three apples each, with three samples taken from the equatorial area of the fruit to be analyzed under SEM. The brushes of the classifying machine altered the cuticular layer, dragging it, modifying the structure and removing crystalloids of the cuticular wax layer, and forming cracks. There were no differences between the effects of the two types of brushes tested on the cuticles of the apples.

In this study, we evaluate the presence of E. brasiliensis-associated EF in soil and the virulence of a ground pearl-derived strain of Isaria fumosorosea against cysts under laboratory conditions. EF were not identified on cysts in an initial survey performed in a grape-producing area in southern Brazil. However, 6 % of mobile females that had emerged from cysts were infected by Metarhizium brunneum, {{which was the first}} report of this insect pathogen on ground pearls in Brazil. Cysts without the <b>protective</b> <b>wax</b> layer were inoculated with I. fumosorosea conidia suspension by immersion. The symptoms and the signs of the disease were described. Infected cysts had a yellow-ochre color and ?hard-boiled egg? consistency when broken, in contrast to the intense bright yellow color and ?raw egg? consistency of living cysts. Vegetative fungal cells were present inside symptomatic cysts, and later, outside conidiation was visible. The LC 25 for the cysts protected with the wax layer and also inoculated by immersion was 1. 31 x 107 conidia·mL- 1. However, the presence of fungal structures was not observed on symptomatic individuals.

40|$|Abstract Background In the {{treatment}} of human head lice infestation, healthcare providers are increasingly concerned about lice becoming resistant to existing pesticide treatments. Traditional pesticides, used to control these pests, have a neurological mechanism of action. This publication describes a topical solution with a non-traditional mechanism of action, based on physical disruption of the wax layer that covers the cuticle of the louse exoskeleton. This topical solution has been shown clinically to cure 82 % of patients with only a 10 -minute treatment time, repeated once after 7 [*]days. All insects, including human head lice, have a wax-covered exoskeleton. This wax, composed of hydrocarbons, provides the insect with protection against water loss and is therefore critical to its survival. When the <b>protective</b> <b>wax</b> is disrupted, water loss becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, leading to dehydration and death. A specific pattern of hydrocarbons {{has been found in}} all of the head louse cuticular wax studied. Iso-octane effectively removes these hydrocarbons from human head lice’s cuticular wax. Methods A method of head louse cuticle wax extraction and analysis by gas chromatography was developed. Human head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) were collected from infested patients and subjected to any of three extraction solvents comprising either the test product or one of two solvents introduced as controls. A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) was used to determine the presence of hydrocarbons in the three head lice extracts. Results In the study reported herein, the test product isopropyl myristate/cyclomethicone D 5 (IPM/D 5) was shown to perform comparably with iso-octane, effectively extracting the target hydrocarbons from the cuticular wax that coats the human head louse exoskeleton. Conclusions Disruption of the integrity of the insect cuticle by removal of specific hydrocarbons found in the cuticular wax appears to offer a mechanism for killing lice without the likelihood of encountering genetic resistance. </p...|$|E

40|$|Phegopteris connectilis is an apogamous species, {{endangered}} {{in certain}} regions. The ex situ conservation, through the in vitro {{production of the}} gametophyte, {{as well as the}} embryos and the plants, followed by their cryo-stocking, is necessary for ensuring the survival of the endangered species, while at pace with international methodology. The differentiation of the gametophyte is characteristic of the leptosporangiate ferns, passing through the following stages: prothallic filament, prothallic blade, cordate prothallus. The uni- or pluri-serial branchings formed on the gametophytes constitute the initial differentiation stage of a new prothallus. One-cell trichomes are differentiated on the gametophyte, which produce <b>wax,</b> <b>protective</b> against de-hydration. The in vitro culture has evinced the fast life cycle of this species, as the apogamous embryo is formed in the course of only seven weeks after culture inception. The first protophylles are formed out of the apogamous embryo and the initial stem cell is differentiated between the first two. In very few cases, however, it was noticed, {{at the base of the}} first leaf, the differentiation of the first root; the latter is formed at a stage when the young sporophyte already has two to three protophylles, as rhizogenesis is favoured by the addition of AIA and Kin in the medium.

40|$|Textile UV-radiation sensors {{has lately}} been {{introduced}} {{to the field of}} smart textiles. Inkjet printing has been used as means of application due to the effective and resource efficient process. UV-LED radiation curing has been used in combination with inkjet printing in favour of low energy requirements, solvent free solution and reduced risk of clogging in the print heads. The problems arising when exposing photochromic prints to UV-radiations are that oxygen inhibition during the curing and photo-oxidation in the print reduces the prints ability to develop colour. It is the oxygen in the air in combination with UV-radiation that gives the photo-oxidating behavior. The aim of the study is to with the aid of physical protection reduce the effect of oxygen inhibition and photo-oxidation in the prints. Three types of physical treatments were used, wax coating, protein based impregnation and starch based impregnation. Treatments were applied before curing as well as after curing and the colour development after activation during 1 min of UV-radiation was measured with a spectrophotometer. Multiple activations were also tested to see how the treatments affected the fatigue behaviour of the prints over time. The aim was to have as high colour development as possible reflecting reduced oxygen inhibition and photo-oxidation. Results showed significantly higher colour development for samples treated with wax and whey powder before curing, but reduced colour development for amylose impregnation. Over time whey powder before curing showed highest colour development due to highest initial colour development. Lowest fatigue was seen for washed samples containing the chemical stabiliser HALS, showing an increased colour development. In reference to earlier studies the <b>protective</b> properties of <b>wax</b> and whey powder is due to their oxygen barrier properties protecting the print. The tested treatments have shown {{that it is possible to}} reduce the effect of photo-oxidation during curing leading to prints giving higher colour development. This gives a great stand point when improving existing and future application of photochromic prints on textiles...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Planococcus citri (Risso) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), {{the citrus}} mealybug, {{is a highly}} {{destructive}} pest of citrus in South Africa. The ability of mealybugs to develop resistance to chemicals, {{as well as their}} cryptic nature and <b>protective</b> <b>wax</b> coverings, all individually and combined, impair the ability of insecticides to control them. Furthermore, chemicals deplete natural enemy populations that usually establish control over mealybug populations well before harvest in March to May. The inability of chemicals to control P. citri successfully and the growing public awareness of the detrimental environmental effects and health risks that are associated with pesticides are pressuring citrus growers to find alternative methods to chemical control. Entomopathogenic nematodes of the Rhabditida order, belonging either to the families Heterorhabditidae or Steinernematidae, have proven to be valuable biocontrol agents of a variety of insect pest species. These nematodes are, however, not yet commercially available in South Africa. Various laboratory bioassays were conducted to determine the potential of entomopathogenic nematodes to control P. citri. Adult female P. citri were screened for susceptibility to six indigenous nematode species. Planococcus citri was found to be most susceptible to Steinernema yirgalemense and Heterorhabditis zealandica, causing 97 % and 91 % mortality, respectively. Both H. zealandica and S. yirgalemense completed their life cycles inside adult female P. citri. Under optimal conditions, H. zealandica and S. yirgalemense, at an application rate of 170 infective juveniles (IJs) / insect (LD 90), were able to control P. citri efficiently with a discriminating dosage of 11 (LD 50). The water activity (aw) bioassay indicated that S. yirgalemense was two times more tolerant to lower levels of free water than H. zealandica, with aw 50 = 0. 96 and aw 90 = 0. 99, compared to H. zealandica with aw 50 = 0. 98 and aw 90 = 1. 01. Furthermore, S. yirgalemense proved able to locate and infect P. citri at a faster rate than H. zealandica. Nematode activity was not significantly affected when exposed to 15 °C, 20 °C and 25 °C. Results of the exposure trial also showed that the first 2 − 4 h post-application was the most decisive time for establishing successful infection of mealybugs. Further experiments were conducted to determine the ability of two polymer products, Zeba® and Xanthan gum, and a surfactant, Nu-Film-P®, to improve nematode application suspensions. Despite not being as effective as Xanthan gum, Zeba® still retarded sedimentation significantly. The addition of 0. 02 % Xanthan gum did not improve the ability of nematodes to control P. citri at 60 % and 80 % relative humidity containing H. zealandica and 0. 03 % Zeba® increased mortality by 14 % at 60 % RH and by 22 % at 80 % RH. The same polymer formulation was tested with S. yirgalemense, with mortality being found to have increased by 21 % at 60 % RH and by 27 % at 80 % RH. The combined addition of Nu-Film-P® and Zeba® was able to retard sedimentation significantly, increasing the average number of nematodes deposited on 2 -cm 2 leaf discs. To illustrate those factors that should be taken into consideration before applying nematodes in an integrated pest management (IPM) programme for citrus, the compatibility of H. zealandica and S. yirgalemense with biological control agents and agrochemicals to which they {{are most likely to be}} exposed was determined. Bioassays showed the coccinellid beetle, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, to be susceptible to both nematode species. Beetle larvae proved to be highly susceptible, with H. zealandica obtaining 80 %, and S. yirgalemense obtaining 92 % control. Adult beetles were found to be twice as susceptible to S. yirgalemense, with 64 % mortality recorded, as to H. zealandica, with 30 % mortality recorded. Tolerance of H. zealandica and S. yirgalemense infective juveniles to the affect of aqueous solutions of an insecticide (Cyperphos 500 E. C. ®), two biopesticides (CryptogranTM and HelicovirTM), and two adjuvants (Nu-Film-P® and Zeba®) on the infectivity and survival of H. zealandica and S. yirgalemense was evaluated. Heterorhabditis zealandica proved to be highly compatible with all products tested. Significant increase in mortality of S. yirgalemense was recorded after 12 h exposure to CryptogranTM, HelicovirTM and Cyperphos 500 E. C. ®, and after 6 h exposure to Nu-Film-P®. However, there was no decrease in the ability of S. yirgalemense to infect the insect hosts. Towards selecting the appropriate nematode species for field studies, the ability of S. yirgalemense and H. zealandica to control P. citri was first evaluated under less harsh simulated glasshouse conditions. The ability of both the above-mentioned nematode species to control P. citri, with and without the addition of 0. 03 % Zeba® and 0. 06 % Nu-Film-P®, was evaluated in a growth chamber at 75 ± 8 % relative humidity and 22 °C. All treatments resulted in significantly higher mortality of adult female P. citri than did the control. The addition of 0. 03 % Zeba® and 0. 06 % Nu-Film-P® to an H. zealandica and an S. yirgalemense suspension increased resultant mortality from 26 % to 30 %, and from 34 % to 45 %, respectively. This increase in mortality was, however, not significant. The ability of this formulation to prolong the ability of S. yirgalemense to infect P. citri and to prolong nematode survival was also evaluated under the same conditions and showed the formulation to improve both infectivity and survival for up to 2 – 3 h post-application. In the semi-field trial, S. yirgalemense was unable to obtain significant control of P. citri without the addition of 0. 03 % Zeba® to nematode application suspensions. However, with the addition of 0. 03 % Zeba® S. yirgalemnse was able to obtain up to 53 % control. The study established that the polymer product Zeba® improves the ability of S. yirgalemense to infect P. citri by retarding desiccation and by buffering nematodes from suboptimal environmental conditions. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Planococcus citri (Risso) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), die sitrus witluis, is ŉ baie skadelike pes van sitrus in Suid Afrika. Die vermoë van witluise om weerstand teen chemiese middels te ontwikkel, hul kriptiese lewenswyse en die beskermende waslaag wat hul liggame omhul inhibeer gesamentlik en individueel die vermoë van insektisiede om witluis bevolkings te beheer. Chemiese middels verminder ook die natuurlike vyande wat gewoonlik witluis bevolkings beheer voor die sitrus oestydperk in Maart tot Mei. Die onvermoë van chemiese middels om P. citri suksesvol te beheer en verhoogde bewustheid van die publiek rond om die vernietigende omgewings impak en gesondheidsrisiko’s verbonde aan chemiese insek beheer, noodsaak sitrus produsente om alternatiewe beheermetodes te ontwikkel. Entomopatogeniese nematodes, van die orde Rhabditida wat aan die families Heterorhabditidae of Steinernematidae behoort, is bekend as effektiewe biologiese beheeragente van ŉ verskeidenheid insek pes spesies. Hierdie nematodes is egter tans nie kommersieel beskikbaar in Suid- Afrika nie. Om ten einde die vermoë van plaaslike nematode spesies te bepaal om P. citri te beheer, is verskeie biotoetse in die laboratorium uitgevoer. ŉ Vinnige siftings proses is uitgevoer om vas te stel watter plaaslike nematode spesies die hoogste persentasie mortaliteit van P. citri wyfies veroorsaak. Daar is bevind dat P. citri die mees vatbaarste is vir Steinernema yirgalemense en Heterorhabditis zealandica wat 97 % en 91 % mortaliteit respektiewelik veroorsaak het. Die ontwikkeling van beide H. zealandica en S. yirgalemense na die infektering van volwasse P. citri wyfies is gevolg en daar is bevind dat beide nematode spesies hul lewensiklusse kon voltooi in insek kadawers. Onder optimale toestande was H. zealandica en S. yirgalemense in staat om P. citri effektief te beheer, as hul teen ŉ konsentrasie van 170 infektiewe larwes (JIs) per insek (LD 90) toegedien word, met ŉ diskriminerende toedienings dosis van 11 (LD 50). ŉ Water aktiwiteit biotoets het gewys dat S. yirgalemense twee keer so verdraagsaam is teenoor laer vlakke van vrye water as wat H. zealandica is met aw 50 = 0. 96 en aw 90 = 0. 99, in vergelyking met H. zealandica met aw 50 = 0. 98 en aw 90 = 1. 01. Resultate van ŉ blootstellings toets het ook gewys dat S. yirgalemense die vermoë het om P. citri vinniger op te spoor en te infekteer as H. zealandica. Die blootstellings toets was uitgevoer teen 15 °C, 20 °C en 25 °C en daar is bevind dat die aktiwiteit van H. zealandica nie beduidend verhoog het met ŉ verhoging in temperatuur nie. Resultate vir die blootstellings toets het ook gewys dat die eerste 2 tot 4 uur na toediening van nematodes die mees kritieke tyd is om suksesvolle infektering van witluise te bevestig. Verdere eksperimente is uitgevoer om te bepaal of die byvoeging van twee polimeer produkte nl. Zeba® en Xanthan gum en ŉ benatter Nu-Film-P®, nematode toedienings suspensies kan verbeter. Deur 0. 02 % Xanthan gum by nematode toedienings suspensies te voeg is die vermoë van nematodes om P. citri by 60 % en 80 % relatiewe humiditeit (RH) te beheer nie beduidend verhoog nie, terwyl die byvoeging van 0. 03 % Zeba® wel ŉ beduidende verhoging in mortaliteit veroorsaak het. ŉ Suspensie van H. zealandica en 0. 03 % Zeba® het beheer met 14 % by 60 % RH en met 22 % by 80 % RH verhoog. Die invloed van dieselfde polimeer formulasie was ook getoets op S. yirgalemense en mortaliteit het verhoog met 21 % by 60 % RH en met 27 % by 80 % RH. Ten spyte daarvan dat “Xanthan gum” nie so effektief was om afsakking van nematodes te verhoed nie, het die byvoeginging van 0. 03 % Zeba® by toedienings suspensies steeds ŉ beduidende invloed gehad. Die gekombineerde byvoeging Nu-Film-P® en Zeba® was in staat om die gemiddelde aantal nematodes gedeponeer op 2 -cm 2 blaar skyfies te verhoog. Om te wys watter faktore in ag geneem moet word voor EPNs as deel van ŉ geïntegreerde pes beheer program toegedien word, is die verenigbaarheid van H. zealandica en S. yirgalemense vir biologiese beheer agente en landbouchemikalieë, waaraan hulle heel waarskynlik blootgestel gaan word, bepaal. Biotoetse het gewys dat die liewenheersbesie, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, vatbaar is vir beide nematode spesies. Die larwale fase was hoogs vatbaar met mortaliteit van 80 % en 92 % verkry deur die toedeining van H. zealandica en S. yirgalemense respektiewelik. Daar is ook bepaal dat volwasse besies twee maal so vatbaar is vir S. yirgalemense wat 64 % mortaliteit veroorsaak het, as vir H. zealandica met 30 % mortaliteit aangeteken. Verdraagsaamheid van IJs van H. zealandica en S. yirgalemense met oplossings van ŉ insektisied (Cyperphos 500 E. C. ®), twee bio-plaagdoders (CryptogranTM en HelicovirTM), en twee byvoegmiddels (Nu-Film-P® en Zeba®), vir infektiwiteit en oorlewing is bepaal. Resultate het gewys dat H. zealandica hoogs verenigbaar is met alle produkte wat getoets is. ŉ Beduidende verhoging in mortaliteit van S. yirgalemense is aangeteken na 12 ure se blootstelling aan CryptogranTM, HelicovirTM en Cyperphos 500 E. C. ®, en na 6 ure se blootstelling aan Nu-Film-P®. Resultate het egter ook gewys dat die vermoë van S. yirgalemense om om gashere te infekteer nie deur beinvloed word nie. Om ten einde te bepaal watter een van H. zealandica of S. yirgalemense die beter isolaat sou wees om te gebruik in veldproewe, is hul vermoë om P. citri te beheer eers evalueer onder minder ongunstige gesimuleerde glashuis toestande. Die vermoë van beide nematode spesies om P. citri te beheer is bepaal in ŉ groeikamer by 75 ± 8 % (RH) met en sonder die byvoeging van 0. 03 % Zeba® en 0. 06 % Nu-Film-P®. Mortaliteit verkry deur alle behandelings was beduidend hoër as die kontrole. Deur 0. 03 % Zeba® en 0. 06 % Nu-Film-P® by toedienings suspensies van H. zealandica en S. yirgalemense te voeg is die gevolglike mortaliteit van P. citri verhoog van 26 % na 30 % en van 34 % na 45 %, respektiewelik. Hierdie verhoging in mortaliteit was egter nie beduidend nie. Die vermoë van die bo-genoemde formulasie om oorlewing van S. yirgalemense en infeksie tydperk van P. citri te verleng was bepaal onder dieselfde toestande en daar is gevind dat die formulasie beide die infektiwiteit en oorlewing van nematodes met 2 tot 3 uur na toediening verleng het. Tydens die semi-veldproef was S. yirgalemense nie in staat om beduidend hoër mortaliteit van P. citri te verkry, in vergelyking met die kontrole, sonder die byvoeging van 0. 03 % Zeba® by toedienings suspensies nie. Met die byvoeging van Zeba® is daar tot 53 % beheer verkry. Die studie het onweerlegbaar gewys dat die polimeer produk Zeba® die vermoë van S. yirgalemense om P. citri te infekteer verbeter deur die uitdroging van nematodes te vertraag en deur hul te beskerm teen ongunstige omgewings toestande...|$|E

There is also no clear consensus about the best temperature and duration. Lodge Manufacturing uses a proprietary soybean blend in their base coats as stated on their website. Others use lard, or animal fats. Some advocate the use of food-grade flaxseed oil (a drying oil). The temperature recommended for seasoning varies from high temperatures above [...] to temperatures below [...] Some say that a temperature around the smoke point of the oil or fat should be targeted since this will allow vaporization of the lighter hydrocarbons from the oil, leaving behind heavier molecules for optimal polymerization and carbonization to occur. And, there is also no consensus on the correct duration of heating: from half an hour to an hour is often recommended.|$|R
40|$|Preserving {{silver and}} bronze alloy {{cultural}} heritage objects is a monumental challenge for museums as they house thousands {{of objects that}} are sensitive to atmospheric corrosion. Metal alloy objects are currently preserved by applying cellulose nitrate lacquers, however, these coatings are limited by short lifetimes, non-uniform application, and appearance changes. This thesis describes investigations of a new method for preserving silver and bronze alloy art and cultural heritage objects using atomic layer deposition (ALD) diffusion barriers. My research focused on determining the potential of ALD films to protect cultural heritage objects while adhering to the strict requirements of art conservation, which require the coatings to minimally change object appearance, have a long effective lifetime, and be completely reversible without significant substrate alteration. ALD coatings were structurally engineered to minimize color changes on silver, silver alloys and bronze patinas by modeling the simulated reflectance spectrum of single and multilayer ALD film stacks. Optimal ALD film structures for minimal appearance change depend on the substrate, requiring different films for silver alloys and bronze. ALD films protected silver at least 15 times longer than cellulose nitrate films, for an expected lifetime of more than 100 years. ALD film porosity decreases with increasing film thickness with no correlation to “dirty” surface treatment, indicating a thick ALD film could effectively protect a non-ideal surface or real cultural heritage object. Al 2 O 3 ALD films were removed with weak solutions of NaOH, however, more Cu than Ag was removed. XPS depth profiling on combinatorial Ag-Cu alloy libraries showed Cu removal {{was limited to the}} top 2 - 3 nm of the alloy surface. ALD films can be deposited on bronze alloys and patinas with and without <b>wax</b> <b>protective</b> layers to prevent changes due to environmental exposure. Bronze patinas have a more complicate surface roughness and chemistry that causes difficulty in achieving a uniform, high quality ALD film. Plasma cleaning is an effective method to ensure high-quality ALD coatings on complex surfaces with tortuous paths, chemical heterogeneity, and topography. ALD films are promising as cultural heritage diffusion barriers as they are reversible with negligible effect on substrate composition...|$|R
40|$|Barley straw, an {{agricultural}} byproduct, {{was identified as}} a potential adsorbent material for wastewater treatment as it offers various advantages such as abundant availability at no or very low cost, little processing cost and ability to biodegradation. The raw barley straw, however, needs to be modified as a preliminary study showed less favorability of the raw barley straw in removing oil and anionic dyes. Barley straw was chemically pretreated with sodium hydroxide and modified using a cationic surfactant, hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate (CPC). Generally, the treatment with NaOH increases the negatively charged sites on straw surface and the cationic surfactant introduced forms a hydrophobic layer on the straw surface and changes the surface potential charge from negative to positive. From this exercise, four different adsorbents have been prepared, viz; raw barley straw (RBS), raw barley straw pretreated with sodium hydroxide (RBS-N), and the modification of RBS and RBS-N with the cationic surfactant CPC, which were labelled as surfactant modified barley straw (SMBS) and base pretreated surfactant modified barley straw (BMBS). Several physical and chemical techniques were employed to characterize barley straw samples to understand the properties of raw and modified straws as well as to study the effects of modification on the textural and surface properties of the raw barley straw. Chemical compositional analyses showed that the amounts of potassium, sodium, arsenic and cadmium existing in RBS, RBS-N were generally low. The availability of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in RBS offers the great potential of using the barley straw as a biosorbent material. Surface group measurement by the Boehm titration showed higher acid groups in the base-treated straw (RBS-N) than raw straw due to the base hydrolization of lignocellulosic material, which is responsible for the increase in surface acidic sites such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups. The percentages of carbon and nitrogen for SMBS and BMBS were greater compared to RBS and RBS-N, due to loading of CPC. Based on carbon and nitrogen values, the impregnated CPC on SMBS and BMBS was calculated as 0. 086 and 0. 109 mmol g- 1, respectively. For the surfactant modified straw, lower BET surface area was observed and could be explained by the attachment of the surfactant moieties to the internal framework of raw adsorbents causing the constriction of pore channels. The electrical conductivity was found much lower in surfactant modified straw due to significant reduction in water soluble mineral after the surfactant modification. Higher bulk density of SMBS and BMBS was due to the addition of CPC onto the straw surface. SEM microphotos of all the prepared adsorbents showed the highly irregular shapes and sizes. The treatment with alkaline solution partly removed the <b>protective</b> thin <b>wax</b> on straw surface. The surfactant modified surface appeared to be rough, indicating that the surface had been covered with organic molecules. FT-IR spectra of RBS and RBS-N did not show any radical changes indicating that the treatment with mild base solution did not significantly alter the chemical properties of the straw. Two new bands lying at about 2920, 2850 cm- 1 referred as asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of methylene (C-H) adsorption bands originated from the alkyl chain of CPC were observed on SMBS and BMBS, proving the existence of CPC on straw surface. Desorption of CPC from the surfactant modified straw was observed to increase with increasing acid solution concentration. The increasing desorption of CPC (with increased in acid solution) describes that ion exchange is the major binding mechanism. The sorption of CPC generally showed that the sorption capacity of CPC increases with increasing CPC equilibrium concentration for both RBS and RBS-N. The surfactant sorption was at the maximum when the equilibrium surfactant concentrations reached the critical micelle concentration, CMC. Preliminary experiments found the effectiveness of the prepared adsorbents, namely; RBS, RBS-N, SMBS and BMBS in removing different types of emulsified oil from wastewater such as canola oil (CO) and standard mineral oil (SMO). Comparing to SMBS and BMBS, RBS and RBS-N showed low removal efficiency of the emulsified oil. This provided a sensible justification in using SMBS and BMBS as adsorbent materials. The adsorption tests were performed using SMBS and BMBS on CO and SMO by batch adsorption. For the sorption of CO and SMO on SMBS and BMBS, the adsorption was less favorable at high acidic condition and the maximum adsorption capacity was observed at about neutrality. Larger particle size would result in lower adsorption while adsorption temperature would not affect adsorption significantly. The kinetic study revealed that equilibrium time was short and pseudo first order model provided the best correlation for the kinetic adsorption data of CO and SMO on both SMBS and BMBS. The film diffusion was observed as the rate limiting in the sorption of CO and SMO on SMBS and BMBS. The isotherm data for sorption of CO and SMO on SMBS and BMBS indicated that the adsorption was fitted well by the Langmuir model. The Langmuir adsorption capacities of CO and SMO on SMBS were 576. 00 and 518. 63 mg g- 1; and 613. 29 and 584. 22 mg g- 1 on BMBS, respectively. Desorption experiments also showed the stability of the oil loaded on straw. The adsorbent was later evaluated in a fixed bed column. The breakthrough curves indicated the favorable performance of SMBS and BMBS for both CO and SMO; however, less success was observed for RBS and RBS-N. The modeling of column tests showed a good agreement of experimental data of oil adsorption on SMBS and BMBS with the Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models. The column adsorption capacities from the Thomas model for SMBS and BMBS were 368. 82 and 440. 74 mg g- 1 for CO; and 310. 16 and 336. 31 mg g- 1 for SMO, respectively. The applicability of the prepared adsorbents was also evaluated for treating dye containing wastewater. The adsorption tests were performed using SMBS and BMBS on anionic dyes of Acid Blue 40 (AB 40), Reactive Blue 4 (RB 4) and Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) as the preliminary batch adsorption experiments showed low removal percentage of dyes on RBS and RBS-N. The batch study also revealed that the adsorption was a function of dye concentration, pH and temperature. Adsorption capacity was found higher at pH about neutrality for AB 40, and at acidic condition (pH 3) for the other dyes. Adsorption capacity of AB 40 increased at increasing experimental temperature whereas no significant change was observed for RB 4 and RB 5. The kinetic experiment revealed that adsorption of dyes was rapid at initial stage followed by a slower phase where equilibrium uptake was achieved. Based on batch kinetic study of adsorption of AB 40, RB 4 and RB 5 on SMBS and BMBS, the pseudosecond- order model fitted well with the kinetic data other than the pseudo first order model. The film diffusion was observed as the rate limiting in the sorption of AB 40, RB 4 and RB 5 on SMBS and BMBS. The isotherm data of dye adsorption on SMBS and BMBS indicated that the adsorption was fitted well by the Langmuir model. The Langmuir adsorption capacities of AB 40, RB 4 and RB 5 were 45. 4, 29. 16 and 24. 92 mg g- 1 for SMBS and 51. 95, 31. 50 and 39. 88 mg g- 1 for BMBS, respectively. Desorption experiments also showed that the dye loaded straw was stable at acidic condition but desorption increased as the pH increased (i. e pH 11). The applicability of the adsorbents for AB 40 and RB 5 removal was also tested in a fixed bed column study. Similar to the column system for CO and SMO, the breakthrough curves on RBS and RBS-N was also poor, however, favorable column breakthrough performance was observed on SMBS and BMBS. The column breakthrough modeling showed the better fit of the experimental data of SMBS and BMBS with the Thomas and Yoon-Nelson breakthrough models. The adsorption capacities from the Thomas model for SMBS and BMBS were estimated as 53. 39 and 77. 29 mg g- 1 for AB 40; and 24. 57 and 33. 46 mg g- 1 for RB 5, respectively...|$|R
