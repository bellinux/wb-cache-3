25|$|This {{period of}} {{incubation}} can take {{much longer than}} the production of another clutch of eggs by the female, especially in temperate regions where pregnancies last longer, leading to a reproductive environment in which sexual selection can be stronger on females than on males due to increased male parental investment. Interestingly, this reversal of traditional sex roles has only been found in <b>pipefishes,</b> whereas seahorses have largely been accepted as monogamous. Some pipefish species display classical polyandry because of this unique situation. Male syngnathids usually prefer females with large body size and prominent ornaments such as blue skin pigmentation or skin folds. Intriguingly, syngnathid males in some species are apparently capable of absorbing eggs or embryos while in the brood pouch.|$|E

2500|$|Monogamy {{occurs when}} one male mates with one female exclusively. This is also called pair spawning. Most fish are not monogamous, {{and when they}} are, they often {{alternate}} with non-monogamous behaviours. Monogamy can occur when feeding and breeding grounds are small, when {{it is difficult for}} fish to find partners, or when both sexes look after the young. Many tropical cichlids, which rear their young together in locations where they must fiercely defend against competitors and predators are monogamous. [...] "In some <b>pipefishes</b> and seahorses, development of eggs takes a long time before the female can place them in the brood pouch of a male, where they are fertilized. While the male is pregnant, the female starts a new batch of eggs, which are ready {{at about the same time}} that the male gives birth to the young from the previous mating. This close timing of development promotes monogamy, especially if the likelihood of encountering another potential mate is low." ...|$|E

In the straighnosed <b>pipefish,</b> female-female competition and mate choice by males has resulted in female-specific coloration, female ornamental skin folds, and more active courtship in females.|$|R
