5|$|Eurostar's <b>punctuality</b> has fluctuated {{from year}} to year, but usually remains over 90%; {{in the first quarter}} of 1999, 89% of {{services}} operated were on time, and in the second quarter it reached 92%. Eurostar's best <b>punctuality</b> record was 97.35%, between 16 and 22 August 2004. In 2006, it was 92.7%, and in 2007, 91.5% were on time. In the first quarter of 2009, 96% of Eurostar services were punctual compared with rival air routes' 76%.|$|E
5|$|Since {{privatisation}} in 1987, {{dozens of}} Japanese railway companies compete in {{regional and local}} passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains {{are known for their}} safety and <b>punctuality.</b> Proposals for a new Maglev route between Tokyo and Osaka are at an advanced stage.|$|E
5|$|Twenty dots {{arranged}} {{in the shape}} of an aircraft serves as the logo of the airline. The airline uses a two tone blue livery on a white background with the belly of the aircraft painted in Indigo with the logo in white. The flight attendants wear a single-piece navy-blue tunic with a cap and a thin indigo belt designed by fashion designer Rajesh Pratap Singh and make-up artist Ambika Pillai. The airline has the tagline on-time focusing on <b>punctuality.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{advantage}} held by Eurostar is {{the convenience}} {{and speed of}} the service: with shorter check-in times than at most airports and hence quicker boarding and less queueing and high <b>punctuality,</b> it takes less time to travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail than it does by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market. In 2007, it achieved record market shares of 71% for London–Paris and 65% for London–Brussels routes.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 2012 {{revealed}} that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised {{that the older}} vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — were outdated {{and the cause of}} much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. Respondents were surveyed on value for money, <b>punctuality,</b> seating availability, tram stops and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was value for money compared to a national average of 60%.|$|E
5|$|Original {{estimates}} {{predicted a}} daily ridership of 180,000 after launch, growing to 400,000 by 2036. In {{view of a}} 50% drop in airline passengers {{in the wake of}} the 1997 Asian financial crisis, forecasts were revised downwards. The final initial ridership estimate was 140,000 passengers per day. Actual initial ridership did not match these projections. In September 2007, six months after opening, THSRC carried 1.5million passengers monthly, translating to about 50,000 passengers daily. In the second year, passenger numbers almost doubled. In the third year, average daily ridership continued to grow to 88,000 passengers per day, jumping to over 120,000 passengers per day in 2012. (updated to September 2012) Seat occupancy was around 45% in the first three years, with a modest improvement achieved in 2009, and reached 53.91% in 2012. (updated to September 2012) <b>Punctuality</b> is stable above 99%.|$|E
5|$|VR {{has given}} mixed {{statements}} about the fault-sensitivity of the train. Pentti Kuokkanen, project coordinator of VR Engineering downplayed the problems when questioned about the reliability of another Fiat Ferroviaria multiple unit, the Sm4, in 1999. According to him, the Pendolino had been VR's most reliable passenger train during winter 1998–1999. In 2006, VR's CEO Henri Kuitunen affirmed that the Pendolino was causing serious image problems to VR Group. In 2010, the company's head of traffic control Mauno Haapala stated that the Sm3 was not more fault-sensitive than their other trains. However during winter 2011, VR Group's head of service and production department Pertti Saarela gave a totally different answer, saying that Pendolinos {{are more prone to}} failures especially during winter. It is impossible to know if the train has more problems than VR's other rolling stock, as the company does not give out <b>punctuality</b> statistics for specific train types.|$|E
5|$|Biman {{is notable}} for {{disruptions}} to its flight schedule and poor customer service. In 2007, Biman faced strong criticism from major international airports including London Heathrow Airport and Dubai International Airport for {{its failure to}} maintain flight schedules. Heathrow Airport operator BAA wrote to Biman providing evidence which showed Biman had not achieved the minimum 80% usage of its allocated landing slots at Heathrow, as required by EU and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations, {{during the summer of}} 2007. Biman should, therefore, not expect slot allocations at Heathrow for the summer of 2008 and should look to Stansted or Gatwick airports if it wished to continue serving London. Following discussions with BAA, however, Biman obtained landing slots for the summer of 2008 on condition that it achieved 80% usage. Delays continued unabated and in September 2008, Biman's Dhaka–London direct flight utilising a DC-10 aircraft was diverted and landed at Gatwick when it did not have sufficient fuel to remain in a holding pattern over Heathrow following arrival over three hours after the scheduled time. In a 10 September 2008 article published in The Times, Biman was labelled the worst performer for <b>punctuality</b> at Heathrow, with flights delayed on average by three hours. In 2008, the United Nations advised its staff not to fly with Biman, citing both safety and security concerns and Biman's unreliable flight schedules. It was made clear that UN staff who flew with Biman did so at their own risk, and would be ineligible to make claims on insurance. Biman's then newly appointed managing director said he was unaware of the UN directive, but admitted that Biman did face problems in managing its flight schedules. He expected the situation to improve with the procurement of aircraft in the coming months.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to rebuild, the team {{acquired}} several players who were highly talented, but had reputations for off-court troubles. Isaiah Rider, who was traded by the Minnesota Timberwolves for a draft pick and career backups due to his frequent arrests and lack of <b>punctuality,</b> was arrested for cannabis possession two days before his debut with the Blazers. Rasheed Wallace, who was acknowledged as a hot-tempered player since college, was also acquired, in a trade with the Washington Bullets. Point guard Kenny Anderson was {{signed as a free}} agent, and subsequently traded to the Toronto Raptors for Damon Stoudamire in February 1998 (the Raptors traded Anderson to the Boston Celtics five days later, because {{he did not want to}} play in Canada). Initially, this approach worked, as the team returned to the Western Conference finals in 1999 under head coach Mike Dunleavy. After being swept by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs, Whitsitt sent Rider and guard Jim Jackson to the Atlanta Hawks for guard Steve Smith and acquired former All-Star forward Scottie Pippen from the Houston Rockets. The team again advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they faced a Los Angeles Lakers team led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. In that series, the Trail Blazers dropped three out of the first four games before winning the next two, forcing a pivotal Game 7. The Blazers had a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, but lost the game and the series to the Lakers, who went on to win the first of three consecutive titles.|$|E
25|$|On average, 930,000 {{trips are}} made on Metlink trains each month. In 2013-14, Tranz Metro claimed 94.3% <b>punctuality,</b> being the {{proportion}} of trains arriving within five minutes of schedule (94.7% <b>punctuality</b> if normalised {{for the effects of}} the 2013 Seddon earthquake and 2013 Lake Grassmere earthquake).|$|E
25|$|Chris Green {{as chief}} {{executive}} led a drive to improve reliability and <b>punctuality</b> after much press criticism in 2001, and by 2006, due to improved reliability of trains and completion of major infrastructure projects, performance was better. Virgin has undertaken a number of projects to increase <b>punctuality,</b> including radio-controlled watches.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that a contributing factor in the accident was the JR West policy of schedule <b>punctuality.</b> As a result of this, Masataka Ide, JR West adviser who {{played a major role}} in enforcing the <b>punctuality</b> of the company's trains, announced that he would resign in June 2005 at the company's annual shareholder meeting, with the company's chairman and president resigning in August.|$|E
25|$|In {{the month}} of December 2014, Metlink trains had a {{delivery}} rate of 98.5%, and a <b>Punctuality</b> rate of 93.60%.|$|E
25|$|Virgin Trains {{suffered}} poor <b>punctuality</b> {{compared with}} some other transport operators between 2001 and 2006, according to Office of Rail Regulation statistics. <b>Punctuality</b> did gradually improve until {{the introduction of a}} new timetable (in December 2008), following the upgrade of the West Coast Main Line, which resulted in a dip in performance. Performance subsequently recovered and peaked during 2010-2011, but then fell again and reached a new low for the year ending 31 March 2013 of 83.6% (MAA).|$|E
25|$|A {{stress on}} {{performance}} targets had diluted the perceived importance of safety. Cullen contrasted multimillion-pound penalties for poor <b>punctuality</b> with much lower fines for serious safety breaches.|$|E

25|$|By the 1960s, {{refrigerator}} trucks {{had begun}} to displace railcars. Strikes in the 1970s resulted {{in the loss of}} reliability and <b>punctuality,</b> important to fish transportation. In 1986, the last refrigerated cars were replaced by reefer containers.|$|E
25|$|The latest <b>punctuality</b> {{statistics}} {{to be released}} by Network Rail for period 7 of 2013/2014 were 89.3% PPM (Public Performance Measure) and a MAA (Moving Annual Average) of 88.8% for the 12 months up to 12 October 2013.|$|E
25|$|As {{a direct}} result, {{terminating}} trains {{no longer need}} to shunt {{from one side of the}} station to the other to take up their return workings, reducing turnaround times for terminating trains and improve train service <b>punctuality</b> and reliability.|$|E
25|$|From the {{academic}} year 1976-77, Dr. Lawrence requested schools to introduce a scheme of awarding prizes for good conduct to pupils during annual school days. Character, virtues, good manners, good conduct, <b>punctuality,</b> cooperation, devotion to studies, team spirit, regularity and obedience are important aspects in education.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to problems with local public transport, the main local rail franchise, Great Western Railway, has a poor record of <b>punctuality,</b> with only 71% of trains reaching their destinations on time. In January 2007 and January 2008, fare strikes were organised, during which fake tickets were issued to passengers during morning commutes.|$|E
25|$|If {{a student}} is not seated {{in his or her}} chair, with their bags off their desk when the bell rings, they must leave class and report to room 32, a {{detention}} room, and miss that class for that day, receiving a 0. This policy is designed to teach students the importance of <b>punctuality.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 12 December 2004, {{the company}} {{completely}} recast its timetable, {{for the first}} time in the South West region since 1967, in an attempt to bring service provision into line with changing demand and to take into account the different characteristics of modern rolling stock, with the intention that this would improve reliability and <b>punctuality</b> across the network.|$|E
25|$|Urban transit {{began in}} Montreal in 1861 when {{a line of}} horse-drawn cars started to operate on Craig (now St-Antoine) and Notre-Dame streets. Eventually, as the then Canadian {{metropolis}} grew, a comprehensive network of streetcar lines provided service almost everywhere. But urban congestion started to take its toll on streetcar <b>punctuality,</b> so {{the idea of an}} underground system was soon considered.|$|E
25|$|Before we put real {{effort into}} the Severn Beach line {{it was really}} the {{sacrificial}} lamb for other services. So if we needed a spare train, we would pull one off the line and cancel it, which was why <b>punctuality</b> and reliability was so poor. After the public campaign in 2006 we decided that we didn't want to take that to carry on any more.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006 First Hampshire & Dorset {{was fined}} by the Traffic Commissioner for poor <b>punctuality</b> on its {{services}} in Portsmouth. The company {{stated that it}} had rerouted some services through the city to improve their performance. The provision of evening services in {{the city has been}} criticised by some local groups. In May 2011, some contracted journeys were cut after the city council was forced to implement spending cuts.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, ATW {{was ranked}} seventh best (out of 21 companies) with an above average 89.9% of trains 'on time' {{according}} to Network Rail statistics. The latest figures released by NR (Network Rail) rate <b>punctuality</b> (Public Performance Measure) at 96.1% for period 7 of the 2013/14 financial year.

25|$|SkyTrain's {{signalling}} system later provided {{the basis of}} SelTrac, which is currently maintained and sold by Thales and has equipped many lines around the world. Largely {{as a result of}} this, the Expo and Millennium Lines have a combined <b>punctuality</b> record of over 96 per cent; the principal cause of train delays is passenger interference with train doors. There has been one derailment and no collisions in the system's history.|$|E
25|$|Brentwood County High School has based its ethos {{heavily on}} community. Every student and staff member {{is part of}} one of the five Houses which compete {{regularly}} in competitions of sport and academia. Each house competition is worth points which determine which House wins the House cup. The five Houses also compete with each other on attendance, <b>punctuality</b> and student house points where the house with the most points goes on to win a prize every half term.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-eight stops {{opened in}} the phased {{introduction}} of tram services in May 2000. Centrale tram stop in Tamworth Road opened on 10 December 2005, increasing journey times slightly. As turnround times were already quite tight this {{raised the issue of}} buying an extra tram to maintain <b>punctuality.</b> Partly for this reason but also {{to take into account the}} planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.|$|E

25|$|The {{speed and}} <b>punctuality</b> of many LB {{passenger}} services {{was the subject}} of widespread criticism in the technical and popular press during the 1890s. This was in part {{due in part to the}} complexity of the system between London and Croydon, with a large number of signals and junctions, the sharing of stretches of line with the SER, and the relatively short routes, which gave little opportunity to make up for lost time. The LB gradually began to rebuild its reputation during the twentieth century through improvements to main-line infrastructure and electrification of suburban services.|$|E
25|$|Rajkumar {{was best}} {{regarded}} {{for being a}} highly disciplined man in both his personal and professional lives. He practised Carnatic music for an hour each {{in the morning and}} in the evening. His <b>punctuality</b> is another noted aspect. Waking up every morning at 4 am, he performed Yoga and Pranayama, which {{is said to be the}} reason behind his physical and mental fitness. His Yoga performances can be seen in the first clips of his film Kaamana Billu. Rajkumar is the first actor of the world cinema who had mastered Yoga.|$|E
25|$|The Parliamentary {{leaders had}} no {{intention}} of flinging their men away in a frontal attack on the line of the Lambourn. A flank attack from the east side could hardly succeed, owing to the obstacle presented by the confluence of the Lambourn and the Kennet. Hence, they decided on a wide turning movement via Chieveley, Winterbourne and Wickham Heath, against Prince Maurice's position. The decision, daring and energetic as it was, led only to a moderate success, for reasons that will appear. The flank march, out of range of the castle, was conducted with <b>punctuality</b> and precision.|$|E
25|$|The {{school for}} many years used its own Intranet to host online lesson plans which staff and {{students}} could access as well as subject pages and other tools. The school has implemented a Frog VLE (Virtual learning environment), provided by FrogTrade. Some of the main points the school highlights about its VLE {{is the ability to}} access their timetable attendance and <b>punctuality,</b> home learning, school notices, cashless catering data and reward points. Parents of students have their own account to access a part of Frog called the 'Parents Portal', which allow them to see relevant information for their child.|$|E
