40|$|We have {{extended}} the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) to support directional bonds and dynamic bonding.

40|$|Crystallographic {{polarity}} in needle-shaped ZnO crystals {{was determined}} by utilizing the intensity difference between (hkl) and (hkl) Laue spots resulted from the anomalous dispersion of X-ray near the K absorption edge wave length of Zn atom. The polarity obtained agrees with the one determined by the difference in etching behavior on the cleaved surfaces of the crystal. X-ray oscillation photographs did not show the existence of stacking fault in the crystal. A polar twin, which appears in the prismatic surface region of the crystal, frequently has crystallographic (100) boundary planes with the matrix crystal. A possible model for the atomic configuration of the polar twin is presented, in which, instead of Zn-O <b>type</b> <b>bond,</b> Zn-Zn <b>type</b> and O-O <b>type</b> <b>bonds</b> are produced at (100) twin boundary and (001) twin plane.

40|$|Objectives : This {{experimental}} study evaluated {{the effect of}} bonding application time on the microshear bond strength of composite resin to different types of glass ionomer cements (GICs). Materials and Methods: One-hundred and sixty specimens (two conventional and two resin-modified GICs) were prepared and divided into 16 groups. The surface of all specimens was prepared using two different bonding systems (Frog and Stea) at three different times. After setting, the composite resin (Z 100) was placed over the GICs. The specimens were then stored in distilled water for 24 hours (37 oC) and exposed to microshear stresses at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The results were analyzed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (P˂ 0. 05). Results: In conventional GICs, bond strength was affected by the <b>type</b> of <b>bonding</b> system at different times, and bond strength was significantly higher in the Fuji II group compared to Riva Self Cure group. In the Riva Self Cure group, bond strength was significantly affected by time; whereas, the <b>type</b> of <b>bonding</b> system failed to exert {{a significant effect on}} bond strength. There was no significant correlation between the <b>type</b> of <b>bonding</b> system and the two brands of resin-modified GICs. Bond strength was not affected by the <b>type</b> of <b>bonding</b> agent; however, among the two brands of resin-modified GICs, Fuji II LC yielded a significantly stronger bond. Conclusion: It appears that the <b>type</b> of <b>bonding</b> agent does not affect the microshear bond strength, and the bonding application time affects the microshear bond strength in Riva Self Cure GICs. </p...|$|R
