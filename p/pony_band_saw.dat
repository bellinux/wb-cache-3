50|$|An IoT-enabled {{intelligent}} system of such cases {{has been demonstrated}} by the NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at University of Cincinnati on a <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> machine in IMTS 2014 in Chicago. <b>Band</b> <b>saw</b> machines are not necessarily expensive, but the <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> belt expenses are enormous since they degrade much faster. However, without sensing and intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> belt will actually break. The developed prognostics system {{will be able to}} recognize and monitor the degradation of <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> belts even if the condition is changing, so that users will know in near real time when {{is the best time to}} replace <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b> This will significantly improve user experience and operator safety, and save costs on replacing <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> belts before they actually break. The developed analytical algorithms were realized on a cloud server, and was made accessible via the Internet and on mobile devices.|$|R

40|$|It is {{said that}} the {{revolution}} speeds of <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> wheels change during sawing by the load acting on the <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b> However, there are few quantitative data on such change during sawing. In this study, the revolution speeds of the <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> wheels were measured precisely with rotary encoders, {{in order to examine}} the influence of sawing condition on the change in revolution speed and the power consumption during sawing. The revolution speeds of <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> wheels decreased along with the start of sawing, and then it resumed closely to the idling revolution speed level. It increased immediately after sawing and then it came down to the idling revolution speed level before sawing. The power consumption increased rapidly simultaneous with the start of sawing and then it decreased gently. After sawing, the power consumption decreased rapidly and then resumed the level for idling. The differences between the maximum and minimum revolution speeds of <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> wheels during sawing increased with an increase in feed speed and also with an increase in depth of workpiece.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to measure the capacity of the log <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> by monitoring the sawing process per operation for each log and to determine what the influencing factors were and their effect on the technological capacity of the log <b>band</b> <b>saw,</b> based on recorded and processed data. The analysis of the recorded data shows that the processed log volume, whose increase also increases the saw capacity, has the most important effect on log <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> capacity. It is imperative {{to take into account the}} volume of logs being processed when calculating the capacity of the log <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b> When monitoring the work of the operator, the use of fixed norms is not recommended and it is imperative that norms are connected to the volume of logs being processed...|$|R

The <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> blades were equipped with swaged teeth and stellited teeth. The power consumption, tool wear resistance, surface roughness and variation of board thickness during 6000 m sawn prism length were studied.
