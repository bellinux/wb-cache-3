5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the <b>pre-cooler,</b> it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve the}} desired temperature, the {{bleed-air}} is passed through a heat exchanger called a <b>pre-cooler.</b> Air bled from the engine fan is blown across the <b>pre-cooler,</b> located in the engine strut, and absorbes excess heat from the service bleed air.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{handling}} processes were investigated {{in the mud}} crab, Scylla serrata, using <b>pre-cooling</b> and chelae tying during emersion storage. Muscle glycogen, muscle lactate, muscle yield, muscle pH, volatile basic nitrogen (VBN), and chemical composition were analyzed. More than 90 % of the glycogen in muscle of non <b>pre-cooling</b> without chelae tying and non <b>pre-cooling</b> with chelae tying disappeared within 3 days of emersion storage, while the concentration of glycogen following non <b>pre-cooling</b> with chelae tying and <b>pre-cooling</b> with chelae tying decreased by only about 70 % within {{the same period of}} time. Lactate content increased from the initial level - 1. 20 ± 0. 20 mmol/kg - to 14. 81 ± 0. 28 mmol/kg in non <b>pre-cooling</b> without chelae tying, while it increased to 11. 34 ± 0. 58 mmol/kg, 11. 12 ± 0. 27 mmol/kg and 10. 08 ± 0. 62 mmol/kg during treatment including non <b>pre-cooling</b> with chelae tying, <b>pre-cooling</b> without chelae tying, and <b>pre-cooling</b> with chelae tying, respectively. The muscle pH of all treatments remained almost unchanged, irrespective of treatment. Percentage loss of muscle yield after 7 days was 30. 10 ± 1. 20 %, 20. 95 ± 3. 90 %, 22. 32 ± 4. 26 % and 17. 29 ± 4. 93 % in non <b>pre-cooling</b> without chelae tying, non <b>pre-cooling</b> with chelae tying, <b>pre-cooling</b> without chelae tying, and <b>pre-cooling</b> with chelae tying, respectively.

None of the treatments resulted in any significant changes in mean of moisture, protein, fat, or ash content.

To further investigate the effect of wetted medium type on <b>pre-cooling</b> performance, the current study simulates a pre-cooled NDDCT using two typical types of wetted media, i. e., film (Cellulose 7060 and PVC 1200) and trickle (Trickle 125 and Trickle 100). A MATLAB program was developed and was validated against published data. The model was then used to carry out case study of a 120 m-high NDDCT pre-cooled using the selected wetted media with fixed thickness of 300 mm.

40|$|Water {{shortage}} is a {{major problem}} facing the power industry in many nations around the world. The largest consumer of water in most power plants is the wet cooling tower.

40|$|Micromachined Joule–Thomson (JT) coolers are {{attractive}} for cooling small electronic devices. However, microcoolers operated with pure gases, such as nitrogen gas require high pressures of about 9 MPa to achieve reasonable cooling powers. Such high pressures severely add complexity {{to the development}} of compressors. To overcome this disadvantage, we combined a JT microcooler with a thermoelectric (TE) <b>pre-cooler</b> to deliver an equivalent cooling power with a lower pressure or, alternatively, a higher cooling power when operating with the same pressure. This hybrid microcooler was operated with nitrogen gas as the working fluid at a low pressure of 0. 6 MPa. The cooling power of the microcooler at 101 K operating with a fixed high pressure of 8. 8 MPa increased from 21 to 60 mW when the precooling temperature was reduced by the thermoelectric cooler from 295 to 250 K. These tests were simulated using a dynamic numerical model and the accuracy of the model was verified through the comparison between experimental and simulation results. Based on the model, we found the high pressure of the microcooler can be reduced from 8. 8 to 5. 5 MPa by lowering the precooling temperature from 295 to 250 K. Moreover, the effect of TE cooler position on the performance of the hybrid microcooler was evaluated through simulation analysis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{reduce the}} {{influence}} of the pipe material on the measurement of effective thermal conductivity, the pipe of a cryogenic pulsating heat pipe is generally made of stainless steel. Because of the low thermal conductivity of stainless steel, the <b>pre-cooling</b> of the evaporator in cryogenic pulsating heat pipe using helium as working fluid at 4. 2 K is a problem. We designed a mechanical-thermal switch between the cryocooler and the evaporator, which was on during the <b>pre-cooling</b> process and off during the test process. By using the <b>pre-cooling</b> system, the cool down time of the cryogenic pulsating heat pipe was reduced significantly...|$|R

The result {{shows that the}} <b>pre-cooling</b> wind speed should be chose reasonably while guarantees the <b>pre-cooling</b> effort, hot air defrost had a favorable defrosting performance, and {{it is essential to}} seek optimal defrosting time according to the frost thickness and energy consume. The temperature field near the switch door was analyzed, and the temperature gradient near the switch door is considerable, but the outdoor air can be obstructed by increase air curtain. ...|$|R
