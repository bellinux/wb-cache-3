In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement {{of the rest of the}} 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to <b>permit</b> <b>a</b> shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the French {{physicist}} Francis Perrin discovered fifteen {{ancient and}} no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo mine in Gabon, West Africa, collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors. The ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old; then, uranium-235 constituted about 3% of the total uranium on Earth. This is high enough to <b>permit</b> <b>a</b> sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur, provided other supporting conditions exist. The capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the U.S. federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository.|$|E

A break in the cable or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with this}} ceremony, AMPAS {{introduced}} a new competitive award that would honor animated feature films. According to Academy communications director John Pavlik, the film {{must be at least}} 70 minutes in length, have a significant amount of animated characters, and be at least 75 percent animated in order to be qualified for consideration. A minimum of eight qualifying films must be released within the calendar year to <b>permit</b> <b>a</b> slate of three nominees. If the number of films exceeds twelve, the nominee roster increases to five. Prior to the introduction of this category, three Disney films (1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and 1995's Toy Story) were all given Special Achievement Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{offensive}} captured {{a portion of}} the targeted area, including the town of Lipik as the first of the larger settlements captured by the HV during the war, the mission objectives were not met before the ceasefire took effect. SAO Western Slavonia retained control of the town of Okučani and its surroundings, including a short section of the Zagreb–Slavonski Brod motorway. The halting of Operation Hurricane-91 due to the ceasefire of 3 January 1992 led to opposing assessments on the possible outcomes of the offensive had there been no ceasefire. Assessments range from claims that the JNA was on the brink of defeat in the area, to estimates that the HV was too exhausted and its ammunition stocks too low to <b>permit</b> <b>a</b> successful conclusion of the offensive. The three HV offensives launched in Western Slavonia in late-1991 led to the displacement of approximately 20,000 Croatian Serb refugees who were later settled in the JNA-held Baranja region in eastern Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Having {{received}} {{permission to}} conduct the raid, Mountbatten and his staff studied the Bruneval installation and its defences, rapidly coming {{to the conclusion that}} due to the extensive coastal defences in the area around the installation it was too well-guarded to <b>permit</b> <b>a</b> seaborne commando raid. They considered that such a raid would result in high casualties among the attacking troops and would not be fast enough to capture the Würzburg radar before it was destroyed by the Germans. Believing that surprise and speed were to be the essential requirements of any raid against the installation to ensure the radar was captured, Mountbatten saw an airborne assault as the only viable method. On 8 January 1942, he therefore contacted the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division and 38 Wing RAF, asking if they were able {{to conduct the}} raid. The division's commander, Major-General Frederick Browning, was particularly enthusiastic, as a successful operation would be an excellent morale boost to the airborne troops under his command, as well as a good demonstration of their value.|$|E

5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might <b>permit</b> <b>a</b> variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E
5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not <b>permit</b> <b>a</b> federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 998, Dalassenos {{learned that a}} catastrophic fire had broken out in Apamea and {{destroyed}} most of its provisions, so he marched towards the city. The Aleppines too endeavoured to seize Apamea and arrived there first, but withdrew at the approach of Dalassenos, who could not <b>permit</b> <b>a</b> vassal to grow too strong and intended to capture the town for the emperor. Although ostensibly allies with the Byzantines, the Aleppines left the provisions they had brought with them to be collected by the inhabitants of Apamea, aiding them in their resistance. Subsequent events are presented by several authors, including the brief narrative of John Skylitzes and the more extensive accounts of the Christian Arab Yahya of Antioch and the Armenian Stephen of Taron.
