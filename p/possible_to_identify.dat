5|$|An older snake may shed {{its skin}} only {{once or twice}} a year, but a younger, still-growing snake, may shed up to four times a year. The {{discarded}} skin gives a perfect imprint of the scale pattern and it is usually <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the snake if this discard is reasonably complete and intact.|$|E
5|$|Book of the Dead papyri {{were often}} {{the work of}} several {{different}} scribes and artists whose work was literally pasted together. It is usually <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the style {{of more than one}} scribe used on a given manuscript, even when the manuscript is a shorter one. The text and illustrations were produced by different scribes; {{there are a number of}} Books where the text was completed but the illustrations were left empty.|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost immediately. In {{the days following}} the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping {{to be able to}} identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it would be difficult, but <b>possible,</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E
5|$|Sōryūs {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of nine A6M Zeros and seventeen D3As. The former attacked Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, losing one Zero to American anti-aircraft guns. On the return trip, the Zero pilots {{claimed to have}} shot down two American aircraft while losing two of their own. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, {{but it is not}} <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> which aircraft attacked which ship. Two of them were shot down during the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral {{upper respiratory tract}} infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and bronchitis the lungs. However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected. The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
30|$|Combining {{both the}} network {{accessibility}} indicators and the {{analysis performed on}} the UE RSS values, it is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> univocally <b>identify</b> each cause. Therefore, simple rules are proposed for the diagnosis of the different cases, as shown in Table  2.|$|R

40|$|The European Accessible Information Network (EUAIN) is {{currently}} examining {{issues relating to}} accessible content processing. With the support of key European publishers, it has been <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> key trends in accessible content processing which {{are likely to be}} of some importance in the coming years. This paper also describes some related standards activities and identifies a need for accessibility to be embedded within content creation and production processes at the earliest stages...|$|R
5|$|The newer {{technologies}} of road and rail {{led to the}} navigation falling into disuse. Some lengths of the system were drained or allowed to overgrow with vegetation. Increasingly {{the difference between the}} canal and the river became less obvious, although it is still <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> remains of the original locks. The threat to the remains which the construction of the M3 motorway posed spurred the Winchester Tenants and Residents Association and the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association into action in 1975, with both suggesting that the waterway could be restored. The two groups later co-operated, and the Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of karyotype techniques in the 1950s, it became <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> abnormalities of chromosomal number or shape. In 1959, Jérôme Lejeune reported {{the discovery}} that Down syndrome resulted from an extra chromosome. However, Lejeune's claim to the discovery has been disputed, and in 2014, the Scientific Council of the French Federation of Human Genetics unanimously awarded its Grand Prize to his colleague Marthe Gautier {{for her role in}} this discovery. The discovery was in the laboratory of Raymond Turpin at the Hôpital Trousseau in Paris, France. Jérôme Lejeune and Marthe Gautier were both his students.|$|E
5|$|The dialect of the {{district}} of Palakkad in Kerala has {{a large number of}} Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax and also has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the Vaishnava paribasai, a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> a person's caste by their speech. Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.|$|E
50|$|Potential role {{of genetic}} markers in the {{identification}} of persons at risk. There is a 75% probability <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the two EPPN1 mutations (one paternal, one maternal) that cause IIAC. Once the mutations are identified, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) are <b>possible</b> options <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the condition, either before or during pregnancy.|$|R
5000|$|Once the DNA strands are {{extracted}} from the samples, Dewey-Hagborg then amplifies, or copies, specific regions of the genome, using a technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR, a process advanced by Kary Mullis, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1993). These amplified regions of the genome make it <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identifying</b> single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced [...] "snips"), which contain variables in the base pairs that give clues to a person's individual genetic make up (e.g., {{whether or not a}} person's eyes might be blue, brown or green). These results are then sent for analysis to a company for sequencing. Dewey-Hagborg used 23andMe, a DNA analysis service, for Stranger Visions.|$|R
40|$|Massively {{parallel}} sequencing {{enables the}} sequencing of whole genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes from many tumor samples. Thus, {{it now is}} <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> comprehensively <b>identify</b> somatic mutations, including single base changes, deletions, insertions, and genomic rearrangements. Early results for hematopoietic tumors show great promise, but many questions remain to be answered...|$|R
5|$|The {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of 9 Zeros and 18 D3As, {{one of each}} aborting with mechanical problems. The former strafed Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay {{before moving on to}} attack Bellows Army Airfield. They strafed the airfield, and shot down two Curtiss P-40 fighters attempting to take off when the Zeros arrived and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber that had earlier diverted from Hickam Army Airfield, and also destroyed a Stinson O-49 observation aircraft on the ground for the loss of one of their own. The fighters with remaining ammunition expended it strafing MCAS Ewa, the rendezvous point for the second-wave fighters. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but it is not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> which aircraft attacked which ship. Two D3As from Hiryū were lost during the attack, one shot down by Second Lieutenant George Welch.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E

50|$|DNA {{sequence}} information underpins genetic research, enabling discoversies {{of important}} biological or medical benefit. Compared with previous discovery strategies, a whole-genome sequencing study {{is no longer}} constrained by differing patterns of linkage disequilibrium, thus, in theory, is more <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> directly <b>identify</b> the genetic variants contributing to biological traits or medical outcomes.|$|R
50|$|DSM {{analysis}} {{can also be}} used to manage the effects of a change. For example, if the specification for a component had to be changed, it would be <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>identify</b> all processes or activities which had been dependent on that specification, reducing the risk that work continues based on out-of-date information.|$|R
40|$|Although micrometeorites of {{cometary origin}} {{are thought to}} be the {{dominant}} component of interplanetary dust, it has never been <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> positively <b>identify</b> such micrometer-sized particles.
