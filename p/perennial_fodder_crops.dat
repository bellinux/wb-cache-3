5000|$|The Eighth Plan {{called for}} {{increasing}} the average annual gross harvest of cereals to between 780,000 and 800,000 tons; potatoes to between 150,000 and 160,000 tons; vegetables to between 50,000 and 80,000 tons; silage crops to between 280,000 and 300,000 tons; and annual and <b>perennial</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> to between 330,000 and 360,000 tons. Emphasis was placed on raising crop production and quality by increasing mechanization, improving and expanding acreage, raising crop yields, expanding irrigation, selecting cereal varieties better adapted to natural climatic conditions and better locations for cereal cultivation. [...] It also meant applying greater volumes of organic and mineral fertilizers; building more storage facilities; reducing losses because of pests, weeds, and plant diseases; and preventing soil erosion. Emphasis also was put on improving management of crop production on state farms and negdels {{as well as of}} procurement, transport, processing, and storage of agricultural products.|$|E
40|$|The subsoil (i. e. {{the soil}} beneath the {{ploughed}} soil layer) provides a large potential reservoir of nutrients for crops but {{the conditions for}} nutrient acquisition are generally adverse due tolow organic matter contents, low nutrient concentration in the soil solution, low microbial activity and high bulk density. However, the structural heterogeneity of the subsoil including biopores created by roots and earthworms requires a more detailed view on nutrient acquisition processes. First results from the DFG research unit ‘Crop Sequence and the Nutrient Acquisition from the Subsoil’ have shown that cultivation of <b>perennial</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> with taproot systems can result in enhanced biopore density in the subsoil and increased root-length density of subsequent crops.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} effect of the water deficit on {{selected}} species of <b>perennial</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> ? grass and clover, as well as annual fodder crops, by comparing different species in conditions of changing climate and increasing extreme weather events, especially drought. Assesssment was based on comparing different literature and Internet data. Among the clover the following were evaluated as prospective for growing in dry weather - Onobrychis viciifolia, Lotus corniculatus, Medicago lupulina and Melilotus albus. Among the grass Festuca arundinacea and Bromus inermis proved to resist drought the best. Among the annual fodder crops Sorghum vulgare best resisted drought. In dry weather using grass and clover mixtures, which reach more balanced yields than some monocultures, proved to be more suitable. More attention should be paid to the issue of drought resistance because in the future such crops and species will be required that prove higher abiotic stress resistance, especially drought resistance...|$|E

Additional plant-available water can enable stands to cope with dry periods in early summer, which will take place more often in future due to climate change. In this context we investigated whether crop species or cropping period of forage cropping influenced rates of photosynthesis and transpiration as indicators for water availability of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) ...|$|R
40|$|Intensification of {{extremely}} weather phenomena during vegetation period of plants determined serious problems for Romanian farmers by partial or total disparagement of {{cultures in the}} last years. These problems are also common for fodder producing farmers from Transylvania. Among the alternatives, which farmers can follow, the revision of structure and gravity of crops can be considered. Sown pastures with complex mixtures (more than three <b>perennial</b> <b>fodder</b> grass and legume species) well adapted to the new ecological conditions, through their multifunctional character, can represent real alternatives to annual <b>fodder</b> <b>crops.</b> In this paper {{the results of a}} study regarding 8 complex mixtures of <b>perennial</b> <b>fodder</b> species and a pure alfalfa crop, cultivated on three levels of fertilization, are presented.

40|$|Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense) is a {{widespread}} weed in organic farming. It is difficult to control and in many farming enterprises {{there is a tendency}} of increase. Reduced frequency and intensity of tillage may be one reason for increasing problems. We studied the impact of stubble tillage and primary tillage on population-dynamics of C. arvense. In this paper results are presented of two field experiments at the ‘Experimental Station for Organic Farming Kleinhohenheim’, one field experiment on ‘Goldener Acker’ at Hohenheim and 19 experiments on organic farms south of Stuttgart. The experiments were carried out between 1998 and 2003. Results show that inversion in autumn or winter is vital for the control of C. arvense. In an experiment testing various ploughing options plus non inversion tillage C. arvense rapidly increased in plots with yearly non inversion tillage but was kept at a low level in ploughed plots, with lower densities of C. arvense shoots in plots with deep ploughing compared to shallow ploughing. Experiments on stubble tillage showed that tillage in summer effectively can reduce growth of C. arvense. However, shallow ploughing which was seen as the optimal option before the widespread introduction of herbicides appears to have no advantages compared to stubble tillage operations by a cultivator, rototiller or other machines. So, modern machinery adequately controls C. arvense and {{there is no need for}} a renaissance of the old fashioned shallow plough. We conclude that tillage during summer and autumn is vital to control C. arvense and therefore to achieve adequate yields. Another important component for keeping C. arvense and other perennial weeds on a reasonable level is an adequate proportion of <b>perennial</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> within the rotation. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of clover-grasses in the {{structure}} of <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> grown on arable soil, especially those with intergeneric hybrids as the main component part, could avert the negative current trend, i. e. further decreasing the area of <b>perennial</b> <b>fodder</b> plants or <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> as a whole on arable soil. They have an irreplaceable role in crop sequences and in preserving the cultural character of the countryside, above all {{due to the fact that}} they improve soil fertility and microbial life in the soil and that they have an excellent pre-produce value, and, at the same time, they are applied in various farming systems (both conventional and ecological) and in various climatic conditions, and agricultural businesses are well equipped for growing, harvesting and storing them. In the Czech Republic, the area of <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> grown on arable soil was decreased from 1, 019. 9 thousand hectares to mere 396. 7 thousand hectares between 1980 and 2009, which is 15. 6 [*]% of the total area of arable soil whereas <b>perennial</b> <b>fodder</b> plants only take up 8. 5 [*]%. <b>Fodder</b> from clover <b>crops</b> and clover-grass growths on arable soil are one of the main resources of voluminous fodder for dairy cows. Most of this fodder is preserved through a fermentation process (silages, hay storage); a smaller part is fed as fresh fodder, or serves for production of hay. Silages made with <b>perennial</b> <b>fodder</b> plants are the most important source of both proteins and other nutrients for ruminants, especially for high-yielding milch cows. The basis of fodder production systems are the conservative elements of the landscape area (geomorphology) in combination with the progressive elements (weather conditions, plants and human labour) and relict ones, the representative of which is the soil. The fodder production systems in Europe are divided into five main fodder production zones. From this point of view, the areas where short-term clover-grass mixtures are grown on arable soil could be classed with Zone 4, i. e. intensive fodder production and cattle breeding. This characterisation corresponds with the Vysočina Region (the Czech Republic), which is the focus of our work even though extensive breeding can be found in this area on a smaller scale as well. Therefore, our aim was to verify the production and qualitative parameters of the <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> and mixtures included in the test in chosen agricultural businesses in the Vysočina Region and to recommend the most suitable variant for the given area. A statistically significant correlative relationship (P < 0. 05) was proved between the net energy for lactation contents and the percentage of organic matter digestibility. The evaluation of the production parameters evidently shows the favourable influence of the grass component part or of intergeneric hybrids on the stability of dry matter yield per hectare as well as on the stability of individual nutrients...|$|R

40|$|The Livestock Development Project {{aimed at}} {{increasing}} domestic production {{of meat and}} milk from local sheep and goats in southern and some northern governorates of Yemen through the implementation of programmes in form of technical packages to upgrade extension/veterinary services, train FEAs, VTs and rural women, and extend to farmers technical packages in fodder/animal production and health. Project achievements resulted in a significant impact on: (i) generation of more income from increased farmers' output and the sale of more fodder and animals; (ii) enhancement {{of the role of}} rural women in agricultural development; (iii) transfer of technology through the introduction of new <b>perennial</b> high-yielding <b>fodder</b> <b>crops,</b> improvement in the productivity of traditional fodders, and better animal husbandry/health practices; (iv) human resources development through intensive training of the national cadre; (v) development of support services to ensure sustainable development; and, (vi) an environmental improvement, through desertification control using windbreaks. It is important that the successful results of the Livestock Development Project are sustained in the future and applied on a national scale {{in order to meet the}} ever increasing demand for milk and meat by the rapidly growing population. FAO recommends that Government policy should support expansion of livestock programmes as one of the major elements in its development plans. Government agencies and organizations such as the Agricultural Research and Extension Authority (AREA), Directorate General of Animal Resources (DGAR), Directorate for Forest and Range Resources (DFRR), and the Regional Departments of Animal Wealth should be upgraded and should be involved in the planning, implementation and monitoring of the various activities of these programmes. They should have a clearly-stated policy and coordination among themselves. In specific technical areas the following aspects, in particular, are emphasized: (i) continued fodder promotion activities throughout Yemen to provide an ecologically-sound feedbase; (ii) upgrading of the extension and veterinary services and the establishment of a livestock extension system; (iii) enhancement of the role of rural women; (iv) training of a national cadre, and the development of training institutes.
