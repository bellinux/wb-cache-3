The regulations make <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> extending the period of validity of a passport; however, after a passport is expired, there is no <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal,</b> and instead a new application {{must be made to}} the Passport and Immigration Office.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} 10 years the Stationers {{repeatedly}} advocated bills to re-authorize the old licensing system, but Parliament declined to enact them. Faced with this failure, the Stationers decided to emphasise {{the benefits of}} licensing to authors rather than publishers, and the Stationers succeeded in getting Parliament to consider a new bill. This bill, which after substantial amendments was granted Royal Assent on 5 April 1710, {{became known as the}} Statute of Anne due to its passage during the reign of Queen Anne. The new law prescribed a copyright term of 14 years, with a <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>for</b> a similar term, during which only the author and the printers they chose to license their works to could publish the author's creations. Following this, the work's copyright would expire, with the material falling into the public domain. Despite a period of instability known as the Battle of the Booksellers when the initial copyright terms under the Statute began to expire, the Statute of Anne remained in force until the Copyright Act 1842 replaced it.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the first major enunciation of the Five Principles is not wholly encouraging. China has often {{emphasized}} its close association with the Five Principles. It had put them forward, as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, {{at the start of}} negotiations that took place in Delhi from December 1953 to April 1954 between the Delegation of the PRC Government and the Delegation of the Indian Government on the {{relations between the two countries}} with respect to the disputed territories of Aksai Chin and what China calls South Tibet and India Pradesh. The 29 April 1954 agreement mentioned above was set to last for eight years. When it lapsed, relations were already souring, the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal</b> of the agreement was not taken up, and the Sino-Indian War broke out between the two sides. However, in the 1970s, the Five Principles again came to be seen as important in Sino-Indian relations, and more generally as norms of relations between states. They have become widely recognized and accepted throughout the region.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, it was {{announced}} that the Sudanese President Omar al Bashir signed several cooperation agreements with King Salman of Saudi Arabia during a visit to Riyadh. Among the agreements was a pledge from the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation to restructure SAR22.5 million riyals (USD6 million) worth of debt. In addition, <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> fleet <b>renewal</b> at Sudan Airways were also made.it was reported Saudi Arabia may equip the Sudan Airways with fourteen aircraft including three B777s, three A320-200s, six Embraer Regional Jets, and two A330-200s.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of steel trusses and timber trusses {{in the same}} bridge {{is considered to be}} justified by the high price of bridge steel and concrete work at the time of construction, it being cheaper to build all approach spans of timber and to make <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> possible <b>renewal</b> with steel and concrete when the life of the timber has reached its limit. For this reason the main piers were designed to support 200-ft. steel flanking spans at some future time, each to replace the present 121-ft. and 70-ft. spans.|$|R
50|$|Hurried and {{preoccupied with}} other matters {{associated}} with his recall, the departing governor neglected to make specific <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> the <b>renewal</b> of the expiring {{authority for the}} collection of customs duties. Actually the authority expired in November 1680, but no attention was called to the matter for many months. Then, in May 1681, opportunity knocked for Beekman. Governor Andros had departed; the lieutenant-governor was temporarily absent from the province and Mayor Dyer, collector of customs, was laid low by illness. With no authority to continue the expired taxes without express orders from the Duke of York, Mayor Dyer, who was also tax collector, continued to levy customs taxes.|$|R
50|$|On 12 November 1942, the Secretary of War and Standard Oil Co. (San Francisco) {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} (unnumbered lease {{to run with}} lease W-868-ENG-4504), whereby Standard Oil agreed to install, operate, and maintain lubricating oil storage and distribution facilities at the site. In addition, on 20 December 1943, the CAA was granted a permit (to run with Lease No. W-868-ENG-4505) to use and occupy two parcels of land totaling 11.2 acres at the Modification Center for a radio range and communication building site, together with a right of way between the two parcels for establishing and maintaining subsurface cable lines. The original permit period ended 30 June 1944, however, the lease contained a <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> annual <b>renewal,</b> {{at the option of}} the government, through 30 June 1967. Upon the expiration of the permit, all CAA property was to have been removed to a condition satisfactory to the Commanding Office or other competent military authority.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{progressive}} reforms were introduced during Colombo's time as prime minister. A housing reform law of 22 October 1971 introduced new criteria for land expropriations and <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> urban <b>renewals.</b> Under {{a law of}} 6 December 1971, state funds were made available {{for the construction of}} a kindegarten in every local authority. A law of 30 December 1971 introduced new regulations covering protection of female workers and maternity insurance. The duration of maternity leave was extended two months prior to, and two months after confinement for all employees, and all female workers were entitled to an earnings-related indemnity, equal to 80% of earnings (including agricultural workers and tenant farmers). Also introduced was an entitlement to voluntary extra period of leave for six months during the first year of the child’s life, with job security and an indemnity equal to 30% of earnings, together with an entitlement to paid absences due to the child’s sickness during the first three years if the child’s life. In addition, a special natality allowance was introduced for self-employed women in the agricultural, artisan, and commercial sectors.|$|R
5000|$|Chiau {{also participated}} in the {{deliberation}} process of《Special Statute for the Comprehensive Management of River Basins》, which was officially passed on January 14, 2014. This statute encompasses the key issues throughout all the national territories, with overall planning of up, mid and downstream waters. Chiau advocates and stresses that the watercourses can be controlled by both subtle and rigid means to increase permeation spaces and those of retention basins or green areas. With comprehensive watercourse controls, measures against climate change can be employed {{with the assistance of}} public participation to prepare plans and determine the optimal means for future watercourse control. In Taiwan, an island regularly suffering from either floods or drought, the focus shall not be solely on watercourse control, but rather the creation of a “water conservation oriented society” with introspective national land planning and water resource management that will not accept a single moment’s delay.Furthermore, Chiau believes that the relevant <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> urban <b>renewal</b> infringe upon human rights and override the protection of human rights set down in the Constitution, as well as the protection of property. Taiwan is lacking overall planning and concern for the preservation, protection and management of submarine cultural assets and interest in the conflict of the utilization of marine resources. Chiau also plants to address the damage and collapse of national land and landscapes in the future. Other of Chiau’s acts include the《Amendment of Urban Renewal Act》, the《Landscape Bill》, the《Landscape Architect Bill》, the《Marine Area Management Bill》, the《Amendment of Cultural Heritage Preservation Act》, and the《Indigenous Peoples’ Land and Marine Area Bill》.|$|R
