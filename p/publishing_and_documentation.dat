40|$|The keeping {{of goats}} has {{increased}} greatly {{in the last}} decade. Goats {{are a source of}} high-quality protein in both their milk and meat; they have a good fodder/protein conversion ratio; by-products such as cheese, suckling kids, mohair and cashmere are increasingly popular; and they can control brushwood and so reduce the risk of bush fires. The 'social' status of goats has risen accordingly, over-riding the social and religious taboos that were once associated with them. (See also Dossier this issue). However, knowledge of goat husbandry, nutrition and products has not kept up with {{the increase in the number}} of goats kept in the developing world. FAO's Goat Nutriton and Feeding working group and its goat sub-network have researched the subject for eight years, and Goat nutrition, a 308 page comprehensive handbook is the result. The book has been published with the help of CTA and other organizations concerned with agricultural development in the Third World and in the Mediterranean countries. The book is aimed at a wide readership of researchers, teachers, students and extension officers, decision-makers, veterinarians and livestock specialists and farmers. It is divided into four parts: general goat nutrition; evaluation and utilization of feeds; feeding of adult goats; and feeding of young goats.

40|$|International audienceThe {{question}} of WWI {{aims of the}} Kingdom of Hungary, constituting a distinct State within the Habsburg Monarchy, remains almost unexplored.

This way, the Hungarian strategic thought during the war appears to have constantly balanced between perspectives of territorial enlargement (in case of a victory of Central Powers) and independence (in case of the Entente’s success). Both alternatives had a common goal – to maximally secure the political freedom and territories of Hungary. The paper is based on the analysis and synthesis of available sources in Hungarian, Slovak, English, French and Russian (relevant historiography, <b>published</b> <b>and</b> archives <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> memoirs) ...|$|R

Secondly, the management of therural wealth of the Vizcayan and Guipuzcoan heads of lineages, in which the role of churches of lay patronage plays a central role.

40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on the Punic {{settlement}} of Pani Loriga starting from the review of material from the old excavations and the analysis of the recent work undertaken by ISMA. The re-examination of the <b>published</b> <b>and</b> unpublished <b>documentation</b> concerning the excavations directed by Ferruccio Barreca allows us to confirm that the site was probably founded {{at the end of the}} 7 th century BC. The transfer of a community of people with an Eastern tradition to a hill near the modern town of Santadi must be seen within a precise program of territorial control initiated by the powerful settlement of Sulky. In this defensive system Pani Loriga occupied a strategic position of primary importance, as the settlement was to act as a link between the coastal hinterland and the internal areas of the country, rich in minerals and agro-pastoral products. This function was maintained through the following Punic phase. The importance of the settlement is shown by Carthage’s strong interest in it, which has been clearly demonstrated by the recent excavations by ISMA which identified and partially revealed vast living areas, that were originally built between the end of the 6 th and the early 5 th century BC, that is, in the earliest phase of the north African metropolis’ presence on Sardinia...|$|R
