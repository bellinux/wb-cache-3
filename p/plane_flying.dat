5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a <b>plane</b> <b>flying</b> in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E
5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a <b>plane</b> <b>flying</b> to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E

A jazzed-up version of the theme was heard during the closing credits {{for the first two}} seasons, followed by a more up-tempo version with a piano lead from season 3 onward. The closing credits were changed in season 6 with the tag scene accompanied by the closing credits (for NBC's original airings, the generic credits were used when NBC started doing this in the 1994-1995 season as well), though some episodes from seasons 6-8, including the series finale, used the standard closing sequence from seasons 1-5 (but with a slightly different font).|$|E
25|$|The Egyptian flight, {{having been}} {{authorized}} by its government, was lawful under international law. The Egyptian government protested the American interception of its plane {{which was not}} legal under international law. (Egypt's arguments were somewhat diminished by its own previous justification for its 1978 raid at Locna airport in Cyprus.) Not only had the Americans not gotten consent from the Italians to forcibly land a non-hostile <b>plane</b> <b>flying</b> in compliance with International Law at Sigonella, but the American military action was taken solely for American purposes (not those of the NATO alliance) and was taken {{in order to secure}} criminals – this was in violation of the purely joint military purposes that the Italians had agreed to when deciding to share the utilization the Italian base.|$|E
25|$|When Peterson and Davis did {{not arrive}} at Fort Bliss on Sunday afternoon, the men there assumed they had either {{returned}} to Marfa Field or made a forced landing. When they were unaccounted for on Monday, a search was begun. Flying over the patrol route, 1st Lts. Frank Estell and Russell H. Cooper surmised that Peterson and Davis might have mistakenly followed the Conches into Mexico. The region along the Conches almost {{as far as}} Chihuahua City {{was added to the}} area covered by search planes. Tuesday afternoon Peterson and Davis saw a <b>plane</b> <b>flying</b> up the Conches, but they were in thick brush and could not attract the crew’s attention. The search continued until Sunday, 17 August 1919. Then Capt. Leonard F. Matlack, commanding Troop K, 8th Cavalry, at Candelaria, received word Peterson and Davis were being held for ransom.|$|E

500|$|Dallas {{was raised}} to {{lieutenant}} colonel and appointed to the command of a wing, but would never see the message from headquarters that arrived on 1June 1918 advising him of the promotion and ordering him to cease flying. He disappeared on a solo mission the same day. It was later learned {{that he had been}} killed over Liévin during combat with three Fokker Triplanes from Jagdstaffel 14, probably by its commander, Leutnant Johannes Werner. There are several theories as to how he died. The common elements are that he was on patrol near the front line when he pounced on a German <b>plane</b> <b>flying</b> at a lower level, that there might have been another unknown British pilot in trouble, and that the Germans who shot Dallas down had dived from a still higher altitude. Medics near his crash site at Absalom Trench ventured into no man's land and retrieved his body, while a patrol of eight volunteers salvaged his personal effects from the fallen aircraft.

500|$|The mainly {{computer}} generated music video for [...] "Play" [...] {{was directed by}} Francis Lawrence. Set in a futuristic multi-level spaceship, the clip begins with Lopez strutting into the boarding area whilst the other passengers gaze at her in awe. The video then cuts to Lopez, now on the plane, relaxing {{with a pair of}} headphones on listening to music. Various shots showing the plane's exterior are inter cut with these scenes of the singer. Lopez is then seen entering a room through sliding doors with a new outfit. The doors lead to a club filled with dancers. Intercut with these scenes are Lopez dancing solo on a platform, later joined by back-up dancers. Towards the music video's conclusion, Lopez asks the DJ (who takes the avatar of an iris) to play her favorite song. Its final shot depicts the <b>plane</b> <b>flying</b> towards the horizon. The music video, much like [...] "Love Don't Cost a Thing", also features Cris Judd as a back-up dancer, who would later go on to become her second husband months later.|$|E
