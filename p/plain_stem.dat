50|$|White asphodel {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 50 - 120 cm. The <b>plain</b> <b>stem</b> is {{supported}} by fleshy, thickened roots (rhizomes). The leaves, which originate {{from the base of}} the stem, are gutter-shaped and glaucous (covered by a waxy coating), about 20 - 22 mm wide and 50 - 70 cm long. The white hermaphroditic flowers are funnel-shaped, 4 cm of diameter, with six elongated petals. The flowering period extends from April through June. The egg-shaped yellow-green seed capsules are usually 8 - 10 mm in length.|$|E
5000|$|The i form, {{also called}} the conjunctive, the continuative, the infinitive, the {{nominative}} or the ren'yōkei form, {{may be used for}} two main purposes: deriving nouns from verbs and creating compound constructions. This form can be achieved by simply changing the vowel -u of the underlying plain form to -i, and then applying the necessary sound changes afterwards. Contrary to the standard Japanese language, this form is completely regular for verbs ending with the <b>plain</b> <b>stem</b> -ru. Thus, the underlying verb 食もる tamoru [...] "eat" [...] would become 食もい tamoi (< tamori), instead of just reducing to the root as in standard Japanese.|$|E
5000|$|There may, however, be some {{irregularity}} when deriving nouns or compounds, as verbs {{ending with}} the <b>plain</b> <b>stems</b> -u and -ru may become a moraic obstruent {{as opposed to the}} vowel [...] For example, the underlying verb 買う kau [...] "buy" [...] could become [...] in its nominal form rather than [...] "buying", also creating a doublet between かっもん [...] and けもん [...] "shopping". [...] Similarly, the underlying verb 知る shiru [...] "know" [...] could become [...] rather than , leading to the polite construction 知っもさん [...] "not know" [...] rather than [...]|$|R

50|$|The Ardagh Hoard, {{best known}} for the Ardagh Chalice, is a hoard of {{metalwork}} from the 8th and 9th centuries. Found in 1868, it is now on display in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. It consists of the chalice, a much <b>plainer</b> <b>stemmed</b> cup in copper-alloy, and four brooches, three elaborate pseudo-penannular ones, and one a true pennanular brooch of the thistle type; this is the latest object in the hoard, and suggests it may have been deposited around 900. The chalice ranks with the Book of Kells as one of the finest known works of Insular art, indeed of Celtic art in general, and is thought to {{have been made in the}} 8th century AD. Elaborate brooches, essentially the same as those worn by important laypeople, appear to have been worn by monastic clergy to fasten vestments of the period.|$|R
5000|$|The {{village has}} two churches. Situated {{on a hill}} {{to the north of}} the village is the old parish church of St Marys which is locally {{referred}} to as the Chapel. The oldest part of the building has been dated back to the 13th century but only the chancel of the original building now remains, to which a western porch has been added. There remain some ancient stained glass in the windows and some encaustic tiles in the floor. The font, of the 15th century, has an octagonal bowl with a moulded lower edge, and a <b>plain</b> <b>stem.</b> In the bowl one of the two staples remains. The memorials are to the Knights of Barrells Hall and a coloured memorial to Sir Francis Throkmorton who died in 1554 The roof and bell tower were still under restoration at the turn of the 2000 millennium but at a service attended by 80 parishioners on the morning of 1 January 2000 the old bell was made to [...] "ring in" [...] the 21st Century by throwing Golf balls into the bell tower. The balls were recovered some years later when the restoration was completed.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation to determine the coefficients of discharge of nozzles with small, round orifices of the size used with high-speed compression-ignition engines. The injection pressures and chamber back pressures employed were comparable to those existing in compression-ignition engines during injection. The construction of the nozzles was varied to determine the effect of the nozzle design on the coefficient. Tests were also made with nozzles assembled in an automatic injection valve, both with a plain and with a helically grooved stem. It was found that a smooth passage before the orifice is requisite for high flow efficiency. A beveled leading edge before the orifice gave a higher coefficient of discharge than a rounded edge. The results with the nozzles assembled in an automatic injection valve having a <b>plain</b> <b>stem</b> duplicated those with the nozzles assembled {{at the end of a}} straight tube of constant diameter. Lower coefficients were obtained with the nozzles assembled in an injection valve having a helically grooved stem.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{variations}} of orifice length to diameter ratio on spray characteristics was determined for a 0. 014 -inch and a 0. 040 -inch orifice for ratio of 0. 5 to 4. 0. The nozzles containing the orifices were mounted in an injection valve and tested {{with a plan}} stem and with a helically grooved stem. The injection pressure was varied from 4000 to 8000 {{pounds per square inch}}. The air density into which the fuel was sprayed was varied from the density obtained with a pressure of 60 pounds per square inch to the density obtained with a pressure of 250 pounds per square inch at room temperature. The tests showed that increasing the orifice length to diameter ratio with a <b>plain</b> <b>stem</b> in the injection valve causes the spray tip penetration first to decrease, reaching a minimum between a ratio of 1. 5 and 2. 5, and then to increase, reaching a maximum at a ratio greater than 3. 5. The spray cone angle showed little change with variation of the ratio. With a helically grooved stem and small ratio of orifice area to groove area, the penetration at first shows little tendency towards a minimum; but as the time of injection is increased to 0. 004 second, the penetration becomes a minimum at a ratio between 0. 5 and 2. 0...|$|E
40|$|For CLEF 2008 JHU {{conducted}} monolingual and bilingual {{experiments in}} the ad hoc TEL and Persian tasks. The TEL task involved focused on searching electronic card catalog records in English, French, and German {{using data from the}} British Library, the Bibliotheque Nationale de France, and the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek (Austrian National Library). The approach we adopted for TEL was to strip out non-content sections of records and to treat the task as ordinary full-text search using character n-grams and stemmed words. For the Persian task, which is based on the Hamshahri corpus, several different forms of textual normalization were compared. Using the provided training topics we compared character n-grams, n-gram stems, ordinary words, words automatically segmented into morphemes, and a novel form of n-gram indexing based on n-grams with character skips. On the training topics we found that character 5 -grams and skipgrams performed the best and this was borne out in our official submissions. We also did some post hoc experiments using previous CLEF ad hoc tests sets in 13 languages. In all three tasks we explored alternative methods of tokenizing documents including <b>plain</b> words, <b>stemmed</b> words, automatically induced segments, a single selected n-grams for each words, and all n-grams from words (i. e., traditional character n-grams). Character n-grams demonstrated consistent gains over ordinary words in each of these three diverse sets of experiments. Using mean average precision, relative gains of o...|$|R

40|$|Application of {{quantitative}} methods to the histological {{study of the}} vascular connections of the first bud of seedlings of Pisum sativum L. var, Meteor showed that the inhibition of growth of the first lateral bud, whether promoted {{by the presence of}} the apex or by application of IAA in lanolin to the cut surface of decapitated plants, was not due to any noticeable lack of vascular connections with the stele of the main stem. The results have also indicated that in inhibited buds the smaller development of the vascular connections is rather a consequence than a cause of the bud inhibition. Experiments in whichychanges in the lateral bud behaviour, in the patterns of P translocation and IAA movement were induced either by a constriction of the stem or by a ring of lanolin with NPA (naphthylphthalamic acid) around the stem or by application of CHL (chloramphenicol) to the stump yielded results which do not support the "nutrient diversion" theory. Although no direct and conclusive proof of the irrelevance of the"nutrient diversion" theory could be obtained several features of the results indicate that the lack of nutrients should not be the basic cause of the lateral bud inhibition. Similar conclusion was obtained from the study of the time-course changes of translocation by mapping the radioactivity along the stem and relating them to the behaviour of the bud. The direct application of a cytokinin (6 -Benzylaminopurine) in lanolin paste has caused the release of the lateral bud from apical dominance both in intact and decapitated IAA treated plants, but the supply of 6 -Benzylaminopurine via the basal cut end of stem cuttings was not able to relieve the inhibition promoted by applied IAA, although a stimulatory effect on the lateral bud growth have been obtained in <b>plain</b> lanolin treated <b>stem</b> cuttings. The results, as a whole, lend support to the idea that the incapacity of the lateral bud to compete with the apex of the main stem for some growth regulator(s), indispensable for bud growth and probably from the cytokinin-type, coming up from the root system is the primary cause of its growth inhibition. An explanation of the apical dominance phenomena is attempted with a theoretical model which is based both on the results presented here and on other evidence available from the literature. <p...|$|R
40|$|The Neverver {{language}} is spoken by fewer than 600 people in two inland villages on Malakula Island (Vanuatu). A language documentation project was initiated in August 2004 {{and is now}} drawing to a close. In this paper, I explore {{one of the more}} interesting morphological features of Neverver - the feature of reduplication. I consider how transcribed texts, community language consultants, and linguistic theory have all contributed to developing an understanding of this important feature in Neverver. Reduplication is understood to be a morphological process. It is generally described as type of affixation where the phonological content of the reduplicative affix is underspecified and gains content from the stem or base to which it is attached (cf. Moravcsik 1978; Broselow & McCarthy 1984; Marantz & Wiltshire 2000). Moravcsik (1978 : 305) makes the early observation on reduplication that ‘reference is always made both to the meaning and to the sound form of the constituent to be reduplicated’. Thus, in considering reduplication, the semantic features of the simplex stem, as well as its phonological form are deemed relevant. In terms of phonology, the reduplicative prefix in Neverver has the structure CV(C). This structure preserves the language-specific phonotactic constraint on syllables which states that the maximal structure of a well-formed syllable is CVC. In Neverver, productive reduplication is associated with the verb phrase. It is a common element in detransitive constructions including object incorporation and suppression, as well as reflexive and reciprocal constructions. Reduplication is used as a derivational process to form stative verbs and stative nominal modifiers. It is one of the means of expressing participant and event quantity. It is involved in the expression of certain negative constructions. Verbs, nouns, and members of other word classes may exhibit inherent or fossilized reduplication, where a semantically-related <b>plain</b> <b>stem</b> cannot be identified in the corpus. An important characteristic of reduplication in Neverver is that it frequently occurs in conjunction with other morphological and syntactic features to express particular meanings. Arriving at an understanding of the forms and functions of reduplication in Neverver has been the result of working with a large digitized text corpus, collaborating with multiple language consultants to document simplex and reduplicated forms and meanings, and applying a multi-tiered approach to phonological analysis (cf. Clements & Keyser 1983; Goldsmith 1990). I suggest that engaging in language documentation has allowed me to provide a rich record and analysis of reduplication that will have a lasting value for the community of Neverver speakers.
