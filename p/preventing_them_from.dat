5|$|A common {{concern among}} reviewers is the {{overhead}} perspective, which critics have bemoaned for <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> judging pathway routes and an object's location {{in relation to}} its background. Besides this, the actual visuals were generally well received, {{as well as the}} setting and animations. The audio was commended for combining both originality and nostalgia, even though it looped frequently.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 1962, a PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (registration CF-IHA) crashed during landing at Nuuk Airport. The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} a mechanical malfunction in the nose wheel doors <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> closing during landing on water, resulting in the aircraft sinking. The accident killed 15 of the 21 people on board.|$|E

5|$|Edge and Orton {{formed an}} {{alliance}} in October 2006 {{to challenge the}} team of Triple H and Shawn Michaels, collectively known as D-Generation X (DX), who Rated-RKO felt were <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> becoming world champions. Rated-RKO would succeed in defeating DX, giving the latter their first loss since their reunion in June 2006. The following month, Edge and Orton became World Tag Team Champions, and Lita left the group after her legitimate retirement.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> suing or testifying in court.|$|E
5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> being absorbed. Notable examples are oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid, which {{are high in}} plant-based diets. Calcium and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|E

5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{contribute to}} antioxidant defense by chelating transition metals and <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> catalyzing {{the production of}} free radicals in the cell. Particularly important {{is the ability to}} sequester iron, which is the function of iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin. Selenium and zinc are commonly referred to as antioxidant nutrients, but these chemical elements have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{trees are}} also girdled {{to act as}} trap trees to monitor for emerald ash borer. The {{stressed}} tree attracts egg-laying females {{in the spring and}} trees can be debarked in the fall to search for larvae. If detected, an area is often placed under a quarantine to prevent infested wood material from causing new infestations. Further control measures are then taken within the area to slow population growth by reducing beetle numbers, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> reaching reproductive maturity and dispersing, and reducing the abundance of ash trees.|$|E
5|$|The bombing had {{destroyed}} the north {{wing of the}} school. During the search, rescuers found an additional 500pounds (230kg) of dynamite which had failed to detonate in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices, and they found an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in {{the second set of}} bombs, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.|$|E

5|$|Unbeknownst to the Byzantines, Khalid had {{prepared}} {{for such a}} contingency by placing a strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises, which gave the Muslims {{time to prepare for}} battle. At the center, the Byzantines did not press hard, intending to pin down the Muslim centre corps in their position and <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> aiding the Muslim army in other areas. Thus the center remained stable.|$|E
5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E

50|$|The SSA makes {{available}} to disabled Americans {{two forms of}} disability benefits: Social Security Disability Insurance, (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Social Security pays disability benefits to citizens who have worked long enough and have a medical condition that has <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> working or is expected to <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> working for at least 12 months or end in death.|$|R

5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1633, Commonwealth forces retook Dorogobuzh, an {{important}} Russian supply point after its capture the year before. This setback wrecked Russian plans to send reinforcements to Shein's army, although in any event the Russians did not begin to gather a 5,000-strong army for that purpose until January 1634. Also that autumn, Grand Crown Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski defeated an Ottoman incursion {{in the south of}} the Commonwealth, freeing his force to lay siege to the Russian town of Sevsk; although Koniecpolski failed to take the fortress, he tied down large Russian forces, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> moving north towards Smolensk.|$|E
5|$|It {{was more}} {{difficult}} to take Koroni. General Sébastiani showed up there on October 7 with a party from his brigade. The fort commander’s response was similar to those given at Navarino and Methoni. Sébastiani sent his sappers, who were pushed back by rocks thrown from atop the walls. A dozen men were wounded, among them Cavaignac and, more seriously, a captain, a sergeant and three sappers. The other French soldiers felt insulted and their general had great difficulty in <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> opening fire and taking the stronghold by force. The Amphitrite, the Breslaw and the Wellesley came to {{the assistance of the}} ground troops. The threat they posed led the Ottoman commander to surrender. On October 9, the French entered Koroni and seized 80 cannons and guns, along with numerous victuals and munitions.|$|E
