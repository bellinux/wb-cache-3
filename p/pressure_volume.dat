25|$|Therefore, {{internal}} energy changes {{in an ideal}} gas may be described solely by changes in its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is simply the {{internal energy}} of the perfect gas and depends entirely on its <b>pressure,</b> <b>volume</b> and thermodynamic temperature.|$|E

5000|$|The macrostate of {{a system}} is {{what we know about}} the system, for example the temperature, <b>pressure,</b> and <b>volume</b> of a gas in a box. For each set of values of temperature, <b>pressure,</b> and <b>volume</b> there are many {{arrangements}} of molecules which result in those values. The number of arrangements of molecules which could result in the same values for temperature, <b>pressure</b> and <b>volume</b> is the number of microstates.|$|R
50|$|The transpulmonary <b>pressure</b> vs <b>Volume</b> {{curve of}} {{inhalation}} {{is different from}} the <b>Pressure</b> vs <b>Volume</b> curve of exhalation, the difference being described as hysteresis. Lung volume at any given pressure during inhalation is less than the lung volume at any given pressure during exhalation.|$|R
25|$|The {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} plays {{a central role in}} maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis via <b>pressure,</b> <b>volume,</b> and chemoreceptor signals. It does this by regulating the peripheral vasculature, and kidney function, which in turn affect cardiac output, vascular resistance, and fluid retention. Excess activity of the sympathetic nervous system increases blood pressure and contributes to hypertension.|$|E
25|$|In {{physics and}} thermodynamics, an {{equation}} of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describes the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions. It is a constitutive equation which provides a mathematical relationship between two or more state functions associated with the matter, such as its <b>pressure,</b> <b>volume,</b> temperature (PVT), or internal energy. Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.|$|E
25|$|Because most gases are {{difficult}} to observe directly, they are described {{through the use of}} four physical properties or macroscopic characteristics: <b>pressure,</b> <b>volume,</b> number of particles (chemists group them by moles) and temperature. These four characteristics were repeatedly observed by scientists such as Robert Boyle, Jacques Charles, John Dalton, Joseph Gay-Lussac and Amedeo Avogadro for a variety of gases in various settings. Their detailed studies ultimately led to a mathematical relationship among these properties expressed by the ideal gas law (see simplified models section below).|$|E

25|$|A {{ventilator}} assists breathing {{using either}} pressure control or volume control {{based on the}} equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact {{is known as the}} equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: Pressure = (Elastance × Volume) + (Resistance × Flow)In this equation, <b>pressure,</b> <b>volume,</b> and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient’s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in elastance and resistance.Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (<b>pressure,</b> <b>volume,</b> or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practical}} {{basis of}} thermometry is {{the existence of}} triple point cells. [...] Triple points are conditions of <b>pressure,</b> <b>volume</b> and temperature such that three phases are simultaneously present, for example solid, vapor and liquid. [...] For a single component there are no degrees of freedom at a triple point and {{any change in the}} three variables results in {{one or more of the}} phases vanishing from the cell. [...] Therefore, triple point cells can be used as universal references for temperature and pressure (see Gibbs phase rule).|$|E
