50|$|The Bharbhunja in Uttar Pradesh are {{traditionally}} grain <b>parchers.</b> They have a mixed origin, with some {{claiming to be}} of Shaikh origin, while other claiming Rajput origin.

As Babbitt sneaked from Floral Heights down to the Bunch, so the young gallants sneaked from the proprieties of the Bunch off to [...] "times" [...] with bouncing young women whom they picked up in department stores and at hotel coatrooms. Once Babbitt tried to accompany them. There was a motor car, a bottle of whisky, and for him a grubby shrieking cash-girl from <b>Parcher</b> and Stein's. He sat beside her and worried. He was apparently expected to [...] "jolly her along," [...] but when she sang out, [...] "Hey, leggo, quit crushing me cootie-garage," [...] he did not quite know how to go on.

Though Babbitt admired this savant, and appreciated Sidney Finkelstein as [...] "a mighty smart buyer and a good liberal spender," [...] it was to Vergil Gunch that he turned with enthusiasm. Mr. Gunch {{was president of the}} Boosters' Club, a weekly lunch-club, local chapter of a national organization which promoted sound business and friendliness among Regular Fellows. He was also no less an official than Esteemed Leading Knight in the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and it was rumored that at the next election he would be a candidate for Exalted Ruler. He was a jolly man, given to oratory and to chumminess with the arts. He called on the famous actors and vaudeville artists when they came to town, gave them cigars, addressed them by their first names, and--sometimes--succeeded in bringing them to the Boosters' lunches to give The Boys a Free Entertainment. He was a large man with hair en brosse, and he knew the latest jokes, but he played poker close to the chest. It was at his party that Babbitt had sucked in the virus of to-day's restlessness.|$|E

To William's constant irritation, his ten-year-old sister Jane and the Baxters' Negro handyman, Genesis, persist in treating him as an equal instead of the serious-minded grown-up he now believes himself to be.

5000|$|In 1916, Stephen Mather of the National Park Service made an {{agreement}} with a private concessionaire, D. J.

In 1923, the Park Service decided that the camps should be re-opened and expanded. Ranger and naturalist Carl <b>Parcher</b> Russell hiked through the region and selected locations for five more camps. Three of these were built the following year by a new concessionaire, the Yosemite National Park Company.

The first of many is to catch candies in his mouth from a distance as Ed throws them. Tom successfully catches two but the third lands on his nose. Ed gets a large laugh out of Tom's failure and agrees to give him $200 anyway. The next dare is for Tom to eat a donut dipped in toilet water. Lynette feels that they had enough and that they should quit playing games. Ed sees this as a cry from Tom. This causes Lynette to ask Ed to give her a dare since it is new company policy. Ed dares Lynette to eat a pound of raw bacon and if she succeeds without vomiting the dares will stop. Lynette manages to eat the bacon and Ed stops the dares, saying that Lynette [...] "sucked the fun out of it".|$|E
5000|$|As much as Babbitt {{is about}} the American businessman, it is also about American cities. Zenith's chief virtue is conformity, and its {{religion}} is [...] "boosterism."

In {{a speech to the}} Zenith Real Estate Board, he states: [...] "It may be true that New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia will continue to keep ahead of us in size. But aside from these three cities, which are notoriously so overgrown that no decent white man, nobody who loves his wife and kiddies and God's good out-o'-doors and likes to shake the hand of his neighbor in greeting would want to live in them—and let me tell you right here and now, I wouldn’t trade a high-class Zenith acreage development for the whole length and breadth of Broadway or State Street!—aside from these three, it’s evident to any one with a head for facts that Zenith is the finest example of American life and prosperity to be found anywhere." [...] Zenith is thus presented as more than simply prosperous; it is safe and wholesome.|$|E
