40|$|Abstract: The {{paper will}} be {{sketching}} out a constructivist {{approach to learning}} with microcontent, with special regard to new web technologies emerging in the “blogosphere”, the networked space created by weblogs and widened by many new web services that help to assign metadata to objects, or to construct social networks and webs of trust {{through the use of}} <b>personal</b> <b>publishing</b> or social networking platforms. Especially new "tagging " technologies and practices, creating "soft" metadata, show a possible way to new kinds of collaborative knowledge environments. It will be shown that is not only microcontent itself, but also its contextualization through learnercentered approaches, discussion through trackbacks or commentaries, and “soft ” object metadata which contribute to an understanding of microlearning and provide insights for implementing <b>personal</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>systems</b> in (educational) institutions. Until now, most of these conceptions are emergent on the web, so future research would have to identify possible uses and integration into learning environments and didactical applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: While we are {{currently}} witnessing the renaissance of Tim Berners-Lee's original vision for a Two-Way-Web, many institutions in higher education still develop and maintain landscapes of tools and services that largely ignore the ongoing power-shift towards the individual. This paper argues that these institutional landscapes need to be reorganised and changed into augmented landscapes, in which the application of individually selected and maintained, multi-purpose tools and services becomes possible. Some implications for individuals and institutions in higher education are discussed. 1 Technology enhanced teaching and learning and the renaissance of the Two-Way Web Since the late 1990 's <b>personal</b> authoring and <b>publishing</b> <b>systems</b> that radically simplif...|$|R
