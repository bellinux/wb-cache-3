25|$|During the Jurassic {{there was}} a {{dramatic}} increase in the known diversity of family-level Coleoptera. This includes the development and growth of carnivorous and herbivorous species. Species of the superfamily Chrysomeloidea are believed to have developed around the same time, which include a wide array of plant host ranging from cycads and conifers, to angiosperms. Close to the Upper Jurassic, the portion of the Cupedidae decreased, however {{at the same time the}} diversity of the early plant eating, or <b>phytophagous</b> species increased. Most of the recent <b>phytophagous</b> species of Coleoptera feed on flowering plants or angiosperms.|$|E
25|$|All tessaratomids are <b>phytophagous.</b> They {{generally}} {{feed upon}} plants {{belonging to the}} plant orders Rosales and Sapindales, and {{spend most of their}} lives in tree leaves and stems. They exhibit incomplete metamorphosis and have lifespans that can be several years.|$|E
25|$|Non-biting midges - Chironomidae - these flies have {{a complex}} life cycle. While adults are {{terrestrial}} and <b>phytophagous,</b> larvae are aquatic and detritivorous. Immature instars {{have been used}} as forensic markers in several cases where submerged corpses were found.|$|E
25|$|Adult diopsids are {{typically}} found on low-lying vegetation in humid areas, often near streams and rivers, where they feed on fungi and bacteria, which they scavenge from decaying vegetation. The larvae are saprophagic or <b>phytophagous,</b> eating decaying and fresh plant matter. Diopsis macrophthalma Dalman, 1817, is a pest {{of rice and}} sorghum in tropical Africa.|$|E
25|$|Micropredators {{actively}} {{hunt for}} hosts {{in the manner}} of traditional predators. Micropredators choose hosts that are large but helpless or ineffective in resisting the attack. For example, a mosquito attacks animals too slow to protect themselves from the bite. Similarly, <b>phytophagous</b> scale insects, aphids, and caterpillars attack much larger plants, and serve as vectors of bacteria, fungi and viruses causing plant diseases, and plants defoliated by caterpillars may die, as in parasitoidy. Female scale insects are unable to move, so they are obligate parasites, permanently attached to their hosts.|$|E
25|$|After {{landing on}} a {{suitable}} tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel {{in which it}} releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near {{the surface of the}} beetle gallery. The majority of ambrosia beetles colonize xylem (sapwood and/or heartwood) of dying or recently dead trees, but some attack live trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels ("galleries"). However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most <b>phytophagous</b> organisms including the closely related bark beetles.|$|E
25|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense occurs when endophytic fungi, which live symbiotically {{with the majority}} of plants by entering their cells, are utilized as an indirect defense against herbivores. In exchange for carbohydrate energy resources, the fungus provides benefits to the plant which can include increased water or nutrient uptake and protection from <b>phytophagous</b> insects, birds or mammals. Once associated, the fungi alter nutrient content of the plant and enhance or begin production of secondary metabolites. The change in chemical composition acts to deter herbivory by insects, grazing by ungulates and/or oviposition by adult insects. Endophyte-mediated defense can also be effective against pathogens and non-herbivory damage.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemical}} defenses {{once thought}} to be produced by the plant have since been shown to be synthesized by endophytic fungi. The chemical basis of insect resistance in endophyte-plant defense mutualisms has been most extensively studied in the perennial ryegrass and three major classes of secondary metabolites are found: indole diterpenes, ergot alkaloids and peramine. Related compounds are found across the range of endophytic fungal associations with plants. The terpenes and alkaloids are inducible defenses which act similarly to defensive compounds produced by plants and are highly toxic {{to a wide variety of}} <b>phytophagous</b> insects as well as mammalian herbivores. Peramine occurs widely in endophyte-associated grasses and may also act as a signal to invertebrate herbivores of the presence of more dangerous defensive chemicals. Terpenoids and ketones have been linked to protection from specialist and generalist herbivores (both insect and vertebrate) across the higher plants.|$|E
500|$|The <b>phytophagous</b> larvae of A.latipennis feed {{primarily}} on the root systems of two species of tree, Eucalyptus obliqua (messmate stringybark) and Eucalyptus regnans (mountain ash). Both of these species are present in old growth forests and dominant in regrowth forests, contributing to the moth's success in its own habitat. Forming simple and vertical tunnels, lined with silk, the caterpillars are [...] before and during pupation, emerging for their metamorphosis. [...] The tunnel entrances, 6 to 10 millimetres in diameter, are covered with silk webbing and leaf litter, and can be up to [...] deep, although depth is more usually 12 to 35cm.|$|E
500|$|About 75% of beetle {{species are}} <b>phytophagous</b> {{in both the}} larval and adult stages. Many feed on {{economically}} important plants and stored plant products, including trees, cereals, tobacco, and dried fruits. Some, such as the boll weevil, which feeds on cotton buds and flowers, can cause extremely serious damage to agriculture. The boll weevil crossed the Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, to enter the United States from Mexico around 1892, and had reached southeastern Alabama by 1915. By the mid-1920s, it had entered all cotton-growing regions in the US, traveling [...] per year. It remains the most destructive cotton pest in North America. Mississippi State University has estimated, since the boll weevil entered the United States, it has cost cotton producers about $13 billion, and in recent times about $300 million per year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interaction}} between figs and fig wasps is especially well-known (see section on reproduction, above). In {{addition to their}} pollinators, Ficus species are exploited {{by a group of}} non-pollinating chalcidoid wasps whose larvae develop in its figs. Both pollinating and non-pollinating wasps serve as hosts for parasitoid wasps. [...] In addition to T. americanus, F. maxima figs from Brazil were found to contain non-pollinating wasps belonging to the genus Critogaster, mites, ants, beetles, and dipteran and lepidopteran larvae. [...] Norwegian biologist Frode Ødegaard recorded a total of 78 <b>phytophagous</b> (plant-eating) insect species on a single F. maxima tree in Panamanian dry forest—59 wood eating insects, 12 which fed on green plant parts, and 7 flower visitors. It supported the fourth most specialised <b>phytophagous</b> insect fauna and the second largest wood-feeding insect fauna among the 24 tree species sampled.|$|E

Predatory mites, for example, naturally prey upon <b>phytophagous</b> mites, which are common pests in apple orchards. Spraying the orchards kills both mites, but the effect of diminished predation is larger than that of the pesticide, and <b>phytophagous</b> mites increase in abundance.|$|E
