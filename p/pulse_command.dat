Because {{there is such a}} wide variety of command types and messages, most command systems are implemented using programmable micro-processors. The type of interface circuitry needed is based on the command sent by the processor. These commands include relay, pulse, level, and data commands. Relay commands activate the coils of electromagnetic relays in the central power switching unit. Pulse commands are short pulses of voltage or current that is sent by the command logic to the appropriate subsystem. A level command is exactly like a logic <b>pulse</b> <b>command</b> except that a logic level is delivered instead of a logic pulse.

An intriguing find {{was that the}} pilots appeared to: 1) produce a continuous, internally-generated stick signal that they integrated in time; 2) integrate the actual stick position; and 3) compare the two integrations to issue and cease <b>pulse</b> <b>commands.</b> This suggests that the pilots utilized kinesthetic feedback in order to perceive and integrate stick position, supporting the hypothesis that pilots can access and employ the proprioceptive inner feedback loop proposed by Hess' pilot Structural Model. The Pulse Models {{used in conjunction with}} the pilot Structural Model closely recreated the pilot data both in the frequency and time domains during closed-loop simulation. This indicates that for the range of tasks and control styles encountered, the models captured the fundamental mechanisms governing pulsive and control processes.

40|$|Stepping motors are {{the most}} used {{electrical}} machines for low power positioning. The drive controls the machine so that the rotor performs a fixed angular displacement after each step <b>command</b> <b>pulse.</b> Counting the step <b>command</b> <b>pulses</b> enables open-loop positioning. The {{vast majority of the}} stepping motor systems is driven in open-loop. When the rotor hits an obstacle stall occurs. Step loss due to overload is another typical problem with stepping motor driven systems. Both phenomena are not detected in open-loop which causes loss of synchronism. In this paper, a sensorless load angle estimator is used to detect step loss and stall. This algorithm is based on the typical stepping motor drive algorithms and does not depend on mechanical load parameters. The method therefore has a broad industrial relevance...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To improve {{understanding}} of the binocular control of saccades by making high-resolution eye movement recordings in patients with unilateral Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) type I (marked by congenital absence of the sixth cranial nerve). METHODS: Binocular eye movements were recorded in four patients in binocular viewing conditions during a saccade task. RESULTS: Affected-side gaze showed normal saccades of the sound eye and undershooting saccades of the affected eye-evidence of intact interneurons, but deficient motoneurons, in the sixth-nerve nucleus on the affected side. Postsaccadic smooth onward drift followed undershooting saccades of the affected eye. Sound-side gaze, in the centripetal direction, showed relatively accurate saccades despite large offsets in initial position between the two eyes. In the centrifugal direction, there was a consistent undershoot of the affected eye. The sound eye showed unexpected overshoot. Postsaccadic drifts in opposite directions in the two eyes brought both eyes onto the target in an optimal time course. CONCLUSIONS: Studying {{the characteristics of the}} saccadic system in this oculomotor disorder gives new insight into binocular control of saccades and adaptation. In these patients, the oculomotor system was not capable of adapting the <b>pulse</b> <b>command</b> to the two eyes separately, even though DRS offers clear advantages of independent control. In contrast, independent adaptation of the saccadic step command was sent to the two eyes. This supports the idea that the rapid part of the saccadic command is common to both eyes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 32 -channel digital output module, {{and the development}} of the hardware and software design. The microprocessor-based design allows versatility in output control in response to CAMAC commands. The unit may be tailored to different specific applications by modification of the internal applications software. CAMAC commands, which may be stacked for serial micro-processing, allow outputs to be selectively DC or pulse controlled, and to control other outputs at the start or end of a pulsed output. output pulse width may be pre-defined, or set within a range of values. Various outputs may be responding to any of the above commands concurrently. outputs to be pulsed (on or off) may be preset with width and trigger options, with execution deferred. Action may be later initiated on a set of channels using a selective <b>pulse</b> <b>command</b> to initiate execution of the preset sequences. The unit is a single width CAMAC module. Intended for general use as an equipment controller, each output is rated for switching loads of up to 75 volts and 100 milliamperes. DEVELOPMENT The Isolated Digital Output Module (IDOM) is a microprocessor-based CAMAC module. The IDOM was designed for use by the Stanford Linear Collider project (SLC) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The ability to preload and then initiate the execution of a sequence of variable width output pulses, makes this module useful as a process control sequencer. The outputs are arranged in two groups of sixteen, each group being brought out from the module through a 36 -pin front panel connector (see Figure 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Stepping motors {{are well}} suited for {{open-loop}} positioning tasks at low-power. The rotor position of the machine can simply be controlled by the user. Every time a next pulse is sent by the user, the stepping motor driver excites the correct stator phases to rotate the rotor over a pre-defined discrete angular position. In this way, counting the step <b>command</b> <b>pulses</b> enables open-loop positioning. However, when the motor is overloaded or stuck, {{the relation between the}} expected rotor position {{based on the number of}} step <b>command</b> <b>pulses</b> and the actual rotor position is lost. This is called step loss. Open-loop stepping motor methodologies do not detect this step loss or stall. While the absolute rotor position is lost, the open-loop control continues to send unnecessary and unwanted step <b>command</b> <b>pulses.</b> This can lead to excessive vibrations, wear and noise. Especially for dynamically demanding applications, step loss should be avoided or at least be detected. Using a mechanical position sensor to achieve closed loop control would increase the cost and complexity of the system and omits the straightforward open loop control. Therefore in this paper, a sensorless estimator based on a Phase Locked Loop is presented which provides feedback of the load angle, even during transients. The load angle contains information about the torque generation and the margin to step loss. To estimate the load angle, the back-EMF is considered. This algorithm can be used with the typical full-, half- and micro-stepping algorithm and only needs one current and one voltage measurement and electrical parameters such as resistance and inductance to estimate the back-EMF and subsequently estimate the load angle. The proposed algorithm is validated through measurements on a hybrid stepper motor...|$|R

Sports Physiol., Vol. 9, No. 1 pp. 7 - 25, 2004. According to the {{equilibrium}} point hypothesis of motor control, control action of muscles is not explocoty computed, but rather arises {{as a consequence}} of interaction among moving equilibrium point, reflex feedback and muscle mechanical properties. This approach is attractive as it obviates the need to explicitly specify the forces cintrolling limb movements. One of the debatable aspects in the original version of this hypothesis is the command waveform specifying the moving equilibrium point, in particular, in replicating various speeds of movements and movements performed in differet ecvironments. In this study, we intended to extend the original single-joint modei under the empirically suggested assumption that the control system may have a program to compute and combine a pulse and a step motor command, as seen in oculomotor physiology. We hypothesized that the <b>pulse</b> <b>command</b> shares the common scaling factors (i. e., pulse height and pulse width) with scaling of the step command and coactivation command. These commands are translated into control inputs to antagonist muscles by a spinal neural networl, with the reciprocal reflex circuit playing an important role in this transformation. At the putput stage, stretch reflex feedback acts to effecticely elicit a convergent torque towards the joint equilibrium such that reflex activation sums up agonist coactivation shile concomitantly inhibiting coactivation of the opposing muscle. This model could well account for the single-joint elbow movements performed over a wide range of movement times and distances.

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the relationships between the}} modulation of transmitter release and of specific ionic currents by membrane potential in the cholinergic interneuron L 10 of the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia californica. The presynaptic cell body was voltage-clamped under various pharmacological conditions and transmitter release from the terminals was assayed simultaneously by recording the synaptic potentials in the postsynaptic cell. When cell L 10 was voltage-clamped from a holding potential of - 60 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin, graded transmitter release was evoked by depolarizing <b>command</b> <b>pulses</b> in the membrane voltage range (- 35 mV to + 10 mV) in which the Ca 2 + current was also increasing. Depolarizing the holding potential of L 10 results in increased transmitter output. Two ionic mechanisms contribute to this form of plasticity. First, depolarization inactivates some K+ channels so that depolarizing <b>command</b> <b>pulses</b> recruit a smaller K+ current. In unclamped cells the decreased K+ conductance causes spike-broadening and increased influx of Ca 2 + during each spike. Second, small depolarizations around resting potential (- 55 mV to - 35 mV) activate a steady-state Ca 2 + current that also contributes to the modulation of transmitter release, because, even with most presynaptic K+ currents blocked pharmacologically, depolarizing the holding potential still increases transmitter release. In contrast to the steady-state Ca 2 + current, the transient inward Ca 2 + current evoked by depolarizing clamp steps is relatively unchanged from various holding potentials...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFunctional {{electrical}} stimulation (FES) {{is a useful}} technique for restoring motor functions for spinal cord injured (SCI) patients.

40|$|In {{this age}} of {{shrinking}} military, civil, and commercial space budgets, an off-the-shelf solution is needed to provide a multimission approach to spacecraft control. A standard operational interface which {{can be applied to}} multiple spacecraft allows a common approach to ground and space operations. A trend for many space programs has been to reduce operational staff by applying autonomy to the spacecraft and to the ground stations. The Spacecraft Command Language (SCL) system developed by Interface and Control Systems, Inc. (ICS) provides an off-the-shelf solution for spacecraft operations. The SCL system is designed to provide a hyper-scripting interface which remains standard from program to program. The spacecraft and ground station hardware specifics are isolated to provide the maximum amount of portability from system to system. Uplink and downlink interfaces are also isolated to allow the system to perform independent of the communications protocols chosen. The SCL system can be used for both the ground stations and the spacecraft, or as a value added package for existing ground station environments. The SCL system provides an expanded stored commanding capability as well as a rule-based expert system on-board. The expert system allows reactive control on-board the spacecraft for functions such as electrical power systems (EPS), thermal control, etc. which have traditionally been performed on the ground. The SCL rule and scripting capability share a common syntax allowing control of scripts from rules and rules from scripts. Rather than telemeter over sampled data to the ground, the SCL system maintains a database on-board which is available for interrogation by the scripts and rules. The SCL knowledge base is constructed on the ground and uploaded to the spacecraft. The SCL system follows an open-systems approach allowing other tasks to communicate with SCL on the ground and in space. The SCL system was used on the Clementine program (launched January 25, 1994) and is required to have bidirectional communications with the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) algorithms which were written as another task. Sequencing of the spacecraft maneuvers are handled by SCL, but the low-level thruster <b>pulse</b> <b>commands</b> are handled by the GNC software. Attitude information is reported back as telemetry, allowing the SCL expert system to inference on the changing data.

The Clementine mission will be used as a case study in the application of the SCL to a 'fast track' program.

The leftward shift in the current-voltage relation of the L-type Ca(2 +) channels expressed in GT 1 cells allowed the depolarization-induced AP broadening to facilitate Ca(2 +) entry despite a decrease in spike amplitude.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Resolving the {{kinetics}} of agonist binding events {{separately from}} the subsequent channel gating processes requires the ability of applying and removing the agonist before channel gating occurs. No reported system has yet achieved pulses shorter than 100 Âµs, necessary to study nicotinic ACh receptor or AMPA receptor activation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Solution exchange systems deliver short agonist pulses by moving a sharp interface between a control and an experimental solution across a channel preparation. We achieved shorter pulses {{by means of an}} exchange system that combines a faster flow velocity, narrower partition between the two streams, and increased velocity and bandwidth of the movement of the interface. The measured response of the entire system was fed back to optimize the voltage signal applied to the piezoelectric actuator overcoming the spurious oscillations arising from the mechanical resonances when a high bandwidth driving function was applied. Optimization was accomplished by analyzing the transfer function of the solution exchange system. When driven by optimized <b>command</b> <b>pulses</b> the enhanced system provided pulses lasting 26 Â± 1 Âµs and exchanging 93 Â± 1 % of the solution, as measured in the open tip of a patch pipette. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Pulses of this duration open the experimental study of the molecular events that occur between the agonist binding and the opening of the channel...|$|R

Here we characterize this shift in the firing pattern and its impact on Ca 2 + influx experimentally by using prerecorded sharp and broad APs as the voltage-clamp <b>command</b> <b>pulse.</b> As a quantitative test of the experimental data, a mathematical model based on the membrane and ionic current properties of GT 1 neurons was also used. Both experimental and modeling results indicated that in{{activation of}} the tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channels by sustained depolarization accounted for a reduction in the amplitude of the spike upstroke. The ensuing decrease in tetraethylammonium-sensitive K+ current activation slowed membrane repolarization, leading to AP broadening. This change in firing pattern increased the total L-type Ca 2 + current and facilitated AP-driven Ca 2 + entry. The leftward shift in the current-voltage relation of the L-type Ca 2 + channels expressed in GT 1 cells allowed the depolarization-induced AP broadening to facilitate Ca 2 + entry despite a decrease in spike amplitude. Thus the gating properties of the L-type Ca 2 + channels expressed in GT 1 neurons are suitable for promoting AP-driven Ca 2 + influx in receptor- and non-receptor-depolarized cells...|$|R
40|$|The kinetic {{properties}} {{of a single}} Na+ channel in the tunicate egg cell membrane were studied by the patch-recording technique. A conventional micropipette filled with a solution of 600 mM NaCl and 1. 5 mM MnCl 2 {{was used as the}} patch electrode. The seal resistance between patch electrode and egg surface was more than 1000 M omega. In the patch recording, the current fluctuations at a given membrane potential consisted of pulse-like events of a uniform amplitude. The amplitude was 1 pA at - 56 mV and decreased as the membrane potential was made more positive. It is suggested that the fluctuation in the patch current is the current through a single Na+ channel for the following reasons. First, the reversal potential of the pulse-like fluctuation in the patch current was approximately equal to that of the total membrane Na+ current in a solution equivalent to that in the patch electrode. Second, the charges transferred by the patch current and by the total membrane Na+ current during a 170 -msec <b>command</b> <b>pulse</b> showed parallel dependence on membrane potential. Third, the kinetic {{properties of}} the pulse-like fluctuations in the patch current were analyzed according to the Hodgkin-Huxley model, and it was shown that the time sequences of the pulse-like events were compatible with those for a single Na+ channel...|$|R
40|$|Patch-clamp {{performance}} {{can be improved}} without altering the normal headstage configuration described by (Hamill, O. P., A. Marty, E. Neher, B. Sakmann, and F. J. Sigworth, 1981, Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol., 391 : 85 - 100). The "supercharging" method permits resolution of such fast events as calcium and sodium tail currents. Digital computer modeling and analog electronic simulation were used to identify appropriate shapes for the command voltage and the voltage applied to a capacitor tied to the input of the headstage. The voltage <b>command</b> <b>pulse</b> consists of a step with a brief (5 - 15 microseconds) rectangular spike on its leading edge. Spike amplitude {{is a function of}} the membrane capacitance and the access resistance. The spike drives current through the access resistance and speeds charging of the membrane capacitance, making it possible to complete a voltage step within 5 - 15 microseconds. Clamping speed is independent of the electrode and feedback resistance over a wide range. The second function of the patch clamp amplifier is current measurement, and good time resolution requires suppression of the capacity transient. This can be accomplished by applying an appropriately shaped voltage to the small capacitor tied to the input of the headstage. Series resistance compensation for ionic current transients does not interfere with supercharging. Although the focus of this paper is on whole cell recording, the supercharging concept may prove useful for single channel and bilayer recording techniques...|$|R

The rising phases of transients obtained from global illumination regions showed distinct accelerations when supercharging pulses were applied (95 % of steady-state fluorescence achieved in 1. 5 ms with supercharging pulses versus 14. 6 ms with step pulses). When local transients were recorded {{at the edge of}} the muscle fiber, their kinetics resembled those of the applied waveform, but a similar relationship was not observed in transients from regions near the edge chosen to minimize the surface membrane contribution. We developed a model of the T-system capable of simulating membrane potential changes as a function of time and distance along the T-system cable and the associated fluorescence changes in regions corresponding to the experimental illumination strategies. A critical parameter was the access resistance term, for which values of 110 â€“ 150 Î©Â·cm 2 were adequate to fit the data. The results suggest that the primary mechanism through which supercharging pulses boost the kinetics of T-system voltage changes most likely involves their compensating the voltage attenuation across the access resistance at the mouth of the T-tubule...|$|R
