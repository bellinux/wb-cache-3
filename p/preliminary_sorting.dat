40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a general {{framework}} to deal with model approximation and analysis. We present a unified procedure which exploits sampling, screening and model approximation techniques in order to optimally fulfill basic requirements in terms of general applicability and flexibility, efficiency of estimation and simplicity of implementation. The sampling procedure applies Sobol' quasi-Monte Carlo sequences, which display optimal characteristics when linked to a screening procedure, such as the elementary effect test. The latter method is used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and allows for a <b>preliminary</b> <b>sorting</b> of the factors in terms of their relative importance. Then we apply State Dependent Parameter (SDP) modelling (a model estimation approach, based on recursive filtering and smoothing estimation) to build an approximation of the computational model under analysis and to estimate the variance based sensitivity indices. The method is conceptually simple and very efficient, leading to a significant reduction in the cost of the analysis. All measures of interest are computed using a single set of quasi-Monte Carlo runs. The approach is flexible because, in principle, it can be applied with any available type of Monte Carlo sample.

This procedure can provide cells for the exploration of processes involved in the reproductive physiology of bivalves. Spermatogonia were chosen because of their essential role in spermatogenesis {{and the impact of}} gonia proliferation on reproductive effort. A non lethal method for determining sex and reproductive cycle stage was first validated in oysters. This first step was essential in order to constitute a homogeneous pool of oysters at the same stages of gametogenesis. Germ cell fractions were then obtained from a density gradient, and enrichment of each fraction was ratified by electron microscopy and by means of a 2 -parameter flow cytometry procedure (DNA and mitochondrial staining). A significant enrichment in spermatogonia and spermatocytes was confirmed by the increased expression of markers of proliferative cells (proliferative cell nuclear antigen, PCNA) and early germ cells (oyster vasa-like gene).

40|$|The arctic amphipoda {{collected}} by the Willem Barents’ expeditions of 1878 and 1879 were described by Dr. P. P. C. Hoek. The same eminent carcinologist had already carried out the <b>preliminary</b> <b>sorting</b> of the present collection, when, upon appointment to his important post at Helder, {{he found that the}} time requisite for describing it was no longer at his command. Under these circumstances at his suggestion Professor Max Weber did me the honour of asking for my services, and the following paper is the result. Of the sixty species here recorded the majority are already well known. They include {{a very large number of}} the most striking forms among the Gammaridea. The specific names in the list are due to a score of authors, concerning whom, as writers on Amphipoda, it may be said that they have among them not only most of the best but also the best out of most. For fifteen of the species mentioned science is indebted to the elaborate accuracy of Kröyer, whose high qualities appear to be a kind of heirloom in the Scandinavian school of naturalists. That the Amphipoda should have been in the first instance best studied by northern observers is, however, not surprising. For, compared with the forms of these Crustacea commonly met with in Dutch and English waters, the Arctic species claim attention and respect by gigantic size, a bristling armature, brilliant colouring, or prodigious swarms. They cannot be overlooked and ignored, as their kindred practically are in England. In regard to many of the established species and genera I have not given a full synonymy, but have thought it sufficient to refer to the Bibliography annexed to my Report on the Challenger Amphipoda. In view of the full descriptions published elsewhere, and especially in the admirable work on the Crustacea of Norway by G. O. Sars, now in course of publication, I have usually limited myself to an occasional comment or identifying note upon existing genera or species. In a few instances detailed descriptions of old species have been given, in each case, as will be easily perceived, to serve a special purpose. Five new species are described. Though this may seem an inconsiderable number in so fine a collection, nevertheless, when it is remembered who have been the reapers of the harvest of Arctic amphipoda during the last fifty years, this late gleaning will not fall short of any reasonable expectations. To judge by the results obtained at Kerguelen Island in the Southern Ocean, it is much rather in Antarctic than in Arctic waters that the explorer who devotes himself to the search after Amphipoda may hope to find new and surprising forms. There are, it is true, some remarkable instances in which the same species occurs both far north and far south, but these are after all not very numerous...|$|E
40|$|Without some {{evidence}} {{of the economic and}} technical feasibility of EIPs and their potential for reducing the environmental burden of industry, the business and community leaders will hesitate to embrace it [...] (Martin et al., 1996). Three of the main challenges to overcome in eco-industrial development is related to technical, economic and regulatory barriers and the framework outlined in this work is a step towards identifying and overcoming these barriers. The objective of this master thesis is developing a user-friendly framework for a qualitative and quantitative decision-support tool in order to evaluate specific measures for energy-saving technologies and reuse opportunities in eco-industrial parks. Information gathered through a literature study on; common strategies for energy savings and reuse in industrial areas, feasible methods and models for examining energy savings and their corresponding benefits and multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA), provides the basis for the model development. The complete framework consist of 3 phases: 	Opportunity generation tool: high level <b>preliminary</b> <b>sorting</b> of alternative measures 	Sustainability screening tool: evaluation of sustainability performance of alternative measures. 	Implementation helping tool: overcoming barriers related to contractual and financial issues of measures to be implemented. Because development of phase 1 of the framework turned out to be much more time consuming than initially thought, phase 2 of the framework was delegated significantly less attention than what was fist planned. More focus was put into trying to advance as much as possible in the important phase 1 of the framework. Already early in the work it was decided that phase 3 would be excluded from the scope and left to further work in order to put more focus on the two initial phases. The three types of energy streams included in the assessment is steam, exhaust/flue gas, and water. Material flows are excluded from the assessment. The opportunity generation tool in phase 1 will work as a discussion opener and provide a brief qualitative evaluation of some of the possible alternatives for synergy. It can be used as support in discussing possible energy recovery opportunities for different streams in a variety of cases concerning industrial symbiosis in industrial areas. It suggests different reuse opportunities and technologies for each type of stream on a generalized high level and link to literature where more specific appliances of the technologies has been implemented before. With help from this tool, the users will become aware on various symbiosis opportunities. Even the combinations in lack of enough data to provide a feasibility assessment, will create awareness just by having different recovery possibilities identified. One of the main barriers in developing this phase was related to the compromise between making a generic model {{that at the same time}} was refined enough to screen alternatives for various specific cases. Much time was spent trying to classifying the stream types in a manner that would provide the user with an accurate sorting of purposes and technologies according to the specific stream type. Finally, the sorting of the different stream types was done in a more simple manner, because of troubles finding enough parameter specific literature for purposes and technologies to make this initial, general screening of opportunities. Streams could be classified in a more exhaustive way with respect to e. g. pressure, temperature and volume flow, or in terms of useful energy content (exergy). In order for the tool to reach its maximum potential, the tool has to be filled with information and evolve over time to create an exhaustive, informative database for energy recovery opportunities for waste streams in an industrial area. The initial version of the tool demonstrated in this work is not completed, and there is a large potential for improvement both in terms of the structure of the tool and how to program it. For further work it is recommended that after defining the classification it is recommended to start focusing on one type of stream until a satisfying amount of information on relevant energy recovery and reuse purposes and technologies for that stream are implemented and evaluated in the tool, before moving on to the next stream type. Phase 2 is the follow up development of what was started in the preliminary thesis: Methods for assessment of energy saving and reuse technologies in eco-industrial parks (Aase, 2015). Due to limited time, it was not possible to advance as much as intended in this phase. In this work it has been focused on making the sustainability screening tool in a more generic manner than in the preliminary thesis, adaptable to various cases. This phase is where the identified measures in through the screening of opportunities in phase 1 is given a more detailed, case specific feasibility assessment. A set of the most relevant technical, economic, environmental and socionomic criteria are listed and the user of the tool selects which of these to include in the assessment of the case specific measures. When the results from the calculations on the criteria are put in to the model, normalized results are calculated using four different methods. Hence, the user have a possibility of choosing what method to utilize. The objective of this tool was also looking in to different ways of weighting, aggregating displaying the final evaluation scores. However, due to an increased focus on phase 1, this was not found time for. Phase 3 of the framework not initiated in this work. It is suggested to be a toolkit with a list of common contractual and pricing issues and successful models/templates. Developing this is left to further work.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in supporting bulk operations on multidimensional index structures. Bulk loading refers to the process of creating an initial index structure for a presumably very large data set. In this paper, we present a generic algorithm for bulk loading which is applicable to a broad class of index structures including R-trees and multi-version B-trees (MVBTs). Our approach differs completely from previous ones for the following reasons. First, sorting multidimensional data according to a predefined ordering is completely avoided. Instead, our approach is based on the basic routines of the underlying index structure for splitting and merging pages. Second, in contrast to inserting records one by one, our approach makes full use of the available main memory. As examples we demonstrate in this paper how to apply our technique to two well known, but conceptually different multidimensional index structures: R-trees and MVBTs.

40|$|In several {{manufacturing}} processes, {{the cutting}} of 2 D parts from sheets {{is an important}} task. The arrangement of the parts in the sheets, supported by computers, is called nesting and is addressed to minimize the wasted material.

In shipbuilding the parts to be arranged have significantly different sizes, which are often difficult to pack in a fast way using the standard methods in literature.

Fifty-eight <b>preliminary</b> items were <b>sorted</b> into 7 subscales: derealisation, depersonalisation, identity confusion, identity alteration, conversion, amnesia, and hypermnesia. A revised 56 -item SSD was administered with other psychiatric scales (DES, BDI, BAI, SCI-PANSS) to patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (n= 19), schizophrenia (n= 18), alcohol withdrawal (n= 20), dissociative disorders (n= 10), and controls (n= 63). The SSD was demonstrated to be a valid and reliable measure of severity, and changes in severity, of dissociation {{at the time of its}} completion. Discriminant validity, content, concurrent, predictive, internal criterionrelated, internal construct, and convergent validities were confirmed statistically by factor analysis, Spearman's rho correlations, confidence intervals, predictive analysis, and parametric and non-parametric comparisons of dependent and independent samples. It showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 97) and high splithalf reliability (Guttman coefficient = 0. 92). The conversion subscale clustered with the other subscales into one general factor on factor analysis and did not support its segregation from dissociative disorders in DSM-IV. State characteristics of dissociation were also examined in 11 patients with complex partial epilepsy. The relationship between concurrent EEG and experimentally induced dissociative states was examined by repeated SSD and baseline DES measurements after spectral analysis of EEG. Canonical analysis demonstrated significant SSD-EEG correlations. Amnesia, identity alteration, and identity confusion correlated with theta, frontal delta, and fast wave EEG activity respectively.

40|$|PosterRecent {{studies show}} that {{rockfall}} activity has increased along the three past decades in high mountain areas, and permafrost degradation {{is regarded as the}} main triggering factor. 433 rockfalls affecting the steep rockwalls of the Mont Blanc massif have been inventoried and documented (time and precise location, topographical and geological settings, volume, conditions, etc.) from 2007 to 2011. With the aim of better understanding geomorphic processes, we address questions about the thermal state of the unstable rockwalls within this study area. A statistical model of the Mean Annual Rock Surface Temperature (MARST) for the 1961 - 1990 period has been implemented on a 4 -m-resolution DEM of the Mont Blanc massif. The model runs with Potential Incoming Solar radiation (PISR) calculated with GIS tools and air temperature parameters computed from Chamonix Météo France's records. 87 rockfalls are located at the geographical margins of the DEM, where the PISR calculation doesn't take account of the surrounding hillshading and biased MARST simulation. Thus, only 346 rockfalls were kept and linked to a MARST value after data <b>sorting.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> results show that rockfalls occurred over a modelled MARST range of - 6 °C to 5 °C. MARSTs ranging from - 2. 5 °C to 2. 5 °C encompass about 60 % of the rockfalls. The mean MARST value for the 346 rockfalls is of - 0. 9 °C. Simulated warm permafrost areas (> - 2 C) are therefore appearing as the most affected by instabilities. These first observations reinforce the hypothesis that permafrost degradation is likely the dominant triggering factor of these rockfalls. The 1961 - 1990 period is supposed to be representative of the conditions at depth that are not affected by the recent climate warming. This means that the here presented results are mainly valuable for rockfalls related to pluri-decadal signal. But they also suggest that MARST model is an interesting tool to explore the link between rockwall instability and permafrost state. Simulations at various time scales would allow more precise reconstruction of the bedrock temperature during each year of rockfalls.

Comparison between numerous contiguous pixels, typically 3, 000 for each type, establishes a consensus and a mean spectrum with characteristic bands for waxy and parent. Extractions with solvents of differing polarity were employed to aid in lipid extraction in situ and kernel extracted endosperm. Differences between kernel sections of waxy and parent are observed using FT-IR microspectroscopic imaging. However, revealing lipid class contribution to the molecular bands required infrared analysis after selective extraction. Triple mass spectrometry of lipid molecule ions was used for compositional analyses to enhance lipid class profile distinction. A normal and waxy advanced breeding line wheat were also analyzed via the same methods. It was noted that digalactoslydyglyercides are the most abundant lipids in all samples, however the relative lipid profiles of normal wheat versus waxy wheat differ as well as tetraploid versus hexaploid. It is observed that in the endosperm of all parent wheat versus waxy wheat specimens analyzed, all waxy wheat specimens contained higher lipid content.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work was to study the beneficiation of rare earth ore of the Bokan Mountain [...] Dotson Ridge deposit, located near Ketchikan, Alaska. Rare earth element (REE) composite ore samples from the Bokan Mountain [...] Dotson Ridge deposit were tested using gravity concentration, magnetic separation, flotation, and leaching techniques to separate the REE. The composite ore sample {{was a product of}} a <b>preliminary</b> x-ray <b>sorting</b> process. Qualitative electron microprobe analysis of the ore showed that most of the REE minerals in the ore were silicate minerals. Since the electron microprobe analysis samples were coated with carbon during sample preparation, the carbon element was inactivated for analysis. Because of this, carbonate compounds of minerals' particles could not be detected. 95 % of the REE mineral particles appear to be smaller than about 10 μm in size (about 100 μm² in area). For the gravity concentration, light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth elements' (HREE) individual elemental recovery values were in the ranges of 49. 6 - 52. 8 % and 46. 3 - 48. 8 %, respectively, at 25 % of mass yield. In order to separate a larger amount of the REE, a wet high intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) test was carried out on tailings of the gravity concentration tests. The HREE individual elemental recovery values ranged from 56. 3 - 63. 1 % at 37 % mass yield, while LREE individual elemental recovery values were in the 57. 9 % - 59. 1 % range. For the combined gravity and magnetic separation processes, the net individual elemental recovery values of the LREE and the HREE were in the range of 79. 6 - 80. 5 % and 76. 5 - 80. 9 %, respectively. The combined mass yield of the gravity and magnetic separation processes was 3 %. Direct leaching tests conducted on the composite ground ore feed yielded high individual elemental recovery values of 90 - 92 % of the LREE. The HREE individual elemental recovery values ranged from 56. 5 - 87. 3 %. In the leaching, 20 % HCl was used in the 1 st and 2 nd stages with a duration of 2 hrs in each stage at 90 °C. The solid percentage of the leach slurry was 20 % w/w. The composite ground ore sample was tested in conventional flotation using a 2. 0 L capacity Denver cell. In the flotation, 0. 05 kg/tonne of Cytec Aero 6493 collector, 0. 05 kg/tonne of Cytec Aero Froth 88, and 0. 1 kg/tonne of sodium metasilicate as a depressant were used. Pulp pH was set around 9. Results showed individual elemental recovery values in the range of 44. 6 - 50. 4 % or the LREE. The HREE individual elemental recovery values ranged from 27. 9 - 44. 5 %. The mass yield of the flotation was 23 %. The flotation recoveries reported here are significantly lower than what was achieved previously. For the Leach after flotation process, leaching was conducted on the first concentrate of flotation. Individual elemental recovery values of the LREE and HREE were 94. 7 - 96. 5 % and 61. 1 - 90. 5 %, respectively. The concentrate was leached using 20 % HCl in both the 1 st and 2 nd stages, with a duration of 2 hrs in each stage at 90 °C. Flotation/Leach process net recoveries of LREE by individual elemental values ranged from 42. 2 - 48. 5 %. HREE net recoveries by individual elemental values ranged from 17. 1 - 41. 4 %...|$|R
