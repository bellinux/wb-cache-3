Manduca (1986) Inhibition of dimethyl sulfoxide induced erythropoietic differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells in culture. Cancer Res., 46, 6260 - 6263). We show here the occurrence of another <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> during the initial 5 h after the addition of the inducer dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the culture medium. The sensitivity to the mutagenic action of a sublethal 3 -s pulse of UV light (13. 5 J/m 2) was monitored on the progeny of the irradiated cells at day 5 after the start of induction. The effects were analysed on functions strictly linked to the final expression of the differentiated phenotype: hemoglobin concentration, percent cells producing hemoglobin (%B+), activity of delta-amino levulinic acid dehydrase (ALA-DH) and presence of globins. Each function appeared differently and selectively affected in the progeny of the cells depending on the exact time of irradiation during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> Specifically, cells irradiated at hour 3 after induction show both hemoglobin concentration and ALA-DH activity values increased by a factor 3 over controls. Cells irradiated at hour 5 show an almost complete halt in cell induction and the other tested functions show minimal values. Cells are nearly insensitive to irradiation at later times, until hour 20, after which a second <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with peak value at hour 22 occurs at which time hemoglobin concentration in the progeny of irradiated cells is increased by a factor 3 over controls, ALA-DH activity is increased by a factor 15 while percent B+ value is at its minimum. The differential effects of UV irradiation on Mel cell functions in the first and in the second <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to mutagens confirm the hypothesis that the consequences of a mutational event are strictly dependent on the functional state of the cell.

40|$|AbstractThe two {{closely related}} species of Drosophila, D. melanogaster and D. simulans, display an {{identical}} bristle pattern on the notum, but hybrids between the two are lacking a variable number of bristles. We show that the loss is temperature-dependent and provide evidence for two <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> temperature <b>sensitivity.</b> A first <b>period</b> <b>of</b> heat <b>sensitivity</b> occurs during larval development and corresponds {{to the time when}} the prepattern of expression of genes whose products activate achaete–scute in the proneural clusters preceding bristle precursor formation is established. A second <b>period</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>sensitivity</b> corresponds to the time of emergence of the bristle precursor cells and the maintenance of their neural fate, a process requiring high levels of Achaete–Scute. Expression of achaete–scute at these two critical periods depends on cis-regulatory elements of the achaete–scute complex (AS-C). The differences between males, which have only one copy of the X-linked AS-C from D. simulans, and females, which have copies from both parental species, are compared, together with the effects of crossing in different rearrangements of the D. melanogaster AS-C that delete regulatory and/or coding sequences. We provide evidence that bristle loss in the hybrids may result from a decrease in the level of transcription at the AS-C and argue that interaction between trans-acting factors and cis-regulatory elements within the AS-C has diverged between the two species...|$|R

Further experiments designed to elucidate the mechanism underlying this variation in UV sensitivity indicated that it arises from the partial depletion of nutrients in the medium during late log phase.

Ziracin, an antibacterial of the everninomycin class under development for serious enterococcal, staphylococcal, and streptococcal infections, caused anomalies of the external genitalia in F 1 female rats and decreased reproductive performance. To characterize the urogenital malformations and determine the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{to the effects of}} Ziracin during development, pregnant rats (F 0) were administered 60 mg/kg IV of Ziracin from GD 6 to LD 21, GD 6 to 13, GD 14 to the last day of gestation or LD 0 to 21. Controls received saline or placebo from GD 6 to LD 21. Ziracin-induced changes occurred in F 1 rats exposed from GD 6 to LD 21 and GD 14 to the last day of gestation, indicating that the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to Ziracin was from GD 14 to the last day of gestation. The urogenital abnormalities consisted of cranial displacement of the urethral opening within the vagina from its normal location {{at the tip of the}} genital tubercle.

No differences in survivability, body weight, and date of vaginal opening were observed in F 1 females. The estrous cycles were slightly prolonged. The mating and fertility indices were decreased as a result of the urogenital anomalies. The mammary glands of pregnant F 1 females were underdeveloped, thus F 2 pups from affected F 1 females had a decreased survival rate.

The developmental time course of CNTF expression, its regional tissue distribution and its cytosolic localization (as suggested by its primary structure) 4 * 5 favour a role for CNTF as a lesion factor rather than a target-derived neurotrophic molecule like nerve growth factor. Nevertheless CNTF exhibits neurotrophic activity in vitro on different populations of embryonic neurons 6. To determine whether the vulnerability of motor neurons to axotomy in the early postnatal phase is due to insufficient availability of CNTF, we transected the axons of newborn rat motor neurons and demonstrated that iocal application of CNTF prevents the degeneration of the corresponding cell bodies...|$|E

40|$|The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) {{of mammals}} contain a {{circadian}} clock that synchronizes behavioral and physiological rhythms {{to the daily}} cycle of light and darkness.

40|$|The present work {{examines}} {{the role of}} cAMP in the induction {{of the type of}} long-term morphological changes that {{have been shown to be}} correlated with long-term sensitization in Aplysia. ^ To examine this issue, cAMP was injected into individual tail sensory neurons in the pleural ganglion to mimic, at the single cell level, the effects of behavioral training. After a 22 hr incubation period, the same cells were filled with horseradish peroxidase and 2 hours later the tissue was fixed and processed. Morphological analysis revealed that cAMP induced an increase in two morphological features of the neurons, varicosities and branch points. These structural alterations, which are similar to those seen in siphon sensory neurons of the abdominal ganglion following long-term sensitization training of the siphon-gill withdrawal reflex, could subserve the altered behavioral response of the animal. These results expose another role played by cAMP in the induction of learning, the initiation of a structural substrate, which, in concert with other correlates, underlies learning. ^ cAMP was injected into sensory neurons in the presence of the reversible protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin. The presence of anisomycin during and immediately following the nucleotide injection completely blocked the structural remodeling. These results indicate that the induction of morphological changes by cAMP is a process dependent on protein synthesis. ^ To further examine the temporal requirement for protein synthesis in the induction of these changes, the time of anisomycin exposure was varied. The results indicate that the cellular processes triggered by cAMP are sensitive to the inhibition of protein synthesis for at least 7 hours after the nucleotide injection. This is a longer <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> than that for the induction of another correlate of long-term sensitization, facilitation of the sensory to motor neuron synaptic connection. Thus, these findings demonstrate that the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to protein synthesis inhibition is not identical for all correlates of learning. In addition, since the induction of the morphological changes can be blocked by anisomycin pulses administered at different times during and following the cAMP injection, this suggests that cAMP is triggering a cascade of protein synthesis, with successive rounds of synthesis being dependent on successful completion of preceding rounds. Inhibition at any time during this cascade can block the entire process and so prevent the development of the structural changes. ^ The extent to which cAMP can mimic the structural remodeling induced by long-term training was also examined. Animals were subjected to unilateral sensitization training and the morphology of the sensory neurons was examined twenty-four hours later. Both cAMP injection and long-term training produced a twofold increase in varicosities and approximately a fifty percent increase in the number of branch points in the sensory neuron arborization within the pleural ganglion.

Igfbp 5 is the most conserved and is developmentally up-regulated in key lineages and pathologies; in vitro studies suggest that IGFBP- 5 functions independently of IGF interaction. Genetic ablation of individual Igfbps has yielded limited phenotypes because of substantial compensation by remaining family members. Therefore, to reveal Igfbp 5 actions in vivo, we generated lines of transgenic mice that ubiquitously overexpressed Igfbp 5 from early development. Significantly increased neonatal mortality, reduced female fertility, whole-body growth inhibition, and retarded muscle development were observed in Igfbp 5 -overexpressing mice.

Thus, despite only modest changes in IGF and IGFBP concentrations, the Igfbp 5 -overexpressing mice displayed a phenotype more extreme than that observed for other Igfbp genetic models.

In this species, larvae always colonize the reef (settlement) in a yellow morph, while juveniles and adults can display two distinct colour-patterns: yellow and dark brown.

A significant positive effect of fish density inducing a brown colour morph was also highlighted. After a first colour induction, reversibility experiments illustrated that juveniles can change their colour morph anew after a 5 -day period. Although a shift from brown to yellow morph seemed to be more limited. In the dark condition, yellow adults did not change their colour after a 5 -day period. Our results showed that the colour dimorphism in C. brownriggii should be density-dependent. The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> seems to last throughout the post-settlement period.

40|$|Of 2649 {{patients}} with strabismic amblyopia who attended clinics between 1941 and 1978, 1904 patients were reviewed. Of these, 115 patients had transfer of fixation after occlusion. These were analysed {{according to the}} type of transfer of fixation and relation to occlusion and age. The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> maximum <b>sensitivity</b> to short <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> occlusion extended to 18 months, declining to about 30 months <b>of</b> age. <b>Sensitivity</b> to occlusion reaches low levels about the age of 5 to 51 / 2 years, though it is still present to some degree, especially in {{patients with}} relatively good visual acuity of 6 / 36 or better.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench] showed that episodes of {{high-temperature}} stress around anthesis could adversely affect grain yield via effects on pollen germination with varying responses among genotypes. The objectives {{of this study}} were to determine the reproductive development phase most sensitive to heat stress and to determine whether genotypic differences in high-temperature tolerance were associated with differences in either cardinal temperatures for pollen germination, the duration of the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to high temperatures, or the extent of the response to high temperature per se. To determine cardinal temperatures, pollen from six genotypes, differing in high-temperature tolerance, was incubated on a gradient plate at temperatures between 10 and 40 °C. To identify the critical period of high temperature sensitivity, plants of two genotypes with contrasting high-temperature tolerance were grown under optimum (31 vs. 21 °C) and high (38 vs. 21 °C) day vs. night temperatures, with selected plants reciprocally transferred between the two temperatures for 5 -d periods from just before flag leaf full expansion until 20 d thereafter. Pollen germination, seed set, and grain yield were most sensitive to high temperatures immediately around anthesis. Effects on seed mass were smaller and independent of seed set. Genotypes differed in the magnitude of the response to high temperatures, rather than in the duration of the critical period, and the adverse effect of high temperatures increased with duration of exposure during this critical period. These differences were not associated with cardinal temperatures for pollen germination. These results could assist in identifying selection targets for crop improvement programs...|$|E
40|$|Whereas the {{adolescent}} brain {{is a major}} target for gonadal hormones, our understanding of hormonal influences on adolescent neural and behavioral development remains limited. These experiments investigated how variations in the timing of testosterone (T) exposure, relative to adolescence, alters the strength of steroid-sensitive neural circuits underlying social behavior in male Syrian hamsters. Experiment 1 simulated early, on-time, and late pubertal development by gonadectomizing males on postnatal d 10 and treating with SILASTIC brand T implants for 19 d before, during, or after adolescence. T treatment before or during, but not after, adolescence facilitated mating behavior in adulthood. In addition, preadolescent T treatments most effectively increased mating behavior overall, indicating that the timing of exposure to pubertal hormones contributes to individual differences in adult behavior. Experiment 2 {{examined the effects of}} preadolescent T treatment on behavior and brain regional volumes within the mating neural circuit of juvenile males (i. e. still preadolescent). Although preadolescent T treatment did not induce reproductive behavior in juvenile males, it did increase volumes of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, sexually dimorphic nucleus, posterodorsal medial amygdala, and posteroventral medial amygdala to adult-typical size. In contrast, juvenile anterodorsal medial amygdala and ventromedial hypothalamus volumes were not changed by preadolescent T treatment yet differed significantly in volume from adult controls, suggesting that further maturation of these brain regions during adolescence is required for the expression of male reproductive behavior. Thus, adolescent maturation of social behavior may involve both steroid-independent and -dependent processes, and adolescence marks the end of a postnatal <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to steroid-dependent organization of the brain...|$|E
40|$|It is {{controversial}} whether trichloroethylene (TCE) is a cardiac teratogen. We exposed chick embryos to 0, 0. 4, 8, or 400 ppb TCE/egg {{during the period}} of cardiac valvuloseptal morphogenesis (2 – 3. 3 days ’ incubation). Embryo survival, valvuloseptal cellularity, and cardiac hemodynamics were evaluated at times thereafter. TCE at 8 and 400 ppb/egg reduced embryo survival to day 6. 25 incubation by 40 – 50 %. At day 4. 25, increased proliferation and hypercellularity were observed within the atrioventricular and outflow tract primordia after 8 and 400 ppb TCE. Doppler ultrasound revealed that the dorsal aortic and atrioventricular blood flows were reduced by 23 % and 30 %, respectively, after exposure to 8 ppb TCE. Equimolar trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was more potent than TCE with respect to increasing mortality and causing valvuloseptal hypercellularity. These results independently confirm that TCE disrupts cardiac development of the chick embryo and identifies valvuloseptal development as a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The hypercellular valvuloseptal profile is consistent with valvuloseptal heart defects associated with TCE exposure. This is the first report that TCA is a cardioteratogen for the chick and the first report that TCE exposure depresses cardiac function. Valvuloseptal hypercellularity may narrow the cardiac orifices, which reduces blood flow through the heart, thereby compromising cardiac output and contributing to increased mortality. The altered valvuloseptal formation and reduced hemodynamics seen here are consistent with such an outcome. Notably, these effects were observed at a TCE exposure (8 ppb) that is only slightly higher than the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency maximum containment level for drinking water (5 ppb). Key words: cardiac cushions, chic...|$|E
40|$|Metastatic {{prostate}} cancer is an incurable disease. After a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> hormone <b>sensitivity</b> {{that allows for}} the use of antiandrogens, the disease invariably progresses to a situation of androgen-independent growth, which deserves the consideration or the use of chemotherapy. As many of these patients are elderly and fragile, treatment with chemotherapy is challenging. Therefore, new drugs are required. Preclinical evidence supports the role of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling in {{prostate cancer}}. In this paper, we report the first published evidence of PSA control in a patient with metastatic prostate cancer treated with fulvestrant acetate...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{windows are}} {{specific}} <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> during normal plant development {{in which a}} perturbation may be adaptively integrated. In these periods, sub-lethal environmental perturbations may improve the capacity to grow at lethal conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that previous non-lethal water deficit applied in different developmental stages in soybean plants could enables them to improve the tolerance to environmental perturbations. In order to test this hypothesis we carried out an experiment with soybean plants submitted to water deficit in different stages of plant development, evaluating yield and physiological aspects. Our results indicated that water deficit experienced on V 4 stage (vegetative) induces more suitable response, enabling plants to develop a process of tolerance improvement to a further water shortage period, probably through a reduction of growth, which maintains a conservative strategy of energy use. On the other hand, water deficit in R 1 stage (reproductive), increased the plant susceptibility to posterior water withholding. This " strategy" was the opposite of the one employed by plants on V 4 stage, i. e., to maintain growth rate probably at the expense of a higher energetic cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} salmon to home {{accurately}} to their natal stream to spawn has long intrigued biologists and has important {{consequences for the}} maintenance of population structure in these species. It is known that olfaction is crucial to homing, and that the transition from the freshwater to the marine environment (the parr–smolt transformation; PST) is a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> increased olfactory <b>sensitivity</b> and learning, resulting in a permanent memory of natal site odours that is retained, at least in part, in peripheral sensory neurones. These odours are then used as cues by sexually maturing fish on their homeward migration. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques to demonstrate transient increases in expression of odorant receptor transcripts (of up to fifty-fold over pre-PST levels) coincident with PST. Both olfactory (SORB) and vomeronasal receptors (SVRA and SVRC) are involved, which suggests that the fish learn both environmental odours and semiochemicals (pheromones). Receptor expression varies between families and changes over time indicating both genetic differences in odour stimuli and multiple <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> olfactory <b>sensitivity.</b> We suggest that changes in OR gene expression may have a role in homing behaviour and thus the maintenance of population structure in Atlantic salmo...|$|R
