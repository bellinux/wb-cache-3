In this paper, we propose a Block SAPOR (Block Second-order Arnoldi method for <b>Passive</b> <b>Order</b> Reduction) for Multi-Input Multi-Output RCS Circuits. The proposed Block SAPOR algorithm can simultaneously guarantee passivity and achieve higher accuracy {{than the first}} order reduction technique PRIMA. Most importantly, the reduced system matrices obtained by the proposed method can preserve {{the structure of the}} original system matrices.

40|$|The recently-introduced {{susceptance}} element exhibits many {{prominent features}} in modeling the on-chip magnetic couplings. For an RCS circuit, {{it is better}} to be formulated as a second-order system. Therefore, corresponding MOR (model-order reduction) techniques for second-order systems are desired to efficiently deal with the ever-increasing circuit scale and to preserve essential model properties. In this paper, we first review the existing MOR methods for RCS circuits, such as ENOR and SMOR, and discuss several key issues related to numerical stability and accuracy of the methods. Then, a novel technique, SAPOR (Second-order Arnoldi method for <b>Passive</b> <b>Order</b> Reduction), is proposed to effectively address these issues. Based on an implementation of a generalized second-order Arnoldi method, SAPOR is numerically stable and efficient. Meanwhile, the reduced-order system also guarantees passivity. * 1...|$|E

40|$|RLC {{circuits}} {{have been}} shown to be better formulated as second-order systems instead of first-order systems. The corresponding model order reduction techniques for secondorder systems have been developed. However, existing techniques are mainly based on moment-matching concept. While suitable for the reduction of large-scale circuits, those approaches cannot generate reduced models as compact as desired. To achieve smaller models with better error control, a novel technique, SBPOR (Second-order Balanced truncation for <b>Passive</b> <b>Order</b> Reduction), is proposed in this paper, which is the first second-order balanced truncation method proposed for passive reduction of RLC circuits. SBPOR is superior to the pioneering work in the control community because second-order systems can be balanced via congruency transformation without any accuracy loss. In addition, compared with the first-order balanced truncation approaches, SBPOR is a better choice for RLC reduction. SBPOR preserves not only passivity but also the structure information inherent to RLC circuits, which is a special need for RLC reduction. In addition, SBPOR is computationally more efficient as it only needs to solve one linear matrix equation instead of two quadratic matrix equations...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the components of}} trading costs incurred in trading large and liquid stocks listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. We find that aggressive orders pay an immediacy price measured by price impact, whereas executed <b>passive</b> <b>orders</b> gain the immediacy price. We also find a sizable opportunity cost from the unexecuted portion of a limit order that more than offsets the benefit obtained from the partial fulfillment of the order. The total trading cost, which includes price impact and opportunity cost, is positively related to order size and stock price volatility, but negatively associated with firm size, stock price, and stock liquidity. The total trading cost has a U-shaped relation with order aggressiveness. Collectively, our study suggests that, to minimize the total trading cost, the optimal strategy is simply to use a limit order submitted at the best quote...|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{institutional}} investors are frequently viewed as well-informed traders, and their information advantage would transform into informational efficiency on prices. Due {{to the relative}} importance of foreign institutions in emerging markets, this study investigates the information role of foreign institutional traders in Taiwan futures market (TAIFEX). TAIFEX has significant trading volume increase over the past few years, mainly because of the foreign institutions. However, it is puzzling that while trading volume has been increasing in TAIFEX, the market-wide liquidity costs tend to be much higher and the informational efficiency has worsen. We find that foreign institutions more frequently act as market makers, and such decrease in order aggressiveness has primarily resulted in the deterioration of market efficiency. Furthermore, extensive <b>passive</b> <b>orders</b> induce higher liquidity costs and impede possible arbitrage opportunity from mispricing. The evidence indicates that foreign institutions may earn profits by providing liquidity rather than trading with information advantage...|$|R

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient, {{discrete model}} is presented for transmission line analysis and <b>passive</b> model <b>order</b> reduction of high-speed interconnect systems. The {{development of this}} model was motivated by the on-going efforts in chip/package co-design to route {{a major portion of}} the on-chip clock and high-speed data buses through the package in order to overcome the bandwidth reduction and delay caused by the high ohmic loss of on-chip wiring. The geometric complexity of the resulting interconnections is such that model order reduction is essential for rapid and accurate signal integrity assessment to support pre-layout design iteration and optimization. The modal network theory of the skin effect in conjunction with the theory of compact differences is used for the development of discrete models for dispersive, multi-conductor interconnects compatible with <b>passive</b> model <b>order</b> reduction algorithms.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{the problem of}} curve {{following}} in an illiquid market is addressed. Using techniques of singular stochastic control, we extend the results of [NW 11] to a two- sided limit order market with temporary market impact and resilience, where the bid ask spread is now also controlled. We first show existence and uniqueness of an optimal control. In a second step, a suitable version of the stochastic maximum principle is derived which yields a characterisation of the optimal trading strategy {{in terms of a}} nonstandard coupled FBSDE. We show that the optimal control can be characterised via buy, sell and no-trade regions. The new feature is that we now get a nondegenerate no-trade region, which implies that market orders are only used when the spread is small. This allows to describe precisely when it is optimal to cross the bid ask spread, which is a fundamental problem of algorithmic trading. We also show that the controlled system can be described in terms of a reflected BSDE. As an application, we solve the portfolio liquidation problem with <b>passive</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel <b>passive</b> model <b>order</b> {{reduction}} (MOR) method via projection-based truncated balanced realization method, PriTBR, for large RLC interconnect circuits. Different from existing passive truncated balanced realization (TBR) methods where numerically expensive Lur’e or algebraic Riccati (ARE’s) equations are solved, the new method performs balanced truncation on linear system in descriptor form by solving generalized Lyapunov equations. Passivity preservation is achieved by congruence transformation instead of simple truncations. For the first time, <b>passive</b> model <b>order</b> reduction is achieved by combining Lyapunov equation based TBR method with congruence transformation. Compared with existing passive TBR, the new technique has the same accuracy and is numerically reliable, less expensive. In addition to passivity-preserving, it can be easily extended to preserve structure information inherent to RLC circuits, like block structure, reciprocity and sparsity. PriTBR can be applied as a second MOR stage combined with Krylov-subspace methods to generate a nearly optimal reduced model from a large scale interconnect circuit while passivity, structure, and reciprocity are preserved at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method and show PriTBR and its structure-preserving version, SP-PriTBR, are superior to existing passive TBR and Krylov-subspace based moment-matching methods.
