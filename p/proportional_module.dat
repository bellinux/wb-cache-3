40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), numerous works focus on designing better network architectures (i. e., AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet and DenseNet etc.). Nevertheless, all these networks {{have the same}} characteristic: each convolutional layer is followed by an activation layer, a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer is the most used among them. In this work, we argue that the paired module with 1 : 1 convolution and ReLU ratio {{is not the best}} choice since it may result in poor generalization ability. Thus, we try to investigate the more suitable convolution and ReLU ratio for exploring the better network architectures. Specifically, inspired by Leaky ReLU, we focus on adopting the <b>proportional</b> <b>module</b> with N:M (N$>$M) convolution and ReLU ratio to design the better networks. From the perspective of ensemble learning, Leaky ReLU can be considered as an ensemble of networks with different convolution and ReLU ratio. We find that the <b>proportional</b> <b>module</b> with N:M (N$>$M) convolution and ReLU ratio can help networks acquire the better performance, through the analysis of a simple Leaky ReLU model. By utilizing the <b>proportional</b> <b>module</b> with N:M (N$>$M) convolution and ReLU ratio, many popular networks can form more rich representations in models, since the N:M (N$>$M) <b>proportional</b> <b>module</b> can utilize information more effectively. Furthermore, we apply this module in diverse DCNN models to explore whether is the N:M (N$>$M) convolution and ReLU ratio indeed more effective. From our experimental results, we can find that such a simple yet effective method achieves better performance in different benchmarks with various network architectures and the experimental results verify that the superiority of the <b>proportional</b> <b>module.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 10 figures, conferenc...|$|E

Research was performed with plastic scintillator and gas <b>proportional</b> <b>modules</b> in an effort to find the most conducive geometry for a surface conformal, position sensitive monitor. The respirator monitor prototype developed is a computer controlled, position-sensitive detection system employing 56 modular proportional counters mounted in molds conforming to the inner and outer surfaces of a commonly used respirator (Scott Model 801450 - 40). The molds are housed in separate enclosures and hinged to create a {open_quotes}waffle-iron{close_quotes} effect so that the closed monitor will simultaneously survey both surfaces of the respirator.

Materials and methods minipig iliac arterial segments were cryopreserved at − 196 °C in either minimum essential medium or Wisconsin solution. Fresh segments served as the control group. After 1 month, the specimens were rapidly thawed (37 °C) and processed for biomechanical, ultrastructural, morphological and immunohistochemical (MMP- 1, MMP- 2, MMP- 3 and MMP- 9) analysis. Visualisation of apoptotic cells was performed by TUNEL method. For the mechanical distension analysis, an in vitro circuit was designed. Results the cryopreserved segments showed a 42 % incidence of spontaneous fracture {{and the appearance of}} microfractures which affected the endoluminal third of the vessel. An accumulation of liquid in the subelastica was observed. An increased expression of wall-degradative enzymes (mainly MMP- 2) was also observed following cryopreservation. No significant differences were detected in the <b>proportional</b> elasticity <b>module</b> or tensile strength of the specimen groups. No differences in mechanical distension were observed between groups after the vessel segments were subjected to the pulsatile circuit flow for 72 h. Cell damage was most intense in the specimens cryopreserved in Wisconsin solution. Conclusions cryopreservation in both the solutions employed, followed by rapid thawing, induce changes in the permeability which increase the fragility of the cryopreserved arterial wall. Both increased expression of wall-degradative enzymes and accumulation of liquid may contribute to graft failure after implantation...|$|R
40|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was nearly}} integrated and had passed {{some of its}} early mechanical and electrical testing. One of its instruments, the Proportional Counter Array (PCA), had a gas leak {{in one of the}} five <b>proportional</b> counter <b>modules</b> that made up the array. The science division where the instrument was being developed wanted a gas replenishment system added to assure the PCA would last for the entire mission. Adding a gas replenishment system would mean interrupting spacecraft integration and testing; developing a new subsystem and integrating it onto the spacecraft; modifying all the PCA modules; including a complex integration of the instrument onto the spacecraft; and implementing a more complex performance and environmental test process. It was the wrong answer because it made a simple design more complex and added little value to the mission at a major cost in time and dollars. Our mission couldn't afford the additional budget and schedule risks. XTE was the latest of a long line of projects being managed by my Explorer Program Office, but it was unique in being the first project we had agreed to do for a fixed price. NASA HQ agreed, in return, to provide us with the funding profile we needed to make it happen. We were both trying to break the unhealthy spiral in the Explorer program that saw current missions overrunning and pushing subsequent missions downstream to the point where their science was becoming marginal. The science community was upset and wanted better performance from NASA. I summarized my arguments to the director. The Engineering Directorate had taken responsibility for the spacecraft development when we established XTE as an in-house project at Goddard Space Flight Center, and also was supporting the PCA development. "It adds complexity," I reiterated. "It's a significant cost impact for only a marginal reliability increase". His response was music to my ears, "Jim, I won't stand in your way, but you'll have to convince the scientists and engineers. ...|$|R

In this regard, as a result 35 - 40 years later there are problems on these objects related to: sag of foundations of buildings of storages; rise in level of ground waters in semi-underground storages be-cause of emergence of natural reservoirs; salinization of the surface of soil; swelling of soil at foundations of semi-underground storages and their rise during the winter period. Complex influence of the specified factors leads to change of physical and mechanical properties of the soil bases and, as a result, premature destruction of the bases of buildings and constructions where storage of military property is carried out. On the basis of stated by the actual direction, a study of deformation properties of soil is conducted in order to carry out timely actions for strengthening of the bases and bases of buildings and military construc-tions. After numerous research works performed, it was established that de-pendence between the enclosed tension and the deformations caused by them in soil has a nonlinear character. Therefore, for instance, A. A. Bartholomaei suggests recording it like [2]: mcnncc, (1) where c and n are coefficients, defined by practice; c – tension which isn't exceeding the structural durability of soil стрc P; n – tension causing soil deformation – cn; m – the nonlinearity parameter determined by practical consideration.

40|$|We {{know that}} the {{universe}} consists of 22 % dark matter. The dark matter particle has to be stable, non-relativistic and only weakly interacting. But we don't know what the dark matter is made of {{and how it is}} distributed within our Galaxy. Supersymmetric models predict the existence of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is stable if R-parity is conserved. In supersymmetric models inspired by supergravity, the commonly accepted LSP candidate is the lightest neutralino which is a neutral and weakly interacting massive particle. It is a viable candidate for dark matter since the derived relic abundance is naturally within the observed range. In general, the cosmic antiparticles are expected as secondary products of interactions of the primary cosmic-rays (CRs) with the interstellar medium during propagation. While the measurements of cosmic positrons, antiprotons and diffuse gamma rays have become more precise, the results still do not match with the pure secondary origins. The comparison of the expected background of positron, antiproton and gamma-ray fluxes with experimental data have been performed using CR propagation models. A phenomenological study based on the mSUGRA frameworks was carried out and showed a better interpretation of CR fluxes including neutralino annihilations in the galactic halo or center. The combined data of positrons, antiprotons and gamma rays give a strong constraint on the mSUGRA parameter space. The light neutralino has a mass between 80 and 120 GeV annihilating dominantly to W+W-. The most preferred mSUGRA parameter space belongs to the focus point region. This region also produced the correct dark matter abundance consistent with the WMAP 3 and the 2 dFGRS data. This result might be considered as first evidence of a neutralino dark matter scenario. However, future experiments have to provide measurements of CRs with higher precision. AMS- 02 will be the major particle physics experiment on the ISS and will make a profound impact on our knowledge of high energy CRs with unprecedented accuracy. It will extend our knowledge on CR origins, acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Especially, the measurement of the positron flux may be the most promising for the detection of the neutralino dark matter, since the predicted positron flux is less sensitive to the astrophysical parameters responsible for the propagation and the dark matter halo profile. The AMS- 02 Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) is designed to provide a positron separation from the proton background with high efficiency in the momentum range of 1 GeV/c upto leq 300 GeV/c. It consists of 20 layers of straw <b>module,</b> <b>proportional</b> counters using Xe/CO 2 gas mixtures, interleaved with fleece radiators supported in a conical octagon structure. Major design constraints arise from operating it in a space environment with limited power resources. The TRD readout system is divided into 82 front-end electronic circuits and two pairs of crate electronics and power distribution boxes. A front-end board employs a 64 channel charge sensitive amplifier, shaper and multiplexer based on low noise and low power with a high dynamic range. In addition, it contains an analog-digital-converter, calibration, hybrid control and logic circuits. The front-end electronics has been developed and constructed to meet the requirements of space qualification issued by NASA. Results of functional tests during a series of space qualification tests have been presented and the TRD performance has been investigated using a testbeam at CERN. All of the flight frond-end boards are produced and passed the EMI, vibration and thermal vacuum tests without any failure. Each AMS sub-detector will be delivered to CERN in 2007 for the detector integration. The fully assembled AMS- 02 detector will be tested with high energy beams at CERN. Afterwards a space qualification test will be performed using a large space simulator at ESA-ESTEC. Then it will be delivered to NASA-KSC to prepare for the launch with a space shuttle. The launch and installation of the AMS- 02 detector on ISS is scheduled for 2009.
