Section 360 was originally occupied by James Pitcher about 1842 and he named the land Section Bushy Farm.

40|$|In every {{variety of}} algebras Θ we can {{consider}} its logic and its algebraic geometry. In the previous papers geometry in equational logic, i. e., equational geometry has been studied. Here we describe {{an extension of}} this theory towards the First Order Logic (FOL). The algebraic sets in this geometry are determined by arbitrary sets of FOL formulas. The principal motivation of such generalization lies {{in the area of}} applications to knowledge science. In this paper the FOL formulae are considered in the context of algebraic logic. With this aim we define special Halmos categories. These categories in the algebraic geometry related to FOL play the same role as the category of free algebras Θ 0 play in the equational algebraic geometry. The paper consists of three <b>parts.</b> <b>Section</b> 1 is of introductory character. The first <b>part</b> (<b>sections</b> 2 – 4) contains background on algebraic logic in the given variety of algebras Θ.

5000|$|Charles Matthews owned 13 {{acres of}} land, Part of Section 337, across the Main North Road from the Gepp's Cross Inn, {{on the south}} eastern corner of Gepp's Cross, where he {{operated}} a blacksmiths shop. In December 1848 Matthews applied for a publican's licence for the 'Blacksmiths Arms Hotel' on his premises, but Isaac Gepp objected {{on the grounds that}} two hotels being placed exactly opposite each other would probably cause the road to be obstructed by drays. The bench ruled that competition for custom would induce a disregard for order or public convenience and the application of Charles Matthews was refused. John Merritt who farmed next to the Gepp's Cross Inn and across the road from Matthew's blacksmith shop took out an option to purchase Matthews' 13 acre property. Merritt relinquished this option after he became publican of the Grand Junction Inn in 1851. In 1850 Isaac Gepp transferred his licence and lease of the Gepp's Cross Inn on land Section 360 to Charles Matthews. In 1851 Matthews dropped the former licensee's name from the inn name and changed it to the Victoria Cross. [...] It obviously didn’t sit well with the patrons who by then referred to the area around the inn as Gepp's Cross and in all likelihood continued to call the inn by its colloquial name. Matthews reverted to the accepted name in 1852. Gepp sold his <b>Part</b> <b>Section</b> 360 to Charles Matthews in November 1854 for the sum of £900, with repayment set out in the terms of a mortgage and two lease payments of £50 per year each for inn and surrounding land until the purchase was complete. Months before he purchased the Gepp's Cross Inn and land <b>Part</b> <b>Section</b> 360 Charles Matthews had let the Inn run down. In March 1854 he was cautioned to keep his house in a proper state of cleanliness. By the end of 1858 Matthews was in financial difficulty and he sold one acre of his <b>Part</b> <b>Section</b> 360 bordering John Merritt's farm to the council, which wanted the land to erect a civic hall and stray animal pound. Once built the hall was used as a council office and school until 1899 when it was used as a dwelling.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1840s and early 1850s Marrabel was {{along one of}} the routes to the Burra copper mines used by bullock teamsters carting ore to Kapunda, {{becoming}} one of their stopovers. The fertile district soon attracted farmers, leading to several small service towns being established, including Marrabel. In 1859 a local landholder, John E. Marrabel, laid out a town on <b>part</b> <b>section</b> 1122, Hundred of Waterloo, naming it Marrabel. The township grew rapidly and by 1865 it comprised a hotel, several churches, a school, two general stores, two blacksmiths, a post office, a steam flour mill, plus many other facilities.|$|E

On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the Dingley Dell Conservation Park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 which repealed the former act along with other statutes concerned with conservation.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, when a bill {{is passed}} by the House and Senate and signed by the president, or Congress {{overrides}} a presidential veto, the various provisions contained within the newly enacted law are rearranged according to their policy content and cataloged in the United States Code—a compilation of the general and permanent federal laws of the United States. To repeal any element of an enacted law, Congress must pass a new law containing repeal language and the codified statute's location in the U.S. Code (including the title, chapter, <b>part,</b> <b>section,</b> paragraph and clause). In this way, Congress (and the president) must follow the same rules and procedures for passing any law. When statutes are repealed, their text is simply deleted from the Code and replaced by a note summarizing {{what used to be}} there. Once deleted, the repealed statute no longer has the force of law. All repeals of parts of the US Code are, therefore, express repeals.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} any {{transformation}} to take place, the microstructure {{of the metal}} must be austenite structure. The exact boundaries of the austenite phase region depend on the chemistry of the alloy being heat treated. However, austenitizing temperatures are typically between 790 and 915°C (1455 to 1680°F). The {{amount of time spent}} at this temperature will vary with the alloy and process specifics for a through-hardened part. The best results are achieved when austenitization is long enough to produce a fully austenitic metal microstructure (there will still be graphite present in cast irons) with a consistent carbon content. In steels this may only take a few minutes after the austenitizing temperature has been reached throughout the <b>part</b> <b>section,</b> but in cast irons it takes longer. This is because carbon must diffuse out of the graphite until it has reached the equilibrium concentration dictated by the temperature and the phase diagram. This step may be done in many types of furnaces, in a high temperature salt bath, via direct flame or induction heating. Numerous patents exist for specific methods and variations.|$|E
