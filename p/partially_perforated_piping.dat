40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{the natural}} {{frequencies}} of the perforated square {{plate with a}} square penetration pattern are obtained {{as a function of}} ligament efficiency using the commercial finite-element analysis code ANSYS. In addition, they are used to extract the effective modulus of elasticity under an assumption of a constant Poisson's ratio. The effective modulus of elasticity of the fully perforated square plate is applied to the modal analysis of a <b>partially</b> <b>perforated</b> square plate using a homogeneous finite-element analysis model. The natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of the homogeneous model are compared with the results of the detailed finite-element analysis model of the <b>partially</b> <b>perforated</b> square plate to check the validity of the effective modulus of elasticity.

50|$|After the {{development}} of aerial topdressing in New Zealand, large numbers of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force Tiger Moths built in that country and in the United Kingdom were converted into agricultural aircraft; at the time, this was a pioneering use for aircraft. In this role, the front seat was commonly replaced with a hopper to hold superphosphate for aerial topdressing. A large number were also used to deploy insecticide in the crop-sprayer role, for which several alternative arrangements, including <b>perforated</b> <b>piping</b> being installed underneath the mainplanes or the placement of rotary atomisers on the lower mainplane, were used. From the mid-1950s onwards, these topdressers were gradually replaced by more modern types such as the PAC Fletcher; as such, {{a large number of}} New Zealand Tiger Moths in good flying condition were then passed to pilot owner enthusiasts.|$|R

30|$|In {{our first}} case, {{laparoscopy}} was performed almost 4  years after the laparotomy failure. The preoperative CT scan and sigmoidoscopy {{gave us a}} clear picture of the site of the IUD. The dissection and traction on the thread were applied with some confidence, knowing that the device was not in the bowel, urinary system or a vessel. Another problem of persistent traction forces on the strings would have been the breaking down of the device or thread. To avoid these, we applied sharp dissection to a certain degree to the first case only. For those cases where the IUD is shown to be <b>partially</b> <b>perforating</b> the sigmoid colon or rectum and the arms or the thread are visible by sigmoidscopy, the IUD can be removed rectally [9], thus avoiding an unnecessary surgical intervention.|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{computer}} simulation of in-bin grain drying was conducted. The {{study was to}} model the non-uniform distribution of temperature and moisture content in bins with slanted or <b>partially</b> <b>perforated</b> floors, hence with non-parallel airflow streamlines. Complete data were obtained for grain drying with non-parallel airflow. These data included moisture contents, temperatures, static pressures, intergranular air velocities, and shrinkage of the drying beds. The intergranular air velocities measured {{were found to be}} about three times those calculated from the superficial air velocity divided by the bulk porosity. The non-parallel airflow regions were more pronounced near the air entrance. A way from the entrance regions, the air velocity profile tended to be uniform. The <b>partially</b> <b>perforated</b> floor created higher resistance to airflow than the totally or slanted perforated floors. The drying pattern depended on the floor configuration. For the slanted floor, grain {{at the center of the}} bin remained undried at about 20 % moisture content when the average moisture content of the bin reached 14 % (w. b.). Typical bulk shrinkage of grain was about 20 % for grain dried from 22 % to 12 % moisture content. The shrinkage was non-uniform with the slanted floor. Grain shrinkage resulted in denser packing of the grain and an increase in the resistance to airflow. This increase was somewhat compensated for by a decrease in the grain bed depth. The net decrease in airflow supplied to the bin was about 13 %. An improved simulation scheme was developed to simulate the airflow distribution and to compute heat and mass transfer processes along streamlines. The improved simulation scheme predicts the general pattern of moisture content. Under non-parallel airflow conditions, the model provides a better estimation of moisture content than it does of grain temperature. Accurate prediction of airflow distribution was needed to simulate the grain drying process accurately. More work is required to simulate three dimensional flow and drying with concurrent grain shrinkage...|$|R

Objective: To compare, in vivo, bone tissue response to {{two types of}} biomaterials: Resilon points and gutta-percha points. Material and methods: For this purpose, 40 male albino Wistar rats were used for implantation of the biomaterial points in their previously perforated left tibia. Twenty rats received gutta-percha point implants and the other 20 rats received Resilon point implants. All animals had their right tibia <b>partially</b> <b>perforated,</b> as a control group.

40|$|Objective. Imperforate hymen {{represents}} the extreme in {{the spectrum of}} hymenal embryological variations. The archetypal presentation in the adolescent patient is that of cyclical abdominopelvic pain {{in the presence of}} amenorrhoea. We reported a rare event of imperforate hymen presenting as a cause of tuboovarian abscess (TOA). Case Study. A 14 -year-old girl presented to the emergency department complaining of severe left iliac fossa pain. It was her first episode of heavy bleeding per vagina, and she had a history of cyclical pelvic pain. She was clinically unwell, and an external genital examination demonstrated a <b>partially</b> <b>perforated</b> hymen. A transabdominal ultrasound showed grossly dilated serpiginous fallopian tubes. The upper part of the vagina was filled with homogeneous echogenic substance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated complex right adnexa mass with bilateral pyo-haemato-salpinges, haematometra, and haematocolpos. In theatre, the imperforate hymen was opened via cruciate incision and blood was drained from the vagina. At laparoscopy, dense purulent material was evacuated prior to an incision and drainage of the persistent right TOA. Conclusion. Ideally identification of imperforate hymen should occur during neonatal examination to prevent symptomatic presentation. Our case highlights the risks of late recognition resulting in the development of sepsis and TOA. Griffith Health FacultyFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} linear {{elasticity}} is considered in a domain whose boundary {{depends on a}} small parameter #epsilon#> 0 and has a part with a rugged structure. The rugged part of the boundary may bend sharply and embrace cavities or channels, and as #epsilon##-># 0, it approaches a limit surface on the boundary of the limit domain. On the rugged part of the boundary, conditions of two types are considered: (I) contact with rigid obstacles (conditions of Signorini type); (II) reaction forces involving the parameter #epsilon# and nonlinearly depending on displacements. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of weak solutions to such boundary value problems as #epsilon##-># 0 and construct the limit problem, according to the geometric structure of the rugged part of the boundary and the external surface forces and their dependence on the parameter #epsilon#. In general, the limit problem has {{the form of a}} variational inequality over a certain closed convex cone in a Sobolev space. This cone characterizes the boundary conditions of the limit problem and is described in terms of the functions involved in the nonlinear boundary conditions on the rugged boundary. As shown by examples, in the limit, the type of the boundary condition may change. To justify these asymptotic results, we give a detailed exposition of some facts about extensions, Korn's inequalities, traces, and nonlinear boundary conditions in <b>partially</b> <b>perforated</b> domains with Lipschitz continuous boundaries.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} time-domain computational {{fluid dynamics}} approach is employed to calculate and analyze the sound attenuation behavior of water-filled perforated pipe silencers. Transmission loss predictions from the time-domain {{computational fluid dynamics}} approach and the frequency-domain finite element method agree well {{with each other for}} the straight-through and cross-flow perforated pipe silencers without flow. Then, the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach is used to investigate the effects of flow velocity, diameter, and porosity of orifices on the sound attenuation behavior of the silencers. The numerical predictions demonstrate that the flow increases the transmission loss, especially at high frequencies. Based on the above analysis, <b>partially</b> plugged straight-through <b>perforated</b> pipe silencer is proposed to improve the sound attenuation performance by increasing the flow velocity through the orifices.

40|$|The {{research}} {{covered in}} this thesis {{is concerned with the}} effects of the behaviour and load carrying capacities of classes of steel beam structures with various shapes of web openings. A comprehensive investigation on non-composite and <b>partially</b> concrete encased <b>perforated</b> steel Isections with large web openings positioned along the centre-line of the beams was undertaken. This thesis enhances the current knowledge on these classes of perforated beams, as previous research has shown that these beams are susceptible to various failure modes, due to the existence of large web openings. Currently, perforated steel beams with large web openings are utilised in most engineering applications such as infrastructure, ship building and aeronautical engineering. The most significant benefits of using such beams are the achievement of reductions in weight and accommodation of services within their structural depth of floor systems. Specifically, in building applications, service integration eliminates the internal columns and supports, produces lighter structures which leading to reduced construction and installation time and results in cost effective structural forms and uses. However, many uncertainties are associated with perforated beams as well as non-standard methodology is used for their assessment. Perforated beams with standard circular, hexagonal and elongated web openings are most widely used nowadays, whilst various non-standard web opening shapes, such as `elliptical', are introduced through this thesis for first time. These new pioneering web opening shapes improve the structural performance of the perforated beams when examined under two critical failure modes (i. e. shear-'Vierendeel' mechanism and web-post buckling). Moreover, the manufacturing procedure of the `elliptical' web openings show great advantage in comparison with the manufacturing way of the more popular perforated beams with circular web openings (i. e. cellular beams). Also, other web opening shapes are reported and examined {{in this thesis}}. Furthermore, the novelty of the work seems to consist of the treatment of web openings of somewhat greater web opening depth than those usually considered and the introduction of a new class of composite concrete-steel beam. Despite the abundant experimental work on perforated steel beams that has been conducted by researchers throughout the years, the results are not comprehensive, due to the complexity of the beam configuration and the large number of variable parameters. Therefore, using commercially available finite element (FE) software, numerical analyses were verified by comparison to a new experimental programme designed to test each of the new structural forms. The numerical programme was then used to undertake extensive parametric studies to isolate some of the geometric and material properties that influence the failure modes associated with each of the new forms of structural systems. The main parameters under consideration are the web opening depth (noted usually as diameter), the critical opening length of the top and bottom tee-sections, the web opening spacing, the steel flange and web thicknesses, the concrete strength and contact properties between the steel and concrete of the newly formed composite beams. Detailed study of plastic hinges formation (i. e. high stress concentrations) was also employed {{in the vicinity of the}} web openings, by conducting both experimental and finite element (FE) investigation. This research study should now lead to better management of the use of perforated beams with large web openings as the profound difference between the novel and the conventional perforated beams is demonstrated. Useful practical applications of the so-called structural forms would be of particular interest in the general engineering, not just because of their superior structural performance, but also because of their low cost in manufacturing and usage. Another contribution is the investigation of the partial steel encasement with the concrete in-fill, on the percentage of enhancement of the steel perforated beams with web openings under high shear forces as well as on the distinction which is drawn between the conventional and the new composite beams. Finally, a further indirect outcome of this research thesis is the excellent agreement between the experimental and FE analyses as well as the data that can be used by future researchers to widen the above research to various engineering applications...|$|R
