5|$|The North Vietnamese {{reacted to}} the {{political}} changes in Cambodia by sending Premier Phạm Văn Đồng to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he wanted for his insurgency against the Cambodian government. <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing {{at the same time}} but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. In May 1970, <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> finally returned to Cambodia and the pace of the insurgency greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Vietnam War ended, the {{relationship}} between the Khmer Rouge—which {{was in the process of}} seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol—and North Vietnam was strained. Clashes between Vietnamese communists and Khmer Rouge forces began as early as 1974, and the following year <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> signed a treaty codifying the ‘friendship’ between the Khmer Rouge and China.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their final offensive against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow the Khmer Rouge advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, the Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot,</b> began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E

5|$|The power vacuum the Vietnamese {{communist}}s left in {{its wake}} in Cambodia was soon filled by the return of a young group of Cambodian communist revolutionaries, many of whom received their communist education in France. In 1960, the KPRP {{changed its name to}} the Kampuchean Communist Party (KCP), and the name was later adopted by the majority coalition that formed around Saloth Sar (<b>Pol</b> <b>Pot),</b> Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan as the ‘true’ political institution memorialising the KCP. This clique became the genesis of the Khmer Rouge, and its doctrine was heavily influenced by the Maoist ideology.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Vietnam War, Lê Duẩn took an {{aggressive}} posture. He saw attack {{as the key}} to victory. When the North finally won the war in 1975, Lê Duẩn and his associates were overly optimistic about the future. The Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1980) was a failure and left the Vietnamese economy in crisis. Vietnam was then headed by a gerontocracy (in which the rulers are much older than the average adult). Vietnam became internationally isolated during Lê Duẩn's rule. In 1979 the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot,</b> fought a war with China and became dependent on Soviet economic aid. Lê Duẩn died in July 1986 and was succeeded by Trường Chinh.|$|E
5|$|Nine days later, on 10 May 1975, the Kampuchean {{military}} {{continued its}} incursion by capturing Thổ Chu, where it executed 500 Vietnamese civilians. The Vietnamese military immediately responded to Kampuchean actions by launching a counter-attack and removing Kampuchean forces from Phu Quoc and Tho Chu, and then invading the Kampuchean island of Koh Wai. In June 1975, {{while on a}} visit to Hanoi, Kampuchean leader <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> proposed that Vietnam and his country should sign a treaty of friendship and begin discussions on border disputes. However, those discussions never materialised, and the Kampucheans claimed that Vietnam turned down both offers. In August 1975, Vietnam returned the island of Koh Wai to Kampuchea and formally recognised Kampuchean sovereignty over the island.|$|E

5000|$|His {{father died}} when he was 6 years old before <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot's</b> regime. Veasna was an industrious child, he nurtured chickens, ducks and helped his mother's work. When Veasna was eight years old, one night he asked his mother a question, [...] "Mom, Will you die when you get old?" [...] His mother was amazed and said [...] "Yes". Veasna added, [...] "Where are you gonna wait for me then?" [...] Mother said [...] "I don't know" [...] after that Veasna had slept and weeping a night.His mother died in 2006. the cause of death is a half numb body decease. Veasna's {{childhood}} had lived almost entirely in two eras. The first was the time of foreign invasion (1970-1975), and the second was <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot’s</b> Genocidal Regime, which was backed by foreign countries (1975-1979). During <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot's</b> regime, he and his mother had lived in Peanea village where is his native land. During <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot's</b> regime he was a child among other children who lived under the domination of the black organization was commanded by organization to collect cow dungs.|$|R
5|$|The Khmer Rouge regime, led by <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot,</b> {{wanted to}} return the nation of Cambodia to an idyllic notion of the past by {{implementing}} a radical form of agrarian socialism while simultaneously shunning outside aid and influence. In order to build and protect their utopian goals, the regime perceived enmity in anyone tied to the previous Cambodian governments, ethnic and religious minorities, intellectuals, and members of certain professions. Artists posed a threat due to their own influence on culture, incompatibility with an agrarian lifestyle, or exhibiting foreign influence. Between 1975 and 1979, about 2 million people (25% of the country's population) were killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide. Several of the artists on Cambodian Rocks {{are thought to have}} been among those killed, and information about them destroyed along with much of their creative output.|$|E
5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} onwards Sihanouk was kept {{under house arrest}} at the royal palace. In September 1978 he was removed to another {{apartment}} in Phnom Penh's suburbs, where he lived {{until the end of}} the year. Throughout his confinement, Sihanouk made several unsuccessful requests to the Angkar to travel overseas. On New Year's Day of 1979, Sihanouk was taken from Phnom Penh to Sisophon, where they stayed for three days until 5January, when they were taken back to Phnom Penh. Sihanouk was taken to meet <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot,</b> who briefed him on the Angkar's plans to repulse Vietnamese troops, which had since invaded parts of eastern Cambodia in December 1978. On 6January 1979, Sihanouk flew to Beijing from Phnom Penh, where he was greeted by Zhou Enlai's successor, Deng Xiaoping. Three days later, Sihanouk flew from Beijing to New York to attend the UN Security Council, where he simultaneously condemned the Khmer Rouge for orchestrating the Cambodian genocide as well as the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. Sihanouk subsequently sought asylum in China after making two unsuccessful asylum applications with the US and France.|$|E

5|$|In August 1996, Khmer Rouge leaders <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> and Ieng Sary {{publicly}} split, {{with the}} former denouncing the latter in a radio broadcast. Ieng Sary responded by disassociating himself from the Khmer Rouge {{and went on to}} form his own political party, the Democratic National Union Movement. Pol Pot's announcement prompted Ranariddh and Hun Sen to briefly set their political differences aside to jointly seek a royal pardon for Ieng Sary, who had been sentenced to death by the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government in 1979. Subsequently, in October and December 1996, both Ranariddh and Hun Sen competed to win Ieng Sary's favour by separately visiting the leader at his fiefdom in Pailin. Hun Sen gained the upper hand, when he announced {{at the end of his}} visit that he had managed to convince Khmer Rouge soldiers under Ieng Sary's charge to join the CPP. When Ranariddh announced plans for a follow-up to visit Samlout, another town located within Ieng Sary's fiefdom, his soldiers threatened to shoot down Ranariddh's helicopter if he went there, prompting Ranariddh to cancel his visit.|$|E
25|$|In July 1963, <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> {{and most}} of the central {{committee}} left Phnom Penh to establish an insurgent base in Rotanokiri (Ratanakiri) Province in the northeast. <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> had shortly before been put on a list of thirty four leftists who were summoned by Sihanouk to join the government and sign statements saying Sihanouk was the only possible leader for the country. <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> and Chou Chet were the only people on the list who escaped. All the others agreed to cooperate with the government and were afterward under 24 hour surveillance by the police.|$|E

25|$|These {{men were}} {{perhaps the most}} educated leaders {{in the history of}} Asian communism. Two of them, Khieu Samphan and Hou Yuon, earned doctorates from the University of Paris; Hu Nim {{obtained}} his degree from the University of Phnom Penh in 1965. In retrospect, it seems enigmatic that these talented members of the elite, sent to France on government scholarships, could launch the bloodiest and most radical revolution in modern Asian history. Most came from landowner or civil servant families. <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> and Hou Yuon may have been related to the royal family. An older sister of <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> had been a concubine at the court of King Monivong. Three of the Paris group forged a bond that survived years of revolutionary struggle and intraparty strife, <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> and Ieng Sary married Khieu Ponnary and Khieu Thirith (also known as Ieng Thirith), purportedly relatives of Khieu Samphan. These two well-educated women also {{played a central role in}} the regime of Democratic Kampuchea.|$|E
25|$|The Khmer Rouge, led by <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot,</b> Ta Mok {{and other}} leaders, {{organized}} the mass killing of ideologically suspect groups. The {{total number of}} victims is estimated at approximately 1.7 million Cambodians between 1975–1979, including deaths from slave labour.|$|E
25|$|The region <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> and {{the others}} moved to {{inhabited}} by tribal minorities, the Khmer Loeu, whose rough treatment (including resettlement and forced assimilation) {{at the hands of}} the central government made them willing recruits for a guerrilla struggle. In 1965 <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> made a visit of several months duration to North Vietnam and China. He probably received some training in China, which must have enhanced his prestige when he returned to the WPK's liberated areas. Despite friendly relations between Sihanouk and the Chinese, the latter kept Pol Pot's visit a secret from Sihanouk. In September 1966, the party changed its name in secret to the Kampuchean (or Khmer) Communist Party (KCP). The change in the name of the party was a closely guarded secret. Lower ranking members of the party and even the Vietnamese were not told of it and neither was the membership until many years later.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{practical}} {{support of}} Chinese business interests, many {{have suggested that}} Operation Murambatsvina also demonstrates an adherence to a 'Look East' ideology and is evidence that Zanu-PF has embraced an Asian model of government where individual rights are often subverted {{for the good of}} the masses, or the regime.

25|$|Totalitarian governments {{manipulate}} {{and apply}} anti-intellectualism to repress political dissent.

In the Communist state of Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979), the Khmer Rouge régime of <b>Pol</b> <b>Pot</b> condemned most of the non–Communist intelligentsia to death in the Killing Fields.|$|E
