25|$|Given {{the above}} framework, {{different}} software solutions for detecting SNVs vary {{based on how}} they calculate the <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities</b> , the error model used to model the probabilities , and the partitioning of the overall genotypes into separate sub-genotypes, whose probabilities can be individually estimated in this framework.|$|E
25|$|This 3 {{component}} example {{explains how}} the payoffs are conditional upon which outcomes occur. The advertising manager can characterize the outcomes based on past experience and knowledge and devise some possible {{events that are}} more likely to occur than others.

25|$|Neyman–Pearson {{theory can}} {{accommodate}} both <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities</b> {{and the costs}} of actions resulting from decisions. The former allows each test to consider the results of earlier tests (unlike Fisher's significance tests). The latter allows the consideration of economic issues (for example) as well as probabilities. A likelihood ratio remains a good criterion for selecting among hypotheses.|$|E
50|$|Not taking <b>prior</b> <b>probability</b> {{into account}} {{partially}} or completely is called base rate neglect. The reverse, insufficient adjustment from the <b>prior</b> <b>probability</b> is conservatism.|$|R

30|$|In the {{proposed}} method, the <b>prior</b> <b>probability</b> is adaptively {{set for the}} target video sequence. Specifically, we calculate the parameters which determine the distribution shape of the <b>prior</b> <b>probability</b> on intensity gradients to keep the sharpness in edge regions. Furthermore, the <b>prior</b> <b>probability</b> is also determined {{in such a way}} that noises and ringing artifacts are suppressed in smooth regions.|$|R
25|$|Bayesian {{inference}} is one proposed {{alternative to}} significance testing. (Nickerson cited 10 sources suggesting it, including Rozeboom (1960)). For example, Bayesian parameter estimation can provide rich {{information about the}} data from which researchers can draw inferences, while using uncertain priors that exert only minimal influence on the results when enough data is available. Psychologist John K. Kruschke has suggested Bayesian estimation as an alternative for the t-test. Alternatively two competing models/hypothesis can be compared using Bayes factors. Bayesian methods could be criticized for requiring information that is seldom available in the cases where significance testing is most heavily used. Neither the <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities</b> nor the probability distribution of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis are often available in the social sciences.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} of <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities</b> depends on available {{data from the}} genome being studied, {{and the type of}} analysis being performed. For studies where good reference data containing frequencies of known mutations is available (for example, in studying human genome data), these known frequencies of genotypes in the population can be used to estimate priors. Given population wide allele frequencies, prior genotype probabilities can be calculated at each locus according to the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. In the absence of such data, constant priors can be used, independent of the locus. These can be set using heuristically chosen values, possibly informed by the kind of variations being sought by the study. Alternatively, supervised machine-learning procedures have been investigated that seek to learn optimal prior values for individuals in a sample, using supplied NGS data from these individuals.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} statistics, Haar {{measures are}} used for prior measures, which are <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities</b> for compact groups of transformations. These prior measures are used to construct admissible procedures, by appeal to the characterization of admissible procedures as Bayesian procedures (or limits of Bayesian procedures) by Wald. For example, a right Haar measure {{for a family of}} distributions with a location parameter results in the Pitman estimator, which is best equivariant. When left and right Haar measures differ, the right measure is usually preferred as a prior distribution. For the group of affine transformations on the parameter space of the normal distribution, the right Haar measure is the Jeffreys prior measure. Unfortunately, even right Haar measures sometimes result in useless priors, which cannot be recommended for practical use, like other methods of constructing prior measures that avoid subjective information.|$|E

2500|$|Bayesian {{probability}} specifies {{that there}} is some <b>prior</b> <b>probability.</b> Bayesian statisticians can use both an objective and a subjective approach when interpreting the <b>prior</b> <b>probability,</b> which is then updated in light of new relevant information.

50|$|Under this parametrization, one may {{place an}} uninformative <b>prior</b> <b>probability</b> over the mean, and a vague <b>prior</b> <b>probability</b> (such as an {{exponential}} or gamma distribution) over the positive reals {{for the sample}} size, if they are independent, and prior data and/or beliefs justify it.|$|R
5000|$|Estimating the <b>prior</b> <b>probability</b> {{for each}} {{hypothesis}} (...) is rarely feasible.|$|R
2500|$|The use of Bayesian {{probability}} involves specifying a prior probability. This may {{be obtained}} from consideration of whether the required prior probability is greater or lesser than a reference probability associated with an urn model or a thought experiment. [...] The issue is that for a given problem, multiple thought experiments could apply, and choosing one {{is a matter of}} judgement: different people may assign different <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities,</b> known as the reference class problem.|$|E
2500|$|After {{calculating the}} column <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities</b> the {{alignment}} probability is estimated by summing over all possible secondary structures.

2500|$|Significance {{testing is}} largely {{the product of}} Karl Pearson (p-value, Pearson's chi-squared test), William Sealy Gosset (Student's t-distribution), and Ronald Fisher ("null hypothesis", {{analysis}} of variance, [...] "significance test"), while hypothesis testing was developed by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson (son of Karl). Ronald Fisher began his life in statistics as a Bayesian (Zabell 1992), but Fisher soon grew disenchanted with the subjectivity involved (namely use {{of the principle of}} indifference when determining <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities),</b> and sought to provide a more [...] "objective" [...] approach to inductive inference..|$|E

[...] However gathering this additional data is costly, time consuming and may not lead to perfectly reliable results.

2500|$|In {{imbalanced}} datasets, {{where the}} sampling ratio {{does not follow}} the population statistics, one can resample the dataset in a conservative manner called minimax sampling. The minimax sampling has its origin in Anderson minimax ratio whose value is proved to be 0.5: in a binary classification, the class-sample sizes should be chosen equally. This ratio can be proved to be minimax ratio only under the assumption of LDA classifier with Gaussian distributions. The notion of minimax sampling is recently developed for a general class of classification rules, called class-wise smart classifiers. In this case, the sampling ratio of classes is selected so that the worst case classifier error over all the possible population statistics for class <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities,</b> would be the ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{an example}} of entanglement: a {{subatomic}} particle decays into an entangled pair of other particles. The decay events obey the various conservation laws, and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle (so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a spin-zero particle could decay {{into a pair of}} spin-½ particles. Since the total spin before and after this decay must be zero (conservation of angular momentum), whenever the first particle is measured to be spin up on some axis, the other, when measured on the same axis, is always found to be spin down. (This is called the spin anti-correlated case; and if the <b>prior</b> <b>probabilities</b> for measuring each spin are equal, the pair is said to be in the singlet state.) ...|$|E
