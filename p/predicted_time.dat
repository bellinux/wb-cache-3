500|$|The {{fifth and}} final season begins in 2036, {{following}} from the flash-forward fourth-season episode [...] "Letters of Transit". As September warned, Observers {{from the far}} future, having ruined Earth for themselves, time-traveled to 2015 and instituted [...] "The Purge", wiped out much of humanity, subjected the survivors to their control, and began modifying the planet's environment to be more suitable for themselves. The Fringe team was able to seal themselves in amber to avoid capture shortly after the Purge, and are reunited through Henrietta ("Etta") (Georgina Haig), Peter and Olivia's now adult daughter who disappeared shortly after the Observer arrival in 2015. Walter reveals he and September developed a plan to defeat the Observers, revealed {{through a series of}} pre-recorded videotapes ambered in the lab. The tapes lead to several components of a device, including a young Observer child, named Michael (Spencer List in Season 1 and Rowan Longworth in Season 5), but further allude to a man named Donald that had helped Walter prepare the plan. Etta is killed during these events, driving Olivia and Peter to complete the plan for her sake. Through Michael, they discover Donald is September, having been stripped of his Observer powers for helping the Fringe team, and that Michael is his genetic son, having been purposely grown as an anomaly in the far future. September explains the plan is to send Michael to the year 2167, where human genetic experiments to sacrifice emotion for intelligence would be started and leading {{to the creation of the}} Observers; by showing them Michael, who possesses both emotion and intelligence, the experiments would be stopped and the Observers never created. September is prepared to take Michael to the future as the plan is set in motion, but he is shot and killed at the last moment; Walter, already made aware that he will have to make a sacrifice, takes Michael through to the future to assure the plan's completion. As <b>predicted,</b> <b>time</b> is reset from the invasion onwards in 2015; the Observers never invade, and Peter, Olivia, and Etta, live their lives peacefully—though Peter receives one final letter from his father: a drawing of a white tulip.|$|E

40|$|The authors tested whether perfectionism {{dimensions}} {{interact with}} specific stress to <b>predict</b> depres-sion over <b>time.</b> A sample of 103 {{current and former}} patients completed measures of perfectionism and depression at Time 1 and measures of stress and depression 4 months later.

Depressive disorders are recognized as among the most prev-alent forms of psychopathology, and a goal among researchers is to identify factors that predispose people to these disorders.
