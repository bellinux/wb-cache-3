5|$|By 1963 McNamara had {{convinced}} Kennedy that the Zeus {{was simply not}} worth deploying. The earlier concerns about cost and effectiveness, {{as well as new}} difficulties in terms of attack size and decoy problems, led McNamara to cancel the Zeus project on 5 January 1963. In its place they decided to continue work on Nike-X. Nike-X development was based in the existing Nike Zeus <b>Project</b> <b>Office</b> until their name was changed to Nike-X on 1 February 1964.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, Jodrell Bank {{was named}} as the {{location}} of the control centre for the planned Square Kilometre Array, or SKA <b>Project</b> <b>Office</b> (SPO). The SKA is being planned by a collaboration of 20 countries and when completed it is intended to be the most powerful radio telescope ever built. In April 2015 it was further announced that Jodrell Bank would be the permanent home of the SKA headquarters for the period of operation expected for the telescope (over 50 years).|$|E
5|$|In early 2006 a <b>project</b> <b>office</b> was {{established}} within the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) {{to evaluate the}} options for acquiring heavy lift aircraft. The office considered the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, which was in service with the USAF at the time, {{as well as the}} Airbus A400M Atlas, which was yet to make its first flight. Boeing aggressively marketed the C-17 to the Australian Government during this period. Though unstated, commonality with the USAF and the United Kingdom's RAF was also considered advantageous. In March 2006, Minister for Defence Brendan Nelson announced that the government had decided to purchase three C-17s and take out an option for a fourth. Nelson also announced that the C-17s would be operated by No. 36 Squadron RAAF, which was to transfer its C-130H Hercules to No. 37 Squadron and relocate from RAAF Base Richmond in New South Wales to RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland. Amberley was selected over Richmond as the base for the Globemasters as its runways and engineering facilities were better able to support large aircraft.|$|E

To direct the Special <b>Projects</b> <b>Office,</b> at Sides' persistent suggestion, Burke selected Sides' former deputy, Rear Admiral William F. Raborn, Jr., whose phenomenal success in that role would earn him renown as the father of Polaris.|$|R
5|$|The DDL {{project was}} {{reviewed}} {{again when the}} Liberal Fraser Government came into office in late 1975. The review panel unanimously advised the new Minister for Defence James Killen that the DDL project was no longer viable as {{the total cost of}} the ships would be about $130 million higher than the Oliver Hazard Perry project, and it would take three years longer for the DDLs to be completed. Killen accepted this advice, and a firm order for two Oliver Hazard Perry frigates was placed in February 1976. A third ship was ordered in late 1977. Six of these frigates, which were designated the , were eventually ordered, and the final two were built in Australia at Williamstown. The expertise of the DDL <b>project</b> <b>office</b> and the preparations which had been undertaken to manage the process of ordering and building the ships contributed to the Navy's ability to rapidly evaluate alternative designs and oversee their entry into service once an order was placed.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} {{themselves were}} also found to be poorly manufactured, having been shaped by hand, {{with at least one}} cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the propellers was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine <b>project</b> <b>office</b> sent the propeller to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the propeller design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was one of the points of contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E

25|$|The Submarine Institute of Australia {{released}} a report in July 2007 arguing that planning {{for the next generation}} of Australian submarines had to begin soon if they were to be replaced by the 2020s. In December 2007, a month after coming into office following the 2007 federal election, Minister for Defence Joel Fitzgibbon announced that planning for the Collins class replacement (designated SEA 1000) had commenced. The SEA 1000 <b>project</b> <b>office</b> was established within the Defence Materiel Organisation in October 2008, and was being jointly administered with Defence's Capability Development Group.

Designed by the head of the Messerschmitt <b>Project</b> <b>Office</b> Woldemar Voigt (1907–1980), between 3 and 30 March 1945 {{as an alternative to the}} Me P.1111, the Me P.1112 design was less radical than the P.1111 and incorporated the lessons learned from {{the development of the}} Messerschmitt P.1110 design.

500|$|Despite {{cancelling}} the DDL project, {{the government}} endorsed the RAN's requirement for new destroyer-type warships and requested {{a review of}} existing foreign designs to find a replacement. The process of evaluating new designs was managed by what had been the DDL <b>project</b> <b>office,</b> and in line with the government's priorities it initially focused on selecting affordable warships of a proven design for further consideration. A large number of designs were studied by the <b>project</b> <b>office,</b> and the United States' s and a variant of the British Type 42 destroyer armed with SM-1 surface to air missiles were eventually short listed for detailed evaluation. The project team found that the Type 42 was the only design capable of meeting the Navy's requirement, and stated that the Oliver Hazard Perry class was [...] "a second rate escort that falls short of the DDL requirements on virtually every respect". Despite this, there were serious concerns over whether {{it would be possible to}} fit SM-1 missiles to the Type 42, and this led the government to approve the purchase of two Oliver Hazard Perry ships from the United States in April 1974.|$|E
500|$|Work on the Mirage {{replacement}} program resumed in 1975, and the Tactical Fighter <b>Project</b> <b>Office</b> {{was established}} in 1976 to manage the process of selecting the RAAF's next fighter. A request for proposals was issued in November that year and attracted eleven responses. By March 1977 the office had chosen {{to focus on the}} F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, Dassault Mirage 2000 [...] and Panavia Tornado, as well as the McDonnell Douglas F-18A and F-18L; the F-18A was a carrier-based fighter developed from the YF-17 for the United States Navy, and the F-18L was a land-based variant of this design. The Grumman F-14 Tomcat was also considered by the <b>project</b> <b>office,</b> but was regarded as unsuitable and never placed on the official shortlist. In November 1978 the F-15 and Tornado were removed from the list of aircraft being considered. The Tornado was excluded as it was principally a strike aircraft and had limited air-to-air capability. While the F-15 was an impressive aircraft that met or exceeded almost all of the RAAF's requirements, it was believed that the air force did not need a fighter with such advanced capabilities and that introducing it into service could destabilise Australia's region.|$|E
