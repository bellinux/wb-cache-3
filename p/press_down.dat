5|$|The game is {{seen from}} a {{top-down}} perspective, and focuses on sword combat. The player moves the hero through the game world, which is divided into several areas; as the player enters one, enemy characters start to appear there. Among the areas in the game world, there are dungeons that the player needs to get through. These usually consist {{of a number of}} rooms divided across three to four floors; in order to navigate their way through a dungeon, the player needs to break walls, unlock doors, and sometimes <b>press</b> <b>down</b> buttons and break pots.|$|E

He used a G-pen nib by Zebra, usually getting three chapters {{out of one}} because he typically does not <b>press</b> <b>down</b> hard. Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old fine point Tenshōdō brush. His whiteout was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to Bristol board, from a seller connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30cm long.|$|E

5|$|Manstein's forces—mostly infantry—achieved a rapid {{breakthrough}} {{during the}} first days against heavy Soviet resistance. After most of {{the neck of the}} Perekop Isthmus had been taken, his forces were substantially reduced, leaving six German divisions and the Romanian Third Army. The rest of the Perekop Isthmus was captured slowly and with some difficulty; Manstein complained of a lack of air support to contest Soviet air superiority in the region. He next created a mobile reconnaissance unit to <b>press</b> <b>down</b> the peninsula, cutting the road between Simferopol and Sevastopol on 31 October. Simferopol was captured the next day. The 11th Army had captured all of the Crimean Peninsula—except for Sevastopol—by 16 November. Meanwhile, the Red Army had evacuated 300,000 personnel out of the city by sea.|$|E
5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to <b>press</b> <b>down</b> on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prominent}} early composers and players in Italy were Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger and Alessandro Piccinini. Giuliano Paratico was another early Italian chitarrone player. Little solo music survives from England, but William Lawes and others used theorbos in chamber ensembles and opera orchestras. In France, theorbos were appreciated {{and used in}} orchestral or chamber music until {{the second half of}} the 18th century (Nicolas Hotman, Robert de Visée). Court orchestras at Vienna, Bayreuth and Berlin still employed theorbo players after 1750 (Ernst Gottlieb Baron, Francesco Conti). Solo music for the theorbo is notated in tablature, a form of music notation in which the frets and strings which a player must <b>press</b> <b>down</b> are printed on a series of parallel lines which represent the strings on the fretboard.|$|E
25|$|The east-facing {{pediment}} on {{the southern}} library shows Śiva seated on the summit of Mount Kailāsa, his mythological abode. His consort Umā sits on his lap and clings anxiously to his torso. Other beings are also present {{on the slopes of}} the mountain, arranged in a strict hierarchy of three tiers from top to bottom. In the top tier sit bearded wise men and ascetics, in the middle tier mythological figures with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans, and in the bottom tier large animals, including a number of lions. In the middle of the scene stands the ten-headed demon king Rāvaṇa. He is shaking the mountain in its very foundations as the animals flee from his presence and as the wise men and mythological beings discuss the situation or pray. According to the legend, Śiva stopped Rāvaṇa from shaking the mountain by using his toe to <b>press</b> <b>down</b> on the mountain and to trap Rāvana underneath for 1000 years.|$|E

500|$|In March 1895, {{the same}} month he left Congress, Bryan passed his 35thbirthday, making him constitutionally {{eligible}} for the presidency. [...] By then, {{he had come to}} see his nomination for that office as possible, even likely. [...] Bryan believed he could use the coalition-building techniques he had applied in gaining election to Congress, uniting pro-silver forces behind him to gain the Democratic nomination and the presidency. [...] To that end, it was important that the Populists not nominate a rival silver candidate, and he took pains to cultivate good relations with Populist leaders. [...] Through 1895 and early 1896, Bryan sought to make himself as widely known as an advocate for silver as possible. [...] He had accepted the nominal editorship of the Omaha World-Herald in August 1894. The position involved no day-to-day duties, but allowed him to publish his political commentaries. [...] In the 17months between his departure from Congress and the Democratic National Convention in July 1896, Bryan travelled widely through the South and West, speaking on silver. [...] At every stop, he made contacts that he later cultivated. [...] Several times, in his addresses, Bryan repeated variations on lines he had spoken in Congress in December 1894, decrying the gold standard, [...] "I will not help to crucify mankind upon a cross of gold. [...] I will not aid them to <b>press</b> <b>down</b> upon the bleeding brow of labor this crown of thorns." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other notable texts {{published}} included [...] The Prohibition of Killing, Manual {{of worship}} of Shiva temple and The Essence of the Saiva Religion. His first major literary publication appeared in 1851, the 272-page prose version of Sekkilar's Periya Puranam, a retelling of the 12th century hagiography of the Nayanars or Saivite saints. In 1853 he published Nakkirar's Tirumurukarrupatai, {{with its own}} commentary. It was a devotional poem to Sri Murugan. This was followed by local missionaries attacking Sri Murugan as an [...] "immoral deity" [...] for marrying two women. As a response Navalar published Radiant Wisdom explaining how the chronicles embody differing levels of meaning and that numerous characters in the Christian Bible, like King David, who were being claimed as examples of good conduct by the missionaries, were being depicted as having multiple wives and sexual partners themselves. He also published literature of controversial nature. He along with Centinatha Aiyar, published examples of indecent language from the Bible and published it as Disgusting Things in the Bible (Bibiliya Kutsita). In 1852, he along with Ci. Vinayakamurtti Cettiyar of Nallur, printed the Kummi Song on Wisdom of Muttukumara Kavirajar leading to calls by local Christians to shut the printing <b>press</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In any case, {{he decided}} to {{continue}} playing left-handed. To do so, he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the thimbles were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle – [...] "melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger" [...] – and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic, which created two technical problems. First, the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to <b>press</b> <b>down</b> very hard on them. [...] Secondly, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek light-gauge guitar strings {{to make it easier}} to do so. However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used banjo strings instead, until around 1970–71 when Picato Strings began making light-gauge guitar strings. Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos. In 1974, Iommi told Guitar Player magazine that the thimbles [...] "helped with his technique" [...] because he had to use his little finger more than he had before the accident. Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on [...] "Children of the Grave", [...] "Lord of this World", and [...] "Into the Void", all on the album Master of Reality). Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a [...] "bigger, heavier sound", slackening the strings makes it easier to bend them.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Morrison {{performed}} a series of concerts at the Dominion Theatre, London, opened by Herbie Armstrong with an acoustic set. Paul Charles, who managed Morrison's business affairs at the time, commented that [...] "The idea [...] was [...] 'come into town, do one show, get all the <b>press</b> <b>down,</b> get the radio and TV and record-company people' [...] My logic was, 'Look, with Van it's not just a rock & roll tour. It's not just here's the hits, here's the new record, please buy it, whatever.' It was a performance. ... A certain number of people would come back every night, [...] Van will not have a set-list that he adheres to religiously ... So I thought, 'Here's a way. Van is not having any singles. Van doesn't do TV. How can we get attention to him doing what he does?' Well, the best thing that he does is perform live. I think we did four [...] the first time. We ended up doing eleven [...] We got a lot of coverage, {{we got a lot of}} attention, without him having to do something he didn't like." [...] Morrison's love of live performing was reignited by this set of concerts and he commented at the time that it was [...] "more like appearing in a play, going to the theatre and doing your job every day - which I prefer to touring because that's very fragmented and disorientating." [...] According to Johnny Rogan, these performances [...] "are still regarded by many as his most memorable since the glory days of the Caledonia Soul Orchestra. A concert on 3 to 4 April 1982 at the Grugahalle, Essen, Germany, was broadcast in many European countries as a TV/radio simulcast in the Rockpalast TV series by German TV station WDR.

2500|$|The batting captain {{is allowed}} seven minutes of rolling before his innings and Freddie Brown {{asked for the}} heavy roller to <b>press</b> <b>down</b> the wicket and {{take some of the}} demons out of it. In those days the Woolloongabba still used an old heavy roller drawn by a horse called Dobbin. As it had to be unhitched and led round after each pull of the roller over the pitch, most of the seven minutes was wasted and Brown didn't get much of the rolling he asked for. This was of great {{importance}} as if he had insisted on seven minutes actual rolling instead of messing about at either end the wicket would have been much less dangerous and England would have had less time to bat out before stumps. Though as Bill O'Reilly pointed out the time limits were devised when horse-drawn rollers were the norm and mechanical rollers were unheard of. Initially it made no difference as Reg Simpson was bowled first ball by a full toss from Ray Lindwall (2/21). The veteran England scorer Bill Ferguson was using his famous Ferguson Charts to record the details of each innings; how many runs a batsman had scored, how many balls, how many minutes, how many boundaries, etc. when Simpson was out one wag called out [...] "How long Bill, and how many fours?" [...] which produced a roar of laughter from the press box that astonished the crowd. Cyril Washbrook (6) and John Dewes (9) were determined to see out the day with dead bats and the wicket showed no signs of danger, but Sam Loxton took a superb catch {{to get rid of the}} Lancastrian off Lindwall. Jack Iverson was called up to bowl his first Test over 27 minutes before stumps and had Trevor Bailey in all kinds of trouble as his poked and prodded and could have been out five or six times in the mystery spinner's maiden over. Dewes was bowled by Keith Miller and with one over from Iverson remaining, Alec Bedser came out and immediately appealed against the bad light, but was turned down as he had yet to face a ball. He holed out to Neil Harvey off Iverson, Bailey gave a simple catch to Bill Johnston and Godfrey Evans ran out his fellow wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre when he called for an unnecessary third run. Brown had fed in nightwatchman after nightwatchman in order to save Hutton, Compton and himself for the next day, but the Man from Pudsey still had to come out at 30/6 to survive the last two balls of an extraordinary day. When asked for his opinion that night Hutton said they might win [...] "if the others will stay till lunch and it doesn't rain again". It didn't rain again, but needing 163 to win with only four wickets in hand there was no room for mistakes. In the morning Brown, the umpires and a stopwatch ensured that England got their full 10 minutes rolling at the start of the day, which took nearly half an hour to complete. Evans (5) helped Hutton add 16 runs before he was caught by Loxton off Bill Johnston (2/30). Denis Compton came to the crease, but lasted one ball as he departed like Evans [...] "c Loxton, b Johnston". Brown came in at number 10 and held on grimly as Hutton peeled off 3 boundaries, though in the end the captain made 17 of their 29 runs together before he became Loxton's fourth victim when he was caught off Iverson (4/43). Doug Wright was the last man in at 77/9 and his batting tended to be a hit and miss affair which rarely reached double figures. Hutton (62 not out) farmed the bowling ruthlessly, making 43 of the 45 runs added for the last wicket. Wright managed to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to Ray Lindwall at square leg and the match was over. The 12,000 strong crowd gave Hutton an heroic ovation and after lunch he replied to the congratulations showered on him with by admitting that [...] "with a bit of luck I'd have won the game".|$|E
