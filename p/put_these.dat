5|$|As a {{legal advisor}} {{working for the}} United States Department of War, he drafted {{recommendations}} and reports that were used by Congress and the executive branch in governing the United States' new territories following the Spanish–American War. These reports were collected as a published book in 1902, then considered the seminal work on the subject. During his time as a governor, Magoon worked to <b>put</b> <b>these</b> recommendations into practice.|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists <b>put</b> <b>these</b> pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E
5|$|Since no {{consensus}} could be reached, the committee decided to <b>put</b> <b>these</b> three definitions {{to a wider}} vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in Prague in August 2006, and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from {{two of the three}} proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between planet and rock (or, in the new parlance, small Solar System body), called dwarf planet and placed Pluto in it, along with Ceres and Eris. The vote was passed, with 424 astronomers taking part in the ballot.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1890s, Tesla {{would pursue}} his ideas for {{wireless}} lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements {{on the possibility}} of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to <b>put</b> <b>these</b> ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since <b>put</b> <b>these</b> twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E
5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change this to a system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted {{to do away with the}} provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he <b>put</b> <b>these</b> reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E

After increased business and capital investment in commercial areas along with peoples properties, Mattapan became more popular and more of an increasing area that people moved to.|$|E
25|$|Following {{reports from}} missionaries, there was growing moral outrage, {{particularly}} in Britain and the United States. The Congo Reform Association, led by Edmund Dene Morel, was {{particularly important in}} this campaign, and published numerous best-selling tracts and pamphlets (including Red Rubber) which reached a vast public. King Leopold appointed and financed his own commission to <b>put</b> <b>these</b> accusations to rest, but it too confirmed the atrocities.|$|E

25|$|The temptation {{offered by}} such readily {{available}} savings overwhelmed {{the policy and}} regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers <b>put</b> <b>these</b> savings to use, generating bubble after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the solvency of governments and their banking systems.|$|E
25|$|The further {{development}} of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who <b>put</b> <b>these</b> five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative. This is essentially related to another thought experiment, known as ticking time bomb scenario, which forces one to choose between two morally questionable acts.|$|E
25|$|The harsh {{droughts}} {{and cold}} winters during the Little Ice Age (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries), <b>put</b> <b>these</b> larger groups under severe social stress as they competed for scarcer resources, such as less timber, less fertile farm land and fewer game animals. These groups were already unstable when Europeans arrived during {{the sixteenth century}} with superior weapons and diseases to which the native populations had no resistance. Many of these groups are now only known through the archaeological record.|$|E

25|$|When {{learning}} {{positions for}} drill, an American football field may {{be divided into}} a 5-yard grid, with the yard lines serving as one set of guides. The locations where the perpendicular grid lines cross the yard lines, sometimes called zero points or gacks, may be marked on a practice field at eight-, four-, or two-step intervals. Alternately, band members may only use field markings—yard lines, the center line, hash marks, and yard numbers—as guides (but note that different leagues <b>put</b> <b>these</b> markings in different places).|$|E
25|$|Pătrășcanu again {{served as}} the PCdR's {{representative}} to the Comintern in 1933, and 1934 (remaining in Moscow until 1935), during which time he {{is thought to have}} developed doubts about Stalinism itself. He <b>put</b> <b>these</b> questions aside in order to prioritize opposition to fascism, and remained active in the PCR. In 1936, he was heading the defense team of PCR members who were facing the much-publicized Craiova Trial, but was himself denounced as a communist and consequently handed the position to Ion Gheorghe Maurer.|$|E
25|$|To <b>put</b> <b>these</b> figures into a {{personal}} perspective, when Mount Stephen died in 1921, after providing for his wife, step-daughter and charities, he left £1,414,319 {{to be divided}} between nineteen relatives, which worked out at about £75,000 each. Though hardly an inconsequential sum, he gave substantially more to charity than he left to his individual heirs. In his will, he left little to charities in Canada, believing that through the donations mentioned above and his legacy that was the Canadian Pacific Railway, he had given more to Canada than it had given to him.|$|E

25|$|Unlike, for example, the Market Portal of the Mainz Cathedral, the {{identity}} of the artist responsible for the Bernward Doors is not preserved. As a result, older research attempted to identify a varying number of different artists on the basis of stylistic analysis of the individual panels. Rainer Kahsnitz has since <b>put</b> <b>these</b> attributions in doubt, since the differences in execution between the reliefs is so marginal that they might as easily be the result of technical requirements as different artistic styles. Probably a single artist was responsible for the creation of the Bernward Doors, {{with a small group of}} apprentices and assistants.|$|E
25|$|The Trunk Line was {{completed}} in 1854, followed by the Østfold Line in 1879. By the 1870s there was sufficient traffic on the Trunk Line that the Norwegian Trunk Railway was considering building double track along it. The economic decline throughout the 1880s <b>put</b> <b>these</b> plans on hold. Parliament decided in 1897 that the Gjøvik Line's freight trains would be handled at Loenga. This made it necessary for a separate freight track to be built through Loelvdalen. Surveys for a suitable place for cargo handling soon found that the steep gradient {{made it impossible to}} locate a cargo facility fore Alna.|$|E
25|$|A {{statistical}} learning device {{has also}} been proposed {{as a component of}} syntactical acquisition for young children. Early evidence for this mechanism came largely from studies of computer modeling or analyses of natural language corpora. These early studies focused largely on distributional information specifically rather than statistical learning mechanisms generally. Specifically, in these early papers it was proposed that children created templates of possible sentence structures involving unnamed categories of word types (i.e., nouns or verbs, although children would not <b>put</b> <b>these</b> labels on their categories). Children were thought to learn which words belonged to the same categories by tracking the similar contexts in which words of the same category appeared.|$|E
