5|$|An early {{draft of}} the {{screenplay}} was written by Chris Conkling, who told {{the bulk of the}} story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck's point of view. After Bakshi and Zaentz saw Conkling's first draft, fantasy author <b>Peter</b> <b>S.</b> Beagle was called in for a rewrite. According to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for only $5,000, on the strength of promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward. Zaentz later reneged on these promises.|$|E

5|$|The Monmouth Rebellion and {{the events}} {{surrounding}} it have {{formed the basis for}} several works of fiction. John Dryden's work Absalom and Achitophel is a satire partially concerned with equating biblical events with the Monmouth Rebellion. The Monmouth Rebellion {{plays a key role in}} <b>Peter</b> <b>S.</b> Beagle's novel Tamsin, about a 300-year-old ghost who is befriended by the protagonist. Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel Micah Clarke deals directly with Monmouth's landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed. Several characters in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle, particularly Quicksilver and The Confusion, play a role in the Monmouth Rebellion and its aftermath.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Pictures {{purchased}} the film rights for Who Framed Roger Rabbits story in 1981. Jeffrey Price and <b>Peter</b> <b>S.</b> Seaman wrote two drafts {{of the script}} before Disney brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg, and his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film, and Canadian animator Richard Williams was hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree Studios in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators. While filming, the production budget began to rapidly expand and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which <b>Peter</b> <b>S.</b> Smedresman, {{writing in the}} Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce divides into three categories of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the Baltic Exchange, specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have {{no relation to the}} United Kingdom. London has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, {{due to the nature of}} its arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|E

5|$|The {{show was}} co-produced by several {{production}} companies including Gaumont Television, M6, Firecorp IV Productions Inc., Rysher, Davis-Panzer Productions, Fireworks Distributing Corporation, ProSieben Media and Chum Television. The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and in Paris, France. The executive producers were Bill Panzer, <b>Peter</b> <b>S.</b> Davis, Christian Charret and Marla Ginsburg. Jay Firestone and Adam Haight were co-executive producers and David Abramowitz was Creative Consultant. Donald Paonessa was associate producer. Karen Harris was supervising producer and James Thorpe was executive story editor; both also contributed scripts. The regular directors were Dennis Berry and George Mendeluk. The producer was Steve Wakefield in Toronto; Denis Leroy who was executive {{in charge of}} production in Toronto, took over as producer in Paris. Regina Robb was production manager in Toronto, succeeded by Alexandre Deon in Paris. The sword choreographer on the Toronto segment was James Binkley, replaced in Paris by Philippe Guegan. The theme music was composed and performed by Jeff and Rob Pfeifer; incidental music was composed by Simon Cloquet.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien went on {{to criticize}} the script scene by scene ("yet one more scene of screams and rather {{meaningless}} slashings"). He was not implacably opposed {{to the idea of}} a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director John Boorman was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to Tolkien Enterprises, a division of the Saul Zaentz Company, and the first film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings was released in 1978 as an animated rotoscoping film directed by Ralph Bakshi with screenplay by the fantasy writer <b>Peter</b> <b>S.</b> Beagle. It covered only the first half of the story of The Lord of the Rings. In 1977, an animated musical television film of The Hobbit was made by Rankin-Bass, and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film The Return of the King, which covered some of the portions of The Lord of the Rings that Bakshi was unable to complete.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{purchased}} the film rights to Gary K. Wolf's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, {{then president of}} Disney, {{saw it as a}} perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster. Jeffrey Price and <b>Peter</b> <b>S.</b> Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982, but Disney declined as his two previous films (I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars) had been box office bombs. Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit, Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO of Disney. Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.|$|E

50|$|In 1794, {{the first}} Roman Catholic {{church in the}} Bolton area since the English Reformation was established. It was <b>Ss</b> <b>Peter</b> and Paul Church on Pilkington Street.

In 1853, {{in the school of}} <b>Ss</b> <b>Peter</b> and Paul Church, it was decided to build a church in the centre of the town, which would become St Patrick's Church. <b>Ss</b> <b>Peter</b> and Paul Church was later {{replaced}} by a church built from 1896 to 1897 on the same site, which cost £20,200.
