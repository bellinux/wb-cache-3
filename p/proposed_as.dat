Georges Dumézil stated that the war need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{scholars}} mention {{a possibility of}} future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue {{to function as a}} koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.

Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7mW/g for 241Am and 6.31mW/g for 243Am (cf. 390mW/g for 238Pu) – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the European Space Agency is considering using americium for its space probes.|$|E
