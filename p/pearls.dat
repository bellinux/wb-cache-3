5|$|Most {{molluscs}} with shells {{can produce}} <b>pearls,</b> {{but only the}} <b>pearls</b> of bivalves and some gastropods, whose shells are lined with nacre, are valuable. The best natural <b>pearls</b> are produced by marine pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada mertensi, which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. Natural <b>pearls</b> form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell.|$|E

5|$|Very rarely (about 1 in 10,000 conchs), a conch pearl may {{be found}} within the mantle. Though they occur {{in a range of}} colors {{corresponding}} to the colors of the interior of the shell, pink specimens are the most valuable. These <b>pearls</b> are considered semi-precious, and a popular tourist curio. The best specimens have been used to create necklaces and earrings. A conch pearl is a non-nacreous pearl (formerly referred to by some sources as a 'calcareous concretion') which differs from most <b>pearls</b> that are sold as gemstones.|$|E

5|$|A coronet {{of eleven}} <b>pearls</b> denotes a baron's arms in Sweden (the ancient nobility does {{also have the}} right to have the baronet crown by tradition), which also {{typically}} includes two barred helmets, each wearing this coronet, and a third such coronet is placed above the shield, although some baronial arms feature three helmets or only one, and not every baron uses supporters. A Swedish Greve (Count) bears three barred helmets, each crowned with a coronet showing five leaves, and supporters are usually—though not always—present. The arms of Swedish counts also, from the late 17th century, began using manteaux (see the Greater Coat of Arms of Sweden, pictured above) in place of the traditional mantling, although this practice has since been deprecated. Untitled nobility (others granted noble status by letters patent) also bore a barred helm and a coronet showing two <b>pearls</b> between three leaves.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Queen Mary asked Garrard & Co. {{to make a}} copy of a tiara {{owned by}} her grandmother, Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel, using the queen's own {{diamonds}} and <b>pearls.</b> French in its neo-classical design, the tiara has 19 oriental <b>pearls</b> suspended from lover's knot bows each centred with a large brilliant. Mary left the tiara to Elizabeth II, who later gave it to Diana, Princess of Wales, as a wedding present. She wore it often, notably with her 'Elvis dress' on a visit to Hong Kong in 1989, but on her divorce from Prince Charles it was returned to the Queen. In 2015 and 2016, the Duchess of Cambridge wore it to a diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace.|$|E

While <b>Pearl</b> is distracted talking to Steven, Holo-Pearl impales <b>Pearl's</b> chest with her sword, which causes <b>Pearl</b> to lose her physical form, leaving nothing but her gemstone.

5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and <b>pearls,</b> while others were given items like shoes decorated with <b>pearls.</b> However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a town {{as early as the}} last quarter of the 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed.

40|$|Abstract: This {{article is}} meant to {{highlight}} Specification <b>PEARL</b> in an object-oriented perspective. Specification <b>PEARL</b> is a specification and description language, which originates from Multiprocessor <b>PEARL</b> (DIN 66253, Part 3), also named <b>PEARL</b> for distributed systems. It extends the standard by allowing the description of asymmetrical distributed architectures {{as well as by}} additional parameters for the parameterisation of the RTOS and later feasibility analysis. <b>PEARL</b> itself in its latest implementation still is a procedural language although it supports features like tasking and synchronisation, being supported only by some object oriented languages. Due to the nature of its applications, transferring <b>PEARL</b> into an object-oriented language was not an easy nor straightforward process; hence, there are several implementations of objectoriented <b>PEARL.</b> For Multiprocessor <b>PEARL</b> there was no attempt in this direction so far. In Specification <b>PEARL</b> HW/SW co-design methodology we are striving to use the Specification <b>PEARL</b> language as a specification language with the current release of <b>PEARL</b> (<b>PEARL</b> 90). The aim {{of this article is to}} give Specification <b>PEARL</b> and its components an object oriented perspective- to structure them in a way, which would lead to natural generalisation-specialisation and whole-part relationships and define their interfaces. It will also show why it would be convenient for Specification <b>PEARL</b> to support classes of objects. Key words: real-time systems, co-design, object-orientation, <b>PEARL...</b>|$|R

Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for <b>pearls.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, Weird Tales became {{involved}} in a media altercation after the editor announced the magazine was going to publish an excerpt from Victoria Foyt's controversial novel Save the <b>Pearls,</b> which many critics accused of featuring racist stereotyping.

The publisher subsequently overruled the editor, and announced that Weird Tales no longer had plans to run the excerpt.|$|E

Ebrey lists items found in a 2nd-century AD tomb in Wuwei, Gansu (along the Hexi Corridor fortified by the Great Wall of China), evidence that luxury items could be obtained even in remote frontiers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pearl</b> {{hunting is}} a {{traditional}} way of diving to retrieve <b>pearl</b> from <b>pearl</b> oysters or to hunt some other sea creatures. In some areas, hunters need to dive and search seafloor repeatedly at several meters depth for <b>pearl</b> oysters. In a search perspective, <b>pearl</b> hunting consists of repeated diversification (to surface and change target area) and intensification (to dive and find <b>pearl</b> oysters). A <b>Pearl</b> Hunter (PHunter) hyper-heuristic is inspired by the <b>pearl</b> hunting, as shown in Fig. 1. Given a problem domain and some low-level heuristics (LLHs), PHunter can group, test, select and organize LLHs for the domain by imitating a rational diver. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
