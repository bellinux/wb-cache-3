Even though women reported being subjectively aroused to, for example, a man and woman engaging in sexual activity, their genitals also show sexual arousal to two men engaging in sexual activity, two women doing so, and even non-human animals having sex.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionSome men seek {{castration}} {{outside a}} clear medical need. This study explored how their sexuality changed after castration. AimTo explore changes in <b>preferred</b> <b>gender(s)</b> of sexual attraction, fantasy, and relationships in voluntarily castrated men {{with or without}} gonadal hormone therapy. MethodsA questionnaire was posted at [URL] that yielded data on {{men who had been}} voluntarily castrated physically (n = 198) or chemically (n = 96). Main Outcome MeasuresRespondents were asked to report retrospectively on their sexuality, including their sexual activity and which gender(s) they were sexually attracted to, fantasized about, or had sexual relations with 6 months to 1 year before and after castration. ResultsA substantial proportion of men remained sexually active after castration; 37 % had sex at least several times per week. Most respondents did not report a change in <b>preferred</b> <b>gender(s)</b> of attraction (65 %, n = 181), fantasies (62 %, n = 169), or sexual relationships (66 %, n = 163), although approximately 20 % to 30 % of respondents did report such changes and 8 % to 11 % became non-sexual after castration. Respondents who were attracted to and fantasized about “only men” or who had sexual relationship with “only women” before castration were the least likely to report a change subsequent to castration. Respondents who were taking neither supplemental testosterone nor estrogen {{were more likely to report}} (i) becoming attracted to no one, (ii) fantasizing about no one, and (iii) becoming sexually inactive. ConclusionSexual changes in voluntarily castrated men vary and can be influenced by various factors including the use of supplemental testosterone or estrogen therapy...|$|R

Statistical analysis of the data revealed (1) people holding masculine sex-role preferences are perceived to have a higher motivation to succeed, and to be more competent; (2) from the perspective of friend and potential employee, persons holding gender consistent sex-role preferences are perceived as more attractive; (3) from the perspective of potential employer, there is a tendency for males to prefer employees who hold masculine sex-role preferences, while females continue to <b>prefer</b> <b>gender</b> consistent sex-role preferences...|$|R

This qualitative study explored safe access for transgender persons to public gender segregated restrooms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} factors that affect pre-kindergarten children’s successful play behaviors. Using a multimethods research design, a series of separate studies were combined to determine the relationships among gender, social skills, sociometric status, and play behaviors. The study was conducted in two child development centers where children who have long been together at the center are joined by new children for their pre-kindergarten year. Each child participated in a sociometric analysis by choosing pictures of up to five classmates he/she most likes to play with and responded to interview questions on how children successfully join in play. Teachers assessed each child’s play behaviors using brief Likert Scale surveys. From the sociometric scores, the most chosen boys and girls and the least chosen boys and girls from each classroom were observed during outdoor play sessions while the researcher coded social and nonsocial play behaviors, play entry strategies, and gender and size of the group being entered. The following questions guided this basic research study: (1) What are the effects of gender and familiarity on children’s sociometric choices? (2) Do often-chosen and seldom-chosen children differ in play entry and play behaviors exhibited during outdoor play? (3) Is there a relationship between a child’s knowledge of play entry strategies, social status, and the child’s play behaviors? (4) Is there a relationship between a child’s sociometric score, observed social skills, and a teacher’s assessment of that child’s social skills? This study found the following: Children of both <b>genders</b> <b>prefer</b> same <b>gender</b> playmates. Gender was not a determinate of whether a child chose a student new to the center as a playmate. Seldom-chosen children make more polite requests to play than often-chosen children. Often-chosen children respond to more approaches and spend more time in social play than seldom-chosen children. Most children have knowledge of appropriate play entry strategies, but they do not always implement strategies they know are successful. Teachers know which children spend their time in social play but not which children are most chosen by classmates.
