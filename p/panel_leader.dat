The {{purpose of this paper}} is to propose a new methodology based on a mixed linear model to test various criteria of a panel's reliability. The developed method allows testing the global performance of the panel, and the individual performances of each judge in terms of discriminability and repeatability, severity or laxity, and agreement or disagreement with the panel. All the computations are implemented in an SAS® program. The results of the analysis are summarised in a set of tables in such a way that the <b>panel</b> <b>leader</b> can easily check and compare the judge performances...|$|E
40|$|This {{work has}} been {{developed}} through the collaboration of Nestle Research Centre, Centre Européen des Sciences du Goût, Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l’Analyse de l’Information (ENSAI) and the Department of Econometrics at the University of Geneva. Given the particular nature of TDS data, specific analyses were developed and published {{over the past years}} to characterize the evolution of the dominant sensations in a product, to compare products {{to each other and to}} map the entire product space. Statistical approaches were also proposed to assess panel discrimination ability and agreement between subjects. To continue further on this direction, a general framework is proposed to evaluate panel and subject performance in TDS context. A protocol for testing products to evaluate the performance is proposed (before the measurement phase). Seven indicators are then described and summarized in a single table to facilitate the interpretation of the results by the <b>panel</b> <b>leader.</b> Three of the indicators describe panel and subject behavior in terms of attribute selection. The four remaining indicators describe the discrimination ability and the agreement, both at panel and subject levels. These indicators are inspired from usual ANOVA calculations used for descriptive profiling, but tested according to a permutation approach to overcome issues due to the nature of TDS data (non-independency between recorded values) ...|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{pound net}} {{leaders in the}} {{southern}} portion of Chesapeake Bay in Virginia waters were documented to incidentally take protected loggerhead, Caretta caretta, and Kemp’s ridley, Lepidochelys kempii, sea turtles. Because of these losses, NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in 2004 closed the area to offshore pound net leaders annually from 6 May to 15 July and initiated a study of an experimental leader design that replaced the top two-thirds of the traditional mesh <b>panel</b> <b>leader</b> with vertical ropes (0. 95 cm) spaced 61 cm apart. This experimental leader was tested on four pound net sites {{on the eastern shore}} of Chesapeake Bay in 2004 and 2005. During the 2 trial periods, 21 loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley sea turtles were found interacting with the control leader and 1 leatherback turtle, Dermochelys coriacea, was found interacting with the experimental leader. Results of a negative binomial regression analysis comparing the two leader designs found the experimental leader significantly reduced sea turtle interactions (p= 0. 03). Finfish were sampled from the pound nets in the study to assess finfish catch performance differences between the two leader designs. Although the conclusions from this element of the experiment are not robust, paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test results determined no significant harvest weight difference between the two leaders. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests did not reveal any substantive size selectivity differences between the two leaders...|$|E

The draft {{report of the}} CIP quinquennial review was presented by the review <b>panel</b> <b>leader.</b> TAC comments would be considered in preparing the final version to be reviewed at TAC 16. A progress report on the TAC Review of Farming Systems Research at CIAT, ICRISAT, IITA, and IRRI described {{the findings of the}} preliminary desk study and plans for consultant travel to the four IARCs. The TAC Vegetable Research Project Formulation Mission identified sites in Africa and Asia for regional pilot projects. TAC establish a subcommittee to study the proposals further. Maintaining its watching brief on aquaculture, TAC heard reports on a number of international and national programs. Drs. Swaminathan and Carlos reported on an international symposium on coconut research and development held in Kerala. TAC decided to advise the CGIAR that the issue remained on its agenda. TAC resolved to maintain a watching brief on an IDRC plan for an agroforestry research center, submitted for comment, not CGIAR funding. Responding to IBPGR's request for guidance regarding the place of forest genetic resources in its program, TAC asked for a specific proposal to consider. Additional matters discussed included water buffalo research, water use and management at IARCs, plans for an interim review mission to ILCA, ICIPE, and soybean research.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to determine, {{describe}} and compare the eating quality of selected beef cuts; loin, rump and ribeye produced in Namibia. These cuts originate from carcasses of different age classes, feeding regime and post-mortem aging periods. The determination of the eating quality of this beef will aid MEATCO in understanding consumers’ responses in relation to the sensory attributes of these beef cuts. To date, the eating quality of this beef has not been determined or described by scientific means. Eating quality of beef refers to the overall beef eating experience and it can be affected by various pre- and post-mortem factors. Eating quality is an important component of beef meat quality, but highly variable due to variations in tenderness and flavour, which are dependent on the intrinsic and extrinsic factors of the animal. This variability contributes to consumer dissatisfaction. As a result the prediction of eating quality of beef at the consumer level is of utmost importance to the producers of beef meat in order for them to remain competitive in the market. The study was conducted in two phases, Phase 1 of the study involved descriptive sensory evaluation, where a trained panel was used to evaluate the beef samples. The sensory attributes that were applicable to the beef samples were first identified by the trained panel with the aid of the <b>panel</b> <b>leader.</b> From this, a lexicon and evaluation form were developed. The trained panel used a category scale to rate the intensity of the identified sensory attributes. Phase 2 of the study involved physical evaluation, whereby measurements of shear force resistance were determined using the Warner Bratzler shear force device mounted on a Universal Instron Machine. Added to this cooking and thawing losses were also measured by using a measuring scale. The results of the sensory evaluation show that the trained panel could distinguish the difference between the two grain fed groups (AG and ABG) and the young free-range group (AF) on one side and the older free-range groups (ABF, B 4 and B 6) on the other. The former groups scored higher for the attributes such as tenderness, overall flavour and aroma whereas the latter groups scored higher for juiciness and other flavour undertones e. g. green, livery, rancid and sour. Age class of the animals was found to have had an effect on tenderness related attributes and juiciness, whereas feeding regime had an effect on overall flavour and flavour undertones. However prolonged post-mortem aging had a minimal effect on the sensory attributes. There were no differences found between the 36 and 55 days aged samples. From this study it can be suggested that even though extreme post-mortem aging results in acceptable tenderness levels for all age classes and feeding regimes, the consumer may still pick up flavour differences between the different age classes and feeding regimes. Marketing this beef as a single product line may therefore result in an inconsistent eating experience for the consumer.
