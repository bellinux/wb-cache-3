40|$|The role of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) as a {{neutrophil}} chemoattractant in bovine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> {{was investigated}} by characterizing: (1) {{the expression of}} IL- 8 in the lesions of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis,</b> (2) the ' in vitro' and 'in vivo' effects of recombinant bovine IL- 8 on neutrophil chemotaxis, and (3) the importance of IL- 8 as a neutrophil chemoattractant in this disease. The expression of IL- 8 in bovine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> was assessed by Northern analysis, 'in situ' hybridization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of IL- 8 mRNA was elevated dramatically in lesional lung compared to non-lesional lung, viral pneumonia, and normal lung. 'In situ' hybridization revealed intense IL- 8 mRNA expression in alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, and milder expression in several other cell types. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from lesional lung contained 16. 06 ± 4. 00 ng/ml IL- 8, but lower levels were present in non-lesional lung, viral pneumonia, and normal lung (mean ± SEM). Recombinant bovine IL- 8 (rbIL- 8) was produced using a pGEX expression system. The rbIL- 8 induced in vitro chemotaxis and shape change of bovine neutrophils at doses as low as 6. 3 ng/ml. After injection of 1. 0 ng to 3. 3 m g of rbIL- 8 into bovine skin, neutrophils marginated in vessels within 15 minutes and infiltrated the dermis by 1 hour after injection. These results demonstrate that bovine IL- 8 is a neutrophil chemoattractant 'in vitro ' and 'in vivo', at levels equivalent to those present in <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> An ovine model of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> was developed to ascertain the effects of in vivo neutralization of IL- 8 {{on the development of}} disease. At 0, 3, 8 and 20 hours after bacterial infection (p. i.), BAL fluid samples contained 6. 5 ± 2. 4, 110 ± 48, 554 ± 118, and 507 ± 70 ng/ml IL- 8, respectively. Neutrophil infiltration was mild at 3 hours p. i. but progressively more intense at 8 and 20 hours p. i. Lambs were treated intravenously with up to 80 mg of an IL- 8 -neutralizing antibody prior to bacterial challenge. The antibody treatment failed to completely neutralize IL- 8 activity, probably because the levels of IL- 8 in the lung were unexpectedly high. The contribution of IL- 8 to the neutrophil chemotactic activity of BAL fluid from cattle and lambs with <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> was assessed. Pre-treatment of pneumonic BAL fluid samples with a neutralizing antibody to IL- 8, compared to pretreatment with a control antibody, reduced the 'in vitro' neutrophil chemotactic activity significantly, by 15 - 63 % in 9 / 10 samples. An extract of pneumonic bovine lung induced vigorous neutrophil infiltration following injection into bovine skin, and depletion of IL- 8 from the extract reduced this neutrophil influx by 60 %. These data indicate that IL- 8 is an important neutrophil chemoattractant in both early and well-developed lesions of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis,</b> but that mediators with actions redundant to those of IL- 8 must also be present at these times...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> in {{guinea pigs}} (Cavia porcellus) was examined. Specific pathogen free male guinea pigs were anesthetized and a tracheostomy performed to introduce 10 (5), 10 (4) or 10 (3) Pasteurella haemolytica-A 1 {{into the left}} principal bronchus. The surgical site was closed with tissue adhesive and staples and the animals were monitored for signs of respiratory tract infection. Within 24 hours after inoculation they became depressed, anorectic, pyretic and dyspneic. Fibrinous pleuropneumonia with prominent areas of necrosis and hemorrhage was present. Pericardial effusion was a frequent finding. There was infiltration of the pleura and alveoli with degenerate heterophils and macrophages, a hyperplastic mesothelium and fibrin exudation on the pleura and within alveoli. Hemorrhage, congestion, consolidation, edema and fibrin exudation were prominent in the hilar region of the lungs. Bacterial colonies were evident in all airways. More bacteria were recovered from infected lungs than were inoculated (p less than 0. 05) indicating P. haemolytica was actively multiplying in the lungs. Hematological and clinical chemistry data were consistent with fibrinous pneumonia, however, blood cultures were positive for P. haemolytica in 61 % (11 / 18) of animals sampled.

The treatments were evaluated by comparing clinical illness scores, total sick days, weight changes, mortality rates, and postmortem lung scores between treatment groups. Both antibiotics were highly effective in reducing respiratory disease in the experimentally infected calves. The clinical response to sulbactam/ampicillin treatment was comparable with that of chloramphenicol and was significantly improved compared with {{the response to the}} placebo treatment.

Bovine IgG 1 was hydrolysed sequentially into three distinct bands (approximately 39, 12, and 7 kDa respectively). Furthermore, partial hydrolysis of bovine IgG 2 was observed, but neither bovine IgA nor IgM were affected by incubation with ppCS.

40|$|Iron plays {{a central}} role in {{bacterial}} infections, influencing both bacterial virulence and host cellular defense mechanisms. We investigated whether iron chelation might be of benefit in the treatment of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of calves. Neutrophils obtained from calves previously treated with the iron chelator, deferoxamine, were studied for their responses to latex and opsonized zymosan by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and to phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan by superoxide generation. Treatment with deferoxamine in vivo failed to influence these in vitro measures of neutrophil oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, iron depletion with deferoxamine failed to modify the pathophysiological derangements that occurred in calves following experimental induction of pneumonia by intratracheal inoculation with Pasteurella haemolytica. These data indicate that iron chelation using deferoxamine cannot be recommended as an adjunct to conventional therapy in the treatment of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of cattle...|$|E

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was harvested from calves experimentally infected with bovine herpesvirus- 1 and challenged with Mannheimia haemolytica. Neutrophil chemotactic activity was measured in pneumonic BAL fluid samples treated with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to ovine IL- 8, and compared to the activity in samples treated with an isotype-matched control antibody. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed at a dilution which induced a half-maximal response, and the concentrations of antibody were optimized in a preliminary experiment. Following incubation of replicate samples of diluted pneumonic bovine BAL fluid with 70 microg/mL of IL- 8 -neutralizing antibody or control antibody, the neutrophil chemotactic activities of the samples were determined using an in vitro microchemotaxis assay. Overall, pretreatment of BAL fluid samples with neutralizing anti-IL- 8 antibody reduced neutrophil chemotactic activity by 15 % to 60 %, compared to pretreatment with control antibody. This effect was highly significant (P < 0. 001), and was present in 5 of 5 samples.

After recovery from the disease, these nine principal and four control calves were challenged with aerosols of bovine herpesvirus 1 and P. haemolytica A 1 four days apart. With this viral-bacterial challenge, the nine principal animals failed to develop clinical responses to this bacterial challenge and their lungs did not show the growth of P. haemolytica on cultures, whereas two of four control calves had elevated temperatures and developed necropurulent pneumonia with the isolation of P. haemolytica from the lungs. The principal calves had developed high levels of cytotoxin neutralizing antibodies in their sera following parainfluenza- 3 virus-P. haemolytica infection. This demonstrated that immunity against <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> can be achieved, with a suggestion that further search for an effective vaccine for P. haemolytica is warranted...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In a {{retrospective}} morphological and microbiological study, 39 of 55 cases of bovine fibrinous pneumonia were diagnosed as fibrinous pleuropneumonia. Twenty-nine of these 39 (74 %) were associatcd with Pasteurella hemolytica, {{but only two}} cases (5 %) with P. multocida. In contrast, of the 16 cases classified as fibrinous bronchopneumonia. one (6 %) was associated with P. hemolytica, and nine (5 6 %) with P. multocida. In eight cases Mycoplasrna and Hernophilus sornnus wcrc found in association with either P. hernolytica or P. multocida but were never isolated alone. We concluded {{that the use of}} the term pasteurellosis, implying Pasteurella as the cause is imprecise because lesions associated with P. hemolytica fulfill the criteria of a fibrinous pleuropneumonia. whereas P. rnultocida is morc likely to cause a bronchopneumonia with moderate amounts of fibrin. <b>Pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> is a common disease of cattle.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin (LKT) on the {{activity}} of phospholipase D (PLD) and the regulatory interaction between PLD and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) were investigated in assays using isolated bovine neutrophils labeled with tritiated phospholipid substrates of the two enzymes. Exposure of [3 H]lyso-phosphatidylcholine-labeled neutrophils to LKT caused concentration- and time-dependent production of phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of PLD. LKT-induced generation of PA was dependent on extracellular calcium. Both production of PA and metabolism of [3 H]-arachidonate ([3 H]AA) -labeled phospholipids by PLA 2 were inhibited when ethanol was used to promote the alternative PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation reaction, resulting {{in the production of}} phosphatidylethanol rather than PA. The role of PA in regulation of PLA 2 activity was then confirmed by means of an add-back experiment, whereby addition of PA in the presence of ethanol restored PLA 2 -mediated release of radioactivity from neutrophil membranes.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{diagnostic}} accuracy of acute phase proteins and proinflammatory cytokines in sheep with <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> Blood samples were collected from 56 sheep (36 naturally infected with Pasteurella multocida and 20 healthy controls) belonging to one farm in Eastern region, Saudi Arabia. Serum samples were evaluated for acute phase proteins (Haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen (Fb)), and the proinflammatory cytokines (interleukins (IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-ϒ)). Additionally, nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavages were collected from all animals for bacteriological examinations. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the diagnostic performance of each parameter. All parameters showed moderate to high degree of positive correlation with case-control status. There was no significant difference in the area under the curve (AUC) among acute phase proteins; however, both Hp and SAA showed better sensitivity and specificity than Fb. The proinflammatory cytokines (IL 1 -α, IL 1 -β, and IL 6) showed similar and highly accurate diagnostic performance (AUC > 0. 9), whereas IFN-ϒ was moderately accurate (AUC = 0. 79).

40|$|P. haemolytica is the {{aetiological}} {{agent of}} <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> in sheep and goats, and, as a secondry invader it also exacerbates lesions of chronic non-progressive pneumonia (CNP). These diseases cause considerable economic {{loss to the}} New Zealand farming industry. P. haemolytica exists as 15 serotypes and immunity is serotype specific. Vaccines against P. haemolytica are produced, {{but it is not}} known if the serotypes contained in the vaccine are the same as those causing disease in New Zealand as {{there is a lack of}} information on the prevalence and distribution of the serotypes of P. haemolytica in this country. This is largely due to the technical difficulties involved in typing isolates because the standard method, the indirect haemagglutination assay, (IHA), is laborious and may give anomalous results due to cross-reactions. The present investigation was undertaken with two major aims: to replace IHA with a more convenient typing system, viz. agar gel immunodiffusion, (AGID), and to use AGID to survey the serotypes of P. haemolytica present in CNP lesions of sheep, <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of sheep, <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of goats and the nasal cavities of goats. Difficulties were encountered in the preparation of rabbit antisera to some of the 15 prototype strains. These difficulties were overcome by using domestic hens when necessary. Using these sera it was possible to distinguish the 15 prototype strains by IHA, and following absorption of sera, by AGID. The results obtained by IHA and AGID were in agreement, at least when prototype strains were examined. It was necasary to show that AGID is able to correctly establish the serotype of field isolates of P. haemolytica. Hence 2 5 caprine isolates of P. haemolytica from field cases of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> were serotyped by both IHA and AGID. In 24 cases the results from the two tests agreed. In the remaining case IHA indicated that the isolate was serotype A 2 or All. We were able to show that this isolate gave a line of identity with antigen prepared from the prototype strain of All, but showed no line of identity in the AGID with any other antigen preparation. Taking this as the critical criterion we concluded that this isolate was serotype All, although IHA showed a 2 - fold preference for A 2 over All. Since AGID was shown to be a reliable test we used it alone for future serotyping, for two reasons: it is more convenient, and any cross-reactions that do occur may be resolved by looking for a line of identity between antigens of the isolate and a prototype antigen. In the case of two serotypes involved in many crossreactions, namely Al and A 7, the capsular polysaccharide was purified by organic solvent precipitation. This purified polysaccharide was used to test for a line of identity with reacting isolates. This eliminates the possibility that the line of identity seen was due to a non-serotypespecific antigen. Four surveys (two in sheep, two in goats) of the serotypes of P. haemolytica present in New Zealand were undertaken. The first involved 139 isolates derived from ovine lesions of CNP collected from 4 areas of New Zealand. A total of 9 serotypes were found. Serotypes Al (31. 7 %), A 2 (47. 8 %) and A 7 (10 %) made up 89. 5 % of the total. A smaller survey of 18 isolates from <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of sheep revealed 6 serotypes, including 1 isolate of TlO, a serotype and biotype not previously found in New Zealand. Al (11. 1 %) and A 2 (61. 1 %) were the predominant serotypes present and represented 72. 2 % of the total. The 25 isolates of P. haemolytica from caprine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> contained only 4 serotypes. A 2 represented 8 0 % of the total. 14 isolates of P. haemolytica were obtained from the nasal cavities of 109 goats. Only 2 serotypes were isolated. 13 isolates were A 2 and the remaining isolate was All. The implications of these results for vaccine manafucture were discussed and it was suggested that a vaccine containing A 2, Al and A 7 (in order of importance) should control CNP in sheep and <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> in both sheep and goats. Field isolates of P. haemolytica were compared with prototype strains for capsule production (using Laurell Rocket test), and antibiotic sensitivities. The total proteins of caprine and ovine strains were also compared, using SDS-PAGE. Laurell Rocket tests showed that the prototype strains produced more capsular polysaccharide than did any of our field isolates. All isolates of P. haemolytica showed some resistance to streptomycin while none were resistant to more than 4 f. 1 g/ml chloramphenicol or penicillin so these are the drugs of choice.

40|$|Pasteurella haemolytica {{serotype}} 1 is the bacterial agent {{responsible for}} the pathophysiological events associated with bovine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> Our previous studies support a role for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from P. haemolytica in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. One of the pathological hallmarks of bovine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> is an influx of neutrophils into the alveolar spaces. This pronounced influx suggests the local production of a chemotactic factor(s) such as interleukin- 8 (IL- 8).

By using Northern blot analysis, we have examined the kinetics of IL- 8 mRNA expression in P. haemolytica LPS-stimulated bovine alveolar macrophages and found that 1 ng of LPS per ml induces maximal expression of IL- 8 mRNA. The results also indicate a biphasic time course expression pattern in which IL- 8 mRNA levels peak between 1 and 2 h in the first phase and between 16 and 24 h in the second phase (P < 0. 01). In addition, monospecific polyclonal antibodies were used to demonstrate the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the second phase of IL- 8 mRNA expression.

40|$|Vaccine {{development}} {{for the prevention of}} <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> remains a critical issue for the feedlot industry. Most currently available Pasteurella vaccines are formulated to stimulate immunity by either providing an adequate antigenic mass in the administered dose, or by relying on subsequent production of antigens by in vivo growth of live organisms. The ability of these different types of vaccines to stimulate rapid and high titres to key antigens is a key factor that will influence subsequent resistance to disease. The serologic and protective responses to a streptomycin-dependent, modified-live vaccine and a killed (bacterin-toxoid) vaccine against experimental <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> were compared. Calves were vaccinated with a single injection of either a test vaccine or phosphate-buffered saline, challenged 14 d later by transthoracic injection with Pasteurella haemolytica, and euthanized 3 d post-challenge to evaluate the severity of pneumonia. On days 0, 7, and 14, serologic responses to various P. haemolytica antigens, including cell-associated and soluble antigens, were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and anti-leukotoxin antibody levels were determined by leukotoxin neutralization. The bacterin-toxoid elicited significantly greater serologic responses compared to controls for all antigens.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was performed to}} evaluate the pathological aspects of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> and to determine the role of liver injury induced either by mild carbon tetrachloride toxicity or by subclinical hepatic coccidiosis on the pathogenicity of Pasteurella haemolytica and the pathogenesis of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> in goats. The experiment was designed on two phases as follows: In phase one, the experimental animals were divided into four groups, The first group of goats were infected with relatively high dose of P. haemolytica intratracheally, the second group received subtoxic dose of carbon tetrachloride, while the animals of group three were subjected to mixed treatment with carbon tetrachloride followed by intratracheal infection with P. haemolytica. The last group was uninfected control. In phase two, the experimental animals were also divided into four groups, one group of goats were infected with relatively high dose of P. haemolytica intratracheally, the second group received subclinical dose of different sporulated oocysts of Eimeria spp., while the animals of group three were infected with Eimeria spp. followed by intratracheal infection with P. haemolytica. The last group was uninfected control. 43 The results obtained {{in the present study}} confirmed the possibility of inducing the disease experimentally in healthy goats {{even in the absence of}} predisposing factors or stressing experience. On the other hand, it was evident that mild carbon tetrachloride toxicity and subclinical hepatic coccidiosis predispose experimental goats to <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> The clinical signs and pathological lesions of different animals were variable from mild to severe according to experimental protocol. The post mortem findings observed in the lungs of different experimental animals in this study were mainly in apical and cardiac lobes. The histopathological findings were typically of fibrinous bronchopneumonia. The haematological changes in the present study were mainly observed in animals infected with P. haemolytica after being inoculated either by carbon tetrachloride or by Eimeria spp. These changes were dominated by increase in total WBCS count and slight changes in haemoglobin and packed cell volume. The plasma biochemical parameters were mainly dominated by significant increase in albumin, little changes in total protein, aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin. No change was observed in alkaline phosphatase in both experiments. These alternations are 44 mostly due to severity of the disease and liver injury involvement induced either by mild carbon tetrachloride toxicity or by subclinical hepatic coccidiosis...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to develop and characterize a swine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> model by concurrent introduction of Pasteurella multocida type A and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae crude cytotoxin. After a series of preliminary experiments, a combination of 4 x 10 (9) P. multocida and 4, 000 toxic units of A. pleuropneumoniae crude cytotoxin was determined to produce optimal results. A total of 48 pigs were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each. The control group received buffered saline only. Four pigs from each group were randomly selected for necropsy 3, 7 and 14 days postinoculation (PI). Inoculation of pigs with P. multocida and A. pleuropneumoniae cytotoxin (group 1) resulted in moderate to severe pneumonia. Pasteurella multocida was isolated from pneumonic lesions, grossly normal lung, and bronchial lymph nodes of all group 1 pigs throughout the 14 day experimental period. Pathological changes typical of field cases of swine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> were produced. Pigs inoculated with P. multocida alone (group 2) had pneumonic lesions and P. multocida was reisolated from lungs at three days PI. Pasteurella multocida was not isolated from these pigs at 7 and 14 days PI, except for one pig in which an abscess developed in the thorax. Pulmonary lesions induced by A. pleuropneumoniae crude cytotoxin alone (group 3) were transient and resolved by seven days PI. Group 1 pigs had significantly greater lung lesion volumes than group 2 and 3 pigs at 3, 7 and 14 days PI. Statistical analysis indicated a significant interactive effect of P. multocida and A. pleuropneumoniae cytotoxin on the development of lung lesion volumes at 7 and 14 days PI (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Pasteurella haemolytica A 1 leukotoxic culture {{supernatant}} {{was evaluated}} {{for its ability}} to induce histamine release from bovine pulmonary mast cells isolated by enzymatic dispersion of lung tissue. Histamine was measured by a radioimmunoassay technique. Leukotoxic culture supernatant of P. haemolytica significantly released histamine in a time and concentration-related manner. This effect was lost when culture supernatant was heat-inactivated or preincubated with leukotoxin neutralizing rabbit serum. Preincubation of the mast cells with propranolol or p-bromophenacyl bromide reduced the histamine-releasing effect of leukotoxin, while verapamil enhanced release. Experimental infection of calves with P. haemolytica A 1 reduced the total histamine content of pulmonary mast cells recovered at postmortem. Histamine release induced by P. haemolytica leukotoxin is likely an important factor in the pathogenesis of bovine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Based {{on current}} {{literature}} which commonly associates bovine virus diarrhea virus and M. bovis with <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis,</b> an investigation was conducted into {{the effect of}} these 2 pathogens on the capacity of bovine lung to clear inhaled P. haemolytica. There was no significant effect (P > 0. 05) of either bovine virus diarrhea virus or M. bovis on the mean clearance rate of P. haemolytica, nor did the time interval of 3, 5 or 7 days between the 1 st inoculation and exposure to P. haemolytica adversely affect the lung clearance rates.

40|$|Cultured bovine {{alveolar}} macrophages phagocytosed formalized 125 I-labeled Pasteurella haemolytica organisms poorly {{when compared}} with uptake of an identical number of radiolabeled Yersinia enterocolitica organisms. The presence of immune serum enhanced uptake of P haemolytica, yet at high bacteria-to-macrophage ratios, a significant positive correlation existed between uptake and loss of cells from coverslips. This phenomenon was not observed with Y enterocolitica. While culture supernatant from P haemolytica either impaired phagocytosis or were cytotoxic to cultured macrophages, supernatant from Y enterocolitica did not show this effect. The observation of an apparent deterimental effect on bovine alveolar macrophages after uptake of P haemolytica {{may be used to}} explain events occurring in <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> in cattle and may help in the development of immunizaiton techniques...|$|E
40|$|Biochemical profiles, {{restriction}} endonuclease analysis (REA) and ribotyping {{were used to}} investigate a total of 38 Pasteurella multocida isolates from four separate outbreaks of pasteurellosis in Australian piggeries. Six isolates were obtained from Outbreak 1, 16 from Outbreak 1 and eight each from outbreaks 3 and 4. Outbreaks 1 and 2 were cases of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> while outbreaks 3 and 4 involved systemic pasteurellosis. Biochemical characterisation established {{that a number of}} different types of P. multocida were present in outbreaks 1 and 3 while outbreaks 2 and 4 were associated with a single type of P. multocida. Outbreaks 1 and 3 yielded isolates of P. multocida that belonged to the subspecies multocida and gallicida, with the subspecies multocida isolates being identified as biovar 3 (6 in total) or 12 (1 in total) and the subspecies gallicida isolates (7 in total) being identified as biovar 8. All 24 isolates from outbreaks 2 and 3 belonged to the subspecies multocida and were all biovar 3, REA and ribotyping showed that, in outbreaks 1 and 3, there were three different types of P. multocida in each outbreak with no common strains between the outbreaks. The molecular methods showed that only a single strain of P, multocida was associated with outbreaks 2 and 4, although the outbreaks were associated with strains that differed in REA profiles but shared a ribotype profile. This study has shown that both, systemic and <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> can be associated with either a single strain or multiple strains of P. multocida. The results also indicate that the molecular typing methods of REA and ribotyping are superior to biochemical characterisation for epidemiological investigation of porcine pasteurellosis.

40|$|Goats were inoculated with Pasteurella haemolytica A 1 {{by three}} {{different}} routes {{to evaluate a}} caprine model of reproduction of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> Lungs were examined and compared grossly, microscopically, and by bacterial culture. All of three goats inoculated intratracheally, one of three goats inoculated intravenously, and none of three goats inoculated intratonsillarly developed pneumonic lesions. Pneumonic lesions in the intravenously-inoculated goat were similar in gross and microscopic aspects to the lesions present in the lungs of intratracheally-inoculated goats. In a separate study, there was evidence of replication of P. hemolytica organisms in the lungs of cattle after subcutaneous vaccination with a live P. haemolytica vaccine, and evidence that the organisms may have gained access to the lung via the vascular system;Humoral immune responses of cattle to P. haemolytica have been thoroughly studied, and humoral immune responses sometimes do not correlate with protection against experimental disease. Other factors, including cell-mediated immune responses, {{may be involved in}} protection against <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> To evaluate the cell-mediated immune responses to P. haemolytica, calves were vaccinated with a commercial P. haemolytica bacterin, or a commercial live P. haemolytica vaccine, or they were infected intratracheally with P. haemolytica. Lymphocyte cultures from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or lymph node cells were stimulated with antigens prepared from P. haemolytica to evaluate in vitro lymphocyte proliferative responses and gamma interferon production as measures of cell-mediated immunity. In response to stimulation with an outer membrane protein preparation from P. haemolytica, strong proliferative responses and gamma interferon production were detected in lymph node cells from calves vaccinated with the live vaccine and from infected calves;All calves were challenge-exposed to P. haemolytica, and cell-mediated immune and humoral immune responses were correlated with the degree of pneumonia after experimental challenge. Neither of the cell-mediated immune responses nor the humoral immune response was strongly correlated with the degree of pneumonia present after the experimental challenge...|$|E
40|$|The {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) -associated protein (LAP) was {{extracted from}} Pasteurella haemolytica serotype A 1 strains L 101 (bovine origin) and 82 - 25 (ovine origin). Extracts contained 0. 017 % total LPS and appeared as only two bands at 14 and 16. 6 kDa after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To {{determine the extent}} of pulmonary inflammation induced by LAP and its possible role in the pathogenesis of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis,</b> LAP (500 micrograms in pyrogen-free saline [PFS]) was deposited by fiber-optic bronchoscopy into the dorsum of the caudal portion of the cranial lobe of the right lung of calves (strain L 101 LAP) and sheep (strain 82 - 25 LAP). LPS (500 micrograms in PFS), 3 -h P. haemolytica cultures (1. 6 x 10 (8) to 1. 9 x 10 (8) CFU in PFS), and PFS alone were deposited similarly as controls. At necropsy, 24 h after deposition, gross and histologic pulmonary lesions of calves and sheep given LAP, LPS, and P. haemolytica were similar and consisted of various degrees of acute bronchopneumonia (relative severities of lesions induced: LAP < LPS < live organisms). By subjective histologic interpretation and semiquantitative morphometry, animals given LAP had the highest percentage of macrophages per alveolar lumen and the lowest percentage of neutrophils. The lesions from animals given LPS were more severe than those given LAP, but the morphometric cell counts were similar. In contrast, animals inoculated with P. haemolytica had lesions typical of this agent, consisting of many neutrophils, proteinaceous exudate, and a few macrophages. Morphometrically, these lesions had the highest numbers of neutrophils and the lowest numbers of macrophages. These studies show that LAP can induce an inflammatory response in the alveolar lumens and {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was developed}} {{for the detection of}} immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the capsular polysaccharide (CP) of Pasteurella haemolytica serotype 1. Purified CP was first covalently coupled to poly-L-lysine and then optimally adsorbed at a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml to microtiter plates in the presence of carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9. 8). The ELISA was used to evaluate and compare the CP-specific IgG response of calves vaccinated with different P. haemolytica-derived experimental vaccines. Elevated levels of ELISA IgG titers were detected in postvaccination sera and lung lavage from calves vaccinated intradermally with live logarithmic-phase organisms or the culture supernatants. The ELISA was found to be a rapid, reproducible, and sensitive technique for the detection of CP-specific antibodies and may be useful to delineate the protective role of these antibodies in bovine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was developed}} for detection of bovine serum antibodies to the cytotoxin (leukotoxin) of Pasteurella haemolytica.

Preadsorption of sera with various cytotoxic, somatic, and capsular antigen preparations demonstrated that the assay was specific for anticytotoxin antibodies. ELISA anticytotoxin titers had a strong, significant correlation to cytotoxin-neutralizing-antibody titers. The ELISA, however, was more rapid and allowed for greater numbers of samples to be run than did the neutralization technique. ELISA anticytotoxin titers were high in cattle vaccinated with a live P. haemolytica vaccine, whereas unvaccinated cattle and cattle receiving a P. haemolytica bacterin had low ELISA anticytotoxin titers.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} enrofloxacin was tested in calves with experimentally induced <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> A strain of Pasteurella haemolytica, biotype A, serotype 1 (P haemolytica A 1), {{which had been}} isolated from an outbreak of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> in feedlot calves, was used to induce the disease in 24 eight-month-old calves. Each animal received, by intratracheal injection, 6 x 10 11 colony forming units of P haemolytica A 1 in a four-hour log phase culture. Twelve similar animals were kept as non-infected controls (Negative Control group). Treatment of the infected animals commenced 40 h after infection and was as follows: 12 animals each received 2, 5 mg/kg enrofloxacin subcutaneously and 12 animals each received 5 ml sterile saline intramuscularly (Positive Control group). All treatments were given once daily for three consecutive days. Clinical examinations were performed on all animals once daily, starting prior to infection and continuing until 12 d post-infection. The parameters evaluated were rectal temperature, habitus (attitude), ocular mucous membrane congestion and abnormal sounds on lung auscultation. On day 14 post-infection, all animals were killed and their lung lesions (if any) estimated as the percentage involvement of each pair of lungs. The only statistically significant (P≥ 0, 05) differences observed were between the Negative Control group and the Positive Control group. Noticeable differences were seen between the enrofloxacin-treated group and the Positive Control group, {{but they were not}} statistically significant (P> 0, 05). The average lung lesion score (pneumonic lesions as a percentage of total lung volume) for the Positive Control group was 12, 1 % and that of the enrofloxacin-treated group, 8, 4 %.
