5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer {{than that of the}} equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its <b>period</b> <b>is</b> the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its <b>period</b> <b>is</b> 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its <b>period</b> <b>is</b> Jupiter's official rotation.|$|E

5|$|A <b>period</b> <b>is</b> a {{horizontal}} {{row in the}} periodic table. Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends, there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group trends, such as the f-block, where the lanthanides and actinides form two substantial horizontal series of elements.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} shatpadi {{writing from}} this <b>period</b> <b>is</b> the Jivandhara Charite (1424) by Bhaskara, {{a story of}} Prince Jivanadhara, who regained the throne usurped by his father. Other well-known Jain writers were Kalyanakirti (Jnanachandrabhyudaya, 1439), Santikirtimuni (Santinathacharite, 1440), Vijayanna (Dvadasanuprekshe, 1448), Bommarasa of Terakanambi (Sanatkumara Charite, 1485), Kotesvara (1500), Mangarasa III (Jayanripa Kavya), Santarasa (Yogaratnakara), Santikirti (Santinatha Purana, 1519), Doddayya (Chandraprabha Purana, 1550), Doddananka (Chandraprabha Purana, 1578) and Bahubali Pandita of Sringeri (Dharmanathapuranam, 1352).|$|E
50|$|The term Uruk <b>period</b> <b>was</b> coined at {{a conference}} in Baghdad in 1930, where {{at the same time the}} Jemdet Nasr and Ubaid <b>periods</b> <b>were</b> defined.|$|R
25|$|The study {{concluded}} that the mortality rate per 1,000 population {{per year in the}} pre-invasion <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 5.5 (range of 4.3-7.1, using a 95% CI, confidence interval) and in the post-invasion <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 13.3 (95% CI, 10.9-16.1). Excess mortality rate over the pre-invasion <b>period</b> <b>was</b> therefore 7.8 per 1,000 population per year, with violent death accounting for 92% of the increased mortality rate.|$|R
50|$|The <b>periods</b> <b>are</b> {{intended}} {{to bridge the}} gap between the algebraic numbers and the transcendental numbers. The class of algebraic numbers is too narrow to include many common mathematical constants, while the set of transcendental numbers is not countable, and its members are not generally computable. The set of all <b>periods</b> <b>is</b> countable, and all <b>periods</b> <b>are</b> computable, and in particular definable.|$|R
5|$|Another type of {{mounting}} that became fashionable around the mid-Heian <b>period</b> <b>is</b> the kenukigata, or hair-tweezer style, {{named for the}} characteristically shaped hilt, which is pierced along the center. In this style, the hilt is fitted with an ornamental border and did not contain any wooden covering. Like kazari-tachi, swords with this mounting were used for ceremonial purposes but also in warfare, as an example held at Ise Grand Shrine shows.|$|E
5|$|Approximately every 2.5 or 2.6 years, {{the object}} {{comes back to}} the point in the solar system where the 1990 {{encounter}} occurred, and the earth {{comes back to the}} same point every year.

50|$|The {{average annual}} rate of {{precipitation}} in the watershed of Dalmatia Creek over a 19-year <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 39.30 in. The average {{annual rate of}} runoff over a 19-year <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 3.15 in.|$|R
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation <b>period</b> <b>is</b> 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the ill-fated}} 1263 {{expedition}} of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides and the Isle of Man were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland {{as a result}} of the 1266 Treaty of Perth. Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and place names, the archaeological record of the Norse <b>period</b> <b>is</b> very limited. The best known find is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.|$|E
40|$|Variations in {{insolation}} {{are examined}} {{in terms of}} beat relationships. The relations between eccentricity periods, precessional parameters, and obliquity <b>periods</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. Beat <b>periods</b> <b>are</b> calculated and compared with orbital periodicities from Berger's (1978) series expansions. It is noted that the data, which correlate eccentricity, obliquity, and precessional-parameter <b>periods,</b> <b>are</b> applicable {{to the study of}} orbital periodicities in time-series analyses of long-term climatic records...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} of concentrations of nitrate, ammonium and nitrite nitrogen, total and phosphate phosphorus under the forest ecosystem Čaradice stream during 2005 - 2010. The average concentration of N-NO 3 - for the whole of the monitored <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 1. 76 mg*dm- 3. Its highest average concentrations in all monitored years were generally in the winter. The average concentration of ammonia nitrogen during the whole monitored <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 0. 14 mg*dm- 3. Minimum average concentrations over the entire observed <b>period</b> <b>were</b> recorded in the winter period and maximum during the summer and autumn periods. The average nitrite nitrogen concentration over the entire monitored <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 0. 025 mg*dm- 3. Depending on the time of collection, its lowest average concentration was recorded in January and the highest in June and September. The average total phosphorus concentration under the forest ecosystem of the Čadadický stream for the whole monitored <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 0. 676 mg*dm- 3. Its lowest average value for the whole reporting <b>period</b> <b>was</b> recorded in February and the highest in November. The average concentration of P-PO 43 - for the whole reference <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 0. 203 mg*dm- 3. Its lowest average concentration, depending on the collection time, was found in January and the highest in August...|$|R
5000|$|The {{duration}} {{of the first and}} second <b>periods</b> <b>was</b> 12 minutes, running time. The third <b>period</b> <b>was</b> 11 minutes, running time, plus a final minute of stop time. There was a four-minute break between periods.|$|R
5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a {{magnitude}} of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital <b>period</b> <b>is</b> only slightly longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which means it would cross Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E
