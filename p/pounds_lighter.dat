25|$|At the January 2011 Senior Bowl weigh-in, Carimi was the second-tallest {{player at}} 6 feet 7⅛ inches (2.01 m), had the second-longest arms (35¼inches), {{and had the}} second-longest {{wingspan}} (83¼inches; second to Mississippi State’s Derek Sherrod). His hand size was 10⅜inches, and he weighed in at 315 pounds, 10 <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> than his playing weight in college. ESPN analysts rated him the third-best player at the Senior Bowl.|$|E
25|$|The 1977 {{model was}} {{extensively}} redone and downsized, like the Delta 88. The new models, at around 4000 pounds curb weight, were over 800 <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter,</b> but headroom and rear seat legroom were increased compared to equivalent 1976 models. The 455CID engine {{was replaced by}} the smaller 403CID V8. The Oldsmobile 350 V8 was now the standard engine. The Ninety-Eight set a new sales record of 139,423. A four-door sedan and a two-door hardtop coupe were available.|$|E

25|$|During a post-race inspection, race {{stewards}} {{discovered that}} the car was 250 <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> than the 2,800-pound minimum weight requirement. Donohue was about to have his race victory taken away for cheating, but Roger Penske stepped in. Penske warned that any disqualification would have the potential of motivating Chevrolet to pull all support for the Trans-Am series. After considering the potential consequences, the race stewards allowed Donohue's victory to stand, but the rules for the 1968 season incorporated a change whereby all cars would be weighed during the technical inspection before the race.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Ford Canada hand-built 40 Mercury Sables {{powered by}} SHO V6 engines {{as part of}} their AIV (Aluminum Intensive Vehicle) program and {{released}} 20 to the public. Using aluminum suspension elements and aluminum body panels, held together with a spot welding process and adhesive joining process developed specifically for this vehicle, the end result was a car that was 400 <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> than a SHO Taurus. In 1995, Multimatic Motorsports entered one of these vehicles in the One Lap of America event, finishing 15th overall and 1st in the Mid-Priced Sedan class.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet {{engineered}} several modifications for the Z06 to {{best use}} the increased power. Starting {{with the most}} structurally rigid body style, the hardtop or FRC, new components included: uprated FE4 suspension, larger wheels and tires, revised gearing ratios, and functional brake cooling ducts. The Z06 is 38 <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> than a standard C5 hardtop thanks to weight-saving measures such as a titanium exhaust, thinner glass, lighter wheel, non-EMT tires, reduced sound proofing, fixed rear radio aerial, and a lighter battery. Starting with the 2002 model year, the LS6 engine output was increased to 405hp (302kW) due to a larger CFM air intake, stiffer valve springs, lighter sodium filled valves and more aggressive camshaft lift and timing.|$|E
2500|$|In the end, the T44 was {{selected}} over the T48/FAL {{primarily because of}} weight (T44 was a <b>pound</b> <b>lighter),</b> simplicity with fewer parts, the T44's self-compensating gas system, and {{the argument that the}} T44 could be manufactured on existing machinery built for the M1 rifle (this later turned out to be unworkable).

25|$|Sylvia was {{originally}} scheduled to face Shayne Adams (1–2) on August 13 at a Fight Tour {{event at the}} Rockford Metro Centre in Rockford, Illinois. But due to a scheduling conflict with the athletic commission the event will now take place on August 20. Sylvia was then scheduled to face Brian Heden at the August 20 Fight Tour event because the Illinois Athletic Commission would not approve the fight between Adams and Sylvia. However the bout between Sylvia and Heden was later scrapped for unknown reasons and Sylvia would now face submission specialist Patrick Barrentine. Sylvia defeated Barrentine via TKO in the first round. Sylvia weighed in at 280.5 pounds for the bout, 30 <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> than his previous bout against Wagner.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{weighed in}} at 241 pounds, two <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> than their first fight. Klitschko {{came in at}} a career heavy of 247 pounds. Peter started the fight very aggressively and caught Klitschko with a good left hook in the opening minute, {{although}} Klitschko ended the round well. Peter was caught with three hard right-hands in the second round, one of which seemed to stun him. Peter tried to duck under the Klitschko jab, but was being tied up on the inside. After four rounds, the fight became one-sided in Klitschko's favour. Peter's right eye was closing and he was taking heavy punishment. After the ninth round, Peter's trainer Abel Sanchez said he would give him one more round. Emmanuel Steward also implored Klitschko to be more aggressive. Peter swung wildly in the tenth and Klitschko put him down with a concussive combination. Referee Robert Byrd did not start a count and waved the fight off, awarding Klitschko the win by knockout. Klitschko, however, was set to fight Dereck Chisora on 11 December, but the fight was later called off on 8 December due to Klitschko tearing a muscle in his abdomen.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} off-season, Wellwood became a restricted free agent. After taking the Canucks to arbitration on July 28, 2009, he was re-signed to a one-year, $1.2 million contract {{two days later}} on July 30; terms in the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) did not allow the Canucks {{to walk away from}} a ruling of less than $1.57 million. Having earned a reputation in his first Canucks season for a lack of fitness, Wellwood reported to training camp for the 2009–10 season 15 <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> than in the previous year. He began the season playing on the third line with Steve Bernier and Mason Raymond, a combination that Head Coach Alain Vigneault carried over from the latter stages of the 2008–09 season and playoffs. Wellwood was sidelined early in the season, suffering a broken toe after blocking a shot from Maple Leafs defenceman Mike Komisarek in a game on October 24, 2009, but he returned to the lineup just eight days later, on November 1. He finished the campaign with 14 goals and 25 points in 75 games. He followed that up with a seven-point post-season as the Canucks were eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago Blackhawks, in the second round.|$|E

Encouraged by several of his {{teammates}} and Giants' general manager Brian Sabean, he showed up at spring training several <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter.</b> The weight loss did not lead to immediate results for Sandoval, who batted [...]167 with just six RBI in his first 31 games through May 6. However, over his next 42 games through June 21, he batted [...]351 with seven home runs and 27 RBI.|$|E
500|$|In early November, due to {{the threat}} that a new American Association was near formation, the National League clubs were quick to sign their players without much negotiating. Many of the players' salary demands were met, {{including}} Stivetts'. In March, shortly before the 1895season began, Stivetts claimed he was in [...] "excellent phycial condition", {{and that he was}} [...] "many <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> than he was at this period last year." [...] The season opener was on April19 against Brooklyn, and Stivetts got the start over Nichols for the second consecutive season. Despite being down early in the game, Boston won the game 11–6behind a seven-run seventh inning. Stivetts scored thrice and gathered two hits in the game, including a double.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain {{attention}} for the embattled Kingdom Pro Wrestling league, Hiromitsu Kanehara and Yoji Anjoh signed on {{to compete in the}} Ultimate Fighting Championship's Ultimate Japan tournament. Kanehara was injured in his training for the tournament, and Sakuraba wound up as his late-hour substitute. The tournament was intended for heavyweights, but Sakuraba who weighed 183 pounds (middleweight by modern standards), was nearly twenty pounds beneath the UFC's 200 pound designation for the weight class. Having reporting himself as 203 <b>pounds</b> (<b>Light</b> heavyweight by modern standards) in order to gain entry, Sakuraba was paired off against the 240 pound Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt and former Extreme Fighting champion, Marcus Silveira.|$|R
50|$|After {{selling in}} high numbers, the Dell Inspiron 1520 {{received}} widespread praise regarding its size, and small screen. The Inspiron 1525 {{was intended to}} address some of the issues with the Inspiron 1520. The 1525 has been described by reviewers as weighing approximately six pounds - half a <b>pound</b> <b>lighter</b> than the 1520. This laptop can be considered as a mid-range Dell computer, between the small 1420 model and the expensive XPS M1530 model. The laptop also fixed a perceived flaw that had plagued Inspiron laptops for a decade; they were bulky and boxy, but the Inspiron 1525's chassis used a new edge design that appears on all of Dell's current laptops.|$|R
500|$|As the 1915 {{season was}} set to get underway, Coach Yost reported, [...] "Johnny {{told me he was}} feeling fine when I saw him recently, {{although}} he doesn’t weigh as much as he used to." [...] Despite Yost's hopes, Maulbetsch fell far short of the prior year's performance in 1915. [...] He was several <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> after the illness and surgery, and it was noted that [...] "a few pounds means much to a man of Maulbetsch's weight." [...] In the opening game against Lawrence, Maulbetsch scored three touchdowns, but he was [...] "woefully weak on interference." [...] Playing against Mount Union, Maulbetsch made several big gains, including a 50-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. [...] His difficulties returned in the season's third game against Marietta, as [...] "Maulbetsch was powerless to stop the Marietta forward pass, all of the successful ones being directed toward his side of the line." ...|$|E
500|$|With the Browns {{starting}} in the team's 1947 season, Adamle played as a fullback. He competed with Marion Motley at the position, {{and said he was}} [...] "not working to be a second-stringer". Adamle was a straight-talker and was not afraid to stand up to Brown, a cold disciplinarian who was the team's coach between 1946 and 1962. Brown was impressed with Adamle's candor and held him in respect. Before the seventh game of the 1947 season, a matchup against the Chicago Rockets that October, Adamle replaced Motley as the team's starting fullback. Brown said that while he had not given up on Motley, a big back who had anchored the offense in the Browns' early years, the former starter had [...] "made a few mistakes lately that hurt us" [...] and thought competition would be helpful. Adamle, who was about 15 <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> than Motley, started for a brief time as part of an offense led by quarterback Otto Graham, registering 23 carries for 95 yards on the season, a career-high. The Browns went on to finish the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and win the AAFC championship game against the New York Yankees. Adamle returned to Ohio State in the offseason to continue his studies.|$|E
500|$|Seerey {{made his}} debut with the Indians on June 9, 1943. Almost {{immediately}} after his debut, he earned the nickname of [...] "people's choice" [...] in media due to both his hitting ability and his [...] "willingness {{to challenge the}} brick walls of the stadium". He played in 26 games for the Indians on the season, and hit [...]222 in 72 at-bats. Entering the 1944 Cleveland Indians season, manager Lou Boudreau planned to use Seerey as the starting center fielder, as he had reported to spring training 25 <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter</b> and Boudreau felt that Seerey could improve on a weak area on the team's roster. Seerey moved back to left field to begin the season; {{in his first game}} there on the year, he hit a three-run home run to give the Indians a 74 victory over the Detroit Tigers. A month into the season, Seerey was among the league leaders in runs batted in, which was attributed to better plate discipline, though his fielding in the outfield was still considered a liability. Partway through the season, Seerey's playing time diminished, yet he remained the team leader in home runs for most of the season despite limited at-bats. He finished the season with 15 home runs, 39 runs batted in, and a league-leading 99 strikeouts in 101 games.|$|E
50|$|The {{weapon was}} {{lightened}} to 4.76 kg and shortened to 966 mm but retained the same barrel length. The CQB model has a 13-inch barrel, and is half a <b>pound</b> <b>lighter</b> than the regular model. Uncommon in other automatic shotguns, the AA-12 fires {{from an open}} bolt, a feature more commonly found in submachine guns, as well as heavy and squad-level machine guns. It uses 8-round box, 20-round drum, or 32-round drum magazines, {{as opposed to the}} original 5-round box magazine. Due to the abundant use of stainless steel and the designed clearance for fouling, MPS has claimed that the weapon requires little to no cleaning or lubrication. The designer states that cleaning is required after 10,000 rounds.|$|R
5000|$|Cosmetic {{changes were}} {{apparent}} as well. The keyboard layout and style now mirrored {{that of the}} Apple IIGS and Macintosh, including an enlarged [...] "Return" [...] key and updated modifier keys (Open and Solid Apple being replaced by [...] "Command" [...] and [...] "Option"). Above the keyboard, the rarely used [...] "40/80" [...] switch {{was replaced by a}} sliding volume control (gone was the left side volume-control dial, and as a cost-cutting measure, the audio headphone jack disappeared with it). The case housing and keyboard had been changed to the light-grey Apple platinum color, creating a seamless blend between keyboard and case, making them appear almost as one. The machine, a half <b>pound</b> <b>lighter</b> than the original IIc, weighed in at 7 pounds (3.2 kg).|$|R

500|$|While MSU {{students}} and alumni often {{refer to the}} Spartan statue as Sparty, the incarnation of Sparty with national visibility {{is that of a}} costumed mascot who appears at athletic events and other university-related functions. The first mascot appeared in 1955 and was a papier-mâché Spartan head made by Theta Xi fraternity brothers Donald Pais, Kenneth Roberts, and Don Bauer. By the 1956 Rose Bowl Game, the papier-mâché head had been replaced by a fiberglass version that was thirty <b>pounds</b> <b>lighter.</b> In 1985, MSU Alumni Association Graphic Designer Dave Giordan was asked to draw a muscular Sparty in full body armor. Four years later, in 1989, a group came together to design and revamp the Sparty mascot. Research was conducted on Michigan State’s mission, community, and traditions. The result was an “approachable, fierce yet kind, man for all seasons” mascot. Sparty would reflect the university’s strength and character. To introduce MSU's new mascot, six billboards were positioned around East Lansing announcing his Spartan Stadium debut. The costume, with a cartoonishly oversized head, bulging muscles, and a facial expression that treads a fine line between cute and pugnacious, was introduced to MSU fans during the 1989 football season. [...] Sparty was an immediate hit, in part because the foam-rubber body parts, vinyl breastplate, and skirt have a freedom of movement that allow the anonymous student who portrays Sparty to be quite expressive despite the costume's fixed stare. The student that portrays Sparty is a volunteer, despite rumors of financial compensation or a full scholarship. Early every calendar year, tryouts are held for the student to portray Sparty for the upcoming school year.|$|E

5000|$|The VAIO SA/SB/SC {{series was}} {{released}} in February 2011. It once again featured a 13.3" [...] screen with a matte anti-glare finish, with a native 16:9 aspect ratio and maximum resolution of either 1366x768 or 1600x900. It was notably thinner and lighter than its predecessor, weighing just under 4 lbs (half a <b>pound</b> <b>lighter)</b> and 0.95" [...] thick (1/4" [...] thinner). It also had a completely redesigned chassis, replacing the large rounded hinge with a sleek and angular design, featuring chrome accents on the hinge and VAIO logo. The processors were updated to Second-Generation Intel Core i5 and i7 CPUs, and the graphic options were either AMD Radeon HD 6470M (512MB DDR3) or 6630M (1GB DDR3). The laptop also featured a physical switch that could disable or enable the discrete graphics card at will and make the computer use the integrated processor GPU to increase battery life. It had 4GB of DDR3-1333 memory soldered to the motherboard, and one open RAM slot which was customer-accessible and supported an additional 4GB of RAM. It also features a sheet battery that increases the battery life to 15 hours. The 3rd VAIO S Series was the first VAIO with a non-removable battery.|$|R
