40|$|The {{paper is}} aimed at the fractal {{analysis}} of the creeping discharge patterns propagating over different solid insulators immersed in mineral oil, under negative impulse voltage using a point-plane electrode arrangement. The considered solid insulators are circular samples of different thickness made of polycarbonate, <b>phenoplast</b> resin (Bakelite) and glass. Two methods are used to estimate the fractal dimension, namely the box counting method and the fractal measure relations method. It is shown that the creeping discharges propagate radially; the shape {{and the length of}} these discharges depend on the types of solid insulators and their thicknesses. By using the box counting method, we show that the discharge patterns present a fractal dimension D which depend on the thickness of the solid samples (e) and the type of insulator. D decreases when e increases. This suggests the possible implication of capacitive effects on the propagation phenomena of creeping discharges. So D increases with the dielectric constant of the insulator; it is the highest for glass and the lowest for polycarbonate; D is in between for <b>phenoplast</b> resin. This dependency of D on the solid insulators and their thicknesses reveals the existence of a relation between the fractal dimension and the physical parameters. The fractal measure relations method gives a fractal dimension equal to the Euclidian dimension (D = 2) {{due to the fact that}} the density of branches rho (r) remains constant whatever the radius r of the circular domain within which rho (r) is determined. rho (r) depends on the thickness and the nature of solid insulating material. The value of the density of branches increases when the thickness of the solid insulating material decreases...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} aimed at the {{influence}} of hydrostatic pressure on the morphology and final length of creeping discharges propagating over solid / liquid insulating surfaces in a point-plane electrode arrangement submitted to lightning impulse voltages. Three types of solid insulators (namely polycarbonate, <b>phenoplast</b> resin (Bakelite) and glass), immersed in mineral oil are tested. It is shown that the length of branches constituting the discharges are reduced when the hydrostatic pressure is increased whatever the polarity of the voltage. The final length of discharges Lf increases quasi-linearly with the voltage and decreases when the hydrostatic pressure is increased for {{both positive and negative}} polarities as observed elsewhere under AC and DC. On the other hand, for given voltage and pressure, Lf increases with the dielectric constant of solid materials indicating the important role of the capacitive effects in the propagation mechanism...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{studied the}} {{attachment}} strength of Dreissena polymorpha on nine artificial substrata in the labora-tory. The highest attachment strength (0. 46 N) {{was found on}} resocart (<b>phenoplast</b> plastic). It was lower on alu-minium, acrylic, PVC, rubber and glass (listed {{in the order of}} decreasing strength), and the lowest on zinc, Penaten cream coating and copper. Apart from reducing adhesion, copper substratum caused also heavy mor-tality of the mussels. Further experiments, in which mussels were exposed on resocart surfaces {{in the presence of the}} examined materials (thus being influenced only by waterborne substances released by them), revealed that zinc and copper inhibited mussel attachment primarily by means of ions released to the water column. In the case of Penaten coating, the impact of its surface properties upon mussels seemed to be more important than waterborne cues...|$|E

50|$|Important {{epoxy resins}} are {{produced}} from combining epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A to give bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers.Increasing {{the ratio of}} bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves {{more and more like}} a thermoplastic. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 - 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, <b>phenoplasts</b> and isocyanates.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Zebra mussels {{were tested}} for their {{mobility}} {{and strength of}} attachment in six diferent experimen-tal combinations. They were kept for 7 days on copper or plastic (<b>phenoplast)</b> plates in 4 -L beakers put on the bottom, or on plastic (resocart) plates suspended 15 mm above copper ones; water used was pure or with addi-tion of a metal ion chelator â€“ disodium versenate (EDTA). Exposure to copper ions resulted in the highest mortality. When the ions were EDTA-removed, the animals tended to leave copper plates and stay on the glass bottom or walls of the beakers. Attachment strength was measured with a device based on pan scales, {{with one of the}} pans replaced by forceps grasping a mussel. It was significantly lower in the presence of copper ions or with metallic substrate. Both the release of ions and the surface properties of copper substrate were found to influence zebra mussels, the former factor increasing their mortality, the latter causing sublethal responses. The observations may be useful in designing fouling-resistant devices and systems. KEY WORDS: Dreissena polymorpha, copper, survival, locomotion, attachment strength...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{cleaning}} or {{activation of}} an electrically conductive layer (or a conductor line or contact pad) on a substrate {{or of the}} adjacent substrate surface is carried out by placing the layer in a gas-filled discharge space (3) between two electrodes (1, 2), positioning a dielectric (4) between the layer {{and at least one}} electrode (2) and applying a voltage between the electrodes to create a dielectrically hindered discharge through the dielectric, resulting in micro-discharges which effect direct cleaning or activation of the layer or substrate surface. Preferably, the dielectric (4) is diamond, a high voltage resistant ceramic insulating material such as ceramic, glass or porcelain, an insulating plastic such as 'Teflon' (RTM), PVC, fluorocarbon or <b>phenoplast,</b> or a surface coated with such materials. Also claimed is an apparatus for effecting a dielectrically hindered discharge, especially for carrying out the above process. USE - For removing contaminants, such as condensates adhesi ve or polymerisation residues, carbon-containing substances, metal oxides and metal hydrides, from the circuit lines or pads of circuit boards or electronic circuits prior to contacting with solder pastes, solders and passivating agents. ADVANTAGE - The process can be integrated into the manufacturing process {{to reduce the risk of}} re-contamination, acts extremely uniformly on the layer or substrate surface so that little or no heating occurs, is non-polluting and inexpensive, improves the mechanical, electrical and corrosion properties of the layer, can be localised at the layer to minimise substrate attack and avoids the need for fluxes or wet activation baths during subsequent soldering...|$|E
40|$|In 1979 {{the author}} was {{appointed}} by his employers, Consulting Engineers, Gutteridge Haskins and Davey Pty Ltd as project engineer for the site investigation phase of a feasibility study into the management of fresh Water resources and contaminated water at the proposed Worsley Alumina Refinery in the Darling Range of Western Australia. He subsequently became project manager for the design phase of the 40 million "Water Management System" for which Gutteridge Haskins and Davey were responsible. His total involvement with the project was completed when he was seconded to the Project Managers Raymond Engineers, Australia, Pty Ltd as an on-site technical consultant. The Worsley "Water Management System" comprised three 'large dams', {{as defined by the}} International Committee on Large Dams (ICOLD) over twenty kilometres of diversion channels, various hydraulic structures, lined water, storage basins, tailings disposal areas and various seepage collection systems. A particular feature of the project was a multi-backup environmental protection system to control water contaminated by caustic soda and other chemicals used on the site. The first level of protection involved the construction of a storage reservoir, called the Refinery Catchment Lake, to the highest practical degree of water tightness. Part of the design for this reservoir comprised the incorporation of a grout curtain beneath the earth fill embankment in the thick weathered in-situ laterite soils. Field testing confirmed that only low viscosity chemical grout could effectively reduce the already low permeability of the foundation, Chemical grouting of soils is a relatively recent engineering development, and whilst a certain amount of experience has been gained, particularly over the past twenty five years, the procedures to be used are far from being precisely defined. Practical field testing at the Refinery Catchment Lake Dam Site indicated potential problems with some grouting procedures used at other sites in the past. These procedures related principally to the grout pressures and injection volumes used with evidence that excessive hydraulic fracturing of the low permeability soil was counter productive to the overall aim of economically reducing permeability. The thesis describes the design of the Refinery Catchment Lake Dam, reviews the history and theory of chemical grouting and discusses some relevant case histories. It then describes the development of a practical technique used to inject cement/bentonite grout and a <b>phenoplast</b> grout, Geoseal MQ 4, into the dam foundations to achieve the design requirements. The thesis was prepared following post-construction research by the author to deepen his knowledge on the general subject of chemical grouting. The thesis was written in the belief that the work carried out at the Refinery Catchment Lake Dam was unique in terms of the attempted reduction of already low permeability. It is believed that in documenting a major field operation the thesis makes a positive contribution to the increase in knowledge of low permeability soil grouting techniques and points to areas where additional academic research is required...|$|E
