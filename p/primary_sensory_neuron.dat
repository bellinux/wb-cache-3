Of these, Nav 1. 6, Nav 1. 7, Nav 1. 8 and Nav 1. 9 are the most frequently studied in <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> located in the dorsal root ganglion and are mainly localized to the cytoplasm. A large pool of intracellular Navs {{raises the possibility that}} changes in Nav traffick-ing could alter channel function. The molecular mediators of Nav trafficking mainly consist of signals within the Navs themselves, interacting proteins and extracellular factors. The surface expression of Navs is achieved by escape from the endoplasmic reticulum and proteasome degradation, forward trafficking and plasma membrane anchoring, and it is also regulated by channel phosphorylation and ubiquitination in <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> Axonal transport and localization of Navs in afferent fibers involves the motor protein KIF 5 B and scaffold proteins, including contactin and PDZ domain containing 2. Localization of Nav 1. 6 to the nodes of Ranvier in myelinated fibers of <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> requires node formation and the submembrane cytoskeletal protein complex.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{sensation}} of pain can be dramat-ically altered {{in response to}} injury or disease. This sen-sitization can occur {{at the level of}} the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron,</b> and can be mediated by multiple biochemical mechanisms, including, but not limited to, changes in gene transcription, changes in translation, stability, or subcellular localization of translated proteins, and post-translational modifications. This review focuses on post-translational modifications to ion channels expressed in primary sensory neurons that form the machinery driv-ing peripheral sensitization and pain hypersensitivity. Studies published to date show strong evidence for mod-ulation of ion channels involved in transduction and transmission of nociceptive inputs coincident with bio-physical and behavioral sensitization. The roles of phos-phorylation and oxidation/reduction reactions of volt-age-dependent sodium, potassium, and calcium channels are discussed, as well as phosphorylation-mediated mod-ulation of sensory transduction channels. © 2004 Wile...|$|E
40|$|Slit is a {{secreted}} protein {{known to}} repulse the growth cones of commissural neurons. By contrast, Slit also promotes elongation and branching of axons of <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> The reason why different neurons respond to Slit {{in different ways}} is largely unknown. Islet 2 is a LIM/homeodomaintype transcription factor that specifically regulates elongation and branching of the peripheral axons of the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> in zebrafish embryos. We found that PlexinA 4, a transmembrane protein {{known to be a}} coreceptor for class III semaphorins, acts downstream of Islet 2 to promote branching of the peripheral axons of the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> Intriguingly, repression of PlexinA 4 function by injection of the antisense morpholino oligonucleotide specific to PlexinA 4 or by overexpression of the dominant-negative variant of PlexinA 4 counteracted the effects of overexpression of Slit 2 to induce branching of the peripheral axons of the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> in zebrafish embryos, suggesting involvement of PlexinA 4 in the Slit signaling cascades for promotion of axonal branching of the <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> Colocalized expression of Robo, a receptor for Slit 2, and PlexinA 4 is observed not only in the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> of zebrafish embryos but also in the dendrites of the pyramidal neurons of the cortex of the mammals, and may be important for promoting the branching of either axons or dendrites in response to Slit, as opposed to the growth cone collapse...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDevelopmental {{origins of}} the neural crest (NC), a quintessential and {{pluripotent}} vertebrate cell type, has historically been a topic of extensive investigation but continues to remain poorly understood [1]. In the zebrafish embryo, NC and <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> are thought to segregate from a common population of progenitor cells in response to lateral inhibition [2, 3]. Here, we show that the zebrafish homolog of the B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein (Blimp- 1) gene, u-boot (ubo) [4, 5], is induced by BMP signaling in cells at the boundary of the neural plate and nonneural ectoderm. Loss of Ubo activity not only inhibits specification of the NC but also impairs development of the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> Conversely, misexpression of ubo results in the generation of supernumerary <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> consistent with this cell type representing the default fate within the progenitor equivalence group.

40|$|SummaryBrain {{circuits}} endow behavioral flexibility. Here, {{we study}} circuits encoding flexible chemotaxis in C. elegans, where the animal navigates {{up or down}} NaCl gradients (positive or negative chemotaxis) to reach the salt concentration of previous growth (the set point). The ASER sensory neuron mediates positive and negative chemotaxis by regulating the frequency and direction of reorientation movements in response to salt gradients. Both salt gradients and set point memory are encoded in ASER temporal activity patterns. Distinct temporal activity patterns in interneurons immediately downstream of ASER encode chemotactic movement decisions. Different interneuron combinations regulate positive versus negative chemotaxis. We conclude that sensorimotor pathways are segregated immediately after the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> in the chemotaxis circuit, and sensory representation is rapidly transformed to motor representation at the first interneuron layer.

40|$|Neurotrophic {{factors have}} an {{established}} developmental role in regulating the survival and specification of sensory neurons. However, these factors continue to exert an important influence on sensory neurons throughout the postnatal period and into adult life. In adulthood, approximately one-half of nociceptors {{are dependent on}} nerve growth factor (NGF) for trophic support, whereas the other half are sensitive to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). It is now known that many chronic pain states are maintained by widespread changes in the anatomy, neurochemistry, and function of the sensory nervous system both {{at the level of}} the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

Human observations have further implicated the role of CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine. Activation of <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> in the trigeminal vascular system in humans can cause the release of CGRP.

Recent {{findings suggest}} that reducing {{the activity of the}} voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1. 7 in <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> could provide improved pain control in burn-injured patients. Here, we report that partial thickness scalding-type burn injury on the rat paw upregulates Nav 1. 7 expression in <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> 3 h following injury. The injury also induces upregulation in phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (p-CREB), a marker for nociceptive activation in <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> The upregulation in p-CREB occurs mainly in Nav 1. 7 -immunopositive neurons and exhibits a peak at 5 min and, following a decline at 30 min, a gradual increase from 1 h post-injury. The Nav 1. 7 blocker protoxin II (ProTxII) or morphine injected intraperitoneally 15 min before or after the injury significantly reduces burn injury-induced spinal upregulation in phosphorylated serine 10 in histone H 3 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2, which are both markers for spinal nociceptive processing. Further, ProTxII significantly reduces the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents in spinal dorsal horn neurons following burn injury.

We investigated the hypotheses that these drugs (A) are less neurotoxic than the prototype local anesthetic, lidocaine (B) are selectively toxic for subcategories of dorsal root ganglion neurons and (C) induce activation of either p 38 MAPK or related enzymes, such as the c-jun terminal N-kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). METHODS: We incubated <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> cultures with doses of lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine equipotent at blocking sodium currents. Next, we sought to determine potential selectivity of bupivacaine and ropivacaine toxicity on neuron categories defined by immunohistochemical staining, or size.

Finally, the relevance of MAPK pathways in bupivacaineand ropivacaine-induced neurotoxicity was determined by selectively inhibitin...|$|E
40|$|The TREK- 1 {{channel is}} a temperature-sensitive, osmosensitive and mechano-gated K+ channel with a {{regulation}} by Gs and Gq coupled receptors. This paper demonstrates that TREK- 1 qualifies {{as one of}} the molecular sensors involved in pain perception. TREK- 1 is highly expressed in small sensory neurons, is present in both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic neurons and is extensively colocalized with TRPV 1, the capsaicin-activated nonselective ion channel. Mice with a disrupted TREK- 1 gene are more sensitive to painful heat sensations near the threshold between anoxious warmth and painful heat. This phenotype is associated with the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron,</b> as polymodal C-fibers were found to be more sensitive to heat in single fiber experiments. Knockout animals are more sensitive to low threshold mechanical stimuli and display an increased thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in conditions of inflammation.

40|$|The {{activity}} of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 ion channel (TRPV 1) that is expressed by {{the great majority of}} polymodal nociceptors is pivotal for the development of inflammatory heat hyperalgesia. The responsiveness of TRPV 1 is regulated by a series of intracellular signalling molecules including the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -dependent protein kinase A (PKA); increased or decreased PKA activity results in TRPV 1 sensitisation or desensitisation, respectively. Activation of the cannabinoid 1 (CB 1) receptor that is expressed by the majority of the TRPV 1 -expressing <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> reduces PKA activity. Therefore, here we studied whether activation of the CB 1 receptor resulted in reduced TRPV 1 -mediated responses in cultured rat <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> We found that TRPV 1 -mediated whole-cell currents were significantly reduced respectively, by 50 % and 25 % by 10 nM and 30 nM of the endogenous CB 1 receptor agonist, anandamide. The PKA inhibitor, H 89 (10 μM) also had a significant inhibitory effect on TRPV 1 -mediated currents (∼ 70 %). These findings suggest that activation of the CB 1 receptor can reduce the {{activity of}} TRPV 1 in <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons,</b> and that this inhibitory effect could be mediated through the reduction of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} factor in visual function is {{the speed with which}} photoreceptors (PRs) return to the resting state when light intensity dims. Several elements subserve this process, many of which promote the termination of the phototransduction cascade. Although the known elements are intrinsic to PRs, we have found that prompt restoration to the resting state of the Drosophila electroretinogram can require effective communication between the retina and the underlying brain. The requirement is seen more dramatically with long than with short light pulses, distinguishing the phenomenon from gross disruption of the termination machinery. The speed of recovery is affected by mutations (in the Hdc and ort genes) that prevent PRs from transmitting visual information to the brain. It is also affected by manipulation (using either drugs like neostigmine or genetic tools to inactivate neurotransmitter release) of cholinergic signals that arise in the brain. Intracellular recordings support the hypothesis that PRs are the target of this communication. We infer that signaling from the retina to the optic lobe prompts a feedback signal to retinal PRs. Although the mechanism of this retrograde signaling remains to be discerned, the phenomenon establishes a previously unappreciated mode of control of the temporal responsiveness of a <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron...</b>|$|E

The TyrOHase-containing cells exhibited morphologic features typical of <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons,</b> such as an initial axon glomerulus and a single, bifurcating neurite process. These cells were distinguished from TyrOHase- and FIF-positive small intensely fluorescent cells by size, morphology, and staining intensity.

Nodose and petrosal ganglia of adult rats exhibited TyrOHase catalytic activity, linear with respect to tissue concentration over a 10 -fold range, indicating that the immunoreactive enzyme was functional. Transection of specific ganglionic nerve roots depleted TyrOHase catalytic activity and neuronal immunoreactivity within the petrosal ganglion, suggesting that target organ innervation regulates enzyme levels within ganglion perikarya.

On the basis of intracellular recordings in vivo from somata, L 4 sensory dorsal root ganglion neurons were categorized according to action potential configuration, conduction velocity, and receptive field properties to mechanical stimuli. Methods: Intracellular recordings were made from functionally identified dorsal root ganglion neurons in vivo in the Mosconi and Kruger animal model of peripheral neuropathic pain.

MEP abnormalities were present in one lower limb, but SP abolished in all limbs, in the younger brother. Conclusions: Subclinical involvement of UMNs may be present in patients aﬀected by SBMA. This ﬁnding suggests that the array of neuronal systems whose function may be aﬀected by the pathogenic process of SBMA is larger than it was considered so far. Signiﬁcance: TMS is a sensitive diagnostic tool for the identiﬁcation of UMN dysfunction and {{should be included in the}} diagnostic evaluation of patients with SBMA...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe cell soma {{of primary}} sensory neurons is {{electrically}} excitable, and is invaded by action potentials {{as they pass}} from the peripheral nerve, past the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and toward the spinal cord. However, there are virtually no synapses in the DRG, and no signal processing is known to occur there. Why, then, are DRG cell somata excitable? We have constructed and validated an explicit model of the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> {{and used it to}} explore the role of electrical excitability of the cell soma in afferent signaling. Reduction and even elimination of soma excitability proved to have no detectable effect on the reliability of spike conduction past the DRG and into the spinal cord. Through-conduction is affected, however, by major changes in neuronal geometry in the region of the t-junction. In contrast to through-conduction, excitability of the soma and initial segment is essential for the invasion of afferent spikes into the cell soma. This implies that soma invasion has a previously unrecognized role in the physiology of afferent neurons, perhaps in the realm of metabolic coupling of the biosynthesis of signaling molecules required at the axon ends to functional demand, or in cell-cell interaction within sensory ganglia. Spike invasion of the soma in central nervous system neurons may play similar roles...|$|E
40|$|Background: The complex {{neuronal}} circuitry of the {{dorsal horn}} of {{the spinal cord}} is as yet poorly understood. However, defining the circuits underlying the transmission of information from primary afferents to higher levels is critical {{to our understanding of}} sensory processing. In this study, we have examined phosphodiesterase 1 C (Pde 1 c) BAC transgenic mice in which a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene reflects Pde 1 c expression in <b>sensory</b> <b>neuron</b> subpopulations in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord. Results: Using double labeling immunofluorescence, we demonstrate GFP expression in specific subpopulations of <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> and a distinct neuronal expression pattern within the spinal cord dorsal horn. In the dorsal root ganglia, their distribution is restricted to those subpopulations of <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> that give rise to unmyelinated C fibers (neurofilament 200 negative). A small proportion of both non-peptidergic (IB 4 -binding) and peptidergic (CGRP immunoreactive) subclasses expressed GFP. However, GFP expression was more common in the non-peptidergic than the peptidergic subclass. GFP was also expressed in a subpopulation of the <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> immunoreactive for the vanilloid receptor TRPV 1 and the ATP-gated ion channel P 2 X 3. In the spinal cord dorsal horn, GFP positive neurons were largely restricted to lamina I {{and to a lesser extent}} lamina II, but surprisingly did not coexpress markers for key neuronal populations present in the superficial dorsal horn. Conclusion: The expression of GFP in subclasses of nociceptors and also in dorsal horn regions densely innervated by nociceptors suggests that Pde 1 c marks a unique subpopulation of nociceptive <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Calbindin and calretinin are two {{homologous}} calcium-binding {{proteins that}} are expressed by subpopulations of <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons.</b> In the present work, we {{have studied the}} distribution of the neurons expressing calbindin and calretinin in dorsal root ganglia of the rat and their peripheral projections. Calbindin and calretinin immunoreactivities were expressed by subpopulations of large- and small-sized <b>primary</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neurons</b> and colocalized in a majority of large-sized ones. The axons emerging from calbindin- or calretinin-immunoreactive neurons innervated muscle spindles, Pacini corpuscles and subepidermal lamellar corpuscles in the glabrous skin, formed palisades of lanceolate endings around hairs and vibrissae, and gave rise to intraepidermal nerve endings in the digital skin. Since most of these afferents are considered as rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors, it is concluded that calbindin- or calretinin-expressing neurons innervate particular mechanoreceptors that display physiological characteristics of rapid adaptation to stimuli...|$|R
