25|$|Further bomb alerts {{were issued}} {{across the region}} and two similar devices {{discovered}} on trains, at York Road railway station in Belfast and at Greenisland railway station. Both were removed safely and control detonated. The devices were simple incendiary bombs similar to that which exploded south of Befast, consisting of a 5lb block of explosives attached to a <b>petrol</b> <b>can</b> with a simple time device intended to delay the explosion until the train was empty that evening. Later testimony indicated that Delaney had armed {{the first of two}} bombs and placed it beside him as he picked up the second one. As he armed this device, the first bomb suddenly detonated for reasons that remain unknown. Delaney was killed instantly and his accomplice, Patrick Joseph Flynn, was forced to leap from the train in flames. Flynn was guarded by police in hospital and arrested once his wounds had healed sufficiently.|$|E

Đức [...] emerged from the car along with two other monks. One placed a cushion on the road while the second opened the trunk and took out a five-gallon <b>petrol</b> <b>can.</b> As the marchers formed a circle around him, Đức calmly sat down in the traditional Buddhist meditative lotus position on the cushion. A colleague emptied the contents of the petrol container over Đức's head. Đức rotated a string of wooden prayer beads and recited the words [...] ("Homage to Amitābha Buddha") before striking a match and dropping it on himself. Flames consumed his robes and flesh, and black oily smoke emanated from his burning body.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is worth}} {{comparing}} contemporary directly fueled petrol engines with direct-injection diesel engines. <b>Petrol</b> <b>can</b> burn faster than diesel fuel, allowing higher maximum engine speeds and thus greater maximum power for sporting engines. Diesel fuel, {{on the other}} hand, has a higher energy density, and in combination with higher combustion pressures can deliver very strong torque and high thermodynamic efficiency for more [...] "normal" [...] road vehicles.|$|E

The car park is a graveyard of derelict cars, suggesting that she and Tom are not the first victims.|$|E
50|$|In this written confession, Rouse {{stated that}} as he had driven his {{intended}} victim to the Midlands, he had encouraged him to drink from the bottle of whisky he had purchased in order to inebriate him before turning onto Hardingstone Lane.

5|$|<b>Petrol</b> <b>cans</b> {{were stacked}} {{along the sides}} of {{existing}} revetted trenches near El Alamein railway station. It was found by experiment that when they were hidden in the shadows in that way, they were invisible from the air and so 2000 tons of petrol were thus stored. Over 100,000 four-gallon petrol tins were stacked in the 100 stone-faced slit trenches.|$|R

50|$|In September 2012, the {{settlements}} near Fochville {{fell victim to}} some ethnic violence in which shacks were razed and burned to the ground, and four people were killed along with six injured. Apparently, the conflict was waged between two rival factions following a dispute over boundaries, making the violence a turf war. The weapons used were knobkierries, <b>petrol</b> <b>cans,</b> and traditional spears and daggers.|$|R

As the cat reactively jumps up from the fire and hits his head on top a open fence railing, Tweety decides to help the cat by using a hose and putting the fire. However, when he fires the hose (by now wearing a firefighter's hat) it turns out that it happens to be {{connected}} to a gas (<b>petrol)</b> <b>can,</b> and gasoline goes into the cat's mouth, causing him to explode. Tweety then says, [...] "Oh, the poor putty tat got hot as a firecracker." [...] (With a suspenseful drum roll.) [...] "He blew up and go... boom." ...|$|E

50|$|Waste {{collection}} considerations include {{type and}} size of bins, positioning of the bins, and how often bins are to be serviced. Overfilled bins result in rubbish falling out while being tipped. Hazardous rubbish like empty <b>petrol</b> <b>cans</b> can cause fires igniting other trash when the truck compactor is operating. Bins may be locked or stored in secure areas to avoid having non-paying parties placing rubbish in the bin. The cost of old waste is also a concern in collection of waste across the globe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{incident}} occurred at approximately 11:00am local time, when a dissatisfied customer {{of the local}} branch of Territory Insurance pushed a shopping trolley loaded with <b>petrol</b> <b>cans,</b> and fireworks into the building.

50|$|The Irish troops {{held out}} for six days before {{they ran out of}} bullets and {{drinking}} water. When precious water finally reached them, it came in old <b>petrol</b> <b>cans</b> which hadn't been cleaned, making it undrinkable. They inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy force, but miraculously had suffered no fatalities themselves. After their surrender, they spent just over one month in captivity, unsure of their fate, and when they arrived back in Ireland, they were dismayed and deeply hurt to learn that the UN and their own government were anxious to sweep the entire sorry episode under the carpet.|$|R
50|$|It was {{produced}} between 1997 and 2005 and {{is named after}} a place, the Bouche du Roi in Benin from which African slaves were transported to the Caribbean and Americas. In a wider context, it is primarily a warning against all kinds of human greed, exploitation and enslavement, both historical and contemporary. It is made {{from a combination of}} materials, including <b>petrol</b> <b>cans</b> (inflated to hold more), spices, and audio and visual elements (e.g. a recitation of Yoruba, Mahi and Wémé names from beneath the masks, the terrible sounds of a slave ship, and a video of black market petrol-runners in modern Bénin). The artwork’s arrangement recalls the famous 18th-century print of the slave ship, the Brookes. 304 ‘masks’ are made from these <b>petrol</b> <b>cans,</b> each with an open mouth, eyes and a nose, mirroring the Brookes images, yet gives back individuality and African cultures to the slaves by including tokens of African gods (Vodou or orisha) attached to each 'face'. Two masks at the stern of the ship - with the scales of justice between them - represent the white king imposed on Benin and the native king of Benin, dealing with African and European culpability for the trade. Liquor bottles, beads and cowrie shells are also included as examples of material which was used to barter for slaves, as are tobacco and spices, their smells mixed with those of a slave ship.|$|R
5000|$|Matthews final {{episode is}} a {{showdown}} of revenge against his enemy Steve Owen, the real culprit {{of the murder}} Matthew was framed for. Absolom described the episode as tough and intense. Two versions of the episode were filmed after the BBC decided that the initial version was too violent. In the broadcast version, Matthew holds Steve hostage at gunpoint and terrorises him with mind games, threatening to kill him and forcing Steve to beg for his life. Finally, Matthew empties a <b>petrol</b> <b>can</b> {{and pulls out a}} lighter, but in a final twist he reveals that the can is only filled with water." [...] After humiliating Steve, Matthew departs. Of his leaving storyline, Absolom said, [...] "I wanted it to be a totally blow-your-mind storyline. This is why I knew it was the right time to move on. I really felt I couldnt top recent scenes and wanted {{to go out on a}} high and be remembered for work that Im proud of." ...|$|E
50|$|Things take a {{turn for}} the worse when Tom discovers he has a brain tumour but keeps this from Sharon who proposes to him when they swap roles for a day. Worried about his health, he ends the relationship, {{claiming}} it was all just a 'bit of fun'. Sharon knows there is something wrong with Tom and insists that he tell her what's wrong so he admits that he is ill but doesn't want Sharon to be his nurse. As Tom crumbles, Sharon promises that she will be there for him until the end. They plan to travel around the world but Tom decides to spend his last days in Walford and proposes to Sharon using her father's signet ring.

5000|$|Tamara is {{introduced}} during a storyline in which Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes) is kidnapped by Kyle Braxton (Nic Westaway) {{and left for}} dead in the Australian desert. Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) and Natalie Davison (Catherine Mack) also feature in the storyline. In an interview with Kylie Gillies on The Morning Show, Westaway said that the episodes are action packed and Peacocke added that there were helicopters, stunt men and an explosion carried out on set. Executive producer Lucy Addario told Miller that such a stunt could only be filmed in a remote location in the outback. Younes told Erin Miller of TV Week that halfway through his ordeal a [...] "mystery woman" [...] appears and he is unsure if she wants Casey or Kyle. Mack added that [...] "we really don't know anything about her the whole time". However, it soon becomes apparent that Tamara is an ally and gives Casey water. Kyle, who left Casey for dead, returns to the scene after Brax's car chases him. He recaptures Tamara and Casey. She throws a flaming <b>petrol</b> <b>can</b> at Kyle, causing an explosion, and then attempts to shoot him. Brax and Natalie locate them, bringing the ordeal to an end.|$|E
500|$|Bertram {{consisted}} both {{in creating}} the appearance of army units where none existed, and in concealing armour, artillery and materiel. Dummy tanks and guns were made mainly of local materials including calico and palm-frond hurdles. Real tanks were disguised as trucks, using light [...] "Sunshield" [...] canopies. Field guns and their limbers were also disguised as trucks, their real wheels visible, under a simple box-shaped [...] "Cannibal" [...] canopy to give {{the shape of a}} truck. <b>Petrol</b> <b>cans</b> were stacked along the sides of existing revetted trenches, hidden in the shadows. Food was stacked in piles of boxes, and draped with camouflage nets, to resemble trucks.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as working}} on the dummy army in the south, Ayrton led the work to hide the real army in the north, devising the methods used to hide the army's fuel, food, and ammunition. The petrol, held in fragile and leaky 4-gallon cans, was stacked in {{existing}} slit trenches. These were revetted with masonry, casting sharp shadows. A single wall of <b>petrol</b> <b>cans</b> against the real wall was undetectable from the air. With the real stores invisible in the north, and the dummy stores very visible in the south, Ayrton had made Eighth Army seem to be far {{to the south of}} where it actually was.|$|R
50|$|The {{violence}} {{spread to}} the country's second largest city, Kandy, on 26 July. By 2:45 p.m. Delta Pharmacy on Peradeniya Road was on fire.
