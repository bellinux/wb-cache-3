As {{workflow}} technology {{evolves into}} the grid domain, workflow process {{becomes more and}} more complex, raising a great challenge both to workflow modeling and workflow execution.

Such a goal-driven workflow management paradigm could not only enhance the flexibility and adaptability of workflow system but also ease the heavy burden of workflow definition...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{semi-automatic}} {{solution to the}} problem of customized 3 -D shape modeling using a rule based system. The solution is illustrated with the use case of hearing aid manufacturing. The current process of manufacturing customized hearing aids consists of many manual steps, all of which require expert knowledge. The idea is to translate this expert knowledge into machine readable rules using a <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>representation.</b> Together with a set of anatomical features detected on the ear impression, the necessary surface shaping operations are defined and applied. The advantage of this approach is its high flexibility and customisability. It yields better consistency, efficiency and reproducibility of the resulting device.

The approach also provides a mechanism for reasoning about the use of this knowledge, thus enabling the system to choose effectively between alternative courses of action...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{proliferation}} of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has made computerization increasingly useful to clinicians.

40|$|Context: Detection of {{outbreaks}} of {{infection in the}} hospital typically requires daily manual review of microbiology laboratory test results. This process is time-consuming, tedious, prone to error and may miss trends in infection. A standard formalism for <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>representation,</b> the Arden Syntax, provides a vehicle for implementing algorithms for detecting such infections. Objective: To design and implement a computer-based system for detection of concerning patterns of infection or antibiotic resistance. Setting: Computer-based event monitor and central patient data repository at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC). Results: We designed a two-phase system, including initial filtering of individual patient laboratory results by Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules (MLMs) and subsequent aggregation and analysis across patients and locations using a statistical monitor. Preliminary data for the filtration phase demonstrate a 94. 8 % reduction in the volume of messages that {{must be considered in}} surveillance. Conclusions: Filtering raw laboratory results using a standard formalism eases the process of aggregating data across patients and sites as well as detecting trends in infection.

40|$|Abstract: Procedural {{knowledge}} {{is used by}} experts for complex system control. In this article, {{the notion of a}} complex system is taken in a broad sense. It might be a patient cured by a physician specialist, a biotechnological device, a department of some business enterprise etc. The GLIF model was designed in collaboration of American universities for the formalization of medical guidelines, but it can be used for formal representation of any procedural knowledge. The main objective of the GLIF model was to enable computer processing and comparing of medical guidelines. In this, article also a more sophisticated use of <b>procedural</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>representation</b> by the means of the GLIF model is proposed. The provided data about expert actions are stored into the database, the formalized knowledge represented by the GLIF model can be used for building up sophisticated reminder systems that warn the user if he decides to make an impropriate action. Different kinds of warnings in the reminder system are proposed and their properties are discussed. At the end, also the possibility of using the GLIF model for decision support is discussed.

This scheme uses both <b>procedural</b> and declarative <b>knowledge</b> <b>representation</b> formalisms through the application of relational database. So the rule base and case base formats have been converted into tables.

Also assign the first attribute of table to be a cause of a case and the reset of attributes as the assertions of a case. In this study, all the algorithms, for creating, indexing and checking the availability of a rule and a case, are present.
