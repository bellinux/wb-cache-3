2500|$|One of Shure's most {{visually}} iconic microphone {{series is}} the Unidyne series, seen in use by {{heads of state}} and popular recording artists and performers from the 1940s {{through the end of}} the twentieth century, including President John F. Kennedy, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra. The Model 55 Unidyne is pictured with Harry S. Truman in the famous photograph where he is holding the Chicago Tribune newspaper with the erroneous front page headline [...] "Dewey Defeats Truman." [...] It is also pictured in front of Fidel Castro on the cover of the January 19, 1959 issue of Life magazine and in front of Martin Luther King, Jr. delivering of his I Have a Dream speech during the 1963 March on Washington. The original Shure 55 Unidyne microphone was designed by engineer Ben Bauer and first produced in 1939. Shure designed the 55 Unidyne as a rugged <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>microphone</b> with good audio performance. It was notable for its single-element, unidirectional design, which was smaller, less susceptible to feedback, and less sensitive to ambient noise than other microphones of the time. Several variants of the original Unidyne have been produced, most notably the 55S or [...] "Baby Unidyne." [...] The 55S is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Elvis mic" [...] due to its frequent use by Elvis Presley, and is the microphone depicted with Elvis on the commemorative first-class Elvis stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service in 1993. In 2008, the Unidyne Model 55 microphone was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, and the following year, Shure released the 55SH Series II. A supercardioid version, the Super 55 Deluxe Vocal Microphone, was introduced in 2009, featuring high gain before feedback and excellent off-axis rejection and further extending Unidyne's 70-plus year legacy. The 55 Series microphones were given the [...] "IEEE Milestone" [...] award in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|The opening {{exhibition}} {{game was played}} against the Lady Chaps from Lubbock Christian University. The Huskies trailed early, but got untracked quickly, behind 25 points from Stewart, and cruised to a 95-39 win. After the game, Auriemma went to the <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>microphone</b> to praise both the team and the fans who made the trip, saying [...] "Their fans were great. That’s a long {{way for them to}} travel, and they did. It was way better than a lot of {{exhibition game}}s we’ve had." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Ellen made {{television}} {{history when}} {{the title character}} came out as a lesbian in the famous [...] "Puppy Episode" [...] (DeGeneres herself came out concurrent with the episode on The Oprah Winfrey Show and in Time). To ensure a memorable moment, the coming out scene {{was made into a}} gag where, at an airport, Ellen turns and tells Laura Dern's character [...] "I'm gay!" [...] - only to realize that she had turned right into the <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>microphone,</b> announcing her sexuality to the entire terminal. Ellen DeGeneres's mother Betty can briefly be seen as one {{of the people in the}} terminal with a shocked reaction to the announcement.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1970s, Faust [...] - [...] {{along with}} announcers Harry Caray and Jimmy Piersall, plus Andy the Clown [...] - [...] became great crowd {{favorites}} at Comiskey Park. Usually, when fans think of Caray singing [...] "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" [...] {{they think of}} the Chicago Cubs, but many remember that it was Faust, whose arrangement got Caray so inspired he would bellow the song out loud to himself, who inaugurated this tradition. Owner Bill Veeck put a <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>microphone</b> on Caray, turning him into a cultural icon. Caray later moved from Comiskey to the Wrigley Field press box, taking the tradition with him.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ornamental}} {{design of the}} car body featured standee windows separated by a heavy brace from the lower windows. This {{was due to the}} influence of noted industrial designer Otto Kuhler (US patent Des.153,367), and featured as part of a bid by the American Car and Foundry Company in 1947. The cars also implemented new technology in several areas. [...] "Precipitron" [...] lamps were included, designed to combat airborne bacteria. Forced air ventilation was introduced as ceiling vents circulated fresh air in from outside each car, while removing stale air. Electric door motors were used for the first time, replacing the standard compressed air engines which had served on much of the older equipment. However, these cars were also built with outside door operating apparatus or controls along with an exterior mounted <b>Public</b> <b>Address</b> <b>microphone</b> system. Lastly, drum brakes were installed instead of conventional tread brakes.|$|E
50|$|Bishop {{regained his}} place in the Chester side and became the first Chester player to score at the Deva Stadium, albeit with a late {{consolation}} in a 2-1 defeat to Stockport County on 25 August 1992. Over the next three years he had spells {{in and out of the}} side, before a potent start to the 1995-96 season saw him score in the opening five games of the season. He added three more before the end of October, but he was ruled out through injury for the remainder of the season. Bishop (now playing part-time) was released at the end of the season, with his final Football League appearance having been as a substitute in a 3-1 win at Rochdale on 31 October 1995. The season also saw him involved in an unusual incident when out injured during Chester's home win over Hereford United, when he grabbed hold of the <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>microphone</b> to criticise the referee as he turned down a Chester penalty appeal.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{feedback}} {{is used in}} digital electronics to force voltages away from intermediate voltages into 0 and 1 states. On the other hand, thermal runaway is a positive feedback that can destroy semiconductor junctions. Positive feedback in chemical reactions can increase the rate of reactions, {{and in some cases}} can lead to explosions. Positive feedback in mechanical design causes tipping-point, or over-centre, mechanisms to snap into position, for example in switches and locking pliers. Out of control, it can cause bridges to collapse. Positive feedback in economic systems can cause boom-then-bust cycles. A familiar example of positive {{feedback is}} the loud squealing or howling sound produced by audio feedback in <b>public</b> <b>address</b> systems: the <b>microphone</b> picks up sound from its own loudspeakers, amplifies it, and sends it through the speakers again.|$|R

50|$|Competing in the eight-team Super League against Serbian clubs {{from the}} Adriatic League (Red Star, Partizan, Mega, and Radnički Kragujevac) as well its three First League competitors, FMP managed a 5-9 record {{that was good}} enough for 5th spot, just outside a playoff berth. Due to FMP's {{association}} with Red Star and Gurović's personal past with Partizan fans as well as FMP's cup win earlier in the season, both of FMP's Super League games against Partizan were especially memorable. The teams met again on 2 June 2014 in Hala sportova with FMP leading throughout the nervy contest and building a 17-point lead heading into the final quarter before Partizan shifted into a higher gear and out shot their opposition 34-13 in the fourth quarter for an 86-82 win. Gurović was targeted throughout the match by Partizan fans and the arena erupted when he pushed Boris Dallo, a move that resulted in an automatic ejection from the sidelines as Partizan coach Duško Vujošević even took to the <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>microphone,</b> imploring home fans to calm down.|$|E
5000|$|Kroc {{retired from}} running McDonalds in 1974. While {{he was looking}} for new jobs, he decided to get back into baseball, his lifelong {{favorite}} sport, when he learned that the San Diego Padres were for sale. The team had been conditionally sold to Joseph Danzansky, a Washington, D.C. grocery-chain owner, who planned to move the Padres to Washington. However, the sale was tied up in lawsuits when Kroc purchased the team for $12 million, keeping the team in San Diego. In Kroc's first year of ownership in 1974, the Padres lost 102 games, yet drew over one million in attendance, the standard of box office success in the major leagues during that era. Their previous top attendance was 644,772 in 1972. The San Diego Union said Kroc was [...] "above all, a fan of his team". On April 9, 1974, while the Padres were on the brink of losing a 9-5 decision to the Houston Astros in the season opener at San Diego Stadium, Kroc took the <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>microphone</b> in front of 39,083 fans."I’ve never seen such stupid ballplaying in my life," [...] he said. The crowd cheered in approval. In 1979, Kroc's public interest in future free agent players Graig Nettles and Joe Morgan drew a $100,000 fine from Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. Frustrated with the team, he handed over operations of the team to his son-in-law, Ballard Smith. [...] "There's more future in hamburgers than baseball," [...] Kroc said.|$|E

40|$|In many <b>public</b> areas, <b>public</b> <b>address</b> systems play {{a central}} role in {{broadcasting}} important messages. Consider e. g., air-ports or train stations. The intelligibility of messages broad-cast by such <b>public</b> <b>address</b> systems gets reduced due to en-vironmental noise sources. Usually, these systems therefore employ a pre-processing module to modify the original mes-sage such that its intelligibility in the noisy environment is increased. Most of the pre-processing methods for intelli-gibility improvement require an estimate of the environmen-tal noise PSD. However, existing noise PSD estimators over-estimate the noise PSD in reverberant environments, leading to an overamplification of the speech by the speech intelli-gibility pre-processing module. In this paper, we propose a new MMSE-based noise PSD estimator that can be utilized in <b>public</b> <b>address</b> systems considering reverberation.
