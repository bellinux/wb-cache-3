40|$|Levels of Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn were {{assessed}} by using Posidonia oceanica as a bioindicator in the Gulf of Naples (southern Italy). Lepidochronology, which enables retroactive <b>dating</b> of <b>scales</b> and rhizomes of this seagrass, was combined with atomic spectrometry to assess temporal trends of trace elements in <b>dated</b> <b>scales</b> and rhizomes over a 10 -year period. Lepidochronology occasionally {{has been used}} to monitor Hg in <b>dated</b> <b>scales,</b> but never {{has been used to}} determine concentrations of other trace elements in dated rhizomes. Data were compared between various structural parts of seagrass and between sampling sites. Concentrations of some elements found in <b>dated</b> <b>scales</b> or rhizomes showed a similar trend in most of the sites; increasing for Hg and Cu and decreasing for Pb, Fe, and Zn. Contaminant levels indicated by seagrass meadows varied from metal to metal. Concentrations of Hg, Cd, and Pb fell within the ranges measured in other areas considered to have low levels of heavy metal pollution, whereas Cu, Mn, and Zn had higher concentrations only in some years. However, on the basis of other studies, none of the sampling sites are considered to have high contamination levels...|$|R

50|$|Human Era proponents {{claim that}} it makes for easier geological, archaeological, dendrochronological and {{historical}} dating, {{as well as that}} it bases its epoch on an event more universally relevant than the birth of Jesus. All key dates in human history can then be listed using a simple increasing <b>date</b> <b>scale</b> with smaller <b>dates</b> always occurring before larger dates. Another gain is that the Holocene Era starts before the other calendar eras. So it could be useful for the comparison and conversion of dates from different calendars.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For decades, {{computing}} the LZ factorization (or LZ 77 pars-ing) of {{a string}} has been a requisite and computationally intensive step in many diverse applications, including text indexing and data compres-sion. Many algorithms for LZ 77 parsing have been discovered over the years; however, despite the increasing need to apply LZ 77 to massive data sets, no algorithm to <b>date</b> <b>scales</b> to inputs that exceed the size of internal memory. In this paper we describe the first algorithm for com-puting the LZ 77 parsing in external memory. Our algorithm is fast in practice and will allow {{the next generation of}} text indexes to be realised for massive strings and string collections. ...|$|R

The total amount of interviewees reached through the above mentioned methodologies is 73 persons.

40|$|Nostalgia {{evoked by}} brands {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of contemporary marketing theory and practice. To <b>date,</b> <b>scales</b> have been developed to measure the propensity to be nostalgic as an individual difference but little {{attention has been paid to}} measure consumers’ perceptions of the nostalgia aroused by brands. Moreover, prior research has focused on personal nostalgia even though brands are likely to evoke both personal and historical memories. This article outlines a research project designed to conceptualize, develop, and validate a new 14 -item scale to measure brand nostalgia. Results from our studies show that this construct comprises three inter-related dimensions: personal memories and feelings, perceived brand oldness and historical memories. Results indicate that our multi-dimensional scale is valid and shows a high degree of reliability and validity...|$|R

40|$|A Landsat scene {{simulation}} capability {{was developed}} to {{study the effects of}} small fields and misregistration on Landsat-based crop proportion estimation procedures. The simulation employs a pattern of ground polygons each with a crop ID, planting <b>date,</b> and <b>scale</b> factor. Historical greenness/brightness crop development profiles generate the mean signal values for each polygon. Historical within-field covariances add texture to pixels in each polygon. The planting <b>dates</b> and <b>scale</b> factors create between-field/within-crop variation. Between field and crop variation is achieved by the above and crop profile differences. The Landsat point spread function is used to add correlation between nearby pixels. The next effect of the point spread function is to blur the image. Mixed pixels and misregistration are also simulated. Previously announced in STAR as N 82 - 3281...|$|R
40|$|Survival {{analysis}} problems often involve dual timescales, {{most commonly}} calendar date and lifetime, {{the latter being}} the elapsed time since an initiating event such as a heart transplant. In our main example {{attention is focused on}} the hazard rate of 'death' as a function of calendar date. Three different estimates are discussed, one each from proportional hazards analyses on the lifetime and the calendar <b>date</b> <b>scales,</b> and one from a symmetric approach called here the 'two-way proportional hazards model', a multiplicative hazards model going back to Lexis in the 1870 s. The three are connected through a Poisson generalized linear model for the Lexis diagram. The two-way model is shown to combine the information from the two 'one-way' proportional hazards analyses efficiently, at the cost of more extensive parametric modelling.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to assess gender differences in sexual expectations, and the amount and frequency of intimacy among Framingham State University students. Participants included undergraduate students (n = 70), 39 women and 31 men. Participants completed the First <b>Date</b> Expectations <b>Scale,</b> First <b>Date</b> Behavior <b>Scale,</b> Bill Pay Scale; and finally; the Miller Social Intimacy 2 ̆ 7 Scale (MSIS), as well as basic demographics. Results yielded significant differences in men and women 2 ̆ 7 s first date expectations for sexual activity. These findings suggest men have higher expectations for sexual activity on first dates than do women. Results also indicated a statistically significant relationship between the amount and frequency of social intimacy; higher amounts of social intimacy were associated with higher frequencies of social intimacy. Women reported higher levels of social intimacy and greater frequencies of social intimacy than men...|$|R
