50|$|Sometimes a {{specially}} designed <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer</b> is connected between the PFN and load. This technique improves the impedance match between the PFN and the load so as to improve power transfer efficiency. A <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer</b> is typically required when driving higher impedance devices such as klystrons or magnetrons from a PFN. Because the PFN is charged over a relatively long time and then discharged over a very short time, the output pulse may have a peak power of megawatts or even terawatts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimal design procedure for <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers</b> fed by power converters for supplying pulsed current magnets in particle accelerators. Usually their volume must be minimized because of limited space {{available in the}} accelerator tunnel.

5000|$|The main {{components}} that comprised START included the support structure, <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer,</b> vacuum tank, toroidal and poloidal field coils, and a limiter. The support structure positioned {{and supported the}} vacuum tank which also shared the same spherical center as the large <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer.</b> The main role of the <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer</b> was to provide the current for the toroidal field coils which was supplied through fifteen irons cores that were spirally wound from a [...]03 millimeter iron strip. The toroidal field coil was a central conductor made of copper on the axis of the vacuum tank, and {{was attached to the}} vacuum tank through copper limbs covered by insulated clamps. START had six poloidal field coils within the vacuum tank and were encased in 3 millimeter stainless steel cases. The poloidal coils were supported {{from the base of the}} tank and each could be adjusted as necessary. The vacuum tank was the primary vessel where experiments take place; it was cylindrical in shape and was divided into three sections. The tank offered numerous ports for the attachment of pumps and diagnostics. A graphite limiter was positioned around the central stainless steel tube and this provided a simple way to measure the innermost edge of the plasma during experiments.|$|E

50|$|The {{product of}} the peak pulse voltage and the {{duration}} of the pulse (or more accurately, the voltage-time integral) is often used to characterise <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers.</b> Generally speaking, the larger this product, the larger and more expensive the transformer.|$|R
40|$|An {{induction}} {{system comprises an}} array of single turn <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers.</b> Ferromagnetic cores of transformers are toroids that are stacked along the longitudinal core axis. Another name for this array is a fraction transformer or an adder. The primary and secondary windings of such a design have one turn. The step up mode {{is based on the}} number of primary pulse sources. The secondary windings are connected in series. Performances of such a system for the nanosecond range mode operation are different in comparison to the performances of traditional multi-turn <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers,</b> which are working on a 100 + nanosecond mode operation. In this paper, the author discusses which aspects are necessary to take into account for the high power nanosecond fractional transformer designs. The engineering method of the nanosecond {{induction system}} design is presented...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the results}} on the {{influence}} of tensile stresses during rapid heating of ribbons, the values of stresses necessary to minimize core remagnetization loss were obtained; they are important for manufacturing technology of small nanocrystalline magnetic cores with linear DC bias immune remagnetization loop, in particular for the production of <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers</b> broadband telecommunication systems.|$|R
50|$|When {{it comes}} to the {{components}} involved in this circuit, specific types of each component are needed to have it work to its full potential. The transformer is a vital component. For example, a <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer</b> creates rectangular pulses, which are characterized by fast rise and fall times with a flat top. There are a seemingly endless number of combinations of voltages, transformers, capacitors, transistors and resistors {{that can be used to}} vary and model the circuit.|$|E
50|$|Alternative A {{transports}} {{power on}} the same wires as data for 10 and 100 Mbit/s. This {{is similar to the}} phantom power technique commonly used for powering condenser microphones. Power may be transmitted on the data conductors by applying a common voltage to each pair. Because twisted-pair Ethernet uses differential signaling, this does not interfere with data transmission. The common mode voltage is easily extracted using the center tap of the standard Ethernet <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer.</b> For Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T) and faster, all four pairs are used for data transmission, so both Alternatives A and B transport power on wire pairs used for data.|$|E
50|$|To {{minimize}} {{distortion of}} the pulse shape, a <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer</b> needs to have low values of leakage inductance and distributed capacitance, and a high open-circuit inductance. In power-type pulse transformers, a low coupling capacitance (between the primary and secondary) is important to protect the circuitry on the primary side from high-powered transients created by the load. For the same reason, high insulation resistance and high breakdown voltage are required. A good transient response is necessary to maintain the rectangular pulse shape at the secondary, because a pulse with slow edges would create switching losses in the power semiconductors.|$|E
40|$|NICHICON (KUSATSU) CORPORATION and KEK have {{developed}} a novel long-pulse klystron modulator for both of single-beam tube (136 kVp* 100 A) and multi-beam tube (120 kVp* 140 A). The main features are;- crowbar-less system with optimized IGBT snubber circuit,- compact and highly reliable Self-Healing capacitors,- HV & LV twin <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers</b> of laminated steel core for reduced tank volume...|$|R
40|$|Quality-control {{testing of}} <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers</b> is speeded up by method for {{determining}} rise time and droop. Instead of using oscilloscope and square-wave generator to measure these characteristics directly, method uses voltmeter and sine-wave generator to measure them indirectly in about one-tenth time. Droop and rise time {{are determined by}} measuring input/output voltage ratio at just four frequencies...|$|R
50|$|With the {{increasing}} trend towards digital processing and transmission of audio signals, {{the full range}} of isolation by small <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers,</b> optocouplers or fibre optics become more useful. Standard protocols such as S/PDIF, AES3 or TOSLINK are available in relatively inexpensive equipment and allow full isolation, so ground loops need not arise, especially when connecting between audio systems and computers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pulse</b> <b>{{transformer}}</b> is {{a transformer}} that is optimised for transmitting rectangular electrical pulses (that is, pulses with fast {{rise and fall}} times and a relatively constant amplitude). Small versions called signal types are used in digital logic and telecommunications circuits, often for matching logic drivers to transmission lines. Medium-sized power versions are used in power-control circuits such as camera flash controllers. Larger power versions {{are used in the}} electrical power distribution industry to interface low-voltage control circuitry to the high-voltage gates of power semiconductors. Special high voltage pulse transformers are also used to generate high power pulses for radar, particle accelerators, or other high energy pulsed power applications.|$|E
5000|$|On April 24, Langmuir and I {{were running}} {{the machine and}} as usual were trying to push the {{electron}} gun and its associated <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer</b> to the limit. Some intermittent sparking had occurred and we asked the technician to observe with a mirror around the protective concrete wall. He immediately signaled {{to turn off the}} synchrotron as [...] "he saw an arc in the tube." [...] The vacuum was still excellent, so Langmuir and I came {{to the end of the}} wall and observed. At first we thought it might be due to Cherenkov radiation, but it soon became clearer that we were seeing Ivanenko and Pomeranchuk radiation.|$|E
50|$|Electroshock {{weapons and}} tasers have a DC/AC {{inverter}} to generate several {{tens of thousands}} of V AC out of a small 9 V DC battery. First the 9 V DC is converted to 400-2000 V AC with a compact high frequency transformer, which is then rectified and temporarily stored in a high voltage capacitor until a pre-set threshold voltage is reached. When the threshold (set by way of an airgap or TRIAC) is reached, the capacitor dumps its entire load into a <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer</b> which then steps it up to its final output voltage of 20-60 kV. A variant of the principle is also used in electronic flash and bug zappers, though they rely on a capacitor-based voltage multiplier to achieve their high voltage.|$|E
50|$|MPP cores are {{primarily}} used in inductors {{that require a}} core to have higher saturation point while maintaining other valuable magnetic properties. A standard MPP core saturates at around 7500 Gauss. A ferrite core saturates at around 4500 Gauss. Molypermalloy powder cores are commonly used in the making of: flyback transformers, resonant circuits, quartz filters, loading coils, choke coils, <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers,</b> and other industrial and military circuits.|$|R
30|$|The {{disadvantage}} of these cores is {{the sensitivity of}} the magnetic properties of the ribbon to mechanical stresses arising during core formation [8, 9]. Difficulties arise during production of miniaturized magnetic nanocrystalline cores with transverse anisotropy, particularly for <b>pulse</b> <b>transformers</b> in telecommunication systems. That is why the purpose of the current investigation was to study the influence of mechanical stresses appearing during core fabrication on the transverse magnetic anisotropy that was induced by tensile stress during nanocrystallization process and core loss.|$|R

50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a charging circuit, a triggering circuit and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the charging circuit and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside the charging circuit prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the triggering circuit receives the triggering signal, the triggering circuit stops {{the operation of the}} charging circuit, allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a CD ignition, the ignition coil acts as a <b>pulse</b> <b>transformer</b> rather than an energy storage medium as it does in an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the CD ignition. Voltages exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial. When there's no triggering signal, the charging circuit is re-connected to charge the capacitor.|$|E
