40|$|Background: Although <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> {{care are}} common proxies {{for health care}} quality, their {{associations}} with medical outcomes remain uncertain. Methods: For 2076 patients hospitalized with pneumonia from 32 emergency departments, we used multilevel logistic regression modeling to assess independent associations between patient outcomes and the performance <b>of</b> 4 individual <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> care (assessment of oxygenation, blood cultures, and rapid initiation [< 4 hours] and appropriate selection of antibiotic therapy) and the cumulative number <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> care performed. Results: Overall, 141 patients (6. 8 %) died. Mortality was 0. 3 % to 1. 7 % lower for patients who had each <b>of</b> the individual <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> care performed (P <. 13 for each comparison); mortality was 7. 5 % for patients who had 0 to 2 <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> care, 7. 2 % for those with 3 <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> care, and 5. 8 % for those with all 4 <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> care performed (P =. 39). Mortality was not significantly associated with either individual or cumulative process measures in multivariable models. Conclusion: Neither the individual <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> care nor the cumulative number performed is associated with short-term mortality for pneumonia. ©...|$|R

The theories that are used in this research are the Jacobs and Rosenbaum?s, Elgin?s, and Akmajian and Henry?s theories. The writer chooses {{to analyze the}} Transformational <b>Processes</b> <b>of</b> Deletion in the Headline as her study since headlines should be made as simple as possible. Therefore, the Transformational <b>Processes</b> <b>of</b> Deletion often occurs in the headline. Beside that, the writer describes the frequency of the occurrences each kind of deletion. The writer selects Headlines of Time Magazines of March 6 th 2006, April 10 th 2006, and May 8 th 2006 editions as her sources of data to find out the Transformational <b>Processes</b> <b>of</b> Deletion. To collect the data, the writer uses a descriptive qualitative approach. In collecting the data, the writer selects the Headlines from 4 editions of Time Magazines. The Headlines are used as the sources of the data are the Headlines that contain Transformational <b>Processes</b> <b>of</b> Deletion. Furthermore, the data are classified according to Jacobs and Rosenbaum?s theories by examining the deep structure and surface structure. In analyzing the data, the writer describes each type of deletion and counts the frequencies. From the analysis, there are 5 kinds Transformational <b>Processes</b> <b>of</b> Deletion. The Transformational <b>Processes</b> <b>of</b> Noun Phrase and Linking Verb Deletion occur seven times. The Transformational <b>Processes</b> <b>of</b> Noun Phrase Deletion occurs five times.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} use <b>of</b> ontologies in <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> {{collaborative}} learning and knowledge generation. The creation {{and use of}} ontologies is analysed from an activity theoretical perspective {{in order to understand}} <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> shared conceptualization as well as the role <b>of</b> ontologies in <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> change and transformation. Scenarios of ontology-based collaborative learning and knowledge-creation are presented. This work is based on the cultural-historical activity theory, providing a theoretical framework (1) for understanding <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> knowledge-creation which take place when generating and using ontologies and (2) to investigate the dynamic relationship (coupling) between individual learning and the transformation of a community. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{introductory}} {{article to}} this HSR Special Issue presents the emerging field of sociology of quantification, {{which can be}} regarded as a transdisciplinary approach to the analysis <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> quantification. <b>Processes</b> <b>of</b> categorization and classification are included because they can result in <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> generating figures and numbers also. The contribution sketches the science-historical development of this field. It is argued that <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> quantification are related in many ways with other social and socio-economic processes. Therefore, one can speak of a comprehensive political economy of statistics, quantification and categorization. Especially the works of the French statistician and sociologist Alain Desrosières are an innovative and far-reaching groundwork for the analysis of statistics, quantification and categorization. Also, Desrosières has pointed to the fundamental role <b>of</b> conventions for <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> quantification (as for <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> categorization) and he has published important contributions to the French science movement of economics of convention (économie des conventions). At the end of the article, a set of positions for a sociology of quantification are presented...|$|R
