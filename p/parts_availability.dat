40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{development}} of a scalable framework for biodesign automation is a formidable challenge given the ex-pected increase in <b>part</b> <b>availability</b> and the ever-growing complexity of synthetic circuits. To allow for (a) the use of previously constructed and characterized circuits or modules and (b) the implementation of designs that can scale up to hundreds of nodes, we here propose a divide-and-conquer Synthetic Biology Reusable Optimization Methodology (SBROME). An abstract user-defined circuit is first transfor-med and matched against a module database that incorporates circuits that have previously been experimentally characterized. Then the resulting circuit is decomposed to subcircuits that are populated with the set of parts that best approximate the desired function. Finally, all subcircuits are subsequently characterized and deposited back to the module database for future reuse. We successfully applied SBROME toward two alternative designs of a modular 3 -input multiplexer that utilize pre-existing logic gates and characterized biological parts...|$|R

5000|$|The mix of Pontiac {{exterior}} styling on an economical Chevrolet chassis and drivetrain at a {{price point}} marginally higher than Chevrolet, was a huge marketing success for GM of Canada. For decades [...] "full-size" [...] Pontiacs took third place behind Chevrolet and Ford in sales, typically 70,000 plus units annually. In contrast, heavier and bulkier American Pontiacs, with far higher sticker prices and higher operating costs due to large displacement V8s requiring high octane fuel, would have little appeal in the Canadian marketplace {{for a number of}} reasons: a population base one tenth the size of the US, a less stratified society with lower disposable incomes, more prudent spending and savings sensibilities and far higher taxes and gasoline prices. On the manufacturing side, maintaining unique <b>part</b> <b>availability</b> for a low sales vehicle along with import-export tariffs and barriers between the U.S. and Canada would make the sale of American Pontiacs unprofitable in Canada.|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{technical characteristic}} of a part handling and transport system which supports a factory layout of machine tools or an FMS is the required part transport speed from machining-(inspection-, assembly-) station to station. This speed is imposed by the production programme for which the layout has been designed and {{is a function of}} more parameters: number of stations; net production plus part loading-unloading times; buffer capacities; topology; and size scale of the machine layout. It is also dependent on the machine operation scheduling and on the maximum machine utilization requirement. In the paper, a new machine serving methodology is presented and analysed. It takes into account, in addition to the mentioned parameters, the position of the part transport means at each decision step, the <b>part</b> <b>availability</b> for further processing as well as the space availability in the machine buffer storages and evaluates the required minimum part transport speed. This minimum transport speed can then be used as a criterion for the final design of the part handling and transport system. The method is demonstrated and assessed in a case study. © 1992...|$|R
5000|$|A {{reliability}} program plan {{may also}} be used to evaluate and improve availability of a system by the strategy of focusing on increasing testability & maintainability and not on reliability. Improving maintainability is generally easier than improving reliability. Maintainability estimates (repair rates) are also generally more accurate. However, because the uncertainties in the reliability estimates are in most cases very large, they are likely to dominate the availability calculation (prediction uncertainty problem), even when maintainability levels are very high. When reliability is not under control, more complicated issues may arise, like manpower (maintainers / customer service capability) shortages, spare <b>part</b> <b>availability,</b> logistic delays, lack of repair facilities, extensive retro-fit and complex configuration management costs, and others. The problem of unreliability may be increased also due to the [...] "domino effect" [...] of maintenance-induced failures after repairs. Focusing only on maintainability is therefore not enough. If failures are prevented, none of the other issues are of any importance, and therefore reliability is generally regarded as the most important <b>part</b> of <b>availability.</b> Reliability needs to be evaluated and improved related to both availability and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to cost of spare parts, maintenance man-hours, transport costs, storage cost, part obsolete risks, etc. But, as GM and Toyota have belatedly discovered, TCO also includes the downstream liability costs when reliability calculations have not sufficiently or accurately addressed customers' personal bodily risks. Often a trade-off is needed between the two. There might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership. Testability of a system should also be addressed in the plan, as this is the link between reliability and maintainability. The maintenance strategy can influence the reliability of a system (e.g., by preventive and/or predictive maintenance), although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability.|$|R
