50|$|Gibrat's law (sometimes called Gibrat's rule of {{proportionate}} {{growth or}} {{the law of}} proportionate effect) is a rule defined by Robert Gibrat (1904-1980) in 1931 stating that the <b>proportional</b> <b>rate</b> of growth of a firm is independent of its absolute size. The law of proportionate growth {{gives rise to a}} distribution that is log-normal. Gibrat's law is also applied to cities size and growth rate, where proportionate growth process may give rise to a distribution of city sizes that is log-normal, as predicted by Gibrat's law. While the city size distribution is often associated with Zipf's law, this holds only in the upper tail, because empirically the tail of a log-normal distribution cannot be distinguished from Zipf's law. A study using administrative boundaries (places) to define cities finds that the entire distribution of cities, not just the largest ones, is log-normal. But this last claim that the lognormal distribution cannot be rejected {{has been shown to be}} the result of a statistics with little power: the uniformly most powerful unbiased test comparing the lognormal to the power law shows unambiguously that the largest 1000 cities are distinctly in the power law regime.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{effectiveness}} of local tax equalisation across English local authorities since 1981 is evaluated. Two specific aims of equalisation policies are identified. <b>Proportional</b> <b>rate</b> equalisation implies that variations in needs and resources should be neutralised and that tax levels should depend on local spending decisions. Strict rate equalisation implies that local taxes should not exceed the levels specified by central government. The statistical evidence indicates that neither of these aims has been achieved since 1981. The main obstacles to <b>proportional</b> <b>rate</b> equalisation are differences in grant funding and inadequate compensation for variations in needs and resources. The main obstacle to strict rate equalisation is incrementalism in local budgeting. The implications of the planned reforms of local government finance are analysed. It is concluded that equalisation {{may be more effective}} under the new system of local taxes and central grants. ...|$|E

However, spurious matching could be obtained if the response and environmental event were correlated, even if the event did not reinforce the response. To assess the likelihood of obtaining spurious matching when relating attention and problem behavior, we evaluated the problem behavior of 3 participants for whom attention did not serve as a reinforcer for problem behavior in a functional analysis. Both the simple and generalized matching equations were used to examine matching relations extracted from descriptive observations that were conducted in the participants' classrooms. The results of aggregated matching analyses showed that the <b>proportional</b> <b>rate</b> of responding approximately matched the <b>proportional</b> <b>rate</b> of contiguous adult attention.

The {{quantity}} of radioiodine collected by the thy-roid has been determined directly by in vivo meas-urements (Hamilton, Sole- and co-workers [1 - 4]; Hertz and co-workers [5]), and indirectly by estimations from the total quantity excreted in the urine over a fixed period (Hertz and co-workers [5]; Rawson and co-workers [6, 7]). The distribution of iodine in the thyroid has been studied by autoradiograms (3) or by chemical analysis of excised tissue (5). Most recently the capacity of the thyroid to concentrate radioiodide has been studied by Stanley and Astwood (8) after previous administration of an antithyroid drug such as mercaptoimidazol. Keating, Power, Berkson, and Haines (9) have employed radioiodine to investigate the kinetics of iodine metabolism. They studied the urinary ex-cretion of radioiodine by collecting all the urine in short periods for three days or longer. By plotting cumulative urinary excretion against time, they obtained an exponential curve from which were estimated four quantities: (1) a renal fraction (that part of the dose of radio-iodine primarily excreted. in the urine); (2) a disappearance rate (which they inferred to repre-sent the <b>proportional</b> <b>rate</b> of disappearance of radioiodine from the blood); (3) a r'enal excre-tiop rate (the <b>proportional</b> <b>rate</b> of excretion into the urine); and (4) a so-called collection rate (the <b>proportional</b> <b>rate</b> of disappearance into other sites than the kidneys, of which the most impor-tant is the thyroid).

In this study, we investigated the weight loss riskfactors firstly by using <b>proportional</b> <b>rates</b> model and then by applying time-dependent coefficient ratesmodel. Materials and Methods: In this study, the information of 1673 babies who were born in 2006 or 2007 and were visited for monthly check ups at Tehran east health centers during their first two years of life wereincluded in the analysis. We first fitted the standard <b>proportional</b> <b>rates</b> model to this data with the purposeof determining weigh loss major risk factors. After adjusting these factors, the month-specific effect ofcomplementary foods on weight loss occurrence rate was explored using time-varying coefficient ratesmodel. Results: Our findings showed that the risk of weight loss gets heightened as with the increase in theintake of complementary foods. This negative effect {{is likely to be the}} most between 9 and 11 months ofage and then tends to weaken as the baby grows older. The results of Wald-type statistic showed that theimpact of complementary food on the occurrence of weight loss is significantly different with respect to thechild ‘age (P< 0. 001).

Patients and Methods: The current study was conducted at the Department of Dermatology, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, from March 2006 through April 2014.
