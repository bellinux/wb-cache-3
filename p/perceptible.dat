5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a <b>perceptible</b> thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparison}} of coral strontium/calcium minimums with sea surface temperature maximums, data recorded from , {{time can be}} correlated to coral strontium/calcium and δ18O variations. To confirm accuracy of the annual relationship between Sr/Ca and δ18O variations, a <b>perceptible</b> association to annual coral growth rings confirms the age conversion. Geochronology is established by the blending of Sr/Ca data, growth rings, and stable isotope data. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{is directly related to}} climate fluctuations that influence coral δ18O ratio from local salinity variations associated with the position of the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and can be used for ENSO modeling.|$|E
5|$|There {{were still}} fine mediaeval screens {{in the church}} in 1810, {{possibly}} lost when repairs were done in 1813–16; they were gone by 1862. According to the History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan (1810) by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick: The chancel and north transept are separated {{from the rest of}} the church by light and elegant carved screens, which, from the elaborate workmanship they display, were probably erected about the time of Henry the Seventh. They are coloured red, green and yellow, and though once very brilliant, are now so covered with dirt as to be scarce <b>perceptible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unusual weather phenomena, such as {{snow and}} mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the {{chromatic}} appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as The Magpie, one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under {{the combination of}} a greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white <b>perceptible</b> in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no <b>perceptible</b> decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more {{of their own money}} than in the past.|$|E
5|$|Security, {{services}} and logistics {{at the reception}} centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG, {{and a number of}} secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was <b>perceptible</b> throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.|$|E
5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the <b>perceptible</b> fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} that the battle took place before Somairle and Guðrøðr struggled for the kingship. Guðrøðr is otherwise known to have married a granddaughter of Muirchertach, and seems to have had an earlier marriage to another member of the Uí Néill. These marital unions could be evidence of an alliance between Guðrøðr and Muirchertach in the 1150s. Mac Scelling's participation in Muirchertach's service, therefore, could have been undertaken during a period of cooperation between the Isles and the Uí Néill. Nevertheless, an alliance between Somairle and Muirchertach may be <b>perceptible</b> as late as 1164, when the former lost his life leading an invasion of mainland Scotland. According to the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, Somairle commanded troops from Dublin, a settlement which have recognised Muirchertach's overlordship at the time. One possibility is that a pact between the two concerned Somairle's support of Muirchertach regarding the Irish high-kingship, and Muirchertach's support of Somairle via Dublin.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that Sigurðr Hlǫðvisson, Earl of Orkney (died 1014) extended his authority from Orkney into the Isles in the late tenth- and early eleventh century. For instance, the thirteenth-century Njáls sagathe only source that specifically refers to Gillistates that one of Sigurðr's followers, Kári Sǫlmundarson, extracted taxes from the northern Hebrides, then controlled by Gilli himself. Whether these taxes were due to Norwegian overlords of Sigurðr, as the saga states, is uncertain. The saga further declares that Sigurðr and his men defeated Guðrøðr Haraldsson, King of the Isles (died 989), after which they plundered the Isles. Also noted are additional assaults conducted by accomplices of Sigurðr throughout the Hebrides, Kintyre, Mann (against Guðrøðr), and Anglesey. The thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga also reports Sigurðr's raids into the Isles, as does Eyrbyggja saga, a thirteenth-century source which further notes his taxation of the kingdom. Contemporary Orcadian expansion may be <b>perceptible</b> in the evidence of the land-assessment system of ouncelands in the Hebrides and along the western coast of Scotland. If Sigurðr's authority indeed stretched over the Isles in the last decades of the tenth century, such an intrusion could account for the numbers of silver hoards dating to this time.|$|E

25|$|As the {{fighting}} halted, a joint {{conference of the}} American Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps was held in Seoul to consider future forward air control operations. The U.S. Army still wanted its own Air Corps; the U.S. Air Force still insisted on its independence, {{and its ability to}} supply close air support as needed. The end of the Korean War saw no <b>perceptible</b> change in forward air control doctrine from the war's start. Matters continued post-1953 as they had in 1950; there would be no <b>perceptible</b> moves to settle forward air control doctrine for the U.S. military between 1946 and 1966.|$|E
25|$|Sound that is <b>perceptible</b> {{by humans}} has {{frequencies}} from about 20Hz to 20,000Hz. In air at standard temperature and pressure, the corresponding wavelengths of sound waves range from 17m to 17mm.|$|E
25|$|The term ghost {{implies that}} some {{element of the}} human being survives death and, at least under certain circumstances, can make itself <b>perceptible</b> to living human beings. There are other {{competing}} explanations of apparitional experiences.|$|E
25|$|UUA leaders {{concerned}} with membership numbers fluctuating from barely <b>perceptible</b> growth to slight decline, {{are working with}} a variety of experimental UU communities that represent alternative models of congregational formation—or that may point to new forms of affiliation.|$|E
25|$|The cow is {{considerably}} lighter in make and in colour than the bull. The horns are more slender and upright, with more inward curvature, and the frontal ridge is scarcely <b>perceptible.</b> In young animals the horns are smooth and polished. In old bulls they are rugged and dented at the base.|$|E
25|$|The {{oscilloscope}} can {{be adjusted}} so that repetitive signals can be observed as a continuous shape on the screen. A storage oscilloscope allows single events to be captured by the instrument and displayed for a relatively long time, allowing observation of events too fast to be directly <b>perceptible.</b>|$|E
25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called <b>perceptible</b> if {{its presence in}} the marked signal is noticeable (e.g. Digital On-screen Graphics like a Network Logo, Content Bug, Codes, Opaque images). On videos and images, some are made transparent/translucent for convenience for consumers {{due to the fact}} that they block portion of the view; therefore degrading it.|$|E
25|$|Space and rhythm, {{according}} to Gleizes, are <b>perceptible</b> by {{the extent of}} movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.|$|E
25|$|Since {{changes in}} season can {{coincide}} with favorable changes in environment, {{the distinction between}} seasonal breeder and opportunistic can be muddled. In equatorial climes, the change in seasons is not always <b>perceptible</b> and thus, changes in day length not remarkable. Thus, the tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus) previously categorized as a seasonal breeder is now suspected to be an opportunistic breeder.|$|E
25|$|Now Hipparchus {{made such}} an {{examination}} principally from the sun. Since from other {{properties of the}} sun and moon (of which a study will be made below) it follows that if the distance of one of the two luminaries is given, the distance of the other is also given, he tries by conjecturing the distance of the sun to demonstrate the distance of the moon. First, he assumes the sun to show the least <b>perceptible</b> parallax to find its distance. After this, he makes use of the solar eclipse adduced by him, first as if the sun shows no <b>perceptible</b> parallax, and for exactly that reason the ratios of the moon's distances appeared different to him for each of the hypotheses he set out. But with respect to the sun, not only the amount of its parallax, but also whether it shows any parallax at all is altogether doubtful.|$|E
25|$|Microcurrent {{treatments}} (MENS) {{have been}} around since the 1970s in medical applications and are distinguished by their use of micro-ampere currents (i.e. millionths of an amp) which are hardly <b>perceptible,</b> but mimic the body's own bio-electric currents. The treatment is designed to soften wrinkles and rejuvenate skin, including skin damaged by sunburn, acne, stretch marks, cellulite and scarring.|$|E
25|$|La Magicienne has {{not quite}} {{fulfilled}} general expectation. We are stating a fact, not pronouncing a judgment, {{for it is}} impossible to utter a downright and irrevocable opinion at one hearing. Nevertheless, when a grand opera contains beauties of a high order, it rarely happens that some few are not <b>perceptible</b> at once, and for such we sought in vain.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Laotian Air Force owed {{its origin}} and traditions to the French Far East Airforces (French: Forces Aériennes en Extrême-Orient – FAEO) of the First Indochina War, {{and even after}} the United States took the role as the main foreign sponsor for the Royal Laotian Armed Forces at the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, French military influence was still <b>perceptible</b> in their uniforms and insignia.|$|E
25|$|The Ho Chi Minh Trail {{was central}} to the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) {{strategy}} for the conquest of South Vietnam during the Second Indochina War. North Vietnamese victory depended on the supplies and reinforcements delivered by the Trail, which was located in the Kingdom of Laos. An ongoing air campaign by the United States striking the Trail had little <b>perceptible</b> effect on the Communist logistics effort.|$|E
25|$|The camps {{were also}} {{inspected}} by delegations from neutral countries, notably Switzerland, and most often {{by representatives of}} the Red Cross. During these visits, most prisoners noticed a <b>perceptible</b> improvement in (for instance) food quality, the German authorities seeing {{to it that the}} inspectors were fooled. At the end of the war, the Red Cross took part in prisoners’ repatriation, but it also helped initiate prisoner exchanges and internments in Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|Near {{sunrise and}} sunset, {{most of the}} light we see comes in nearly tangent to the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the {{atmosphere}} is so long {{that much of the}} blue and even green light is scattered out, leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red. Therefore, when looking at the sunset and sunrise, the colour red is more <b>perceptible</b> {{than any of the other}} colours.|$|E
25|$|From {{the rocky}} summit of Little Hart Crag a {{narrowing}} ridge descends north eastward on grass. The ground is quite wet {{and there are}} areas of peat and sedge. After half a mile of steady fall, the ridge throws up the barely <b>perceptible</b> summit of High Harsop Dodd. Beyond this {{the character of the}} fell changes completely and a steep slope plunges straight down to the valley floor.|$|E
25|$|Henceforward Lanfranc {{exercised}} a <b>perceptible</b> {{influence on}} his master's policy. William adopted the Cluniac programme of ecclesiastical reform, and obtained {{the support of}} Rome for his English expedition by assuming the attitude of a crusader against schism and corruption. It was Alexander II, possibly a pupil of Lanfranc's and certainly a close friend, who gave the Norman Conquest the papal benediction—a notable advantage to William at the moment, but subsequently the cause of serious embarrassments.|$|E
25|$|Another {{question}} is whether, {{if there was}} a <b>perceptible</b> beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the ictus was not isochronous, but that the timing depended on whether the anceps syllables were long or short. His view is that so far from attempting to make the word accent match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the line, to avoid monotony.|$|E
25|$|Where arable {{cultivation}} {{continued in}} early Anglo-Saxon England, {{there seems to}} have been considerable continuity with the Roman period in both field layout and arable practices, although we do not know whether there were also changes to patterns of tenure or the regulation of cultivation. The greatest <b>perceptible</b> alterations in land usage between about 400 and 600 are therefore in the proportions of the land of each community that lay under grass or the plough, rather than in changes to the layout or management of arable fields.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus {{measured}} the apparent diameters of the Sun and Moon with his diopter. Like others {{before and after}} him, {{he found that the}} Moon's size varies as it moves on its (eccentric) orbit, but he found no <b>perceptible</b> variation in the apparent diameter of the Sun. He found that at the mean distance of the Moon, the Sun and Moon had the same apparent diameter; at that distance, the Moon's diameter fits 650 times into the circle, i.e., the mean apparent diameters are 360/650 = 0°33'14".|$|E
25|$|Gamma ray {{treatment}} is also uncommon, because {{although it is}} the safest and cheapest irradiation method, successful treatment can take several months. The color produced is a blue to blue-green which penetrates the whole stone. Such diamonds are not annealed. The blue color can sometimes approach that of natural Type IIb diamonds, but the two are distinguished by the latter's semiconductive properties. As with most irradiated diamonds, most gamma ray-treated diamonds were originally tinted yellow; the blue is usually modified by this tint, resulting in a <b>perceptible</b> greenish cast.|$|E
25|$|Müllerian mimicry. Müller's great {{discovery}} {{concerned the}} resemblance between {{two or more}} unpalatable species which are protected from predators capable of learning. The protection is often a noxious chemical, perhaps gained from the larva eating a particular plant; {{or it may be}} a sting or other defence. It is an advantage for such potential prey to advertise their status in a way clearly <b>perceptible</b> to their predators; this is called aposematic or warning coloration. The principle is of wide application, but in Muller's case the prey were butterflies, and the predators usually birds or reptiles.|$|E
25|$|Open {{clusters}} are key {{objects in}} the study of stellar evolution. Because the cluster members are of similar age and chemical composition, their properties (such as distance, age, metallicity and extinction) are more easily determined than they are for isolated stars. A number of open clusters, such as the Pleiades, Hyades or the Alpha Persei Cluster are visible with the naked eye. Some others, such as the Double Cluster, are barely <b>perceptible</b> without instruments, while many more can be seen using binoculars or telescopes. The Wild Duck Cluster, M11, is an example.|$|E
