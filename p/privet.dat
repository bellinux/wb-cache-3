5|$|A {{number of}} plants are {{poisonous}} to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, <b>privet,</b> ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax (both Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica), and wild celery. Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb (e.g., tulip or onion) is normally considered poisonous, as well as ivy and oak tree leaves.|$|E
5|$|Most {{land around}} the oxbow is steep. It {{is covered by}} hemlock and {{hardwood}} forests, as well as skunk cabbage seeps. The forests around the lake also contain black birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, tulip poplar, and Norway maple, while the understory contains slippery elm, European <b>privet,</b> Japanese barberry, American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain laurel, ironwood, and the rare American yew. The American yew population was in significant decline by 2004 due to heavy grazing by deer.|$|E

5|$|This covers {{most of the}} reserve. Silver birch is dominant, with a few crack willow, goat willow, {{some wild}} cherry and {{sycamore}} in the canopy. Shrubs include hawthorn, elder, holly, yew and rowan, with garden escapes like buddleia, Oregon grape, cotoneaster, <b>privet.</b> There are some saplings of pedunculate oak, mostly around the edge, and holm oak. The field layer is mainly thick bramble, with ivy in denser shade. Ferns include male fern, broad buckler fern and the less common lady fern.|$|E
5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, <b>privet,</b> hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
50|$|Ligustrum lucidum is an {{evergreen}} tree {{growing to}} 10 m tall and broad. The leaves are opposite, glossy dark green, 6 - 17 cm long and 3 - 8 cm broad. The flowers {{are similar to}} other <b>privets,</b> white or near white, borne in panicles, and unpleasantly pungent.|$|R
5000|$|The species Ligustrum ovalifolium {{is widely}} {{cultivated}} as an ornamental plant in many countries, as a shrub, and grouped for an informal or formal hedge.

5|$|For ten years, {{living at}} number four, <b>Privet</b> Drive, Harry is {{treated by the}} Dursleys more like a servant than {{a member of the}} family and is forced to live in a {{cupboard}} under the stairs. Shortly before his eleventh birthday, a series of letters addressed to Harry arrive, but Uncle Vernon destroys them before Harry can read them, leading to an influx of more and more letters. To evade the pursuit of these letters, Vernon first takes the family to a hotel, but when the letters arrive there too, he hires a boat out to a hut on a small island.|$|E
5|$|Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour {{addresses}} the wizarding media, and {{states that the}} Ministry will remain strong, even as Lord Voldemort gains strength. The Death Eaters have made major gains after Dumbledore's death, committing mass killings of Muggles and infiltrating the Ministry itself. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to complete the mission Dumbledore gave Harry by hunting down and destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes. Meanwhile, Severus Snape informs Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters of Harry's impending departure from <b>Privet</b> Drive. Voldemort commandeers Lucius Malfoy's wand, as Voldemort's own wand cannot be used to kill Harry because they share the same core.|$|E
5|$|The Fonteyn Kill and its {{riparian}} zone {{are home to}} a variety of species. Caddisflies, clams and mussels, crayfish (Astacidae), damselflies, gammarids, isopods (Asellidae), oligochaetes, black flies, leeches, chironomids, bladder snails, and other snails were recorded in the stream in 2010. Trees {{along the banks of the}} Fonteyn Kill include American elms, sugar maples, black cherries, Norway maples, and red maples, while barberry, <b>privet,</b> holly, Japanese knotweed, honeysuckle, spicebush, common reeds, and Japanese roses make up the kill's riparian shrubs. Carp, mallards, great blue herons, frogs, snapping turtles, and other birds also reside in and around the stream. A 1924 source observed that trout fishing occurred on the kill.|$|E
50|$|Many {{members of}} the family are {{economically}} significant. The olive (Olea europaea) is important for its fruit and for the olive oil extracted from it. The ashes (Fraxinus) are valued for their tough wood. Forsythias, lilacs, jasmines, osmanthuses, <b>privets,</b> and fringe trees are valued as ornamental plants in gardens and landscaping. At least two species of jasmine are the source of an essential oil. Their flowers are often added to tea.|$|R

[...] So saying, Sam Brattle again mounted up to the roof, and the parson {{returned}} discomfited {{to the front of the}} building. He had not intended to see any of the family, but, as he was crossing the little bridge, meaning to go home round by the <b>Privets,</b> he was stopped by Fanny Brattle.|$|R
50|$|The main {{tree species}} that {{are located in the}} park are elm trees, jacaranda, palms and <b>privets</b> (bush). Also art {{exhibitions}} are organized during weekends (that is the origin of the name “Tlacoquemecatl Arts Garden”). In one of the footpaths of the park there is a commemorative plaque to Carlos Gardel, the best known representative in the history of tango, inaugurated in 1990 by the Mexican Association of Tango (Asociación de Tangueros de México in Spanish).|$|R
5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), <b>privet</b> (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum appenninum) is a common species at the site, occurring in abundance on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing here, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae).

5|$|In the {{traditional}} cottage garden, hedges served as fences {{on the perimeter}} to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. Hawthorn leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing Elderberry, in addition to creating a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. Holly was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. <b>Privet</b> was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge. Over time, more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including laurel, lilac, snowberry, japonica, and others.|$|E
5000|$|When {{herbicide}} use is warranted, several {{methods have}} proven effective. In all cases, soil disturbance following herbicide treatment is inadvisable. This {{is due to}} <b>privet's</b> preference for disturbed soils and its increased ability to compete in such an environment. [...] The length of time that the soil must be left undisturbed varies with the treatment. Foliar applications of glyphosate, cut-stump applications of glyphosate or triclopyr, and basal bark treatments for stems less than 0.5 inches is effective.|$|R
60|$|It {{was decided}} that evening at the Vicarage {{that it would be}} better for all parties that the reverend uncle from Salisbury should be told to make his visit, and spend the next week at Hampton Privets; that is, that he should come on the Monday and stay till the Saturday. The letter was written down at the Vicarage, as Fenwick feared that it would never be written if the writing of it were left to the unassisted energy of the Squire. The letter was written, and the Vicar, who walked back to Hampton <b>Privets</b> with his friend, took care that it was given to a servant on that night.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I will, {{with all}} my heart, towards the keys of the store closets of the <b>Privets,</b> but not a step the other way. It has to be, Mary. He is too much in earnest, and too good, and too fit for the place to which he aspires, to miss his object. Come, we'll go in. Mind, you and I are one again, let it go how it may. I will own that I have been vexed {{for the last two}} days,--have been in a humour unbecoming your {{departure}} to-morrow. I throw all that behind me.

5|$|Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart {{return to}} the main castle and reunite with McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, whose {{possession}} by Voldemort caused all of the petrification and troubles {{over the course of}} the year, is given a reprieve by Dumbledore, who reasons that greater wizards have been duped by Voldemort before and takes great interest in the qualities of the diary, which Harry gives to him. Lucius Malfoy bursts in after this meeting, demanding to know why and how Dumbledore has returned to the school and accompanied by Dobby, revealing the family to whom he is enslaved. The house-elf also provides Harry with unspoken cues regarding the diary’s ownership: While it was Tom Riddle’s, it had been in the Malfoys’ possession, and Harry returns it, devising a scenario involving his own sock that frees Dobby from the Malfoys’ employment, thus provoking an attack on Harry, only for Dobby to jump in and save him. The petrified students are cured, the end-of-year exams are cancelled (much to Hermione’s chagrin), Hagrid comes back in the middle of the final feast, and Harry returns to <b>Privet</b> Drive in higher spirits than he last left it.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{handover}} {{occurred during}} the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, when Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Paralympic Flag from Mayor of Beijing Guo Jinlong. This {{was followed by a}} cultural presentation by Britain, which was similar to its presentation during the Olympics' closing ceremony. It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet, and Candoco, a physically integrated dance group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top of the bus was open and folded down to show a <b>privet</b> hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye. Cherisse Osei, drummer for Mika, and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top of the bus folded up into its original form, sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery. Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London's City Hall on 26 September 2008. British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Chris Holmes raised the Paralympic flag.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{crossing}} Lower State Road, PA463 fully enters Horsham Township {{and becomes}} a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane as it heads past housing subdivisions. The route loses the turning lane and continues southeast to PA152 {{in the village of}} Prospectville. At this intersection, PA463 gains a center left-turn lane again and passes a few businesses before continuing past Deep Meadow Park and Kohler Park. The road intersects Keith Valley Road and passes near Samuel Carpenter Park. At the Babylon Road junction, the route becomes a five-lane road and runs to the northeast of Hatboro-Horsham Senior High School and past business parks before coming to <b>Privet</b> Road. At this point, PA463 runs past the Horsham Air Guard Station to the northeast and homes and businesses to the southwest. The route reaches the edge of the air station property at the Maple Avenue intersection. PA 463 intersects Dresher Road, where the center left-turn lane ends and the road becomes four lanes, reaching its eastern terminus at PA611 in the community of Horsham. At the eastern terminus, access from PA 463 to northbound PA 611 is provided by Dresher Road.|$|E

60|$|Now the Balfours were {{considerable}} {{people at}} Loring, though their property was not county property; {{and it was}} always considered that Janet Balfour might have done better than she did, in a worldly point of view. Of that, however, little had been said at Loring, because it soon became known there {{that she and her husband}} stood rather well in the country round about Bullhampton; and when she asked Mary Lowther to come and stay with her for six months, Mary Lowther's aunt, Miss Marrable, had nothing to say against the arrangement, although she herself was a most particular old lady, and always remembered that Mary Lowther was third or fourth cousin to some earl in Scotland. Nothing more shall be said of Miss Marrable at present, as it is expedient, for the sake of the story, that the reader should fix his attention on Bullhampton till he find himself quite at home there. I would wish him to know his way among the water meads, to be quite alive to the fact that the lodge of Hampton <b>Privets</b> is a mile and a quarter to the north of Bullhampton church, and half a mile across the fields west from Brattle's mill; that Mr. Fenwick's parsonage adjoins the churchyard, being thus a little farther from Hampton <b>Privets</b> than the church; and that there commences Bullhampton street, with its inn,--the Trowbridge Arms, its four public-houses, its three bakers, and its two butchers. The bounds of the parsonage run down to the river, so that the Vicar can catch his trout from his own bank,--though he much prefers to catch them at distances which admit of the appurtenances of sport.|$|R

He knew that if every bullock and horse about the place had been struck dead it would not enhance his misery. He had not had much hope before, but now he would have seen the house of Hampton <b>Privets</b> in flames, just for the chance that had been his yesterday. It was not only that he wanted her, or that he regretted the absence of some recognised joys which she would have brought to him; but that the final decision on her part seemed to take from him all vitality, all power of enjoyment, all that inward elasticity which is necessary for an interest in worldly affairs.|$|R
50|$|Agaricus santacatalinensis is {{a species}} of agaric fungus. Described as new to science in 1998 by Edgardo Albertó, it is found in {{deciduous}} forests of Brazil, where it grows under <b>privets</b> (Ligustrum) and elm (Ulmus). The fruit bodies feature caps that are 7 - 12 cm in diameter with felt-like surfaces. Somewhat unusually, the gills mature centrifugally (from the cap center outward to the edge). Initially, they are ochre yellow before turning dark brown after the spores mature. The stipe measures 8.5 - 12 cm long by 1.5 - 2 cm thick. It is white from the cap down to the ring, below which it becomes yellowish with orange tints. The base of the stipe has short yellowish rhizomorphs. The ring is membranous, measuring 1-2 mm thick. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown.|$|R

There was some gentle sparring between the two clergymen, if that can be called sparring in which all the active pugnacity was on one side. Mr. Fenwick endeavoured to entrap Mr. Chamberlaine into arguments, but the Prebendary escaped with a degree of skill,--without the shame of sullen refusal,--that excited the admiration of Mr. Fenwick's wife.
