50|$|The use of punches varies between {{different}} martial arts and combat sports. Styles such as boxing or Russian fist fighting use punches alone, while others such as kickboxing or karate may use both <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> kicks. Others such as wrestling <b>and</b> judo (<b>punches</b> <b>and</b> other striking techniques, atemi, {{are present in}} judo kata, but are forbidden in competitions) do not use punches at all. There are many types of <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> as a result, different styles encompass varying types of punching techniques.|$|R
5|$|Five Finger Death Punch, often {{shortened}} to Death <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> abbreviated as 5FDP or FFDP, is an American {{heavy metal}} band from Las Vegas, Nevada. Formed in 2005, the band's {{name comes from}} the kung fu movie The Five Fingers of Death, to which Quentin Tarantino later made reference in his movie Kill Bill. The band originally consisted of vocalist Ivan Moody, guitarist Zoltan Bathory, guitarist Caleb Andrew Bingham, bassist Matt Snell, and drummer Jeremy Spencer. Bingham was replaced by guitarist Darrell Roberts in 2006, who was then replaced by Jason Hook in 2009. Bassist Matt Snell departed from the band in 2010, {{and was replaced by}} Chris Kael in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Le Mesurier {{worked on}} his first film, Death in the Hand, a mystery in which he played the {{character}} Jack Mottram.

5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E
50|$|Normally lancing {{is done on}} a {{mechanical}} press, lancing {{requires the use of}} <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> dies to be used. The different <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> dies determine the shape and angle (or curvature) of the newly made section of the material. The dies <b>and</b> <b>punches</b> are needed to be made of tool steel to withstand the repetitious nature of the procedure.|$|R

5|$|With 10seconds {{left to go}} {{in round}} two, Tszyu landed a right hand clean on Judah's chin and he backed away from Tszyu with his hands down. Tszyu went after Judah, {{throwing}} another right hand that landed on his chin and sent Judah crashing to the canvas. Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee Jay Nady, but was still dazed by the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> fell down a second time. When Judah collapsed, Nady waved the fight over, resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah's first professional loss.|$|E
5|$|A lack {{of field}} {{observations}} limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts {{are known to}} sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> hammer opponents. The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail. Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.|$|E
5|$|Battletoads Arcade is a coin-operated, {{scrolling}} beat 'em up arcade video game. Up {{to three}} players, as the Battletoads (Rash, Pimple, and Zitz), <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> kick oncoming enemies through six levels {{to save their}} alternate universe from the Dark Queen. Arcade was the first Battletoads game to feature three-player cooperative multiplayer. Players control their characters with eight-directional joysticks and two buttons (attack and jump). Characters can run if the player pushes the joystick twice in the same direction. The Toads vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly, and Zitz is a balance of the two. As customary for the series, the Toads can knocked enemies offscreen such that they appear to fly towards the players, breaking the fourth wall. The Toads can also eat flies to regenerate health. Each Toad has its own signature exaggerated power and attack, in which their limbs turn into objects such as axes and drills. Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents, and snowmen.|$|E

5|$|During a {{game against}} the Canucks on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado's Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be {{retaliation}} for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Because of the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> the consequent fall on the ice with Bertuzzi on top of him, and numerous other players from both teams piling on top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, ever since the Moore hit, it has become tradition for the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck, whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000 it was {{announced}} that Punch magazine was to be prosecuted for contempt of court after publishing an article by former MI5 agent David Shayler. Shayler's article claimed MI5 could have stopped the Bishopsgate bombing, which a spokesman for Attorney General Lord Williams claimed was a breach of a 1997 court injunction preventing Shayler disclosing information on security or intelligence matters. In November 2000 <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> its editor were found guilty and fined £20,000 and £5,000 respectively. In March 2001 the editor successfully appealed against his conviction and fine, with an appeal judge accusing the Attorney General of acting like a press censor and ruling that the 1997 injunction was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 2002 this decision was overturned at the House of Lords, with five law lords ruling that editor James Steen's publication of Shayler's article was indeed in contempt.|$|E
5|$|Killer Instinct Gold is a 1996 {{fighting}} {{video game}} {{based on the}} arcade game Killer Instinct2. The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo64 video game console. As in other series entries, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press buttons to <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as combos. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic finisher moves underscored by an announcer. Charactersincluding a gargoyle, a ninja, and a femme fatalefight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship. Killer Instinct Gold includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, pre-rendered environments, but excludes its full-motion video sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of the cartridge media format. The Gold release adds a training mode, new camera views, and improved audiovisuals.|$|E

5|$|MacMillan next {{produced}} {{a series of}} one-act ballets. For the junior company he choreographed House of Birds (1955), based on the Grimm brothers' Jorinde and Joringel, and for Covent Garden he created Noctambules (1956) about a Svengali-like hypnotist. He also worked in television, with <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> the Child (1954), The Dreamers, a television adaptation of Sonambulism, and Turned Out Proud (1955). In 1956 he took leave of absence to spend five months in New York, working with American Ballet Theatre, choreographing Winter's Eve and Journey for the dramatic ballerina Nora Kaye. For the Covent Garden opera company he staged the Venusberg ballet in Tannhäuser, regarded by some critics as {{the best part of}} a disappointing production.|$|E
5|$|Street {{entertainment}} at Covent Garden {{was noted}} in Samuel Pepys's diary in May 1662, when he recorded the first {{mention of a}} <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> Judy show in Britain. Impromptu performances of song and swimming were given by local celebrity William Cussans in the eighteenth century. Covent Garden is licensed for street entertainment, and performers audition for timetabled slots {{in a number of}} venues around the market, including the North Hall, West Piazza, and South Hall Courtyard. The courtyard space is dedicated to classical music only. There are street performances at Covent Garden Market every day of the year, except Christmas Day. Shows run throughout the day and are about 30 minutes in length. In March 2008, the market owner, CapCo, proposed to reduce street performances to one 30-minute show each hour.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{system of}} KOF '94 {{is similar to}} SNK's previous games like the Fatal Fury series, Art of Fighting and Samurai Shodown. The game uses a four attack button configuration similar to Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special, that consists of light punch, light kick, strong <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> strong kick. Like in Fatal Fury 2, specialized techniques are performed by pressing buttons in combination, allowing the player to dodge an opponent's attack or to launch a character's powerful knockdown attack. As with most other fighting games, each character has a set of basic, unique, and special moves that can be performed by the player with a specific series of joystick and button inputs.|$|E

5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> Judy. The team would carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then the team would be permitted entry and given food and drink.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved {{version of that}} from the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost twice as fast as the original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} stories to {{entertain}} {{is evident in}} one of the most famous ones—Scheherazade—a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories. The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> Judy show.|$|E
