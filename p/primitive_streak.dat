25|$|Wnt {{signaling}} and beta-catenin dependent {{gene expression}} plays {{a critical role}} during the formation of different body regions in the early embryo. Experimentally modified embryos that do not express this protein will fail to develop mesoderm and initiate gastrulation. During the blastula and gastrula stages, Wnt as well as BMP and FGF pathways will induce the antero-posterior axis formation, regulate the precise placement of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> (gastrulation and mesoderm formation) {{as well as the}} process of neurulation (central nervous system development).|$|E
2500|$|The neural {{plate is}} a key {{developmental}} structure {{that serves as the}} basis for the nervous system. [...] Opposite the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> in the embryo, ectodermal tissue thickens and flattens to become the neural plate. [...] The region anterior to the primitive knot can be generally referred to as the neural plate. Cells take on a columnar appearance in the process as they continue to lengthen and narrow. [...] The ends of the neural plate, known as the neural folds, push the ends of the plate up and together, folding into the neural tube, a structure critical to brain and spinal cord development. [...] This process as a whole is termed primary neurulation.|$|E

60|$|We find solid mesoblastic somites, we find <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> allantois and amnion, {{features}} we {{have just}} been explaining as the consequence of an excess of yolk in the egg. We even find a yolk sac with no yolk in it.|$|E
60|$|Section 27. So far, the {{essential}} {{differences between the}} development of fowl and frog, the meroblastic segmentation, absence of a typical gastrula, and the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> seem comprehensible {{on the theory that}} such differences are due to the presence of an enormous amount of yolk. Another difference that appears later is that, while the tadpole has an efficient pronephros, the fowl, which has no larval (free imperfect) stages in its life history, has the merest indication of such a structure.|$|E
60|$|Section 25. There is no open {{invagination}} of an archenteron in the fowl, {{as in the}} frog--, the gastrula, {{like the}} blastosphere, stage is also masked. But, in the hinder region of the germinal area, a thick mass of cells, grows inward and forward, and, appearing in the dorsal view of the egg as a white streak, is called the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> (p.s.). By {{a comparison of the}} figures of frog and fowl the student will easily perceive the complete correspondence of the position of this with the blastopore of the frog. The relation of the two will be easily understood if we compare the fowl's archenteron to a glove-finger under pressure-- its cavity is obliterated-- and the frog's to the glove-finger blown out. The tension of the protoplasm, straining over the enormous yolk, answers to the pressure. The gastrula in the fowl is solid. The <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> is, in fact, the scar of a closed blastopore. As we should expect from this view of its homology, at the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> the three embryonic layers are continuous and indistinguishable (Figure 2). Elsewhere in the blastoderm they are distinctly separate. Just as the yolk cells of the frog form the ventral wall of the intestine, so nuclei appear along the upper side of the yolk of the fowl, where some protoplasm still exists, and give rise to the ventral hypoblastic cells. By conceiving a gradually increasing amount of yolk in the hypoblastic cells in the ventral side of the archenteron, the substantial identity of the gastrula stage in the three types, which at first appear so strikingly different, will be perceived. Carry Figures 4 and 5 of the frog one step further by increasing the size of the shaded yolk and leaving it unsegmented, and instead of ar. in 5 show a solid mass of cells, and the condition of things in the fowl would at once be rendered.|$|E
60|$|At any rate, the {{subsequent}} development goes far to justify such a view. The inner cells split into epi-, meso-, and hypo-blast, like the blastoderm in the fowl; {{there is a}} <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> and no blastopore; an amnion arises; the yolk sac, small and full of serous fluid, is cut off just as the enormous yolk of the fowl is cut off; and an allantois arises in the same way. There {{is no need to}} give special diagrams-- Figures 3, 4b, 5, and 6 of the fowl will do in all respects, except proportion, {{for the development of the}} rabbit. The differences are such as we may account for, not on the supposition that the rabbit's ovum never had any yolk, but that an abundant yolk has been withdrawn from it. The nutrition of the embryo by yolk has been superseded by some better method. The supposition that the rabbit is descended from ancestors which, like the birds and reptiles, laid eggs with huge quantities of yolk, meets every circumstance of the case.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> {{is formed}} at the {{beginning}} of gastrulation and is found at the junction between the extraembryonic tissue and the epiblast on the posterior side of the embryo and the site of ingression. [...] Formation of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> is reliant upon nodal signaling in the Koller's sickle within the cells contributing to the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> and BMP4 signaling from the extraembryonic tissue. [...] Furthermore, Cer1 and Lefty1 restrict the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> to the appropriate location by antagonizing nodal signaling. [...] The region defined as the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> continues to grow towards the distal tip.|$|E
5000|$|Avian {{gastrulation}} {{occurs as}} cells move though the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> Hence, <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> {{is analogous to}} the blastopore lip in amphibian gastrulation. [...] The <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> develops from Koller’s sickle and the epiblast of the avian embryo. As the cells of Koller’s sickle migrate during gastrulation, they form different portions of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> The anterior cells of Koller’s sickle become the anterior region of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> known as Hensen's node. Similarly, the posterior cells of Koller’s sickle form the posterior region of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> This differential movement is due to expression of different mesodermal marker genes among the cells located in different areas of Koller’s sickle. Chordin is expressed in cells of the anterior streak, while Wnt8c is expressed in cells of the posterior streak. The movement is coordinated by a Wnt signaling pathway which is activated by fibroblast growth factors from the hypoblast.|$|E
50|$|The <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> is an {{important}} concept in bioethics, where some experts have argued that experimentation with human embryos is permissible, but only before the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> develops, generally around the fourteenth day of existence. The development of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> is taken, by such bioethicists, to signify {{the creation of a}} unique, human being.In some countries, it is illegal to develop a human embryo for more than 14 days outside a woman's body.|$|E
5000|$|Even after {{implantation}} begins, a preembryo (and proembryo) {{may exist}} up until {{formation of the}} <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> [...] Implantation begins at about six days after fertilization, and lasts for about a week, during which time formation of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> occurs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> is {{key in the}} {{development}} of the major body axes. The primitive groove forms as a depression in the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> as it is developing, and allows a space for migrating cells to move into the deeper layers of the embryo. Cells migrate by entering through the dorsal side and moving toward the ventral side of the avian embryo, separating the left and right sections of the embryo. The primitive pit in Hensen’s node, at the anterior end of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> allows cells to enter which will form the notochord and prechordal plate. Cells that move through the center of the streak will become the heart and kidneys. The lateral plate and the extraembryonic mesoderm arise from the cells that enter at the posterior end of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> Epiblast cells near the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> form the neural plate and other dorsal structures, while the epiblast cells far from the streak become epidermis.|$|E

50|$|In amniotes (reptiles, {{birds and}} mammals), {{gastrulation}} involves {{the creation of}} the blastopore, an opening into the archenteron. Note that the blastopore is not an opening into the blastocoel, the space within the blastula, but represents a new inpocketing that pushes the existing surfaces of the blastula together. In amniotes, gastrulation occurs in the following sequence: (1) the embryo becomes asymmetric; (2) the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> forms; (3) cells from the epiblast at the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and ingress at the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> to form the germ layers.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{commencement}} of gastrulation, the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> a visible, morphological groove, {{appears on the}} posterior epiblast and orients along the anterior-posterior embryo axis. Initiated by signals from the underlying hypoblast, formation of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> is predicated on epiblast cell migration, mediated by Nodal, from the lateral-posterior regions of the epiblast to the center midline. The primitive knot is situated at the anterior end of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> and serves as the organizer for gastrulation, determining epiblast cell fate by inducing the differentiation of migrating epiblast cells during gastrulation.|$|E
5000|$|Koller's sickle, {{which is}} a local {{thickening}} of epiblast involved {{in the formation of}} the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> through which gastrulation occurs, separates sheets of cells from the posterior end of the blastoderm from the underlying hypoderm and area opaca endoderm. This separation is crucial {{in the formation of the}} <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b>|$|E
50|$|Given {{that the}} chicken embryo {{can be easily}} manipulated, most of our {{knowledge}} about the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> comes from avian studies. The marginal zone of a chick embryo contains cells that {{will contribute to the}} streak. This region has a defined anterior-to-posterior gradient in its ability to induce the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> with the posterior end having the highest potential.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} the cells {{to move from the}} {{epithelium}} of the epiblast through the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> to form a new layer, the cells must undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to lose their epithelial characteristics, such as cell-cell adhesion. FGF signaling is necessary for proper EMT. FGFR1 is needed for the up regulation of SNAI1, which down regulates E-cadherin, causing a loss of cell adhesion. Following the EMT, the cells ingress through the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> and spread out to form a new layer of cells or join existing layers. FGF8 is implicated in the process of this dispersal from the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Helen co-created {{alongside}} her biologist sister, Kate Storey, the project <b>Primitive</b> <b>Streak,</b> a science-art collaboration elucidating eleven key events in human embryonic development. <b>Primitive</b> <b>Streak</b> {{is a collection}} of twenty seven dresses, which brings these eleven key events to life in textile form. [...] First funded by the Wellcome Trust, <b>Primitive</b> <b>Streak</b> made its debut at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1997. The exhibition has since gone on to win two awards, has toured in seven countries and has been seen by five million people.

50|$|In certain model systems, it {{has been}} shown that the {{daughter}} cells of stem cell-like progenitor cells which come from the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> or site of gastrulation migrate out and localize in the posterior paraxial mesoderm. As the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> regresses and somites bud off anteriorly, new cells derived from these stem-cell like precursors constantly enter the posterior end of the paraxial mesoderm.|$|E
50|$|On day 16, epiblast {{cells that}} are next to the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> {{experience}} epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation as they ingress through the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> The first wave of epiblast cells takes over the hypoblast, which slowly becomes replaced by new cells that eventually constitute the definitive endoderm. The definitive endoderm {{is what makes the}} lining of the gut and other associated gut structures.|$|E
50|$|The {{third week}} of {{development}} {{and the formation of}} the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> sparks the beginning of gastrulation. Gastrulation is when the three germ cell layers develop as well as an organism’s body plan. During gastrulation, cells of the epiblast, a layer of the bilaminar blastocyst, migrate towards the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> enter it, and then move apart from it through a process called ingression.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} stage of embryogenesis, the {{implantation}} of the embryo and {{the initiation of}} placenta formation are associated with EMT. The trophoectoderm cells undergo EMT to facilitate the invasion of endometrium and appropriate placenta placement, thus enabling nutrient and gas exchange to the embryo. Later in embryogenesis, during gastrulation, EMT allows the cells to ingress in a specific area of the embryo - the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> in amniotes, and the ventral furrow in Drosophila. The cells in this tissue express E-cadherin and apical-basal polarity. Since gastrulation is a very rapid process, E-cadherin is repressed transcriptionally by Twist and SNAI1 (commonly called Snail), and at the protein level by P38 interacting protein. The <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> through invagination, further generates mesoendoderm, which separates to form a mesoderm and an endoderm, again through EMT. Mesenchymal cells from the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> participate also {{in the formation of}} many epithelial mesodermal organs, such as notochord as well as somites, through the reverse of EMT, i.e. mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Amphioxus forms an epithelial neural tube and dorsal notochord but does not have the EMT potential of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> In higher chordates, the mesenchyme originates out of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> migrates anteriorly to form the somites and participate with neural crest mesenchyme in formation of the heart mesoderm.|$|E

50|$|During gastrulation, {{migrating}} epiblast cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition in}} order to lose cell-cell adhesion (E-cadherin), delaminate from the epiblast layer and migrate over the dorsal surface of the epiblast then down through the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> The first wave of epiblast cells to invaginate through the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> invades and displaces the hypoblast to become the embryonic endoderm. The mesoderm layer is established next as migrating epiblast cells move through the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> then spread out within {{the space between the}} endoderm and remaining epiblast, which once the mesoderm layer has formed ultimately becomes the definitive ectoderm. The process of gastrulation results in a trilaminar germ disc, consisting of the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm layers.|$|E

50|$|The avian blastocoel is {{important}} {{during the development}} of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> The ingression of the endodermal precursor cells form the epiblast into the blastocoel and the migration of lateral cells of the posterior epiblast towards the center form the early <b>primitive</b> <b>streak.</b> As these cells converge inward, a depression forms called the primitive groove and functions as an opening through which cells travel into the blastocoel. As cells migrate into the blastocoel, they undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation.|$|E

5000|$|Nodal {{signaling}} regulates mesoderm {{formation in}} a species-specific manner. Thus, in Xenopus, Xnr controls dorso-ventral mesoderm formation along the marginal zone. In zebrafish, Squint and Cyclops {{are responsible for}} animal-vegetal mesoderm formation. In chicken and mouse, Vg1 and Nodal respectively promote <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> formation in the epiblast. In chick development, Nodal is expressed in Koller's sickle. [...] Studies have shown that a nodal knockout in mouse causes {{the absence of the}} <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> and failure in the formation of mesoderm, leading to developmental arrest just after gastrulation.|$|E
50|$|The {{embryonic}} disk becomes oval {{and then}} pear-shaped, the wider end being directed forward. Near the narrow, posterior end, an opaque streak, called the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak,</b> makes its appearance and extends along {{the middle of}} the disk for about one-half of its length; at the anterior end of the streak there is a knob-like thickening termed the primitive node or knot, (known as Hensen's knot in birds). A shallow groove, the primitive groove, appears {{on the surface of the}} streak, and the anterior end of this groove communicates by means of an aperture, the blastopore, with the yolk sac. The <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> is produced by a thickening of the axial part of the ectoderm, the cells of which multiply, grow downward, and blend with those of the subjacent endoderm. From the sides of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> a third layer of cells, the mesoderm, extends laterally between the ectoderm and endoderm; the caudal end of the <b>primitive</b> <b>streak</b> forms the cloacal membrane. The blastoderm now consists of three layers, named from without inward: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; each has distinctive characteristics and gives rise to certain tissues of the body. For many mammals, it is sometime during formation of the germ layers that implantation of the embryo in the uterus of the mother occurs.|$|E
