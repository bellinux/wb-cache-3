Unfortunately, there is one critical challenge to overcome before practical Sybil attack detection via leveraging <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Recall from Section ‘Platoon dispersion theory in transportation engineering’ that existing models for <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion</b> assume that vehicle speeds from an upstream point to a downstream point are unchanged. These speeds are then used to derive σ (which is used to derive Smoothing Factor R in Equation 2), that subsequently determines dispersion phenomena. Anomalies in the dispersion phenomena naturally provide an ideal foundation for detecting Sybil attacks in theory. However, in practice, vehicle do not travel with constant speed and speed can vary widely between vehicles. This is solved by using measurement samples from peer vehicles and incorporating these data to determine platooning anomalies. A high level of confidence of detecting Sybil attacks is possible through this method.|$|E

To capture the heterogeneity in platoon speeds, truncated mixed Gaussian distribution (TMGD) is adopted to fit the field collected speed data, and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed for the estimation of the distribution parameters. A piecewise platoon density function is developed to examine the <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics.

30|$|A Sybil attack {{consists}} of an adversary assuming multiple identities to defeat the trust of an existing reputation system. When Sybil attacks are launched in vehicular networks, the mobility of vehicles increases the difficulty of identifying the malicious vehicle location. In this paper, a novel protocol for Sybil detection in vehicular networks is presented. Considering that vehicular networks are cyber-physical systems, the technique exploits well grounded results in the physical (i.e., transportation) domain to detect the Sybil attacks in the cyber domain. Compared to existing works that rely on additional cyber hardware support, or complex cryptographic primitives for Sybil detection, the protocol leverages the theory of <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion</b> that models the physics of naturally occurring vehicle dispersion. Specifically, the proposed technique employs {{a certain number of}} roadside units that periodically collect reports from vehicles regarding their physical neighborhood. Leveraging from existing models of <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion,</b> a protocol was designed to detect anomalously close neighborhoods that are reflective of Sybil attacks. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is unique in integrating a well established theory in transportation engineering for detecting cyber space attacks in vehicular networks. The resulting protocol is simple, efficient, and robust in diverse attack environments.|$|E

A <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion</b> study was conducted to measure the profiles of traffic flow behavior between intersections and to calibrate the parameters “α” and “β” of the traffic flow model. A set of TRANSYT runs were conducted for two arterial street networks for both before and after the implementation of timing plans designed using the TRANSYT program with and without calibrated “α” and “β”. Then stops and delays predicted by TRANSYT were compared with those measured by detectors on the two streets. Overall, based on findings of the study, it was determined that there is a need for calibration of “α” and “β” in the traffic flow model of the TRANSYT program. The calibration of these parameters was found to significantly reduce stops and delays. Also calibration significantly improved the correlation between stops and delays predicted by TRANSYT and those measured by the detectors. The transferability of calibrated parameters from one street to another was found to be limited due to the fact that no indication of significant improvement was found with “α” and “β” calibrated for one street were applied to the other.

The solution algorithm employs a Frank-Wolfe method to identify the descent direction at each iteration, which requires the input of the derivatives information. A post-simulation sensitivity analysis is developed to estimate the derivatives in the TRANSYT traffic model. Good agreement of results with the values determined by numerical differentiation is obtained. Using these derivatives information, the Frank-Wolfe method shows a good convergence behavior to the equilibrium solution.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{procedures}} for the estimation in real time of origin-destination flows in junctions or small networks are reviewed. These {{are based on the}} assumption that the time taken by vehicles to traverse the junction or network is either small in relation to the chosen time interval or equal to some fixed number of time intervals. In reality, there will be a distribution of travel times that may span a number of time intervals. This paper proposes two ways to allow for this in the estimation of origin-destination flows. The first, appropriate if travel times are approximately geometrically distributed, makes use of the recurrence model of <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The second makes no assumption about the form of the distribution of travel times, but in general requires the estimation of substantially more parameters. Simulation results for data containing geometrically distributed travel times suggests that fitting the correctly specified model produces better estimates of the turning proportions than does the conventional approach where travel times are restricted to a fixed number of time intervals. ...|$|E
40|$|A fast {{constrained}} recursive identification (CRI) {{algorithm is}} proposed to estimate intersection origin-destination (O-D) matrices dynamically.

The estimation of origin-destination matrices by constrained generalized least squares. Transporation Research 25 B, 13 - 22; Bell, 1991 b. The real-time estimation of origin-destination flows {{in the presence of}} <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Transportation Research 25 B, 115 - 125.) for inequality constraints. Numerical results show that the accuracy of estimates by the CRI algorithm is fairly good [...] the solutions obtained by the CRI are optimal in majority of the cases, while the computational efforts are very limited [...] increment mainly lies on the evaluation of an inverse for an mxm matrix (m= 4 for a typical intersection) compared with the ordinary recursive least squares method.

Therefore, the CRI algorithm with its reasonable balance between accuracy and computational simplicity is very suitable for practical use. ...|$|E

In the event of a vehicle performing Sybil attacks, the geographic proximity the Sybil identities will be long-term and repeating, while the geographical proximity of benign vehicles will short-term. To put it in terms of transportation engineering, Sybil identities will appear to “platoon” together, while identities of benign vehicles will eventually “disperse”. The dispersion of vehicles in roads occurs due to a combination of road conditions, vehicle dynamics and human factors. This theory has been extensively studied by transportation engineers in the last five decades {{in the form of a}} theory called “platoon dispersion” [15 – 18]. Integrating <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion</b> models provide an alternative method for Sybil attack detection. To detect attacks, RSUs compare models of naturally occurring dispersion among benign vehicles with anomalously occurring platoons among Sybil nodes. Using a combination of both theoretical analysis and simulations, the simplicity, efficiency, practicality and quality of the protocol for Sybil detection in vehicular networks is demonstrated. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is unique in proposing an inter-disciplinary approach for addressing cyber space attacks in emerging vehicular networks.|$|E

Using a case study from the Northern Virginia Smart Traffic Signal System (NVSTSS), this project sought to determine how often traffic signals need to be re-optimized to provide the greatest benefits.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating an Origin-Destination (O-D) matrix with <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion</b> from fully disaggregate data: that is, the passage times of vehicles at the entries and exits or the origins and destinations of a network. Given a list of entry times {{and a list of}} exiting times, a fully disaggregate method or a matching method tries to match each pair of entry-exiting times such that the resultant journey times for each O-D pair fit the given distributions best. Bell et al., 1991 formulated the problem of finding the most likely set of matches as a 0 - 1 assignment problem. In this paper, two estimators will be considered: maximum likelihood estimator and the matching-Furness technique. It will be shown that the maximum likelihood estimation can be formulated more generally as a transportation problem. The matching-Furness method is investigated by use of simulated traffic data and is applied to a set of real data collected on the Brescia-Padova motorway network in Italy. The matching-Furness method gives consistently better estimates than the least squares estimator (Cremer and Keller, 1987) and the linked static-dynamic correlation model (Keller and Ploss, 1987). The method is therefore suitable for off-line estimations for general networks. ...|$|E

This study explores pedestrian delay reduction methods via {{development of a}} pedestrian priority algorithm that selects an operational plan favorable to pedestrian service, provided a user defined volume threshold has been met for the major street. This algorithm, along with several operational scenarios, were analyzed with VISSIM using Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulation to determine the impact these strategies have on user delays. One of the operational scenarios examined was that of actuating {{a portion of the}} coordinated phase, or actuated-coordinated operation. Following a discussion on <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion</b> and the application of it in the design of actuated-coordinated signal timing parameters, a sensitivity analysis was performed on vehicle extension timers to explore the impact that this coordinated movement parameter has on user delay. In the scenario analysis, it was shown that employing fully actuated (also known as Free) operation, either with the designed algorithm or without was an effective method of reducing minor street pedestrian delay while also decreasing average intersection vehicle delay for the volumes used in the simulation. The vehicle extension sensitivity analysis showed that shortening the extension timer of an actuated-coordinated phase can reduce the minor street pedestrian delay without increasing overall vehicle delay, which could be a tool used by agencies while in coordinated operation to prioritize pedestrians.

It is challenging for most agencies to find engineering resources to properly update signal policies and timing plans to accommodate changing traffic demands. Upgrading existing systems can achieve incremental benefits, but do not address the fundamental problem that information about system performance is not communicated to the agency in a meaningful or systematic way. This project developed a collaborative pilot deployment partnership between a large public agency, university, and commercial equipment manufacturers to define an architecture for a centralized traffic signal management system {{that can be used}} on a large geographic scale by both maintenance and technical services staff. This architecture leverages wireless IP communications to integrate performance measures into a database environment and a performance measure dashboard. In addition to this architecture, several uses of high resolution signal controller event data are presented.

40|$|Research on {{developing}} mathematical and simulative models to evaluate performance of signalized arterials is still ongoing. In this paper, an integrated model (IM) based on Rakha vehicle dynamics and LWR model is proposed. The IM which imitates actuated performance measurement in signalized arterials is described using continuous timed Petri net with variable speeds (VCPN). This enables systematic discretized description of platoon movement from an upstream signalized intersection towards a downstream signalized intersection. The integration {{is based on}} the notion that speed and travel time characteristics in a link can be provided using Rakha model. This will assist the LWR to estimate arrival profiles of vehicles at downstream intersection. One immediate benefit of the model is that platoon arrival profile obtained from the IM can be directly manipulated to estimate queues and delays at the target intersection using input-output analysis without considering the effect of shockwaves. This is less tedious as compared to analysing the LWR model through tracing trajectory of shockwave. Besides, time parameters of a platoon could be estimated for self-scheduling control approach from a cycle to cycle basis. The proposed IM is applied to a test intersection where simulated queues and average delays from the IM are compared with the <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion</b> model (PDM) implemented in TRANSYT, cell transmission model (CTM) and HCM 2000 for both under-saturated and oversaturated situations.

The offset between the main and pre-signal ensures that the majority of start up losses does not occur at the main signal. The benefits of the system under various traffic conditions were evaluated based on analysis of the queue discharge process and Corridor Simulation (CORSIM) study. The proposed measure should reduce the travel time and total control delay for the signalized network. To attain the objective the following two studies were undertaken: 1. Development of a queue discharge model to investigate the expected benefits of the system. 2. Simulation of the system: In {{the second part of the}} research, the proposed strategy was tested using CORSIM to evaluate its performance vis-????-vis the baseline case. The queue discharge model (QDM) was found to be linear in nature in contrast to prior expectations. The model was used to quantify the benefits obtained from the pre-signal system. The result of this analysis indicated that the proposed strategy would yield significant travel time savings and reductions in total control delay. In addition to the QDM analysis, CORSIM simulations were used to code various hypothetical scenarios to test the concept under various constraints and limitations. As per expectations, it was found that the system was beneficial for high demand levels and longer offsets. The upper limit on offsets was determined by visual observation of <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion</b> and therefore the maximum offset distance was restricted to 450 feet. For scenarios where split phasing was used, the break even point in terms of demand level was found to be 2500 vph on a three lane approach, whereas that for a lag-lag type of phasing strategy was found to be 1800 vph, also on a three lane approach...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{microprocessor-based}} {{traffic signal}} controllers {{introduced in the}} 1960 s has allowed {{for the development of}} many new strategies to make traffic signal systems more responsive to traffic conditions. Many efforts have focused on the development of real-time, adaptive control strategies. While some of these strategies have been shown to improve intersection performance, there are several factors that have limited their deployment. Some of these include substantial capital cost, complicated calibration procedures, and the reluctance of practicing engineers to deploy strategies radically different from those currently in use. Therefore, lower cost strategies that are compatible with existing infrastructure continue to be explored. This research effort is considered to be in this category. Isolated signalized intersections, which are operated by actuated type controllers, often do not allocate green time in an optimal manner when compared to the temporal distribution of arriving traffic. Current detection schemes are typically used to provide localized detection near the intersection. At isolated intersections, which do not have coordinated timing plans for allowing progression of platoons, timing decisions are based on the binary status of localized detectors. Therefore, when platoons are forced to stop to allow the passage of a few vehicles from a minor phase, excessive stops and delays are created at the intersection. The proposed strategy uses a detection device located several thousand feet upstream from the intersection from which information is processed to identify platoons. When these platoons are detected, the controller is manipulated using low-priority preemption to allow for the platoon to progress through the intersection unimpeded. This research presents a study in which the platoon accommodation strategy was shown to reduce both the percentage of stops and delays for vehicles in the platoon without significantly impacting any of the minor approaches. This system is designed to be a retrofit to existing control equipment. Since the findings were based upon the simulated traffic, an extensive evaluation was conducted comparing field-observed platooning data with data obtained from CORSIM and the Robertson platoon distribution model. To compare field data with simulation and model data, a new procedure that looked at the percentage of vehicles arriving during a specified window was developed. Those quantitative numbers were summarized in easy to visualize charts. Platoon distribution charts were developed for 1) observed field data, 2) modeled CORSIM data, and 3) theoretical models. These charts, contained in the Appendix of the report, provide a rational procedure for estimating the upper bound on the arrival type used in the Highway Capacity calculations for signalized intersection and arterials (Chapters 9 and 11). In general, the observed field platooning characteristics were similar to the simulation model, but not exact. The CORSIM simulation model tended to have more overall <b>platoon</b> <b>dispersion,</b> which would likely provide slightly conservative estimates on benefits...|$|E
