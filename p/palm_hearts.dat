2500|$|Despite {{the plant}} {{diversity}} and dietary variety {{introduced by the}} various collected species, only <b>palm</b> <b>hearts,</b> starch, and bee honey contribute significant energy to the Aché diet. [...] Palm starch {{is the most important}} carbohydrate staple in the Aché diet. Palm trees are cut, then a small [...] "window" [...] is cut in the trunk to test out the inner pith, which when edible is soft and juicy with a high concentration of starch. The growing shoot (heart) is extracted from each cut palm, but this resource has a high water content and provides only a small caloric contribution to the diet.|$|E

40|$|<b>Palm</b> <b>heart</b> is an {{important}} non-timber forest product obtained from various palm species in tropical forests. We studied the effect of four decades of <b>palm</b> <b>heart</b> extraction from the clonal palm Euterpe oleracea at the southern Pacific coast of Colombia. We monitored populations that had been subject {{to a range of}} harvest intensities and used measured vital rates (survival, growth, sexual and clonal reproduction) to construct population matrix models. We then used these models to simulate several harvest scenarios and to project the population dynamics for the next 50 years. Our projections suggest that the currently implemented intensive harvest regimes - which involve up to four harvests per year - result in dramatic demographic changes, primarily affecting seedlings and adults. In addition, current harvest regimes affect the future supply of <b>palm</b> <b>heart,</b> which is projected to drop sharply during the first years following harvest and fails to recover unless a number of stems are spared. Our simulations indicate that the most sustainable scenarios involve annual harvest between 50 % and 75 % of all harvestable stems, without any removal of small shoots from the clumps. Implementation of this regime must be accompanied by other management practices, including planning harvestable areas, marking the stems to be cut during subsequent harvests, assigning harvesters to specific areas, and leaving harvest residues as mulch around clumps. The degradation of populations of E. oleracea directly affects livelihoods of local people, by reducing cash income from <b>palm</b> <b>heart</b> sales and by reducing availability of palm fruits, a locally important food resource.

50|$|The {{fruit and}} seeds of several species {{are used for}} human food, oil {{production}} and fish bait. Leaves are used {{as a source of}} fibre and stems as building material. Species are also used medicinally and as a source of <b>palm</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Barbel palm is {{endangered}} due to {{habitat destruction}} {{to make way}} for sugarcane plantations, and its high value as edible and medicinal plant. The <b>palm</b> <b>heart</b> is a delicacy. About 150 individuals occur in the wild on Mauritius. It is widely grown in cultivation.|$|R
50|$|Despite these obstacles, {{many farmers}} have embraced {{alternative}} crops. In 2006, Bolivia, {{as a result}} of alternative development programs, exported US$28 million of banana, US$1.9 million of pineapple, and US$7.0 million of <b>palm</b> <b>heart.</b> These industries now employ more than 20,000 people in the Chapare region.|$|R
50|$|As {{well as the}} edible fruits, this palm is {{a source}} of prized (though not very nutritious) hearts of palm. Since it is {{generally}} solitary, harvesting <b>palm</b> <b>hearts</b> kills the tree, and has led to a reduction in numbers.|$|E
50|$|As of 2010 {{there was}} some {{surveillance}} of the park by employees, subcontractors and environmental police.The resident population is engaged in subsistence activities, with domestic and farmed animals.Hunting, fishing and extraction of non-timber products, particularly <b>palm</b> <b>hearts,</b> are practiced by inhabitants, squatters and visitors.|$|E
50|$|Like other Muslim Egyptians, Siwis {{celebrate}} Eid al-Fitr (lʕid ahakkik,"the Little Eid") and Eid al-Adha (lʕid azuwwar,"the Big Eid"). Unlike other Egyptians, however, on Id al-Adha Siwis {{cook the}} skin of the sheep (along with its innards) as a festival delicacy, after removing the hair. They also eat <b>palm</b> <b>hearts</b> (agroz).|$|E
50|$|When this palm is {{cultivated}} {{it demands}} generous water, and rich, acidic soil and shade or filtered light. In habitat, the <b>palm</b> <b>heart</b> is consumed {{and the leaves}} are used in thatching. The fruit are often pickled and used {{as a substitute for}} tamarind or made into sweetmeat.|$|R
40|$|This study {{carried out}} an {{economic}} study and a risk simulation analysis in a <b>palm</b> <b>heart</b> of pejibaye (Bactris gasipaes Kunth.) cultivation project.

50|$|Mexican {{palmetto}} {{is grown}} as an ornamental for its robust, stately form, drought tolerance, and hardiness to USDA Zone 8. The wood is resistant to decomposition and shipworms, making it desirable {{for use in}} wharf pilings and fence posts. The leaves are used for thatching and making straw hats. The drupes and <b>palm</b> <b>hearts</b> are eaten.|$|E
50|$|The {{forestall}} exploit is {{the most}} important activity in the area. Nowadays, the population dedicates, in part, to the industrial process of different varieties of wood, such as: cedar, yvyra pyta, lapacho, taperyva guasu, petereby, guatambu, incense, guaica and others. Another important activity is the plantation of pine as a form of reforestation. There's also the exploit of <b>palm</b> <b>hearts.</b>|$|E
50|$|As many {{anthropologists have}} noted, the Chaco groups, {{including}} the Pilagá, have been hunter-gatherers. Hunting includes fishing and collection of honey.

50|$|Voanioala gerardii is {{critically}} endangered {{because of its}} scarcity. Only 10-15 trees are found. They are cut down for their edible <b>palm</b> <b>hearts</b> and their seeds are used for market trade. They are also rare because of its poor dispersal of seeds. Habitat loss through agricultural logging threatens forest coconuts as well. The national park in Masoala Peninsula is protecting the forest coconuts on its property, and its future depends greatly on the effort of the national park. Its population is currently decreasing.|$|E
