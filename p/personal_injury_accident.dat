50|$|In Poynton, Cheshire, it {{was found}} that as well as {{providing}} significant safety improvements, and regenerating the retail and social centre, the road capacity was not reduced after the redevelopment of a busy junction in the town incorporated shared space elements. In the scheme, the redevelopment of a multi-lane signalised crossroads, with a traffic flow of 26,000 vehicles per day, which was completed in March 2012, traffic lanes, signals, road markings, road signs and street clutter were all removed. In the first three years after the redevelopment there was one minor <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> <b>accident,</b> compared to 4-7 serious incidents {{in each of the three}} years leading up to the project. Although no speed limit changes were made, average traffic speeds fell to around 20 mph and there were reductions in vehicle journey times as well as reductions in pedestrian delays at the junction.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Hedonic pricing {{models have}} been used to infer the cost of crime by {{estimating}} property value differences in high versus low crime areas. However, previous studies have been unable to disentangle the cost of individual crimes. This note reports on an attempt to estimate the cost of individual crimes by examining the pain, suffering and fear endured by crime victims. Actual victim injury rates are combined with jury awards in <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> <b>accident</b> cases to estimate pain, suffering and fear. Crime-related death rates are combined with estimates of the value of life to arrive at monetary values for the risk of death. Not only does this approach yield crime-specific cost estimates, but these estimates are quite consistent with the property value methods of valuing aggregate crime. 1...|$|E

40|$|Reliable {{predictive}} accident models (PAMs) {{are essential}} to design and maintain safe road networks and yet the models most commonly used in the UK were derived using data collected 20 to 30 years ago. Given that the national <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> <b>accident</b> total fell by some 30 % in the last 25 years, while road traffic increased by over 60 %, significant errors in scheme appraisal and evaluation based on the models currently in use seem inevitable. In this paper the temporal transferability of PAMs for modern rural single carriageway A-roads is investigated and their predictive performance is evaluated against a recent data set. Despite the age of these models, the PAMs for predicting the total accidents provide a remarkably good fit to recent data and these are more accurate than models where accidents are disaggregated by type. The performance of the models can be improved by calibrating them against recent data...|$|E

Evaluating {{the impact of}} legislation prohibiting hand-held cell phone use while driving. Transportation Research Part A 44, 182 - 193.), Nikolaev et al.

More specifically, they analyze the impact of a state-wide ban on hand-held cell phone use while driving on the number of fatal automobile and personal injury accidents per 100, 000 licensed drivers per year and conclude that the ban had a significant negative impact on both the mean fatal accident rate and the mean <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> <b>accident</b> rate. In this paper I argue that they lack of a good identification strategy that enables them to correctly identify the causal effect of the ban.

30|$|In {{order to}} assess the overall {{incremental}} accident risks of LHD HGV’s while driving in the RHD environment in Great Britain, a relative risk analysis in terms of Odds Ratio Analysis was undertaken with respect to relative annual vehicle-km driven by UK registered HGV’s as against foreign registered HGV’s, number of reported road accidents involving (i) at least one heavy goods vehicle and (ii) at least one foreign registered heavy goods vehicle in Great Britain in a typical year. The relevant tonne-kilometres and vehicle-kilometres data for UK registered as well as foreign registered vehicles were derived from DfT Road Freight Statistics [7] as revised in 2008 [10], and corresponding accident data for HGV’s during 2005 to 2007 were collected from DfT’s annual publication ‘Road Casualties Great Britain’ in from [6] to 2008. The Odds Ratios, which are equivalent to relative risks, for personal injury accidents of LHD HGV’s while driving in left side in the UK were estimated in relation to proportional annual vehicle-km driven. The average Odds Ratios for slight injury, serious injury and fatal accidents for LHD HGV’s during 2005 to 2007 were 1.69, 1.16 and 1.10 respectively. This implies that the LHD HGV’s were 69  %, 16  % and 10  % more at risk of participating a slight injury, serious injury and a fatal accident respectively than RHD HGV’s in the UK. The weighted average Odds Ratio for <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> <b>accident</b> was 1.61 indicating that relative risk of driving LHD HGV’s having opposite steering wheel control was 61  % higher in comparison to RHD HGV’s in the UK. The same relative incremental risks for personal injury (+ 61  %) and fatal (+ 10  %) accidents were adopted {{in the present study}} for determination of accident impacts of HGV’s, having opposite-side steering wheel control, in Rwanda.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} for analyzing the necessity and effectiveness of forgiving roadside design that aims to mitigate the consequences of run-off-road accidents (RORA). A framework is presented, which comprises the development of road, vehicle and driver models in order to simulate specific RORA scenarios. These scenarios are based on data taken from the Austrian road accident database that contains more than 650, 000 <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> since 1994. Three-dimensional road models (including the roadside) created from laser measurements allow integrating accurate replications of existing accident high-risk sites in simulation. For each “virtual” high-risk site, the roadside is then modified with appropriate safety treatments, before run-off-road accidents are simulated. Indicators for the effectiveness of roadside treatments are the head injury criterion (HIC) and the abbreviated injury scale (AIS) Simulation {{results show that the}} risk of fatal injuries strongly declines with forgiving roadside design. For a specific accident high-risk site, safety treatments with hard and soft shoulders are investigated in the simulation. The results show that the implementation of hard shoulders mitigates the risk of severe injuries...|$|R

In Hungary from 2011 GPS coordinates are used to identify the location of <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> <b>accidents.</b> This method significantly improves the display of locations of accidents on the map, which can be then analyzed using GIS tools. Accident black spots are the most dangerous places in road networks identified by the density of the accidents in the network. One of the analysis methods is the accident density searching. The methods and algorithms used in some software may show differences in relation to one another. The aim of this research is comparing two applications by investigating the local road network in Győr. The analysis was made using the WEB-BAL accident analysis software using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise procedure and the QGIS software using the kernel density estimation method. The former is the official accident database and online software used for accident investigations and the latter is an open source geographic information system.

Useful changes in technology and patterns of use are available now, but their use will raise the question {{as to whether or not}} environmental considerations can override conventional financial constraints. Changes in standards and the basis of design are much more long term. Comparisons of road lighting standards used in different countries show significant differences that deserve examination. As for the basis of design, consideration of the importance of light to fatal and <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> of different types suggests that road lighting should be concentrated where pedestrians are common, not where speeds are highest. Ultimately, considering carefully what problem road lighting is intended to solve and whether or not road lighting is the best answer is the key to minimising the energy consumption of road lighting without diminishing road safety. 1...|$|R

40|$|Treating sleep apnoea is cost {{effective}} The paper by George 1 showing {{a decrease in}} road accidents with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in the July issue of Thoraxwas accompanied by an editorial quanti-fying the cost savings based on USA accident costs. 2 As most sleep services in the UK are hav-ing difficulty funding CPAP treatment, {{there is a need}} to put the cost benefits into a UK context, which we have done using George’s data. According to the UK Department of Trans-port official figures for 1999, 3 fatal accidents cost £ 1 253 140 each, <b>accidents</b> with <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> cost £ 49 800, and property damage only accidents cost £ 1300 each. George’s study was performed in Ontario and examined acci-dents involving either <b>personal</b> <b>injury,</b> more than $ 500 of damage, or a traffic violation. In 1999 Ontario had 221 962 such accidents, of which 763 were fatal, 55 764 were associated with <b>personal</b> <b>injury,</b> and 165 435 with prop-erty damage only. 4 Thus, using George’s data, 1 treating 500 patients with CPAP for 5 years would prevent 1. 03 fatal accidents at a saving of £ 1. 292 mil-lion, 75. 4 <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> at a saving of £ 3. 753 million, and 224 property damage accidents at a cost saving of £ 0. 290 million. The total accident related cost saving would therefore be £ 5. 335 million compared with a treatment cost of £ 0. 4 million (500 CPAP units at £ 300 and £ 100 per annum for consumables and follow up costs), giving a saving of £ 4. 935 million at a 12. 3 -fold return on pounds spent. These savings do not take into account those from the marked and now well docu-mented improvements in work performance, quality of life, 5 and blood pressure, 6 and decrease in hospitalisation costs 7 resulting from CPAP treatment.

The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a {{superseding}} intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> car <b>accident,</b> where the person re-injures an old injury.

He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. [...] A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.|$|R
40|$|Sections 7, 8 and 28 A of the Civil Law Act 19561 are enacted to {{regulate}} the assessment of damages for <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> and fatal <b>accident</b> claims arising out of motor vehicle accidents. The provisions aim to control the quantum of damages being meted out by the courts. Despite the good intention of the legislature, the provisions have been viewed with disfavour by many as a legislative attempt to reduce the quantum of damages and/or fetter or worst still, to divest the judiciary of their discretion {{in the assessment of}} damages. The actual impacts on judicial discretion and the quantum of damages are however yet to be fully worked out. Therefore, this research is to be welcomed as it seeks to critically appraise the actual effects of sections 7, 8 and 28 A of the CLA 1956 on the exercise of judicial discretion and the quantum of damages being awarded by the courts. The same critical appraisal is also extended to section 11 of the CLA 1956, the court rules relating to the assessment of interest on damages as well as the provisions relating to the assessment of damages in Singapore and Brunei. This research applied both the descriptive and analytical approach. Malaysian data have been collected from primary and secondary sources together with interviews with legal practitioners and representatives from several Malaysian insurance companies. This research began with the proposition that despite the provisions in the CLA 1956 and court rules, judges in Malaysia still retain their discretion (albeit with statutory interventions) in assessing damages and interest on damages for <b>personal</b> <b>injury</b> and fatal <b>accident</b> claims arising out of motor vehicle accidents. It concluded that sections 7, 8, 11, 28 A of the CLA 1956 and Order 42 Rule 12 of the Rules of Court have resulted in mixed effects on the judges’ discretionary power; total abolition of discretionary power, maintaining the discretionary power as it was before the 1984 amendments, maintaining the discretionary power but with restrictions and mere codification of existing practices. The research also provides several suggestions for statutory amendment in order to rectify the problems with sections 7, 8, 11, 28 A of the CLA 1956 and Order 42 Rule 12 of the Rules of Court 2012.
