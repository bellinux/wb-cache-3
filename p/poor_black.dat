5|$|Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is a 1971 American {{independent}} action thriller film written, produced, scored, edited, directed by and starring Melvin Van Peebles. His son Mario Van Peebles also {{appears in a}} small role, playing the title character as a young boy. It tells the picaresque story of a <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> man on his flight from the white authority.|$|E
5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups and classes persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E
25|$|Resident {{advocates of}} the housing {{initiative}} were treated with abuse and threats. Leading advocate Ethel Lawrence, a <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> resident who lived her life in Mount Laurel, had her house repeatedly vandalized, and once her bedroom window was damaged by gunfire. Longtime white residents also tried to force the <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> residents out of town. Although the court {{ruled in favor of}} creating affordable housing, residents did manage to delay the process for decades.|$|E

25|$|Historians found {{evidence}} {{that most of the}} African-American staff who assisted the Tuskegee Experiments believed that {{they were part of a}} medical experiment that was in the best interests overall of <b>poor</b> <b>Black</b> residents of Tuskegee.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015, there was rioting in black neighborhoods. The city invited the Department of Justice to conduct an {{investigation}} of the police department and its relations with the community. It found evidence of widespread unconstitutional and discriminatory police practices in the city, especially in <b>poor,</b> <b>black</b> neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, Brown {{heard of}} Gerrit Smith's Adirondack land grants to <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> men, {{and decided to}} move his family among the new settlers. He bought land near North Elba, New York (near Lake Placid), for $1 an acre ($2 /ha), and spent 2 years there. After he was executed, his wife took his body there for burial. Since 1895, the farm has been owned by New York state. The John Brown Farm and Gravesite is now a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
50|$|During Long's {{years in}} power, great strides {{were made in}} infrastructure, {{education}} and health care. Long was notable among southern politicians for avoiding race baiting. He sought to improve the lot of <b>poor</b> <b>blacks</b> as well as poor whites.|$|R
50|$|Haiti's mulatto elite {{was in a}} {{state of}} {{constant}} conflict with the Estimé regime, which it saw as discriminatory against light-skinned people. From below, labor leader Daniel Fignolé attacked Estimé for not going far enough to empower <b>poor</b> <b>blacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Scholars Stanford M. Lyman and Arthur J. Vidich have {{compared}} {{his idea of}} forcing the <b>poor,</b> <b>blacks,</b> single mothers and the unemployed youth to work to the earlier notion of 'warrantism' espoused by Henry Hughes in the Antebellum South.|$|R
25|$|On October 17, 2008, White {{was arrested}} in Roanoke, Virginia by the FBI. The arrest stemmed from an alleged threat White made against a federal juror {{involved}} in the 2004 Matthew F. Hale case and posting the juror's personal information online. White was held without bond. Other counts against White, filed December 11, 2008, included alleged threats he made against <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> tenants suing their landlords, and threats against others, including Warman, columnist Leonard Pitts, former South Harrison Township, New Jersey mayor Charles Tyson, and a university administrator from Delaware.|$|E
25|$|Barry {{was active}} in the {{aftermath}} of the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis. He organized through Pride Inc. a program of free food distribution for <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> residents whose homes and neighborhoods had been destroyed in the rioting. Barry convinced the Giant Food supermarket chain to donate food, and he spent a week driving trucks and delivering food throughout the city's housing projects. He also became a board member of the city's Economic Development Committee, helping to route federal funds and venture capital to black-owned businesses that were struggling to recover from the riots.|$|E
25|$|Liberty Hall {{is said to}} have {{admitted}} its first African-American student when John Chavis, a free black, enrolled in 1795. Chavis accomplished much in his life including fighting in the American Revolution, studying at both Liberty Hall and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), becoming an ordained Presbyterian minister, and opening a school that instructed white and <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> students in North Carolina. He {{is believed to be the}} first black student to enroll in higher education in the United States, although he did not receive a degree. Washington and Lee enrolled its next African-American student in 1966 in the law school.|$|E

50|$|Some black shoppers try {{to avoid}} racial {{discrimination}} either by avoiding white-owned businesses entirely or by deliberately dressing in a middle-class style. Because they are likelier {{to live and work}} in majority-white neighbourhoods, middle-class black people experience more racial profiling than <b>poorer</b> <b>black</b> people.|$|R
60|$|The Englishmen in Africa went even further, {{saying that}} these <b>poor</b> <b>blacks</b> were held in virtual slavery, since after their terms of {{enlistment}} expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and {{they were told that}} they had yet several years to serve.|$|R
25|$|Also, in 1961, she had 25 of {{her works}} {{exhibited}} at the Canisius College Library. She had a solo exhibition of 38 paintings and a few drawings at Central Park Gallery in Buffalo, New York, from 1968-69. In 1967, another solo show at the Sisti Gallery resulted in a near sell-out of her paintings, two of which were purchased by newspaper art critics. In spring 1968, the Lakeview Gallery of Art in Hamburg, New York, hosted a three-generational exhibit featuring the work of Charles Burchfield, Martha Burchfield and, Peggy Richter, who was only 19 years old and a volunteer working with Trinity Lutheran Church {{on the lower east}} side New York City to help <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> and Puerto Rican families.|$|E
25|$|A {{previously}} unknown manuscript of a 1941 novel by McKay was authenticated in 2012. The manuscript, Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the <b>Poor</b> <b>Black</b> Sheep of Harlem, {{was discovered by}} Columbia graduate student Jean-Christophe Cloutier in the Samuel Roth Papers, a previously untouched university archive at Columbia University, in 2009. The novel centers on the ideas and events that animated Harlem {{on the cusp of}} World War II (such as Benito Mussolini’s invasion of Ethiopia). Working in collaboration, Professor Cloutier (now at the University of Pennsylvania) and his advisor Professor Brent Hayes Edwards successfully authenticated the manuscript, and have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction about how it was found and its provenance verified.|$|E
25|$|Kenan's first novel, A Visitation of Spirits, was {{published}} in 1989. While a few critics praised the book, it did not receive much attention. This changed with the publication in 1992 of Kenan's second book, {{a collection of short}} stories titled Let the Dead Bury Their Dead. The stories, based in the fictional community of Tims Creek, focused on (among other things) what it meant to be <b>poor,</b> <b>black,</b> and gay in the southern United States. The book was hailed as a revival of classic southern literature and was nominated for the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Fiction, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and was named a New York Times Notable Book. The short story collection also brought renewed attention to his first novel, which was likewise set in Tims Creek.|$|E
25|$|Segregation affects {{people from}} all social classes. For example, a survey {{conducted}} in 2000 found that middle-income, suburban Blacks live in neighborhoods with many more whites than do <b>poor,</b> inner-city <b>blacks.</b> But their neighborhoods {{are not the same}} as those of whites having the same socioeconomic characteristics; and, in particular, middle-class blacks tend to live with white neighbors who are less affluent than they are. While, in a significant sense, they are less segregated than <b>poor</b> <b>blacks,</b> race still powerfully shapes their residential options.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, President Harry S. Truman {{ordered the}} end of racial {{discrimination}} in the U.S. Army, proposed {{the creation of a}} permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission, supported the elimination of state poll taxes (which effectively discriminated against <b>poor</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites in voting), and supported drafting federal anti-lynching laws.|$|R

25|$|Donald McAdams {{wrote that}} in the 1990s, within trustee District 5 there were schools that were about 50% White that usually had ample parent support and {{stronger}} test scores while there were schools about 90% or higher minorities that had low test scores and little to no parent support. He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had minority children {{as long as the}} minority children tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them. Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were comfortable with their presence. He added that very <b>poor</b> <b>black</b> children tended to go to their neighborhood schools outside of District 5. McAdams also stated that White middle class parents did not consider Asians and Asian Americans to be minorities who could make a school less attractive to them. In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, non-English speaking Central American students at some HISD neighborhood schools made them unattractive to White parents.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{champion}} Joe Louis {{announced that}} he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his <b>poor,</b> <b>black</b> roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and clutched onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that he screamed because he had been hit with a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling's knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly stepped away from the ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.|$|E

5000|$|By 1950, {{the number}} of blacks had risen to 155,000, {{comprising}} about 55 {{percent of the population}} of Bedford-Stuyvesant. Over the next decade, real estate agents and speculators employed blockbusting to make quick profits. As a result, formerly middle-class white homes were turned over to <b>poorer</b> <b>black</b> families. By 1960, eighty-five percent of the population was black.|$|R
50|$|After marrying {{at the age}} of {{thirteen}} to French Wilson, Ann and her husband moved from the countryside to Durham in hopes of better job opportunities, as the city had large tobacco and textile industries. At the time, Durham had a fairly large black population, with a considerable portion of educated, middle-class blacks in addition to white residents and <b>poor</b> <b>blacks.</b> Poverty was still a problem in the segregated society; 28% of families lived below the designated poverty line of $3000 in 1950. The <b>poor</b> <b>blacks</b> of Durham had to fight both racial and class divisions: one against the whites who claimed superiority and another against the wealthier blacks {{who did not want to}} associate themselves with the lower class. Such struggles helped shape Atwater as an activist. Durham's prosperous black business sector made the city a beacon of hope for African Americans seeking to rise through self-help.|$|R
50|$|After {{the passage}} of Reagan's Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1986, incarceration for non-violent offenses {{dramatically}} increased. The Act imposed the same five-year mandatory sentence on those with convictions involving crack as on those possessing 100 times as much powder cocaine. This had a disproportionate effect on low-level street dealers and users of crack, who were more commonly <b>poor</b> <b>blacks,</b> Latinos, the young, and women.|$|R
500|$|Rangel {{has been}} long been {{opposed to the}} all-volunteer army and {{repeatedly}} called {{for the government to}} bring back the draft (military conscription). In 2003, Rangel said a draft would make the military more representative of the American public at large, that [...] "the <b>poor,</b> <b>black</b> and brown shouldn’t be the only Americans fighting and dying in Iraq", and that [...] "Fairness dictates that {{the sons and daughters of}} the white middle and upper classes share the burden of war". During 2006, Rangel said that no soldier would be fighting in Iraq if they had decent career possibilities and stated that: ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{explains}} in the book's prologue why {{she wrote the}} book, which was to explain how she became, despite being born <b>poor,</b> <b>Black,</b> and female, a renowned author and poet. [...] The book {{is divided into two}} sections: the first 13 chapters are grouped into the first section, called [...] "Mom & Me", and the remaining chapters make up the second section, called [...] "Me & Mom". [...] Angelou thanks her mother, [...] "who generously taught me how to be a mother", which allowed her to dedicate the book to her son, Guy Bailey Johnson, whom she calls [...] "one of the most courageous and generous men I know".|$|E
500|$|Conversely, {{reflecting}} the transformation from script to screen, Dana Stevens of Slate disagrees with Gleiberman's {{suggestion that the}} [...] "film makes you think" [...] and argues that the film's [...] "eagerness" [...] to [...] "drag" [...] the audience [...] "through the lower depths of human experience" [...] leaves little space for independent [...] "conclusions". Stevens noted that while the film is about improvement and self-actualization, [...] "it wields an awfully large cudgel" [...] in contrast to Scott's view of balance: [...] "unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail)". Perhaps sharing Mathews' view regarding the daunting challenge of adapting the harsh story of Push, Stevens' observes that [...] "Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice {{to the kind of}} protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a <b>poor,</b> <b>black,</b> overweight single mother from the inner city." ...|$|E
50|$|The Ex-Colored Man {{believed}} the desperate class consists of <b>poor</b> <b>blacks</b> who loathe the whites. The domestic worker class comprises blacks who work as servants to whites. And the artisans, skilled workers, and black professionals class included blacks who had little {{interaction with the}} whites. Many white readers, who viewed all blacks as a stereotype of a single class, were unfamiliar with class distinctions described among blacks.|$|R
50|$|Other African American leaders, {{including}} {{the president of the}} state NAACP, Derrick Johnson, {{and the director of the}} ACLU of Mississippi, Nsombi Lambright, called for justice for the victims of Melton's unorthodox and illegal crime-fighting strategies. They said he was profiling <b>poor</b> <b>blacks</b> in the city. Those groups are leading an effort to start a civilian review board, in part in response to Melton's methods.|$|R
50|$|The new Voting Rights Act of 1965 had no {{immediate}} effect on living conditions for <b>poor</b> <b>blacks.</b> A {{few days after}} the act became law, a riot broke out in the South Central Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts. Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents confronted a largely white police department that had a history of abuse against blacks.|$|R
