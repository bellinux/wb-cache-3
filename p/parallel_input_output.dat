40|$|Two factors {{strongly}} inuenced {{the research}} in high performance computing {{in the last few}} years, the I/O bottleneck and cluster systems. Firstly, for many supercomputing applications the limiting factor is not the number of available CPUs anymore, but the bandwidth of the disk I/O system. Secondly, a shift from the classical, costly supercomputer systems to aordable clusters of workstations is apparent, which allows problem solutions to a much lower price.

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{interleaved}} series <b>input</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>output</b> ZVS forward converter (ISIPO ZVSFC) {{is proposed}} in this paper. The series <b>input</b> and <b>parallel</b> <b>output</b> architecture enables the converter cells {{to share the}} <b>input</b> voltage and <b>output</b> current equally. The interleaved operation diminishes the output current ripple in the output capacitor. That reduces {{the size of the}} output filter. By using active-clamp circuit and resonant circuit, the converter can achieve ZVS operation for all the main and auxiliary switches. The active-clamp circuit is also used to reset the energy stored in the leakage inductor to minimize the voltage spike on switching devices.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a mechanism with the following specifications: continuous alternate motion, wide motion phases with constant angular velocity, <b>parallel</b> <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> shafts, and great strokes. Those specifications derive from a possible application in the textile field. The mechanism is composed of two star wheels properly coupled together: there are two counter-rotating input wheels, alternately coupling with slots first, then teeth at each side of the output wheel. As usual for star wheels, pins and slots handle the acceleration and deceleration phases, while the constant velocity phase is performed by coupling sectors of toothed gears. A proper design of pins and slots is performed, so {{that at the same time}} when a pin from one input wheel is releasing a slot, a pin from the other input wheel engages a slot on the other side of the output wheel, forcing the latter to an opposite motion. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion. By annihilating the arrest phases typical of star wheels, the proposed system eliminates the discontinuities in the acceleration diagram. The paper develops a complete parametrical analysis of the device, underlining the effect of the constraints on the shape of the motion laws with particular emphasis on the acceleration and deceleration phases. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion.

It investigates the requirements necessary for users to work more effectively with next-generation spatial interfaces, specifically {{in the context of}} scientific visualization and artistic 3 D modeling where users currently struggle to express complex spatial concepts. Examples of expressive spatial interfaces are presented and evaluated. In particular, we present new techniques for combining multi-touch with free-hand gestures for navigating visualizations and performing 3 D surface modeling operations. Techniques for selecting and filtering volumetric data using lightweight props as well as active force-feedback are also introduced. Additionally, we present a spatial modeling interface for artistic 3 D modeling using contextual interpretation of the user's input. Several conclusions are drawn from these examples. Rich, <b>parallel</b> <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> streams enabled by recent advances in tracking hardware are particularly important for expressive interfaces. Additionally, {{there is a need for}} tighter integration of two and three-dimensional data and input. Contextual interpretation of user input enables users to specify more complex 3 D concepts. Finally, many spatial tasks require immediate feedback to be expressive. The primary contribution of this dissertation is a new class of interaction techniques called Expressive Spatial Interfaces that advance beyond the limited pointing and rotating interactions common in current-generation spatial interfaces.
