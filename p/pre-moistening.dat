40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{quantitative}} bacterial recovery of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in nasal screenings by utilizing dry or moistened swabs within an in vivo and an in vitro experimental setting. 135 nasal MRSA carriers were each swabbed in one nostril {{with a dry}} {{and in the other}} one with a moistened rayon swab. Quantitative bacterial recovery was measured by standard viable count techniques. Furthermore, an anatomically correct artificial nose model was inoculated with a numerically defined suspension of MRSA and swabbed with dry and moistened rayon, polyurethane-foam and nylon-flocked swabs to test these different settings and swab-materials under identical laboratory conditions. In vivo, quantities of MRSA per nostril in carriers varied between 107 colony forming units, with a median of 2. 15 x 104 CFU. However, no statistically significant differences could be detected for the recovery of MRSA quantities when swabbing nasal carriers with moist or dry rayon swabs. In vitro testing confirmed the in vivo data for swabs with rayon, polyurethane and nylon-flocked tips, since <b>pre-moistening</b> of swabs did not significantly affect the quantities of retrieved bacteria. Therefore, <b>pre-moistening</b> of swabs prior to nasal MRSA sampling provides no advantage in terms of recovering greater bacterial quantities and therefore can be omitted. In addition, this situation can be mimicked in an in vitro model, thereby providing a useful basis for future in vitro testings of new swab types or target organisms for screening approaches...|$|E

40|$|Steel fibres {{are often}} applied as crack {{reinforcement}} in overlays even though methods {{for the design}} with respect to crack widths are not yet available. Thus, the intention was for the research to form a basis for future design of overlays with respect to cracks. A main ambition was to give guidance on e. g. type of steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) required to limit crack widths and how to prepare the substrate surface {{in order to produce}} a high and even base restraint. Test methods and theoretical analysis has been applied to fulfil the aims. The experimental part consisted of end-restrained shrinkage tests, bond tests and half scale overlay tests. End-restrained shrinkage and half scale overlay tests were conducted in order to evaluate the effect of steel fibres for different restraint situations while the bond tests were intended to give information regarding the appropriateness of different substrate treatments from a bond strength perspective. Test results showed that the situation of restraint has a significant influence on the cracking response. A single crack developed if the overlay was restrained only at the ends for both un-reinforced concrete as well as for SFRC. However, the crack width was found to be reduced due to the addition of steel fibres. In case of a continuous restraint provided by bond to the substrate on the other hand, numerous well distributed, fine cracks were observed. For this situation there was no measurable influence of fibres on the width and distribution of cracks. A conclusion is thus that reinforcement is not required in case of thin overlays (depths of 50 mm have been studied) if a high and even bond strength is obtained. Test results verified that high bond strength can be achieved by <b>pre-moistening</b> the substrate prior to overlaying, in combination with thorough cleaning. However, the substrate should be allowed to dry back prior to overlaying, as a wet surface was shown to be deteriorating for the bond strength. Caution is also recommended if the overlay is cast onto a dry substrate. In case of insufficient bond strength, with an apparent risk for partial debonding, i. e. parts of the overlay debond while other parts are still bonded, reinforcement is however required to limit crack widths. A theoretical method has been proposed for the design of SFRC for such situations and predictions have been verified through comparisons with experimental results.

40|$|Phytophthora de Bary {{species are}} among the most notorious plant {{pathogens}} capable of causing large-scale damage to plant communities as well as enormous economic loss in agriculture, horticulture, forestry and natural environments worldwide. Disease caused by P. cinnamomi in Victoria apparently declined during the long drought in Victoria and P. cinnamomi became undetectable in several previously infested areas. This research project focused on studying the effect of drought (from 1996 to 2009) and bushfires on the presence and survival of P. cinnamomi at such sites. The project focused on identifying any possible misidentification or unidentified species among previously collected isolates thought to be P. cinnamomi, studying their pathogenicity and the implications of more than Phytophthora species on the same host. Sampling conducted at 32 sites in 4 Victorian National Parks showed that Kinglake National Park had the greatest rate of infection at 100 %, followed by Wilsons Promontory National Park (88 %), Brisbane Ranges National Park (60 %) and lastly the Grampians National Park (46 %). It was concluded that the absence of susceptible host plants was a major factor responsible for the decline in disease in Victoria and not just drought as previously thought. Even high-intensity fires did not eliminate P. cinnamomi from the soil. Fire restored disease symptoms and detection of P. cinnamomi in previously infested areas but not until at least a year after the fire, when susceptible host plants had re-grown. Smoke water inhibited growth of P. cinnamomi and could possibly be used as an efficient and economical control measure. Seventeen of the ninety-one isolates (18 %) previously collected by various researchers were misidentified as P. cinnamomi. Phytophthora species such as P. cryptogea P. gonapodyides and P. niederhauserii, and Pythium species such as P. undulatum, P. sterilum, Pythium sp. UZ 612 and P. helicandrum were identified among the culture collections using DNA sequencing and PCR-RFLP. A modified and efficient method for isolation and detection of P. cinnamomi from field-collected samples was designed. The procedure included collection of whole sample with roots, litter and soil, <b>pre-moistening</b> and incubation of soil samples at 28 °C for 2 days prior to baiting, use of Pimelea ferruginea leaves as baits and using V 8 agar as the medium for studying growth and sporulation of P. cinnamomi. This method significantly increased the rate of P. cinnamomi isolation, from 40 % to 70 % of samples. A combination of different Phytophthora species, including P. cinnamomi, P. cryptogea and P. niederhauserii, when inoculated on germinated lupins showed that larger lesions and significantly greater root restriction was observed when two different Phytophthora species were present in the same host as compared to the presence of any single Phytophthora species.

40|$|Poor {{estimation}} of the water absorption coefficient (WA) of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) engenders inadequate effective water for the recycled aggregate concrete (RAC), leading to poor mechanical properties or poor workability. Pre-saturation of RCA before mixing could appear as a potential technical solution. However, pre-saturation before mixing is a complex task that is most generally not applied in RAC manufacturing. Therefore, better knowledge of in-situ RCA water absorption capacity is necessary. This paper focuses on the influence on the water absorption capacity of i) the initial moisture of RCA, and ii) their heterogeneity. For this purpose, 6. 3 / 10 mm RCA were pre-wetted using different methods simulating long-term (LT) and short-term (ST) <b>pre-moistened</b> aggregates. It is shown that this <b>pre-moistened</b> history (LT or ST) leads to different levels of total water absorption for a same initial moisture level. The difference lies between 0 and 1 %, depending on the initial moisture level. In addition, the heterogeneity of RCA was investigated by separating samples of RCA into classes of densities using a water jig.

We use this technique on a LES of a shallow cumulus cloud field {{based upon the}} Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX) to calculate statistics of cloud height, lifetime, and other physical properties for individual clouds in the model. We also examine the question of nature versus nurture in shallow cumulus clouds: do properties at cloud base determine the upper-level properties of the clouds (nature), or are cloud properties determined by the environmental conditions they encounter (nurture). We find that clouds which ascend through an environment that has been <b>pre-moistened</b> by previous cloud activity are {{no more likely to}} reach the inversion than clouds that ascend through a drier environment. Cloud base thermodynamic properties are uncorrelated with upper-level cloud properties, while mean fractional entrainment and detrainment rate displays moderate correlations with cloud properties up to the inversion. Conversely, cloud base area correlates well with upper-level cloud area and maximum cloud height. We conclude that cloud thermodynamic properties are primarily influenced by entrainment and detrainment processes, cloud area and height are primarily influenced by cloud base area, and thus nature and nurture both play roles in the dynamics of BOMEX shallow cumulus clouds...|$|R

The main objective was to promote the geotechnical evaluation of soil samples from four cut slopes in residual soil profiles of highways and local secondary roads in order to assess the potential of the anthropic impact on the soil susceptibility to accelerated erosion processes. Soil samples were named: red residual soil (RRS); pink residual soil (PRS); yellow residual soil (YRS); and white residual soil (WRS). The methodology used consisted of geotechnical characterization tests, infiltration rate and modified mass loss by immersion tests performed on soil samples from these profiles, using the physical parameters and indirect assessment of erodibility proposed in 2000 by Bastos et al. The results of indirect assessment of erodibility, which were derived from tests based on the MCT methodology, highlighted the different susceptibility of the investigated soils to hydric erosion. The parameters proposed by the referred authors were complementary to conventional criteria for an adequate classification of tropical soils into their respective classes of erodibility. Among the tested soil samples, the highest erodibility was associated with the YRS and PRS, respectively, in the natural and <b>pre-moistened</b> conditions, as well as it was not detected erodibility in the RRS and WRS. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Resistance to {{antimicrobial}} agents {{is a major}} concern worldwide and is exemplified by the global spread of the Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Health care workers (HCWs) and asymptomatically colonized patients are important sources of nosocomial MRSA infections. Aims and Objectives: To determine the prevalence of MRSA colonisation, two hundred HCWs and 200 consecutive outpatients attending our tertiary care hospital were studied. Material and Methods: Two sterile <b>pre-moistened</b> cotton tipped swabs were used to collect specimens from their anterior nares. These were inoculated immediately on Blood agar with oxacillin, Mannitol salt agar with oxacillin and CHROM agar. Resistance to cefoxitin was confirmed by PCR by demonstration of mecA gene. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method and MIC of vancomycin by using broth dilution and Vitek- 2 Compact system. Results: The nasal carriage of MRSA among HCWs was found to be 7. 5 % and in outpatients 3 %. All strains of MRSA from HCWs and outpatients grew on three selective media and mecA gene amplified in all of them. All the isolated strains of MRSA showed high degree of resistance to co-trimoxazole (93. 3 %), ciprofloxacin (80 %) and erythromycin (66. 66 %). However, there was 100 % susceptiability to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and Rifampicin. Conclusion: Although a direct casual relationship could not be established, it could be assumed that the transmission from colonised health care worker is responsible atleast in part for MRSA infection among patients. Therefore emphasis should be laid on strict implementation of standard infection control practices which would help in minimizing the carriage and transmission of MRSA in the hospital...|$|R

These creatures are not just nuisances. Some may inflict painful bites, cause rashes or lesions, or, in some cases, transmit important diseases. One way in which you might protect yourself is by staying inside during times of peak insect activity. For example, most mosquitoes are often more active during the early morning or late evening. Some horse flies are more active during the bright, sunny hours of the day. Wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts will protect you from insects by reducing the exposed areas of the body. Louisiana’s hot, humid summers can make outdoor conditions unbearable, however, if you dress too warmly. If you choose or are required to be outside when insects are active, use a repellent. Repellents are chemical substances that protect people from insect attack by making the body unattractive or offensive to insects.

Sample collection tubes containing the polyester swabs were thoroughly mixed using vortex to release any attached microbial cells. The total ATP content was measured in replicates (a minimum of three per sample) using well-established procedures (Venkateswaran et al. 2003). The ATP assay employed 0.1  mL of sample and 0.1  mL of a detergent solution for cell lysis. The lysis solution provided by the manufacturer contained benzalkonium chloride and a proprietary ATP-releasing agent.

Approximately 24  h before departure from the country, roots of terrestrial orchids were carefully lifted from soil and rinsed off with UV-irradiated and/or bottled water to remove organic debris to comply with US and UK important regulations. Lateral branch roots were detached and placed over a <b>pre-moistened</b> cotton ball in a pre-sterilized glass vial (8  ml capacity). The screw cap was then tightened firmly and wrapped with a strip of Parafilm “M” (Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Menasha, WI, USA. Caps on glass vials containing roots of lithophytes and epiphytes were also tightened and wrapped with Parafilm “M” at that same time (ca. 24  h prior to departure by air). All sealed glass vials were then housed in 50  ml plastic (shatter-proof) centrifuge vials which were also firmly tightened and sealed with Parafilm “M”. Vials were re-packed into insulated handbags and transported back to labs in the USA and UK as cabin luggage to ensure that samples were maintained at ambient temperature during the duration of each flight.|$|R
40|$|Background: Nosocomial infections {{acquired}} during hospitalization {{depend on}} the characteristics of the microorganisms, with a high risk of these being acquired when the environment is contaminated. Cross-transmission of microorganisms by contaminated surfaces and the hands of health care workers are considered to be the main route of the spread of nosocomial infections and in many Mexican hospitals, information about microbial and fungi contaminants on indoor surfaces is insufficient. Objectives: In this study, we explore the bacterial and fungal genera present on surfaces taken from; armrest beds, wash sinks, medical tables, and the hands of medical staff from emergency, intensive care unit, inhalation therapy, stomatology and pediatric areas. Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted in a hospital located in Xalapa City in Mexico; the samples were taken during a 6 month period from August to December, 2010. Surface swab specimens were collected from predefined surfaces with cotton tipped applicators, <b>pre-moistened</b> with sterile saline and inoculated on Sabouraud dextrose or selective Eosin-Methylene Blue agar plates and incubated for 1 to 7 days at 28 °C or 37 °C in three triplications in order to isolate bacterial and fungal contaminants. Results: We isolated and identified gram-negative bacteria and fungi and the results showed that the predominant bacteria were; Klebsiella spp. Pseudomonas spp. and E coli spp. The predominant genera of fungi were; Cladosporium spp. Microsporum canis., Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. Conclusions: This study showed that all areas of the hospital have pathogenic fungi and bacteria, indicating that these are a potential source of cross-infection from the hands of health care workers to their patients [...] Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:Identification of bacterial and fungal contamination in indoor surfaces would be the key elements in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} aseptic techniques that can be applied and contribute to better preventive measures against infectious diseases caused by nosocomial pathogens.

40|$|The number {{concentration}} of activated CCN (Na) {{is the most}} fundamental microphysical property of a convective cloud. It determines the rate of droplet growth with cloud depth and conversion into precipitation-sized particles and affects the radiative properties of the clouds. However, measuring Na is not always possible, even in the cores of the convective clouds, because entrainment of sub-saturated ambient air deeper into the cloud lowers the concentrations by dilution and may cause partial or total droplet evaporation, {{depending on whether the}} mixing is homogeneous or extreme inhomogeneous, respectively. Here we describe a methodology to derive Na based on the rate of cloud droplet effective radius (Re) growth with cloud depth and with respect to the cloud mixing with the entrained ambient air. We use the slope of the tight linear relationship between the adiabatic liquid water mixing ratio and Re 3 (or Rv 3 ) to derive an upper limit for Na assuming extreme inhomogeneous mixing. Then we tune Na down to find the theoretical relative humidity that the entrained ambient air would have for each horizontal cloud penetration, in case of homogeneous mixing. This allows us to evaluate both the entrainment and mixing process in the vertical dimension in addition to getting a better estimation for Na. We found that the derived Na from the entire profile data is highly correlated with the independent CCN measurements from below cloud base. Moreover, it was found that mixing of sub-saturated ambient air into the cloud at scales of ~ 100 m and above is inclined towards the extreme inhomogeneous limit, i. e. that the time scale of droplet evaporation is significantly smaller than that for turbulent mixing. This means that ambient air that entrains the cloud is <b>pre-moistened</b> by total evaporation of cloud droplets before it mixes deeper into the clouds where it can hardly change the droplet size distribution, hence Re remains close to its adiabatic value at any given cloud depth. However, the tendency towards the extreme inhomogeneous mixing appeared to slightly decrease with altitude, possibly due to enhanced turbulence and larger cloud drops aloft. Quantifying these effects, based on more examples from other projects and high resolution cloud models is essential for improving our understanding of the interactions between the cloud and its environment. These interactions may {{play an important role in}} cloud dynamics and microphysics, by affecting cloud depth and droplet size spectra, for example, and may therefore influence the cloud precipitation formation processes...|$|R
