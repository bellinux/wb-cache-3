50|$|In {{one study}} (c. 1985), {{scientists}} linked malignant tumours {{to the site}} of skin or subcutaneous administration of aqueous extracts of paan in mice. In hamsters, forestomach carcinomas occurred after painting the cheek-pouch mucosa with aqueous extracts or implantation of a wax pellet containing powdered paan with tobacco into the cheek pouch; carcinomas occurred in the cheek pouch following implantation of the wax pellets. In human populations, they reported observing elevated frequencies of micronucleated cells in buccal mucosa of people who chew betel quid in the Philippines and India. The scientists also found that the proportion of micronucleated exfoliated cells is related to the site within the oral cavity where the paan is kept habitually and to the number of betel quids chewed per day. In related studies, the scientists reported that oral leukoplakia shows a strong association with habits of paan chewing in India.

While previous studies have investigated the genetic factors involved in gastric carcinogenesis, there still exist relatively few studies that have investigated the genetic traits associated with the risk of gastric <b>precancerous</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this paper we will review the biology and genetic polymorphisms involved in the genesis of gastric <b>precancerous</b> <b>conditions</b> reported to date and discuss the future prospects of this field of study. The associations of gastric <b>precancerous</b> <b>conditions</b> with polymorphisms in the cytotoxin-associated gene A-related genes (e. g.

40|$|Atrophic {{gastritis}} and intestinal metaplasia (IM) of {{the stomach}} are common and are {{associated with an increased}} risk for gastric cancer. In the absence of guidelines, a pragmatic management has been performed in Western countries in patients with these premalignant conditions. Recently, formal European guidelines have been delivered on this topic. Basically, it has been recommended that patients with extensive atrophic gastritis (AG) and/or extensive IM should be offered endoscopic surveillance every 3 years. On the contrary, no scheduled endoscopic/histological control has been advised for those patients with <b>precancerous</b> <b>conditions</b> confined to the antrum. In this commentary, we highlighted some potential weaknesses in the management formally recommended by the new guidelines. In detail, we discussed that AG and IM patients do not share the same gastric cancer risk, at least in Western countries, deserving a different approach. Some factors significantly associated with gastric cancer risk, such as IM type, first-degree family history of gastric cancer, and smoking habit have not been considered in tailoring the endoscopic follow-up. Finally, some data would suggest that a 3 -year follow-up in patients with extensive gastric <b>precancerous</b> <b>conditions</b> could result in an inadequate secondary prevention...|$|E
40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is not a}} single entity, but comprises a group of tumors including clear cell RCC, papillary RCC and chromophobe RCC, which arise from the epithelium of renal tubules. The majority of clear cell RCCs, the major histological subtype, have genetic or epigenetic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. Germline mutations in the MET and fumarate hydratase (FH) genes lead to the development of type 1 and type 2 papillary RCCs, respectively, and such mutations of either the TSC 1 or TSC 2 gene increase the risk of RCC. Genome-wide copy number alteration analysis has suggested that loss of chromosome 3 p and gain of chromosomes 5 q and 7 may be copy number aberrations indispensable for the development of clear cell RCC. When chromosome 1 p, 4, 9, 13 q or 14 q is also lost, more clinicopathologically aggressive clear cell RCC may develop. Since renal carcinogenesis is associated with neither chronic inflammation nor persistent viral infection, and hardly any histological change is evident in corresponding non-tumorous renal tissue from patients with renal tumors, <b>precancerous</b> <b>conditions</b> in the kidney have been rarely described. However, regional DNA hypermethylation on C-type CpG islands has already accumulated in such non-cancerous renal tissues, suggesting that, from the viewpoint of altered DNA methylation, the presence of <b>precancerous</b> <b>conditions</b> can be recognized even in the kidney. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in <b>precancerous</b> <b>conditions</b> are basically inherited by the corresponding clear cell RCCs developing in individual patients: DNA methylation alterations at the precancerous stage may further predispose renal tissue to epigenetic and genetic alterations, generate more malignant cancers, and even determine patient outcome. The list of tumor-related genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation has recently been increasing. Genetic and epigenetic profiling provides an optimal means of prognostication for patients with RCCs. Recently developed high-throughput technologies for genetic and epigenetic analyses will further accelerate the identification of key molecules for use in the prevention, diagnosis and therapy of RCCs...|$|E

40|$|Cancer-free {{individuals}} from family agregates of seemingly hereditary colon carcinoma were studied {{to determine the}} nature of their cell-mediated immune capacities in miexed leukocyte culture. Members of families who demonstrated no evidence of a <b>precancerous</b> <b>condition</b> such as polyposis coli did demonstrate substantial cellular immunopathology. Of these, 44 % showed a decreased responsiveness of their peripheral mononuclear cells to allogeneic stimuli, and in a number of these individuals this deficiency clearly manifested itself as an inappropriate suppression of potentially normal lymphocyte blastogenic capacities by an adherent population of mononuclear leukocytes. This in vitro defect of recognitive immunity appears to be the same type of defect that has already been described for individuals with established maligancies. The pattern of phenotypic expression of this immunopathology within these families is not inconsistent with an hereditary disorder. Individuals from families with a known hereditary somatic <b>precancerous</b> <b>condition</b> usually did not demonstrate this immunopathology. It is appropriate to speculate that the defect of recognitive immunity in the former families could be contributory to the genesis of the colon carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|Methylation of DNA {{in regions}} {{involved}} in transcriptional regulation can induce the binding of ICBP 90 {{and the subsequent}} formation of multiprotein complexes which alter gene transcription.
