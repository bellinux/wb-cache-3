5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around <b>prometaphase,</b> the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E
25|$|High-resolution banding {{involves}} the staining of chromosomes during prophase or early metaphase (<b>prometaphase),</b> {{before they reach}} maximal condensation. Because prophase and <b>prometaphase</b> chromosomes are more extended than metaphase chromosomes, the number of bands observable for all chromosomes increases from about 300 to 450 {{to as many as}} 800. This allows the detection of less obvious abnormalities usually not seen with conventional banding.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} mitosis {{is complex and}} highly regulated. The {{sequence}} of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities {{and the start of}} the next. These stages are prophase, <b>prometaphase,</b> metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides in cytokinesis, to produce two identical daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{second group}} of +TIPs {{includes}} proteins which can localize on kinetochores even in absence of MTs. In this group there are two proteins that have been widely studied: CLIP-170 and their associated proteins CLASPs (CLIP-associated proteins). CLIP-170 role at kinetochores is unknown, but {{the expression of a}} dominant negative mutant produces a <b>prometaphase</b> delay, suggesting that it has an active role in chromosome alignment. CLASPs proteins are required for chromosome alignment and maintenance of a bipolar spindle in Drosophila, humans and yeast.|$|E
25|$|Another motor protein {{implicated in}} the initial capture of MTs is CENP-E; this is a high {{molecular}} weight kinesin associated with the fibrous corona at mammalian kinetochores from <b>prometaphase</b> until anaphase. In cells {{with low levels of}} CENP-E, chromosomes lack this protein at their kinetochores, which quite often are defective in their ability to congress at the metaphase plate. In this case, some chromosomes may remain chronically mono-oriented (anchored to only one pole), although most chromosomes may congress correctly at the metaphase plate.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{indicate}} that the Ndc80 complex participates in the regulation of the stable association of Mad1-Mad2 and dynein with kinetochores. Yet the kinetochore associated proteins CENP-A, CENP-C, CENP-E, CENP-H and BubR1 are independent of Ndc80/Hec1. The prolonged arrest in <b>prometaphase</b> observed in cells {{with low levels of}} Ndc80/Hec1 depends on Mad2, although these cells show low levels of Mad1, Mad2 and dynein on kinetochores (<10-15% in relation to unattached kinetochores). However, if both Ndc80/Hec1 and Nuf2 levels are reduced, Mad1 and Mad2 completely disappear from the kinetochores and the spindle checkpoint is inactivated.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} karyotypes is made {{possible}} by staining. Usually, a suitable dye, such as Giemsa, is applied after cells have been arrested during cell division by a solution of colchicine usually in metaphase or <b>prometaphase</b> when most condensed. In order for the Giemsa stain to adhere correctly, all chromosomal proteins must be digested and removed. For humans, white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture. Sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing (interphase) cells. The sex of an unborn fetus can be determined by observation of interphase cells (see amniotic centesis and Barr body).|$|E
500|$|In most {{eukaryotic}} cells, Kinesin-5 {{is thought}} to form cross-bridges between pairs of oppositely oriented microtubules in prophase and <b>prometaphase</b> and drives apart duplicated centrosomes during {{the formation of the}} mitotic spindle. [...] This permits the establishment of a steady-state bipolar microtubule spindle structure.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of small chemical inhibitors of human Kinesin-5 through a pioneering in vitro phenotypic screening on cancer cell lines {{has led to}} both {{the development of new}} anticancer therapeutic agents, and to novel tools to probe the mechanism of microtubule motor proteins. [...] This toolkit of allosteric inhibitors has been used to probe the specific role of Kinesin-5 in mitotic spindle assembly [...] as well as fine dissection of motor domain function. [...] Through this work it was found that, in mammalian cells, Kinesin-5 is required for the initial assembly of the mitotic spindle during prophase and <b>prometaphase,</b> but is dispensable to traverse subsequent anaphase during a round of mitosis. [...] Also, the binding of the Kinesin-5 inhibitors to an allosteric site on the motor interrupts the mechanism by which this enzyme converts the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into the mechanical work of moving microtubules, thus providing insight on how this enzyme works.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth phase, M phase, {{consists}} of nuclear division (karyokinesis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis), {{accompanied by the}} formation of a new cell membrane. This is the physical division of [...] "mother" [...] and [...] "daughter" [...] cells. The M phase has been broken down into several distinct phases, sequentially known as prophase, <b>prometaphase,</b> metaphase, anaphase and telophase leading to cytokinesis.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{chromosome}} {{movements in}} relation to spindle poles are associated to lengthening and shortening of kMTs. One {{of the most interesting}} features of kinetochores is their capacity to modify the state of their associated kMTs (around 20) from a depolymerization state at their (+) end to polymerization state. This allows the kinetochores from cells at <b>prometaphase</b> to show [...] "directional instability", changing between persistent phases of movement towards the pole (poleward) or inversed (anti-poleward), which are coupled with alternating states of kMTs depolymerization and polymerization, respectively. This kinetochore bi-stability seem {{to be part of a}} mechanism to align the chromosomes at the equator of the spindle without losing the mechanic connection between kinetochores and spindle poles. It is thought that kinetochore bi-stability is based upon the dynamic instability of the kMTs (+) end, and it is partially controlled by the tension present at the kinetochore. In mammalian cultured cells, a low tension at kinetochores promotes change towards kMTs depolymerization, and high tension promotes change towards kMTs polymerization.|$|E

In certain types of cells, chromosomes do not line up at the metaphase plate and instead move {{back and forth between the}} poles randomly, only roughly lining up along the middleline. Early events of metaphase can coincide with the later events of <b>prometaphase,</b> as chromosomes with connected kinetochores will start the events of metaphase individually before other chromosomes with unconnected kinetochores that are still lingering in the events of <b>prometaphase.</b>|$|E

50|$|This gene is {{a member}} of the SCC3 family and is {{expressed}} in the nucleus. It encodes a component of cohesin, a multisubunit protein complex that provides sister chromatid cohesion along the length of a chromosome from DNA replication through prophase and <b>prometaphase,</b> after which it is dissociated in preparation for segregation during anaphase.|$|E
50|$|At {{the onset}} of mitosis (prophase, <b>prometaphase),</b> the {{cellular}} machinery is engaged in the disassembly of various cellular components including structures such as the nuclear envelope, the nuclear lamina and the nuclear pore complexes. This nuclear breakdown is necessary to allow the mitotic spindle {{to interact with the}} (condensed) chromosomes and to bind them at their kinetochores.|$|E
5000|$|During telophase, {{the effects}} of {{prophase}} and <b>prometaphase</b> (the nuclear membrane and nucleolus disintegrating) are reversed.

Two theories as to how this happens are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Dithiopyr {{acts as a}} root growth inhibitor, causing {{cessation}} of root elongation and inhibition of mitotic cell division. It inhibits formation of microtubules and spindle organizing centers. Dithiopyr may alter microtubule polymerization and stability by [...] "interacting with microtubule associated proteins or microtubule organizing centers rather than interaction directly with tubulin." [...] Mitotic cells are arrested in late <b>prometaphase.</b> Cell entry into mitosis is unaffected.|$|E
50|$|The role of <b>prometaphase</b> is {{completed}} {{when all of}} the kinetochore microtubules have attached to their kinetochores, upon which metaphase begins. An unattached kinetochore, and thus a non-aligned chromosome, even when most of the other chromosomes have lined up, will trigger the spindle checkpoint signal. This prevents premature progression into anaphase by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex until all kinetochores are attached and all the chromosomes aligned.|$|E
50|$|Aurora B also {{interacts with}} mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK). Both Aurora B and MCAK {{localize}} {{to the inner}} centromere during <b>prometaphase.</b> Aurora B {{has been shown to}} recruit MCAK to the centromere and directly phosphorylate MCAK on various residues. Phosphorylation of MCAK by Aurora B limits the ability of MCAK to depolymerize microtubules. Importantly, inhibition of MCAK by a number of approaches leads to improper attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules.|$|E
50|$|Localization of Aurora B to the {{centromere}} during <b>prometaphase</b> and metaphase requires phosphorylation of the mammalian kinetochore-specific histone-H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A). CENP-A {{associates with}} the centromere and {{is necessary for}} assembly of the kinetochore. Phosphorylation of CENP-A at serine 7 by Aurora A kinase recruits Aurora B to the centromere. Aurora B, itself, can also phosphorylate CENP-A at the same residue once it is recruited (see below).|$|E
50|$|Several chromosome-banding {{techniques}} {{are used in}} cytogenetics laboratories. Quinacrine banding (Q-banding) was the first staining method used to produce specific banding patterns. This method requires a fluorescence microscope {{and is no longer}} as widely used as Giemsa banding (G-banding). Reverse banding, or R-banding, requires heat treatment and reverses the usual black-and-white pattern that is seen in G-bands and Q-bands. This method is particularly helpful for staining the distal ends of chromosomes. Other staining techniques include C-banding and nucleolar organizing region stains (NOR stains). These latter methods specifically stain certain portions of the chromosome. C-banding stains the constitutive heterochromatin, which usually lies near the centromere, and NOR staining highlights the satellites and stalks of acrocentric chromosomes.High-resolution banding involves the staining of chromosomes during prophase or early metaphase (<b>prometaphase),</b> before they reach maximal condensation. Because prophase and <b>prometaphase</b> chromosomes are more extended than metaphase chromosomes, the number of bands observable for all chromosomes increases from about 300 to 450 to as many as 800. This allows the detection of less obvious abnormalities usually not seen with conventional banding.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of <b>prometaphase</b> in animal cells, phosphorylation of nuclear lamins causes the nuclear envelope to disintegrate into small membrane vesicles. As this happens, microtubules invade the nuclear space. This is called open mitosis, and it occurs in some multicellular organisms. Fungi and some protists, such as algae or trichomonads, undergo a variation called closed mitosis where the spindle forms inside the nucleus, or the microtubules penetrate the intact nuclear envelope.|$|E
5000|$|Chromosomes {{condense}} further {{during the}} diakinesis stage, from Greek words meaning [...] "moving through". This {{is the first}} point in meiosis where the four parts of the tetrads are actually visible. Sites of crossing over entangle together, effectively overlapping, making chiasmata clearly visible. Other than this observation, {{the rest of the}} stage closely resembles <b>prometaphase</b> of mitosis; the nucleoli disappear, the nuclear membrane disintegrates into vesicles, and the meiotic spindle begins to form.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} found that microtubule-based {{molecular}} motors (including a number of kinesins) have a role in mitosis (cell division). Kinesins are important for proper spindle length and are involved in sliding microtubules apart within the spindle during <b>prometaphase</b> and metaphase, as well as depolymerizing microtubule minus ends at centrosomes during anaphase. Specifically, Kinesin-5 family proteins act within the spindle to slide microtubules apart, while the Kinesin 13 family act to depolymerize microtubules.|$|E

The {{sequence}} of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities {{and the start of}} the next.
