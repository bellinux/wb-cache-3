50|$|In {{planning}} economically, {{the aim was}} {{to reduce}} the access tunnelling to the minimum. Chambers leading directly off the main tunnel, were generally used, with a <b>passing</b> <b>bay</b> provided to avoid congestion or, even better, with a service tunnel. These tunnels were excavated using diamond drills and gelignite. The drill holes were placed over two metres apart armed with a pound of gelignite per metre depth of drilled hole. The blasts were able to reach a free face over 2 m and sometimes up to 4.5 m away. This was a fast way of tunnelling but in retrospect it may have used too much explosive as the remaining rock around tunnels of this era are unstable and rock falls have killed people.|$|E

40|$|Some mining {{companies}} {{are investigating the}} use of road trains to increase productivity in underground mines. Road trains require dedicated <b>passing</b> <b>bays</b> in declines. The spacing of these <b>passing</b> <b>bays</b> can {{have a significant impact}} on haulage productivity. This technical note describes the use of simulation to find the optimal spacing. If the distance between <b>passing</b> <b>bays</b> is sufficiently small then descending trains can be interleaved with ascending trains, which increases productivity. If the spacing is too small, however, productivity can decrease as descending trains wait in <b>passing</b> <b>bays</b> for ascending trains. For a real mine the spacing should be less than the theoretical critical distance to cope with variations in loading and unloading durations. ...|$|R

50|$|SR 272 {{begins at}} an oblique {{intersection}} with SR 68 northwest of Wrightsville, {{in the southwestern}} part of Washington County. It heads north, <b>passing</b> <b>Bay</b> Branch Cemetery. Then, it curves to the northwest to intersections with McBride Lane and Deer Hunter Road, in rapid succession. Just past Deer Hunter Road, the route passes Carter Cemetery. It continues heading northwest, with a slight northward jog, until it passes Antioch Cemetery. Farther to the northwest is the town of Oconee. In Oconee, SR 272 crosses over a Norfolk Southern Railway line and Sandy Hill Creek. Just past the Oconee town limits is Cox Town Road. Later on is an intersection with Tennille Oconee Road, which leads to Tennille. It then crosses over Buffalo Creek and intersects with Spring Lake Road, which leads to Cochran Pond. Later on, the road crosses Bluff Creek and intersects Adams Road. Farther to the northwest, SR 272 meets its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 24 southeast of Milledgeville, in the northwestern part of Washington County. Just west of here, SR 24 crosses Gumm Creek into Baldwin County.|$|E
40|$|Slow-moving vehicles, {{including}} agricultural vehicles, on arterial highways {{can cause}} serious delays to other traffic {{as well as}} posing an extra safety risk. This paper elaborates on a small-scale solution for these problems: the <b>passing</b> <b>bay.</b> It investigates the impacts of a <b>passing</b> <b>bay</b> on the total delay for other motorized vehicles, the number of passing manoeuvres and hindered vehicles, and the mean delay per hindered vehicle. The latter is also {{considered to be an}} indicator for traffic safety. The calculations are performed for two characteristic trips with a slow-moving vehicle. The <b>passing</b> <b>bay</b> is an effective solution to reducing delays on arterial highways when two-way hourly volumes exceed 600 ¿ 1000 vehicles. The effects depend on the trip length and speed of the slow-moving vehicle, and on the passing sight distance limitations of the road. A distance of 2 ¿ 4 ?km between the passing bays seems an acceptable compromise between the reduction of delay for other motorized vehicles and the extra discomfort and delay for drivers of slow-moving vehicles. This result also shows that passing bays are not effective in regions where slow-moving vehicles mainly make trips shorter than this distanc...|$|E

One element of the CIVCAL project Web-based resources containing images, tables, texts and associated data of Shum Wan Road Landslide. The Shum Wan Road Landslide in Aberdeen is the largest landslide to have occurred in Hong Kong since 1976. It involved two distinct slides that occurred almost simultaneously. A minor failure of the fill embankment occurred below a <b>passing</b> <b>bay</b> on Nam Long Shan Road which triggered a major landslide at a hillside between Shum Wan Road and Nam Long Shan Road. In this study various aspects of the landslide and subsequent slope rehabilitation works are presented. Civil Engineering, construction, geotechnical, building site 1.

Until that time, the bridge had still sometimes used for herding of livestock, but soon after the signalisation, further increasing traffic queues began causing calls for a replacement bridge. In late 2009, a webcam was installed to allow online checking of queue lengths during the holiday periods, a feature that in New Zealand had so far been limited to urban areas.|$|R

50|$|Future {{increases}} in traffic {{will have to}} take into account the limitations of the existing road, which features various areas lacking passing lanes (especially problematic if cars are held up behind slow coaches on the steeper sections), a number of one-lane bridges and a narrow carriageway width. Homer Tunnel is a traffic-light controlled one-way route during peak summer periods, as it is not wide enough to allow coaches to pass each other (though <b>passing</b> <b>bays</b> are provided). Improvements to both the road and Homer Tunnel are planned by Transit New Zealand, though a widening of the tunnel is considered unlikely due to the high costs involved.|$|R
