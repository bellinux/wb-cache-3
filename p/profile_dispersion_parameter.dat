40|$|Measurements of pulse {{spreading}} in three graded index fibers {{have been performed}} over an extensive range of wavelengths, including regions in which the index profiles become optimal and the bandwidths correspondingly high. The refractive index distributions and <b>profile</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> have been measured and used in a ray-tracing algorithm in order to predict bandwidths. Comparison reveals that averaging processes on the index data are usually necessary to account for noncircularity of the fiber and small variations in the deduced profile caused by the wavelength dependence of the near-field intensity distribution. Results obtained by this means usually tend to slightly underestimate the true fiber bandwidth, while alpha-profile predictions always result in overestimates by about one order of magnitude. Remaining discrepancies between measured and predicted bandwidths are attributed to small variations of the index profiles along the fiber length...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of operating a non-simultaneous, bidirectional, unrepeatered communications link over long lengths of optical fibre at a data rate of 1 Mb/s is discussed. The link {{is intended for}} communicating between a stationary local terminal and a mobile remote terminal. A design study of the link {{has shown that the}} optical fibre is the most critical system component and that precise characterisation of the fibre is essential. A 1 Mb/s optical fibre data link has been constructed to test the validity of the design study, and has been successfully operated over a distance of 5 km with an error-rate of < 10 ^- 9. The optical receiver utilizes a silicon PIN photodiode feeding a low-noise preamplifier while the transmitter incorporates either a high-radiance LED or a cw semiconductor injection laser, generating half-width return-to-zero optical pulses at wavelengths of 0. 9 µm and 0. 85 µm respectively. Recently a distance of 10. 5 km has been achieved with a 25 dB signal/noise ratio for the LED source. An analogue system incorporating a PIN detector and LED source has also been demonstrated. The signal/noise ratio is 21 dB over 7 km of low-loss fibre. A new method has been invented, the near-field scanning technique, for providing a simple and rapid method for obtaining reproducible and detailed index-profile measurements. The index profile is determined by observation of the light intensity variation across the output face of a short length of fibre illuminated by an incoherent source. The profile obtained in this way may be suitable for many applications; however for accurate determinations it is necessary {{to take into account the}} presence of tunneling leaky modes which contribute additional power to the inferred refractive-index profile and cause a length-dependent error. A normalised correction factor is developed which may be applied to the measured intensity profile once the fibre length, core diameter and numerical aperture are known. The technique has been extensively investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, and the resolution appears to be good when scanning typical multimode fibres. It has allowed for the first time, observation of imperfections in the index profile right down to individual cvd layers. A novel technique is also reported for the determination of the <b>profile</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> P, by direct measurement on the fibre itself. The method is based on the fact that measurement of the wavelength dependence of the numerical aperture yields the difference in dispersion between the core and cladding glasses from which P may be calculated. Very little sample preparation is required and accurate experimental data has been obtained over the wavelength range 0. 35 to 1. 9 µm for germanosilicate, phosphosilicate and borosilicate glasses, whilst the range 0. 35 to 1. 2 µm has been covered for fluoro-silicate glass. For germanosilicate glass, P is found to be independent of both dopant concentration and thermal history. The results show that the exploitation of the longer-wavelength region will require either the design of fibres specifically for 1. 3 µm operation, or the development of fibres which exhibit a low pulse dispersion over an extended spectral range...|$|E

40|$|The {{carbon capture}} and storage (CCS) and {{enhanced}} oil recovery (EOR) projects entail {{the possibility of}} accidental release of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into the atmosphere. To quantify the spread of CO 2 following such release, the 2 ̆ 7 Gaussian 2 ̆ 7 dispersion model is often used to estimate the resulting CO 2 concentration levels in the surroundings. The Gaussian model enables quick estimates of the concentration levels. However, the traditionally recommended values of the 2 ̆ 7 <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameters</b> 2 ̆ 7 in the Gaussian model may not be directly applicable to CO 2 dispersion. This paper presents an optimisation technique to obtain the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameters</b> in order to achieve a quick estimation of CO 2 concentration levels in the atmosphere following CO 2 blowouts. The optimised <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameters</b> enable the Gaussian model to produce quick estimates of CO 2 concentration levels, precluding the necessity to set up and run much more complicated models.

40|$|SUMMARY. In the {{analysis}} of proportions often interest is in the estimation of the mean or the regression <b>parameters.</b> The <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> then {{plays the role of}} a nuisance parameter. However, in some instances, in Toxicology and other similar fields, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> or the intraclass correlation parameter is of primary interest. For example, in some binary-data situations the intraclass correlation is interpreted as ‘heritability of a dichotomous trait’. So, efficient and possibly robust estimation of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> or the intraclass correlation is important. Marginal or conditional estimation of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> is difficult. So we consider joint estimation of the mean (regression) <b>parameters</b> and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter.</b> We consider joint estimation using quadratic estimating functions (QEEs) of Crowder (1987). By varying the coefficients of the QEEs we obtain five sets of estimating equations. We compare large sample relative efficiency of the five sets of estimates obtained by the QEE’s and the quasi-likelihood estimates with the maximum likelihood estimates. Estimated large sample relative efficiencies of these estimates are also compared for two real life data sets arising from biostatistical practices. These comparisons show that estimates, using optimal quadratic estimating functions of Crowder (1987) are highly efficient and are the best among all estimates investigated. 1...|$|R

40|$|Negative Binomial (or Poisson-gamma) {{model has}} been used {{extensively}} by highway safety analysts because it can accommodate the over-dispersion, often exhibited in crash data. However, {{it has been reported}} in the literature that the maximum likelihood estimate of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> of NB models can be significantly affected when the data are characterized by small sample size and low sample mean. Given the important roles of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> in various types of highway safety analyses, {{there is a need to}} determine whether the bias could be potentially corrected or minimized. The objectives of this paper are to explore whether a systematic relationship exists between the estimated and true dispersion parameters; determine the bias as a function of the sample size and sample mean; and, develop a procedure for correcting the bias caused by these two conditions. For this purpose, simulated data were used to derive the relationship under the various combinations of sample mean, <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> and sample size, which encompass all simulation conditions performed in previous researches.

40|$|Data in {{the form}} of counts or {{proportions}} arise in biology, biomedical, toxicology, epidemiology and other similar fields. These data often exhibit variation greater or smaller than predicted by a simple model, such as, a Poisson or a binomial model. Thus, in practice, a model having an over or under <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> might be necessary. This is an important parameter to estimate for making appropriate inferences regarding the mean or the regression parameters in analyzing count data or binary data. Also, in some instances the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> may be of interest in its own right. Several parametric or semi-parametric methods have been developed to estimate the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> in the analysis of binary data. In this thesis, I first conduct an extensive empirical investigation, by simulations, to study the properties, in terms of mean bias, standard deviation and mean square error, of twenty six different estimators of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> that exist in the literature. Of these twenty six estimators I recommend an estimator Q 2, based on optimal quadratic estimating equations for the mean and <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameters.</b> Further, I derive an expression for a bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator (BCML) of this parameter using a beta-binomial model. A bias corrected maximum likelihood estimator of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> is also obtained for a regression situation. I then compare, by simulations, the BCML estimator, in terms of bias and efficiency, with the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, a double extended quasi-likelihood (DEQL) estimator proposed by Lee (2004) and the estimator Q 2. A toxicological data set from Paul (1982) and a medical data set from Otake and Prentice (1984) are analyzed. The simulation results and examples indicate that the BCML estimator performs well in terms of bias and efficiency in most instances. For count data we derive a first order BCML estimator using a two-parameter negative binomial model and a (DEQL) estimator for the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> for data involving only the mean and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameters.</b> The bias corrected maximum likelihood estimator of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>parameter</b> is also derived for a negative binomial regression model. The BCML estimator, in case of a two-parameter model, is compared, in terms of bias and efficiency, with the ML estimator investigated by Piegorsch (1990), the moment and the maximum extended quasi-likelihood estimators investigated by Clark and Perry (1989), and the DEQL estimator. The BCML estimator works best in term of bias and efficiency properties in most instances.

We then assign stellar mass <b>profile</b> and velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> to each system in the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma. Simultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the spherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in general from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner density slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical tests {{of the distribution of}} profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null hypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for M_vir ~< 10 ^{ 13. 5 - 14. 5 } M_solar. These dark matter profiles imply that dark matter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region of halos with M_vir ~< 10 ^{ 13. 5 - 14. 5 } M_solar supporting halo contraction. The main characteristics of halo contraction are: (1) the mean dark matter density within the effective radius has increased by a factor varying systematically up to ~ 3 - 4 at M_vir = 10 ^{ 12 } M_solar, and (2) the inner density slope has a mean of ~ 1. 3 with rho(r) ~ r^{-alpha} and a halo-to-halo rms scatter of rms(alpha) ~ 0. 4 - 0. 5 for 10 ^{ 12 } M_solar ~< M_vir ~< 10 ^{ 13 - 14 } M_solar steeper than the NFW profile (alpha= 1).
