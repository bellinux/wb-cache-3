40|$|The {{activity}} and community structure of aerobic methanotrophic communities were investigated at methane seeps (pockmarks) in the littoral and <b>profundal</b> <b>zones</b> of an oligotrophic freshwater lake (Lake Constance, Germany). Measurements of potential methane oxidation rates showed that sediments inside littoral pock-marks are hot spots of methane oxidation. Potential methane oxidation rates at littoral pockmark sites exceeded {{the rates of}} the surrounding sediment by 2 orders of magnitude. Terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (T-RFLP) analysis of the pmoA gene revealed major differences in the methanotrophic com-munity composition between littoral pockmarks and the surrounding sediments. Clone library analysis con-firmed that one distinct Methylobacter-related group dominates the community at littoral pockmarks. In profundal sediments, the differences between pockmarks and surrounding sediments were found to be less pronounced. Methane is an effective greenhouse gas and accounts for 18 % of the radiative forcing caused by long-lived greenhouse gases (27).

50|$|The <b>profundal</b> <b>zone</b> {{is a deep}} zone of an inland body of {{freestanding}} water, such as a lake or pond, located {{below the}} range of effective light penetration.

The temperature difference may {{be large enough to}} hamper mixing with the littoral zone in some seasons which causes a decrease in oxygen concentrations. The profundal is often defined, in accordance with Thienemann (1925), as the deepest, vegetation-free, and muddy zone of the lacustrine benthal.

40|$|European lakes are {{affected}} by many human induced disturbances. In principle, ecological theories predict that the structure and functioning of benthic invertebrate assemblage (one of the Biological Quality Elements following the Water Framework Directive, WFD terminology) change {{in response to the}} level of disturbances, making this biological element suitable for assessing the status and management of lake ecosystems. In practice, to set up assessment systems based on invertebrates, we need to distiguish community changes that are related to human pressures from those that are inherent natural variability. This task is {{complicated by the fact that}} invertebrate communities inhabiting the littoral and the <b>profundal</b> <b>zones</b> of lakes are constrained by different factors and respond unevenly to distinct human disturbances. For example it is not clear yet how the invertebrates assemblages respond to watershed and shoreline alterations, nor the relative importance of spatial and temporal factors on assemblage dynamics and relative bioindicator values of taxa, the habitat constraints on species traits and other taxonomic and methodological limitations. The current lack of knowledge of basic features of invertebrate temporal and spatial variations is limiting the fulfillment of the EU-wide intercalibration of lake ecological quality assessment systems in Europe, and thus compromising the basis for setting the environmental objectives as required by the WFD. The aim of this deliverable is to provide a contribution towards the understanding of basic sources of spatial and temporal variation of lake invertebrate assemblages. The report is structured around selected case studies, manly involving the analysis of existing datasets collated within WISER. The case studies come from different European lake types in the Northern, Central, Alpine and Mediterranean regions.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described here}} was performed during 1993 and 1994 {{in the context}} of studies on the recovery of Lake Orta from acidification after the liming conducted from May 1989 to June 1990. The causes of the pollution were due to the oxidation of ammonium sulphate discharged from a factory producing rayon by a cupro-ammoniacal method and to the loads of heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn) derived from plating factories. One year after liming, an increase in pH and a marked decrease in metal concentrations were observed, and as a consequence some qualitative and quantitative changes were observed in 1992 - 93 in the planctonic communities and in the littoral macrobenthic fauna. This paper presents qualitative and quantitative data on macrobenthos collected along a transect between the littoral and the maximal depth in the Buccione Basin, which was directly affected by the effluents of the rayon factory. The data revealed some quantitative repopulation of this community, especially along the littoral. Qualitatively, however, the macrobenthos was still quite poor, consisting essentially of Oligochaeta and Diptera Chironomidae. The former were rare and mainly represented by Naididae between 15 and 22 m, while the Tubificidae were well represented in the littoral and the <b>profundal</b> <b>zones.</b> As regards the Chironomidae, the genera Procladius and Chironomus gr. thummi extended as far as the maximum depth, while others, such as Ablabesmyia, Parakiefferiella bathophila and Dicrotendipes gr. nervosus were mostly distributed in the littoral layers. Among the other taxonomic groups only the Trichoptera and the Diptera Ceratopogonidae were quantitatively significant. However, many systematic entities typical of the less polluted Italian subalpine lakes are still absent. In fact, the colonisation of Lake Orta by macrobenthic organisms is still influenced by the increased concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment precipitated from the water column.

We sampled at 3 - 12 stations along the gradient, {{depending on the}} parameter measured. The purpose of the trip was three-fold. First, the primary objective of the class was to provide field and laboratory experiences in aquatic ecology for the students. Secondly, we wished to provide data on the trophic environment that the endangered razorback sucker larvae from the Colorado River would encounter when the entered the reservoir. Thirdly, the limnological and fisheries data collected in this, and subsequent years, may provide a useful long-term data set for the parties responsible for managing Lake Powell. Single, or groups of students were responsible for sampling, analyzing, and writing up specific topic areas. During the investigation, runoff from the Colorado River was still low, and associated trophic enhancement {{was limited to the}} upper reaches of Lake Powell. Secchi depths were 3 ̆c 1 m between river mile (RM) 142 and 126, but increased to 12 m at mile 99 near Bullfrog Marina. Conductivity measurements indicated that a chemocline was present at 25 m near RM 92. Total phosphorus levels were near 140 ug/L at RM 144 close to the inflow, but decreased rapidly, and reached concentrations below our level of detection (2 ug/L) by RM 125. Chlorophyll a levels near the inflow were 4 ug/L, but decreased to 3 ̆c 1 ug/L near RM 99.

These differences were due largely to differences {{in the degree of}} oxygenation, supply of electron acceptors, and mean summer temperature at the two sites. The changes in the hypolimnion (the deep water zone formed on thermal stratification, which may be treated essentially as a closed system) could be used to calculate profundal rates of aerobic respiration, NO, and SO:- reduction, and methanogenesis, relative to the accumulation of CO,. Laboratory measurements demonstrated that N H t accumulation, SO:- reduction and methanogenesis were more intense in the profundal than in the littoral zone. Anaerobic processes that occurred in the littoral sediments did so at greater depths than in the profundal sediments. The release of CH, and N, bubbles also provided estimates of the importance of these processes at the two sites. At both sites aerobic respiration was the most important component (about 50 %) of carbon mineralization; SO:- reduction was the least important, accounting for {{only a small percentage of}} carbon turnover. Pathways of NO; reduction and methanogenesis accounted for approximately equal proportions (varying between 15 and 25 %) of the carbon mineralized.

25|$|Limnology is {{the study}} of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. Limnology divides lakes into three zones: the {{littoral}} zone, a sloped area close to land; the photic or open-water zone, where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water <b>profundal</b> or benthic <b>zone,</b> where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on turbidity, determined by the density and size of suspended particles. A particle is in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include algae and detritus. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous fish can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (planktonivorous) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic trophic cascade). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a Secchi disk, a 20-cm (8in) disk with alternating white and black quadrants. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the Secchi depth, a measure of transparency. The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication.

40|$|A general {{survey was}} carried out on the sediments of {{seventeen}} lakes, ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, in the English Lake District. Several variables not directly concerned with the population of bacteria were measured to provide background information. Estimates {{of the total population}} of bacteria and of the population of filamentous bacteria were made using direct counts with acridine orange and fluorescein di-acetate, and counts by an MPN technique. The counts with acridine orange showed an upward trend with increasing degree of enrichment of the lakes, particularly at the eutrophic end of the spectrum. The distribution pattern obtained with the fluorochrome fluorescein di-acetate was different with an apparent upward trend in the intermediate lakes. The viable counts of the bacterial population in the sediments did not agree with the ranking of the lakes according to published information from the Freshwater Biological Association, although a slight upward trend was observed in the distribution of the viable filamentous bacteria. The preliminary survey led to the selection of three lakes representing the oligrotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic states in which a more detailed investigation on the population of filamentous bacteria was made. The <b>profundal</b> and littoral <b>zones</b> of the three lakes were investigated particularly in relation to the different groups of filamentous bacteria and their vertical distribution in the sediments.

40|$|Albeit subfossil Cladocera remains are {{considered}} as a reliable proxy for tracking historical lake development, they have been scarcely studied in large subalpine lakes south of the Alps. In this study, subfossil Cladocera remains from Lake Garda in northern Italy were analyzed to track the lake's environmental changes since the Middle Ages. One core was retrieved from the largest sub-basin of Lake Garda (Brenzone, 350 m deep) and two cores were retrieved from the <b>profundal</b> and littoral <b>zone</b> of the smaller lake sub-basin (Bardolino, 80 and 40 m deep, respectively). The species distribution of Cladocera remains in recent sediment layers {{was similar to that}} observed in contemporary water samples. The deepest sections of the three cores were characterized by species sensitive to water temperature, which suggest a key role of major climatic events in driving the lake response during the late Holocene. The most evident change in Cladocera assemblages in the studied cores was observed during the 1960 s, when planktonic taxa such as Daphnia spp. and Bosmina spp. became dominant at the expense of littoral taxa. Despite the highly coherent general pattern of subfossil Cladocera, the cores showed a set of minor differences, which were attributed to different morphological and hydrological features of the two basins forming Lake Garda. Multivariate analysis revealed a clear relation of Cladocera to climate variability during periods of low lake nutrient levels (i. e. before the 1960 s). This provides additional information on past ecological responses of Lake Garda, as contrast previous data from subfossil diatom and pigment analyses did not fully capture effects of climate change during the same period. Since the 1960 s shifts in assemblage composition of Cladocera and diatoms were highly coherent, in response to nutrient increase and the following, less pronounced, decrease in nutrient concentrations. During the last five decades, the response of the Cladocera to climate variability appeared to be masked by nutrient change.

This is where rooted wetland plants occur. The offshore is divided into two further zones, an open water zone and a deep water zone. In the open water zone (or photic zone) sunlight supports photosynthetic algae, and the species that feed upon them. In the deep water zone, sunlight is not available and the food web is based on detritus entering from the littoral and photic zones. Some systems use other names. The off shore areas may be called the pelagic zone, the photic zone may be called the limnetic zone and the aphotic zone may be called the <b>profundal</b> <b>zone.</b> Inland from the littoral zone one can also frequently identify a riparian zone which has plants still affected by the presence of the lake—this can include effects from windfalls, spring flooding, and winter ice damage.

Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) is a good model species for verifying and understanding ecological driven polymorphism and speciation. Here, I address the life history traits of three sympatric living Arctic charr morphs in Skogsfjordvatn in northern Norway. The charr morphs differ in diet and habitat utilization; including one morph that feeds on benthic invertebrates and zooplankton in the littoral-pelagic zone (referred to as the LO-morph), a second that feeds on chironomids and small mussels in the <b>profundal</b> <b>zone</b> (PB-morph), and a third that also inhabits the <b>profundal</b> <b>zone,</b> but has a piscivorous diet (PP-morph). The littoral and the two profundal spawning morphs are differentiated in time and place of spawning and all morphs are genetically differentiated, indicating complete reproductive isolation. These morphs also had contrasting differences in numerous life history traits...|$|E

Distribution and habitat {{switching}} {{was measured with}} bimonthly bottom-trawl surveys repeated throughout the summer. Patterns of daily growth increments on otoliths were {{used to measure the}} history of habitat residence, individual size {{at the time of the}} habitat switch, and habitat-specific growth rates. Laboratory experiments and known-age fish confirmed daily increment formation of otoliths. After dispersing during an initial pelagic larval stage, postlarval juveniles settled in both the warm, food-rich littoral zone and the cold, unproductive <b>profundal</b> <b>zone.</b> During summer, initial profundal-zone inhabitants underwent a unidirectional habitat shift to the more productive littoral zone. Fish that moved to the littoral zone grew twice as fast as those in the <b>profundal</b> <b>zone</b> and encountered little apparent predation mortality risk there. Habitat shifts were therefore consistent with both growth optimization and predatory avoidance. However, shifts occurred at a wide range of body sizes throughout the summer. The large spatial scale of the lake, limited swimming ability of juvenile fish, diel migratory behavior, and lack of complex habitat structure may preclude shifts at discrete body sizes for this species...|$|E
40|$|An {{intensive}} {{study of the}} limnology, invertebrates and fishes of Bear Lake was conducted in 1987 in order to define the productivity and food web of the community. Limno 10 gica 1 parameters and invertebrates were measured at approximately monthly intervals while fish distribution and feeding was analyzed in February, June, August, and October. Samples were collected at three to eight stations along a transect running from the shallow littoral area {{on the west side}} of the lake, to the deep <b>profundal</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|E
