5|$|Phosphoryl {{chloride}} (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a {{colourless liquid}} with the formula 3. It hydrolyses in moist air releasing phosphoric acid and choking fumes of hydrogen chloride. It is manufactured industrially {{on a large}} scale from <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> and oxygen or phosphorus pentoxide. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as tricresyl phosphate.|$|E
25|$|World {{production}} exceeds {{one-third of}} a million tonnes. <b>Phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> is prepared industrially by the reaction of chlorine with a refluxing solution of white phosphorus in <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride,</b> with continuous removal of PCl3 as it is formed (in {{order to avoid the}} formation of PCl5).|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> is the {{precursor}} to organophosphorus compounds that contain {{one or more}} P(III) atoms, most notably phosphites and phosphonates. These compounds do not usually contain the chlorine atoms found in PCl3.|$|E
25|$|Tributylphosphine can be {{prepared}} in the laboratory by reaction of the appropriate Grignard reagent with <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> although, as it is commercially available at reasonable prices, it is rare to have to perform the small-scale preparation.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{production}} of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> is controlled under the Chemical Weapons Convention, {{where it is}} listed in schedule 3.

2500|$|Triphenylphosphine is a {{relatively}} inexpensive substance.

2500|$|Tertiary phosphines are {{generally}} obtained by treatment of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> or triphenylphosphite with organolithium reagents or Grignard reagents. [...] Tertiary phosphines {{of the type}} PRR'R" [...] are chiral and optically stable.|$|E
2500|$|In the laboratory, acyl {{chlorides}} {{are generally}} prepared {{in the same}} manner as alkyl chlorides, by replacing the corresponding hydroxy substituents with chlorides. Thus, carboxylic acids are treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2), <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> (PCl3), or phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5): ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most popular}} {{conversion}} is effected by reacting the alcohol with thionyl chloride [...] (...) in the [...] "Darzens halogenation", {{which is one}} of the most convenient laboratory methods because the byproducts are gaseous. Both phosphorus pentachloride (...) and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> (...) also convert the hydroxyl group to the chloride.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> has a lone pair, and {{therefore}} {{can act as a}} Lewis base, for example with the Lewis acids BBr3 it forms a 1:1 adduct, Br3B+PCl3. [...] Metal complexes such as Ni(PCl3)4 are known. [...] This Lewis basicity is exploited in one useful route to organophosphorus compounds using an alkyl chloride and aluminium chloride: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> is a {{chemical}} compound of phosphorus and chlorine, having the chemical formula PCl3. It has a trigonal pyramidal shape. It {{is the most}} important of the three phosphorus chlorides. [...] It is an important industrial chemical, being used for the manufacture of organophosphorus compounds {{for a wide variety of}} applications. It has a 31P NMR signal at around +220 ppm with reference to a phosphoric acid standard.|$|E
2500|$|Two main {{approaches}} {{are used to}} synthesize glyphosate industrially. [...] The first is to react iminodiacetic acid with phosphorous acid and hydrochloric acid (sometimes formed in situ by addition of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride)</b> via a modified Mannich reaction. Oxidation then leads to the desired glyphosate product. [...] Iminodiacetic acid is usually prepared on-site, such as by reaction of chloroacetic acid with ammonia and calcium hydroxide to produce the calcium iminodiacetate salt and then acidification of the product.|$|E
2500|$|Glyphosate is an aminophosphonic {{analogue}} of {{the natural}} amino acid glycine, and like all amino acids, exists in different ionic states depending on pH. [...] Both the phosphonic acid and carboxylic acid moieties can be ionised and the amine group can be protonated and the substance exists {{as a series of}} zwitterions. Glyphosate is soluble in water to 12g/l at room temperature. The original synthetic approach to glyphosate involved the reaction of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> with formaldehyde followed by hydrolysis to yield a phosphonate. [...] Glycine is then reacted with this phosphonate to yield glyphosate, and its name is taken as a contraction of the compounds used in this synthesis - viz. glycine and a phosphonate.|$|E
50|$|Thiophosphoryl {{chloride}} can {{be generated}} by several reactions starting from <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride.</b> The most common and practical synthesis, hence used in industrial manufacturing, is directly reacting <b>phosphorus</b> <b>trichloride</b> with excess sulfur at 180 °C.|$|E
