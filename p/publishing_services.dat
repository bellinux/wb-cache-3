50|$|Many {{libraries}} {{are considering}} offering <b>publishing</b> <b>services</b> to academics under an open access model. The {{growing demand for}} <b>publishing</b> <b>services</b> suggests new roles and responsibilities for academic libraries in the near future. The establishment or reestablishment of academic and university presses may offer a new economic model for academic libraries. A 2011 survey of member institutions of ARL, the Oberlin Group and the University Libraries Group found that {{approximately half of the}} respondents had or were developing library <b>publishing</b> <b>services.</b> Copyright issues and technological limitations imposed by digital rights management are the strongest barriers to this transformation.|$|E
