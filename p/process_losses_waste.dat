In the HIV-infected population, weight loss is associated with lower CD 4 + cell counts and is an independent predictor of mortality. The etiology of weight <b>loss</b> and <b>wasting</b> is complex and multifactorial. We discuss, {{on the basis of}} a large longitudinal cohort that examined nutritional status in HIV infection, data on weight <b>loss</b> and <b>wasting</b> from the present clinical era. The definition, prevalence, and significance of HIV-associated weight <b>loss</b> and <b>wasting</b> are summarized.

40|$|The {{issue of}} global food <b>losses</b> and <b>waste</b> has {{recently}} received much attention {{and has been}} given high visibility. According to FAO, almost one-third of food produced for human consumption – approximately 1. 3 billion tonnes per year – is either lost or wasted globally: their reduction is now presented as essential to improve food security and to reduce the environmental footprint of food systems. In this context, the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), in its Thirty-ninth Session (October 2012) requested the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE) to undertake a study on “Food <b>losses</b> and <b>waste</b> {{in the context of}} sustainable food systems” to be presented to the CFS Plenary in 2014.

40|$|Approximately one out {{of every}} four {{calories}} grown to feed people is not ultimately consumed by humans. Food is lost and wasted to a varying extent across the globe, across all stages of the food value chain, and across all types of food. As a result, overall global food availability is lower than it would be otherwise, negatively affecting food security and requiring the planet's agriculture system to produce additional food to compensate for the food that is not ultimately consumed by people. The potential benefits of reducing food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> are large. As a strategy for closing the food gap between food available today and food needed in 2050 to adequately feed the planet's projected 9. 3 billion people, reducing food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> satisfies each of the development and environmental criteria we introduced in the first installment of the Creating a Sustainable Food Future series.

40|$|Looking at {{the global}} context, the key-note speech will start by {{examining}} major trends in food security and nutrition and challenges ahead to feed a world of 9. 2 billion people by 2050, 2. 3 billion people more than today. It will look at urbanization, changing diets, rising middle class, natural resources and climate change. This is {{the context in which}} FAO is fulfilling its mandate to promote food security and nutrition for all, to preserve natural resources, and to promote economic development. Reducing food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> {{is an integral part of}} efforts in view of achieving a zero hunger world. Every year, the world wastes or loses 1. 3 billion metric tons of food, roughly one third of the globe’s food production. A short video developed by FAO will help better understand what food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> means. The presentation will then examine food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> from the perspective of food security and nutrition, its implications for the environment, and the economic impact. Food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> is a complex issue. In a globalized world, the value chain for many food products is often very long and includes a great number of actors. The inter-dependence between the different links in this chain further contributes to the complexity: what happens at one point of the value chain can have a negative impact in other parts of the chain. The presentation will look at one case study developed by FAO, which examined <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> of maize in Kenya, which did show some unexpected results. It will highlight the importance of analysis and tools to design the response to food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> in a coordinated and focused manner. Many of the actors along the value chain, from the farmer who cannot harvest to the consumer who throws away food into the waste bin, are part of the private sector or people acting in their individual capacity. Yet, the way society is organized will have an impact on their behavior. Food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> is thus also a matter of policies, of development priorities, of education and sensitization. The presentation will examine the role of different stakeholders along the value chain and showcase some of their contributions to reducing food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste.</b> The presentation will argue that reducing food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> is a low-hanging fruit that can make a considerable difference in reducing hunger and malnutrition, preserving the environment and contribute to economic development.

40|$|Food <b>losses</b> and <b>waste</b> {{has always}} been a {{significant}} global problem for mankind, and one which has become increasingly recognised as such by policy makers, food producers, processors, retailers, and consumers. It is however an emotive subject whereby the extent, accuracy, and resolution of available data on postharvest <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> is questionable such that key performance indicators on waste can be misinformed. The nature and extent of food waste differs amongst developed economies, economies in transition, and developing economies. Whilst most emphasis has been put on increasing future crop production, far less resource has been and is still channelled towards enabling both established and innovative food preservation technologies to reduce food waste while maintaining safety and quality. Reducing food <b>loss</b> and <b>waste</b> is a more tractable problem than increasing production in the short to medium term, as its solution is not directly limited, for instance, by available land and water resources. Here we argue the need for a paradigm shift of current funding strategies and research programmes which will encourage the development, implementation, and translation of collective biological, engineering, and management solutions to better preserve and utilise food. Such cross disciplinary thinking across global supply chains is an essential element in the pursuit of sustainable food and nutritional security. The implementation of allied technological and management solutions is reliant on there being sufficient skilled human capital and resource. There is currently a lack of robust postharvest research networks outside of the developed world, and insufficient global funding mechanisms which can support such interdisciplinary collaborations.

40|$|Background - Whereas the {{prevalence}} of hunger and food insecurity is often cited as a motivation for reducing <b>losses</b> and <b>waste</b> in agriculture and food systems, the impacts of such reduction on food security and the wider economy {{have not yet been}} investigated. This paper gives insights into these effects, the factors of influence, and derives implications for applied research, policy and practice. Methods - We used economic theory to analyse the impacts of food loss reductions on the supply side and food waste reductions on the demand side. The analysis is graphical and uses intuitive low-dimension diagrams. Results - The impacts of tackling food <b>losses</b> and <b>waste</b> differ from the size of food <b>losses</b> and <b>waste</b> and depend, in addition, {{on the extent to which}} they are avoidable, factors that cause them to arise (notably food prices) and the costs associated with measures to reduce them. Interactions within the food supply chain and the broader economy also affect the impacts. Trade-offs occur on the demand side where a reallocation of spending on previously wasted foods causes some producers to be worse off and some to be better off. Over time, producers tackling losses may have to incur welfare losses in the short run with gains in terms of increased revenues, if any, occurring later. Similarly, consumers may delay spending savings on previously wasted foods. As a consequence, the impacts, notably on food security and welfare, are ambiguous. Conclusions - Further research should quantify the factors that play a role and carry out economy-wide impact analyses, employing a combination of macro, meso and micro-level tools, and presenting a comprehensive set of indicators that adequately capture broader societal impacts of tackling food <b>losses</b> and <b>waste.</b> This allows policy makers to better target policy and resources, identify complementary policies, and move beyond target-setting to addressing the underlying causes, whereby it is important to consider the whole food supply chain.
