25|$|As thermal {{radiation}} travels, more or less, {{in a straight}} line from the fireball (unless scattered) any opaque object will produce a protective shadow that provides protection from the flash burn. Depending on the properties of the underlying surface material, the exposed area outside the protective shadow will be either burnt to a darker color, such as charring wood, or a brighter color, such as asphalt. If such a weather phenomenon as fog or haze is present at the point of the nuclear explosion, it scatters the flash, with radiant energy then reaching burn sensitive substances from all directions. Under these conditions, opaque objects are therefore less effective than they would otherwise be without scattering, as they demonstrate maximum shadowing effect in an environment of <b>perfect</b> <b>visibility</b> and therefore zero scattering. Similar to a foggy or overcast day, although there are few, if any, shadows produced by the sun on such a day, the solar energy that reaches the ground from the sun's infrared rays is nevertheless considerably diminished, due to it being absorbed by the water of the clouds and the energy also being scattered back into space. Analogously, so too is the intensity at range of burning flash energy attenuated, in units of J/cm2, along the slant/horizontal range of a nuclear explosion, during fog or haze conditions. So despite any object that casts a shadow being rendered ineffective as a shield from the flash by fog or haze, due to scattering, the fog fills the same protective role, but generally only at the ranges that survival in the open {{is just a matter of}} being protected from the explosion's flash energy.|$|E

The six men who had not landed in the drop zone were Royal Engineer sappers who were supposed to rig the aqueduct for demolition, and their Whitley had been carrying most of the explosives to be used in the operation. Despite these losses, the troop gathered up the remaining containers and took up positions around the aqueduct. However, on examining the aqueduct it was found the piers supporting it were made of reinforced concrete and not brick as had been expected, leading Pritchard to suspect that the remaining explosives might be insufficient to demolish the aqueduct. After closer inspection, Pritchard ordered that the majority of the explosives be placed around the western pier and the rest against its abutment, in the hope that this would cause enough damage to destroy the aqueduct. A small amount of explosives were also placed under a nearby bridge that bridged the Ginestra river.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of integrated quantum photonics {{is integral to}} many areas of quantum information science, in particular linear optical quantum computing. In this context, a diversity of physical systems is being explored and thus versatility and adaptability are important prerequisites for any candidate platform. Silicon oxynitride {{is a promising material}} because its refractive index can be varied over a wide range. This dissertation describes the {{development of}} silicon oxynitride waveguides for applications in the field of integrated quantum photonics. The project consisted of three stages: design, characterisation, and application. First, the parameter space was studied through simulations. The structures were optimised to achieve low-loss devices with a small footprint at a wavelength of 900 nm. Buried channel waveguides with a cross-section of 1. 6 μm x 1. 6 μm and a core (cladding) refractive index of 1. 545 (1. 505) were chosen. Second, following their fabrication with plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition, electron beam lithography, and reactive ion etching, the waveguides were characterised. The refractive index was shown to be tunable from the silica to the silicon nitride regime. Optimised tapers significantly improved the coupling efficiency. The minimum bend radius was measured to be less than 2 mm. Propagation losses as low as 1. 45 dB cm- 1 were achieved. Directional couplers with coupling ratios ranging from 0 to 1 were realised. Third, building blocks for linear optical quantum computing were demonstrated. Reconfigurable quantum circuits consisting of Mach-Zehnder interferometers with near <b>perfect</b> <b>visibilities</b> were fabricated along with a four-port switch. The potential of quantum speedup was illustrated by carrying out the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm with a fidelity of 100 % using on-demand single photons from a quantum dot. This dissertation presents the first implementation of tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers, which act on single photons, based on silicon oxynitride waveguides. Furthermore, for the first time silicon oxynitride photonic quantum circuits were operated with on-demand single photons. Accordingly, this work has created a platform for the development of integrated quantum photonics. This work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Toshiba Research Europe Ltd, and the Semiconductor Physics group of the Cavendish Laboratory...|$|R

Recent developments in integrated photonic circuits and single photon detectors indicate that the bottleneck for fidelity in quantum photonic processes will ultimately lie with the photon sources. We present and demonstrate a silicon nanophotonic chip capable of emitting telecommunication band photon pairs that exhibit the highest raw degree of time-energy entanglement from a micro/nanoscale source, to date. Biphotons are generated through cavity-enhanced spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in a high-Q silicon microdisk resonator, wherein the nature of the triply-resonant generation process leads to a dramatic Purcell enhancement, resulting in highly efficient pair creation rates as well as extreme suppression of the photon noise background. The combination of the excellent photon source and a new phase locking technique, allow for the observation of a nearly <b>perfect</b> coincidence <b>visibility</b> of (96. 6 ± 1. 1) %, without any background subtraction, at a large pair generation rate of (4. 40 ± 0. 07) × 10 ^ 5 pairs/s...|$|R

A small amount of explosives were also placed under a nearby bridge that bridged the Ginestra river.At 00:30 on 11 February the explosives were detonated and the western pier destroyed, causing the aqueduct to crumble and effectively break in half, and the Ginestra bridge was also successfully destroyed. Leaving one man who had broken his ankle when he had landed with a nearby farmer, the remainder of the Troop withdrew from the area at 01:00, splitting into three groups and heading towards the coast. The three groups moved as fast as possible towards the coast, but were all captured within a few hours of the aqueduct being demolished. The group commanded by Major Pritchard was spotted by a farmer who raised the alarm at a nearby village, leading to a local carabinieri unit surrounding the group; with little ammunition and heavily outnumbered, Pritchard decided to surrender. The other three groups, including the six sappers who had landed two miles from the objective, fared little better. The two groups from the aqueduct were soon located by Italian soldiers and ambushed, forcing them to surrender after brief firefights. The third group were found by a group of civilians as they moved towards the coast; after attempting to bluff their way past by claiming to be German soldiers on a special field exercise, which failed when the local Mayor demanded identity papers, they were captured by carabinieri. All were stripped of their weapons and equipment and transported to Naples, with the exception of the Italian translator, Picchi; he was handed over to the Blackshirts, a Fascist paramilitary group, who tortured and then executed him. Even if any of the groups had managed to make their way to the coast and the rendezvous point, they would not have been picked up by HMS Triumph. One of the two Whitleys conducting the diversionary raid at Foggia suffered engine trouble after bombing the railway yards. The pilot radioed Malta, informing his airfield that he was ditching in the mouth of the River Sele, coincidentally the area where the rendezvous was to occur. Fearing that the message had been monitored by the Italians and that the submarine might sail into a trap, the decision was made by senior officers not to send it to the rendezvous point.|$|E

Additionally, this study identifies the susceptibility of the inventory systems towards IRI due to conventional <b>perfect</b> data <b>visibility</b> assumptions. Two different alternatives for such methods are presented and analyzed; the IRI resistance and the error control methods. The discussed methods effectively countered various aspects of IRI; the IRI resistance method performs better on stock-out and lost sales, whereas error control method keeps lower inventory. Furthermore, this research also investigates the value of using a secondary source of information (automated data capturing) along with traditional inventory record keeping methods to control the effects of IRI. To understand the combined behavior of the pooled data sources an infinite horizon discounted Markov decision process (MDP) is generated and optimized. Moreover, the traditional cost based reward structure is abandoned to put more emphasis {{on the effects of}} IRI. Instead a new measure is developed as inventory performance by combining four key performance metrics; lost sales, amount of correction, fill rate and amount of inventory counted. These key metrics are united under a unitless platform using fuzzy logic and combined through additive methods. The inventory model is then analyzed to understand the optimal policy structure, which is proven to be of a control limit type...|$|R
40|$|Spectrally unentangled biphotons {{with high}} single-spatiotemporal-mode purity are highly {{desirable}} for many quantum information processing tasks. We generate biphotons with an inferred heralded-state spectral purity of 99 %, the highest to date without any spectral filtering, by pulsed spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a custom-fabricated periodically-poled KTiOPO₄ (PPKTP) crystal under extended Gaussian phase-matching conditions. The high purity achieved {{is made possible}} by the Gaussian phase-matching function of our custom PPKTP crystal. Without applying spectral filtering and using a standard PPKTP crystal, the highest previously reported purity is 93 %. We characterize the joint spectral density of the generated biphoton by converting the spectral content to temporal information via dispersion through a 42 -km SMF 28 fiber. To characterize the JSD at high spectral resolution and more eciently, we employ a commercially available dispersion compensation module (DCM) with a dispersion equivalent to 100 km of standard optical fiber and with an insertion loss of only 2. 8 dB. Compared with the typical method of using two temperature-stabilized equal-length fibers that incurs an insertion loss of 20 dB per fiber, the DCM approach achieves high spectral resolution in a much shorter measurement time. We also verify the indistinguishability of the SPDC signal and idler photons via Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometric measurements.

40|$|Primary snoring {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be a consequence of soft palate vibration caused by a partial upper airway collapse during sleep. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is a surgical treatment used to remove tissue in the throat for snoring and/or sleep apnea syndrome. UPPP is still the most frequently used surgical treatment for snoring and/or sleep apnea syndrome. Innovative advances have recently introduced regarding instrumentation, energy sources, and devices aimed at facilitating surgical procedures in terms of efficient hemostasis, tissue legation and dissection, as well as reduction in surgical time: although curative for many patients, these procedures present side effects. The Ultracision Harmonic Scalpel® is an ultrasonic cutting and coagulating surgical device. The equipment consists of a generator, an hand-piece, and specific inserts. The mechanism of the Harmonic Scalpel® (HS) is based on transforming electrical energy into mechanical movement of 55. 5 kHz frequency. The high-frequency ultrasonic vibrations produced by the HS cause an effect referred to as cavitation whereby the collagen and proteoglycans in the tissue become denatured and then combine with the tissue fluids to form a coagulum. The pressure exerted on the tissue by the blade surface collapses blood vessels and allows the coagulum to form a hemostatic seal. The HS controls bleeding by coaptive coagulation at low temperatures, ranging from 50 °C to 100 °C. By contrast, electrosurgery and laser coagulate by burning (obliterative coagulation) at higher temperatures (150 - 400 °C). The vibration frequency of HS is optimal for soft tissue and does not cut mineralized tissue (lower frequency waves need to be utilized) In UPPP, among the available hand-pieces and inserts, a specific hand-piece and insert was preferred: the insert, shaped like scissor, had a sharp inner beveled radius forcutting under tension, a blunt outer radius for coaptive coagulation, and a flat side for surface coagulation. In all the patients treated, the HS allowed rapid and easy intraoperative management and a precise and safe cut, especially in difficult anatomic sites. The operating fields were blood free with <b>perfect</b> intraoperative <b>visibility.</b> These features facilitate the use of the HS in tight spaces, where precision is essential. Postoperatively, all patients had a recovery of snoring (no complications with regard to haemostasis or other major complication, were noted in our study group), with an acceptable level of pain. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|One of the oft-neglected {{aspects of}} early Baroque {{painting}} is its critical stance vis-à-vis renaissance’s ideal of pure and <b>perfect</b> <b>visibility.</b> The origins of this standpoint {{can be traced}} to the art of Caravaggio, but it is the Hispano-Neapolitan painter Jusepe de Ribera who brings it to a culmination of sorts, in a sustained pictorial quest for a novel sensorial pragmatics. Ribera’s representations of martyrdom, in particular, create a fascinating play between saints’ tactile experience of their suffering, their complex, often-deficient visual perception, and the viewer’s limited access to visual information when reconstructing the narrative on the basis of pictorial evidence. In this article, I analyse Ribera’s creation of mock-tactile textures through purely visual techniques, and the implications of such an artistic method for the hierarchy of the senses in the devotional context of Neapolitan culture in the first half of the seventeenth century. Gilles Deleuze’s analysis of Francis Bacon in The Logic of Sensation and Steven Connor’s observations on skin’s place in modern culture are brought also to bear on Ribera’s epidermal painting and its subversion of ocularcentrism...|$|E
40|$|Evolution of altruistic {{behaviour}} in interacting {{individuals is}} accounted for by, for example, kin selection, direct reciprocity, spatially limited interaction and indirect reciprocity. Real social agents, particularly humans, often take actions based on similarity {{between themselves and}} others. Although tag-based indirect reciprocity in which altruism occurs exclusively among similar flocks is a natural expectation, its mechanism has not really been established. We propose a model of tag-based indirect reciprocity by assuming that each player may note strategies of others. We show that tag-based altruism can evolve to eradicate other strategies, including unconditional defectors for various initial strategy configurations and parameter sets. A prerequisite for altruism is that the strategy is sometimes, but not always, visible to others. Without visibility of strategies, policing does not take place and defection is optimal. With <b>perfect</b> <b>visibility,</b> what a player does is always witnessed by others and cooperation is optimal. In the intermediate regime, discriminators based on tag proximity, rather than mixture of generous players and defectors, {{are most likely to}} evolve. In this situation, altruism is realized based on homophily in which players are exclusively good to similar others...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of {{selective}} attention on metacontrast masking with 3 					different cueing experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 compared central symbolic and 					peripheral spatial cues. For symbolic cues, we observed small attentional costs, 					that is, reduced visibility when the target appeared at an unexpected location, 					and attentional costs as well as benefits for peripheral cues. All these effects 					occurred exclusively at the late, ascending branch of the U-shaped metacontrast 					masking function, although the possibility exists that cueing effects at the 					early branch were obscured by a ceiling effect due to almost <b>perfect</b> <b>visibility</b> 					at short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). In Experiment 3, we presented 					temporal cues that indicated when the target was likely to appear, not where. 					Here, we also observed cueing effects {{in the form of}} higher visibility when the 					target appeared at the expected point in time compared to when it appeared too 					early. However, these effects were not restricted to the late branch of the 					masking function, but enhanced visibility over the complete range of the masking 					function. Given these results we discuss a common effect for different types of 					spatial selective attention on metacontrast masking involving neural subsystems 					that are different from those involved in temporal attention...|$|E
