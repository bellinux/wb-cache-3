40|$|The {{asymmetric}} synthesis of protected amines via the copper/phosphoramidite-catalyzed addition of organozinc and organoaluminum reagents to N-acylimines, generated in situ from aromatic and aliphatic α-amidosulfones, is reported. High yields of optically active N-formyl-protected amines and enantioselectivities up to 99 % were obtained. Under the reaction conditions, partial oxidation of the phosphoramidite ligand to the corresponding <b>phosphoric</b> <b>amide</b> was detected. A preliminary {{study on the}} origin and {{the effect on the}} catalytic addition reaction is presented. ...|$|E

The colR 4 and co 1 R 15 B 2 -tubulin {{missense}} mutations for lysine- 350 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Lee and Huang, 1990) {{were originally}} isolated by selection for {{resistance to the}} growth inhibitory effects of colchicine. The coIR 4 and colR 15 mutants {{have been found to}} be cross resistant to vinblastine and several classes of antimitotic herbicides, including the dinitroanilines (oryzalin, trifluralin, profluralin, and ethafluralin); the <b>phosphoric</b> <b>amide</b> amiprophos methyl; and the dimethyl propynl benzamide pronamide. Like colchicine and vinblastine, the antimitotic effects of these plant-specific herbicides have been associated with the depolymerization of microtubules.

40|$|The {{demonstration}} that hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) possesses potent carcinogenic properties has raised {{doubts about the}} safety of exposure to other <b>phosphoric</b> <b>amides.</b> In order to define a suitable short-term test with which to evaluate such analogues, the response of the Salmonella typhimurium mutation assay of Ames and cell transformation assay of Styles to HMPA and 3 selected analogues has been studied. These analogues were the related leukaemogen phosphoramide, the putative non-carcinogen, phosphoric trianilide and N. N'N''-trimethylphosphorothioic triamide, a compound of unknown and hitherto unpredictable properties. While both tests found the trianilide negative, the Ames test failed to detect phosphoramide as positive and gave an erratic and predominantly negative response to HMPA. In contrast, the transformation assay found both phosphoramide and HMPA positive. This test response profile indicates that the transformation assay is the preferred test with which to evaluate analogues of HMPA for potential carcinogenicity. Some structural requirements for potential carcinogenicity within this class of compounds are tentatively deduced...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: p. 366 - 374. The X-ray crystal {{structure}} determinations {{of a series}} of ring substituted dimethyl-N-phenyl-phosphoramidates, (R) PhNHP(OCH₃) ₂, (R = p-OMe, H, p-NO₂, o-Et and 2, 6 -diMe) have confirmed the preference of the phosphoramidates for dimer formation which was proposed earlier from infrared data. The formation of N - H - - - - O = P hydrogen bonded dimeric species is sensitive to steric effects and the presence of bulky substituents at the ortho positions of the benzene ring prevents dimer formation. The X-ray {{crystal structure}} determination of the carboxylic analogues of the phosphoric amides above, (R) PhNHC(O) R' (R = p-OMe, p-NO₂ and R' = Me or Ph), serves to indicate the differences in the bonding between the phosphoric and carboxylic amides. The geometry of the amide group in the carboxylic amides is subject to the influence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding effects while the <b>phosphoric</b> <b>amide</b> group in the dimer is less sensitive to other intermolecular interactions. In the phosphoric amides the distortion of the amide group from the favourable (planar) geometry arises principally from intramolecular steric repulsions. The bond lengths determined for the phosphoric amides indicate that the <b>phosphoric</b> <b>amide</b> group is less conjugated than the corresponding carboxylic amide group. The P = 0 bond order is insensitive to changes in substituent electron-releasing or -withdrawing ability, The solid state data indicate that the electron density on the nitrogen atom is not transferred to the phosphoryl group as readily as electron density is transferred from the nitrogen atom to the carbonyl group in carboxylic amides. This had previously been suggested from other spectroscopic studies on phosphoric and carboxylic amides. Therefore the approximate reciprocal dependence between the C = O and C - N bond lengths observed in carboxylic amides does not occur in the phosphoric amides. The changes in the electron-withdrawing or -releasing properties of the ring substituent in the phosphoric amides is confined to changes in the acidity of the amide hydrogen atom and is correlated with the N - H [...] 0 = P hydrogen bond length. The angular dependence of the approach of nucleophiles to quaternary phosphonium ions L₄P+ was investigated. The analysis of 36 structures of the general formula L₄P+X- indicates that the nucleophile generally adopts the "face" approach to the phosphonium centre. When the expected leaving group on the phosphorus atom has an acidic α-proton the nucleophile approaches adjacent to the leaving group {{as a result of a}} strong interaction between the α-proton and the nucleophile. This tendency had been found previously and is confirmed by this study. When the expected leaving group is of the form OR or NR and there is no possibility of interaction between the nucleophile and the leaving group the nucleophile approaches the phosphonium centre opposite the leaving group. The angular dependence of the approach of the nucleophiles to the phosphonium centres appears to be as a result of packing factors. The crystal structures of the hydrated and dehydrated forms of synthetic analcime indicate that the structures are essentially identical to structure of the natural form determined previously...|$|E
40|$|Amiprophos-methyl (APM), a <b>phosphoric</b> <b>amide</b> herbicide, was {{previously}} reported to inhibit the in vitro polymerization of isolated plant tubulin (L. C. Morejohn, D. E. Fosket [1984] Science 224 : 874 - 876), yet little other biochemical information exists concerning this compound. To characterize further {{the mechanism of}} action of APM, its interactions with tubulin and microtubules purified from cultured cells of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Bright Yellow- 2) were investigated. Low micromolar concentrations of APM depolymerized preformed, taxol-stabilized tobacco microtubules. Remarkably, at the lowest APM concentration examined, many short microtubules were redistributed into fewer but 2. 7 -fold longer microtubules without a substantial decrease in total polymer mass, a result consistent with an end-to-end annealing of microtubules with enhanced kinetic properties. Quasi-equilibrium binding measurements showed that tobacco tubulin binds [14 C]oryzalin with high affinity to produce a tubulin-oryzalin complex having a dissociation constant (Kd) = 117 nM (pH 6. 9; 23 [deg]C). Also, an estimated maximum molar binding stoichiometry of 0. 32 indicates pharamacological heterogeneity of tobacco dimers and {{may be related to}} structural heterogeneity of tobacco tubulin subunits. APM inhibits competitively the binding of [14 C]oryzalin to tubulin with an inhibition constant (Ki) = 5 [mu]M, indicating the formation of a moderate affinity tubulin-APM complex that may interact with the ends of microtubules. APM concentrations inhibiting tobacco cell growth were within the threshold range of APM concentrations that depolymerized cellular microtubules, indicating that growth inhibition is caused by microtubules depolymerization. APM had no apparent effect on microtubules in mouse 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Because cellular microtubules were depolymerized at APM and oryzalin concentrations below their respective Ki and Kd values, both herbicides are proposed to depolymerize microtubules by a substoichiometric endwise mechanism...|$|E

Like colchicine and vinblastine, the antimitotic effects of these plant-specific herbicides have been associated with the depolymerization of microtubules. In contrast to their resistance to microtubule-depolymerizing drugs, the mutants have an increased sensitivity to taxol, a drug which enhances the polymerization and stability of microtubules. This pattern of altered sensitivity to different microtubule inhibitors was found to cosegregate and corevert with the beta-tubulin mutations providing the first genetic evidence that the in vivo herbicidal effects of the dinitroanilines, amiprophos methyl, and pronamide are related to microtubule function. Although wild-type like in their growth characteristics, the colR 4 and colR 15 mutants were found to have an altered pattern of microtubules containing acetylated alpha-tubulin, a posttranslational modification that has been associated with stable subsets of microtubules found in a variety of cells. Microtubules in the interphase cytoplasm and those of the intranuclear spindle of mitotic cells, which in wild-type Chlamydomonas cells do not contain acetylated alpha-tubulin, were found to be acetylated in the mutants. These data taken together suggest that the colR 4 and colR 15 missense mutations increase the stability of the microtubules into which the mutant beta-tubulins are incorporated and that the altered drug sensitivities of the mutants are a consequence of this enhanced microtubule stability...|$|E
