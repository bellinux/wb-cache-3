Weng Tonghe observed that while the emperor dealt with day-to-day administration, the Grand Councillors gave their advice in more complex cases, and in the most complex cases of all, the advice of Cixi was sought.|$|E
25|$|Isabella's mother married Balian of Ibelin {{in autumn}} 1177. His brother, Baldwin of Ibelin, {{wanted to marry}} Sybilla, but the king {{preferred}} another candidate, Guy of Lusignan. After the marriage of Sybilla and Guy on Easter 1180, a division emerged between Guy of Lusignan's supporters and opponents. The first group included the mother of Baldwin IV and Sybilla, Agnes of Courtenay, her brother, Joscelin, and Raynald of Châtillon, Lord of Oultrejordain. Their opponents included Isabella's mother and stepfather, and Raymond III of Tripoli. To secure Guy's position, the king arranged the betrothal of Isabella to Raynald of Châtillon's stepson, Humphrey IV of Toron in October 1180. Isabella was sent to Kerak Castle to be educated by Humphrey's mother, Stephanie of Milly. Stephanie forbade her to <b>pay</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> her mother and stepfather at Nablus.|$|E

It also cautioned them against [...] "raising their voices and displaying their books there." [...] They were, however, allowed [...] "to <b>pay</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> it as of old." ...|$|E

60|$|Shortly {{after this}} I {{had to go}} out of town. Divers sound sportsmen had invited me to <b>pay</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> their country places, and it wasn't for several months that I settled down in the city again. I had been {{wondering}} a lot, of course, about Corky, whether it all turned out right, and so forth, and my first evening in New York, happening to pop into a quiet sort of little restaurant which I go to when I don't feel inclined for the bright lights, I found Muriel Singer there, sitting by herself at a table near the door. Corky, I took it, was out telephoning. I went up and passed the time of day.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the general}} order, for in the {{afternoon}} there was, when things were quiet, a hush {{for two or three}} hours.

60|$|Mary, at any rate, {{displayed}} {{a great degree}} of decision and energy in her management of public affairs, and in the personal exploits which she performed. She made excursions from castle to castle, and from town to town, all over Scotland. On these expeditions she traveled on horseback, sometimes with a royal escort, and sometimes {{at the head of}} an army of eighteen or twenty thousand men. These royal progresses were made sometimes among the great towns and cities on the eastern coast of Scotland, and also, at other times, among the gloomy and dangerous defiles of the Highlands. Occasionally she would <b>pay</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> the nobles at their castles, to hunt in their parks, to review their Highland retainers, or to join them in celebrations and fêtes, and military parades.|$|E
60|$|Some years since, when {{a certain}} great orator was Lord Mayor of Dublin, {{he used to}} wear a red gown and a cocked hat, the splendour of which delighted {{him as much as}} a new curtain-ring in her nose or a string of glass-beads round her neck charms Queen Quasheeneboo. He used to <b>pay</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> people in this dress; to appear at {{meetings}} hundreds of miles off, in the red velvet gown. And to hear the people crying 'Yes, me Lard!' and 'No, me Lard!' and to read the prodigious accounts of his Lordship in the papers: {{it seemed as if the}} people and he liked to be taken in by this twopenny splendour. Twopenny magnificence, indeed, exists all over Ireland, and may be considered as the great characteristic of the Snobbishness of that country.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{some time}} since Mr. Hethcote ceased to perform his {{clerical}} duties, owing to a malady in the throat, {{which made it}} painful {{for him to take}} his place in the reading-desk or the pulpit. His last curacy attached him to a church at the West-end of London; and here, one Sunday evening, after he had preached the sermon, a lady in trouble came to him in the vestry for spiritual advice and consolation. She was a regular attendant at the church, and something which he had said in that evening's sermon had deeply affected her. Mr. Hethcote spoke with her afterwards on many occasions at home. He felt a sincere interest in her, but he disliked her husband; and, when he gave up his curacy, he ceased to <b>pay</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> the house. As to what Mrs. Farnaby's troubles were, I can tell you nothing. Mr. Hethcote spoke very gravely and sadly when he told me that the subject of his conversations with her must be kept a secret. [...] "I doubt whether you and Mr. Farnaby will get on well together," [...] he said to me; [...] "but I shall be astonished if you are not favourably impressed by his wife and her niece." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{other days}} we would <b>pay</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> the country seats {{at some of}} the great lords' {{beautiful}} fortified places, and the villages clustering beneath their walls. Here we saw vineyards and corn-fields and well-kept park-like grounds, with such timber in them as filled me with delight, for I do love a good tree. There it stands so strong and sturdy, and yet so beautiful, a very type of the best sort of man. How proudly it lifts its bare head to the winter storms, and with what a full heart it rejoices when the spring has come again! How grand its voice is, too, when it talks with the wind: a thousand aeolian harps cannot equal the beauty of the sighing of a great tree in leaf. All day it points to the sunshine and all night to the stars, and thus passionless, and yet full of life, it endures through the centuries, come storm, come shine, drawing its sustenance from the cool bosom of its mother earth, and as the slow years roll by, learning the great mysteries of growth and of decay. And so on and on through generations, outliving individuals, customs, dynasties -- all save the landscape it adorns and human nature -- till the appointed day when the wind wins the long battle and rejoices over a reclaimed space, or decay puts the last stroke to his fungus-fingered work.|$|E
6000|$|However {{much they}} like each other, {{men in the}} London world see their friends but seldom. The place is so vast that even next door is distant; the calls of business, society, pleasure, so multifarious that mere {{friendship}} can get or give but an occasional shake of the hand in the hurried moments of passage. Men must live their lives; and are perforce selfish, but not unfriendly. At a great need {{you know where to}} look for your friend, and he that he is secure of you. So I went very little to Howland Street, where Clive now lived; very seldom to Lamb Court, where my dear old friend Warrington still sate in his old chambers, though our meetings were none the less cordial when they occurred, and our trust in one another always the same. Some folks say the world is heartless: he who says so either prates commonplaces (the most likely and charitable suggestion), or is heartless himself, or is most singular and unfortunate in having made no friends. Many such a reasonable mortal cannot have: our nature, I think, not sufficing for that sort of polygamy. How many persons would you have to deplore your death; or whose death would you wish to deplore? Could our hearts let in such a harem of dear friendships, the mere changes and recurrences of grief and mourning would be intolerable, and tax our lives beyond their value. In a word, we carry our own burthen in the world; push and struggle along on our own affairs; are pinched by our own shoes--though Heaven forbid we should not stop and forget ourselves sometimes, when a friend cries out in his distress, or we can help a poor stricken wanderer in his way. As for good women--these, my worthy reader, are different from us--the nature of these is to love, and to do kind offices, and devise untiring charities:--so I would have you to know, that, though Mr. Pendennis was parcus suorum cultor et infrequens, Mrs. Laura found plenty of time to go from Westminster to Bloomsbury; and to <b>pay</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> her Colonel and her Clive, both of whom she had got to love with all her heart again, now misfortune was on them; and both of whom returned her kindness with an affection blessing the bestower and the receiver; and making the husband proud and thankful whose wife had earned such a noble regard. What is the dearest praise of all to a man? his own--or that you should love those whom he loves? I see Laura Pendennis ever constant and tender and pure, ever ministering in her sacred office of kindness--bestowing love and followed by blessings. Which would I have, think you; that priceless crown hymeneal, or the glory of a Tenth Edition? ...|$|E
