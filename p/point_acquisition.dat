50|$|Power issues aboard MSTI-3, {{caused by}} lower-than-expected battery {{performance}} and {{complicated by the}} spacecraft entering a period of full eclipses during its orbit, forced mission controllers to begin deactivating on-board systems. This began with the infrared instruments on 29 October, GPS on 3 November, and the VIS instrument on 22 November. Even with these measures, an undervoltage event on 25 November caused the spacecraft to lose attitude control, delaying the start of deorbiting procedures. The first thruster burn took place on 2 December 1997 at 04:29:56 UTC while the spacecraft was over Hawaii, lasting 22 minutes 36 seconds and using 12.2 lb of propellant. Following the burn, additional power issues and oversaturated reaction wheels caused a loss of contact and vehicle control. Spacecraft command was reestablished by 3 December, though problems with star tracker <b>point</b> <b>acquisition</b> delayed establishment of attitude control until 11 December. Command sequences for the second and final burn had been pre-loaded onto the spacecraft, and were enacted that same day at 14:11:30 UTC. This burn was programmed to last 1 hour 40 minutes in order to burn the remaining 11.71 lb of propellant to depletion. It was predicted that the spacecraft would impact the Pacific Ocean approximately 45 minutes {{after the start of}} the burn, at around 14:56 UTC. While contact with the spacecraft was established by the Diego Garcia tracking station a few minutes after the burn started, no further contacts were made and radar observation confirmed that the spacecraft had deorbited.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{increased}} use of 3 -dimensional (3 D) cone-beam computed tomography(CBCT) in orthodontic and orthognathic cases has provided {{a clear understanding of}} its benefitscompared to 2 -dimensional (2 D) cephalometric radiographs. However, current “ 3 D hard tissueanalyses” continue to rely on 2 D linear and angular measurements and do not take advantage ofthe vast amount of information that can be derived from CBCTs. The long-term objective is toestablish a user-friendly true 3 D skeletal and dental analysis including quantifiable subnormswith respect to age, gender, and ethnicity. In order to eventually create a comprehensive andeffective 3 D analysis, it is necessary to first develop a true 3 D description of the craniofacialstructure that is both accurate and practical for the user. The specific objective of this study is todevelop an approach for automatic <b>point</b> <b>acquisition</b> for 3 D hard tissue analysis. Materials and Methods: The skeletal boundaries of the maxilla/palate, cranial base/zygoma,and mandible of 24 patient samples were manually plotted in a previous study conducted atUCLA. The same strict inclusion and exclusion criteria was used in both studies, includingrequirements for patients to be 18 + years old, have a class I skeletal relationship, andmesocephalic pattern and omitting patients with significant craniofacial defects, gross skeletalasymmetry or deformity, or history of orthognathic surgery. An extended form to the ActiveShape Model (ASM) was further extended to function in 3 D. Using ASM, automatic pointacquisition along the boundaries of the maxilla/palate, cranial base/zygoma, and mandible wastrained and implemented. A general Procrustes alignment was performed and elliptical-fourierdescriptors were computed on both the points automatically plotted (“estimated landmarks”) andpoints manually plotted (“ground-truth landmarks”), which were later compared. Results: An approach for automatic <b>point</b> <b>acquisition</b> on normative 3 D CBCT images of theadult craniofacial complex was created.

40|$|Constructing a {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) model from sparse data is a nontrivial task. Additionally, inherent to surgical navigation {{is the high}} accuracy and robustness requirement. Here, we report a novel, accurate, and robust approach for reconstruction of proximal femur from sparse intraoperative data and dense point distribution model (DPDM). The problem is formulated as a three-stage optimal estimation process. The first stage, registration, is to iteratively estimate the scale and the rigid registration transformation between the mean shape of the DPDM and the input points. The estimation results of the first stage are used to establish point correspondences for the second stage, morphing, which optimally and robustly estimates a dense template surface from the DPDM using a statistical approach. The estimated template surface is then fed to the third stage, deformation, which uses a newly formulated general framework for kernel-based shape deformation to further reduce the reconstruction error. 3 D surface models of seven dry proximal femurs, obtained from CT volume data, were used in validation experiments. Different strategies of <b>point</b> <b>acquisition</b> are explored for different application scenarios.

40|$|A 2 D photoacoustic {{imaging system}} for spectroscopic {{biomedical}} applications is reported, {{based on a}} Fabry-Perot (FP) polymer film ultrasound sensor. A variety of broadband sensors have been developed with bandwidths from 20 MHz to 50 MHz. These ultrasound sensors have a unique dichroic design which has an optical transmission window from 650 nm to 1200 nm and can be interrogated in the 1520 - 1610 nm wavelength region. This enables the system to operate in backward mode with a tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) as the excitation source for near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic applications such as the measurement of blood oxygenation. The area over which the photoacoustic signals can be mapped is 4 cm × 2. 5 cm with an optically defined element size of 64 µm diameter.

Nine researchers {{with varying degrees of}} osteological and geometric morphometric knowledge landmarked ten iterations of each scan (40 total) to test the effects of scan quality, researcher experience, and landmark type on levels of intra- and interobserver error. Two researchers additionally landmarked ten specimens from seven different macaque species using the same landmark protocol to test the effects of the previously listed variables relative to species-level morphological differences (i. e., observer variance versus real biological variance). Error rates within and among researchers by scan type were calculated {{to determine whether or not}} data collected by different individuals or on different digitally rendered crania are consistent enough to be used in a single dataset. Results indicate that scan type does not impact rate of intra- or interobserver error.

HypothesisWe hypothesised that lack of accuracy in skeletal landmark identification during the acquisition phase and/or measurement variability of the infrared optical system may limit {{the validity of the}} numerical information used to guide the surgical procedure. MethodsWe built a geometric model of a navigation system, with no preoperative image acquisition, to simulate the stages of the acquisition process. Random positions of each optical reflector center and anatomic acquisition point were generated within a sphere of predefined diameter. Based on the virtual geometric model and navigation process, we obtained 30, 000 simulations using the Monte Carlo statistical method then computed the variability of the anatomic reference frames used to guide the bone cuts. Rotational variability (α, β, γ) of the femoral and tibial landmarks reflected implant positioning errors in flexion-extension, valgus-varus, and rotation, respectively. ResultsTaking into account the uncertainties pertaining to the 3 D infrared optical measurement system and to anatomic <b>point</b> <b>acquisition,</b> the femoral and tibial landmarks exhibited maximal alpha (flexion-extension), beta (valgus-varus), and gamma (axial rotation) errors of 1. 65 ° (0. 9 °); 1. 51 ° (0, 98 °), and 2. 37 ° (3. 84 °), respectively.
