5|$|The {{shoot-out}} was a best-of-five and Willie Irvine {{took the}} first penalty for Alloa and scored. Paul Sheerin took Inverness's first <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> despite scoring three goals during the game, two of which were from penalty kicks, he missed. David Beaton then struck the bar and missed for Alloa and Mark McCulloch levelled the score for Inverness to 2–2. Both teams then scored their next three penalties to make it 4-all from five attempts so the shoot-out went to sudden death. Alloa goalkeeper Cairns took the <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> scored; he then saved Teasdale's attempt to ensure Alloa won 5–4 in the shoot-out.|$|E

5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff and a touchback, Florida State's offense {{started work}} at its 20-yard line. Tech {{committed}} a five-yard <b>penalty,</b> <b>and</b> {{as the final}} seconds of the quarter ticked off, Florida State ran up the middle for five yards and a first down. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, the score was 147, Florida State leading.|$|E
5|$|Ricardo Carvalho, Frank Lampard and Avram Grant all {{refused to}} point the finger of blame at John Terry, but {{assistant}} manager Henk ten Cate admitted that Terry was not originally due {{to take one of}} the first five penalties (if Drogba had not been sent off, he would have taken the fifth penalty). Chelsea offered Terry counselling {{as a result of his}} devastation following the miss of his <b>penalty,</b> <b>and</b> subsequently, the loss of the final. Terry was later accused of spitting at Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez, but a UEFA report into the video evidence cleared him of any wrongdoing. Terry also wrote an open letter, published on Chelsea's official website, apologising for missing the <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> costing Chelsea the trophy. Nicolas Anelka, who took the decisive kick, revealed he did not actually want to take a penalty, citing lack of warm-up time.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoot-out}} {{took place}} at the end where the West Ham fans were seated, with Liverpool taking the first penalty. Hamann stepped up first and scored high to the right of Hislop. Zamora took the first penalty for West Ham, but his shot was saved by Reina. Hyypiä took the next penalty for Liverpool, but he also missed, as Hislop saved his shot. Substitute Sheringham took West Ham's next <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> scored, his shot beating Reina high to his left to level the shoot-out at 1–1. Liverpool captain Gerrard took their next <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> scored to make it 2–1, while Konchesky's shot was saved by Reina. Riise took the next penalty for Liverpool and scored to extend their lead to 3–1. Ferdinand was next and needed to score to keep West Ham in the shoot-out, but his penalty was saved by Reina, which meant Liverpool won the shoot-out 3–1 to win the FA Cup for the seventh time.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator <b>penalty,</b> <b>and</b> helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Texas {{attempted}} a trick play, but the pass {{by a wide}} receiver was knocked down by the Virginia Tech defense. After an eight-yard gain on a running play, Texas was penalized 10yards for holding. The Longhorns were unable to regain the yardage lost to the <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> punted to the Hokies. With 2:15 remaining in the opening quarter, Tech fair caught the punt at its 19-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Chelsea {{at home in}} {{the first}} weekend of October. The team found themselves two goals down after 20 minutes, but a converted Dixon <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> goals from Wright and Campbell turned the score around in their favour. Arsenal came away from Old Trafford with a point against league leaders Manchester United on 19 October 1991. After a midweek European football match, Arsenal beat Notts County by two goals, a result which moved them fourth in the table.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} {{federal and state}} civil money <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> fines collected from nursing homes and how states used the collected funds. De-sign and Methods: We used a telephone survey of state officials, Freedom of Information Act requests, state Web site searches, and stakeholder interviews to describe the funds collected, the availability {{and the use of}} funds, public information about <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> fines, and the state allocation process and policies. Results: In 2004, 43 states collected a total of $ 21 million from more than 3, 000 federal <b>and</b> state <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> fines. Forty-two states had $ 60. 5 million in fund accounts from <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> fines available in 2005, and 32 states spent $ 28 million {{on a wide range of}} projects. Fifteen states spent $ 17. 9 million on survey and certification activities, 19 states spent $ 5. 6 million on provider projects, 6 states spent $ 1. 3 million on advocacy projects, and 12 states spent $ 2. 7 million for other projects. Most states did not provide information to the public about issuing <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> fines, have formal procedures to inform stakeholders and allocate funds, or involve stakeholder groups in the decision-making pro-cess. Implications: Funds from federal <b>and</b> state <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> fines vary widely across states. These funds are a resource for improving the quality of nursing home care that needs more attention from policy makers and stakeholder groups.

5|$|Based upon another {{recommendation}} from Cabranes, Sotomayor {{was a member}} of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992. There she was a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death <b>penalty,</b> <b>and</b> voting rights. The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.|$|E
5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the final, Chelsea and Tottenham had already played each other twice during the league season. On 3 December 2014, Chelsea hosted a 3–0 win, with goals from Eden Hazard, Didier Drogba and {{substitute}} Loïc Rémy, despite missing leading scorer Diego Costa through suspension. Tottenham won the reverse fixture 5–3 only 29 days later, with Harry Kane scoring twice among further goals from Danny Rose, Andros Townsend (<b>penalty)</b> <b>and</b> Nacer Chadli.|$|E

5|$|Cottilo {{would be}} elected to office from Italian East Harlem between 1912 and 1922. Raised in the ghetto, he was chosen by the largely Italian {{neighborhood}} and continued to depend upon their political support throughout his political career. He {{was a member of}} the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 28th District) in 1913, 1915 and 1916. He drew support from the Citizens Union and was identified for two notable pieces of legislation; pensions for widows and the Workmen's Compensations Law. He advocated for women's suffrage, gun control, the end of the death <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> school lunch programs.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{refused to}} hold the reunification elections, {{on the basis that}} the State of Vietnam was not a {{signatory}} to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers. Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong, which carried the death <b>penalty,</b> <b>and</b> in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.|$|E
5|$|During the August 10 {{cross country}} phrase, Albert {{completed}} the obstacle course in 9minutes and 44seconds, but accrued a time penalty of 41.60 seconds.

The final part of her Olympic event, show jumping, took place on August 12. She was the only athlete out of the 57 still in the event to be eliminated in this stage.

5|$|Following halftime, Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second half. Texas' kickoff was fielded by Antonio Banks, who returned it to the Tech 41-yard line. On the first play of the half, Thomas was tackled for a loss of two yards on a running play up the middle. After an incomplete pass, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings, who fell down short of the first down marker. The Hokies punted, but Texas was called for a five-yard running into the kicker <b>penalty</b> <b>and</b> Tech opted to re-kick. After the second kick, Texas' offense started at its 17-yard line.|$|E

Virginia Tech recovered the ball at its 26-yard line, but failed {{to capitalize on the}} defensive stop.
