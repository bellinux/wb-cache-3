25|$|During {{the grant}} {{meetings}} in May 1971 {{some of the}} scientists, including Jay Shurley and David Elkind, voiced concern that the prevailing methods of research pursued scientific study {{at the expense of}} Genie's well-being and could cause love and attention to be contingent on her language acquisition. Shurley said that there was strong disagreement during the initial grant meetings and the atmosphere grew increasingly tense and bitter, especially noting that the later meetings excluded {{many of the people who}} had worked most closely with Genie. After May 1971 Elkind declined to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> further, despite having personally known both the Riglers for several years, and in an interview years later he cited a desire not to be involved in a case which, in his view, prioritized scientific research over Genie's care. While Shurley acknowledged that the scientists at the center of the case were in a completely unprecedented situation, he also decided to minimize his involvement over these concerns and felt that by the conclusion of the study all of the scientists, including himself, had been guilty to varying degrees of using Genie as an object and putting themselves and their goals ahead of her and her mother's best interests.|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, MDOT {{announced}} that it was studying whether to repair the freeway at a cost of $80 million, or convert the freeway south of Gratiot Avenue into a boulevard to reduce maintenance cost, making the area around it more pedestrian-friendly, and thus attract development. [...] Converting this segment to a boulevard would free up [...] of land for development which is currently used for the freeway and its right-of-way. The department invited businesses and other groups affected by the potential project to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> in November 2013. Advocates of the conversion cite increased pedestrian access and an improved connection between Eastern Market and downtown as reasons to remove the freeway. Some people who live or work along the freeway and in the downtown area note the improved access I-375 provides to the area as reasons to retain the freeway.|$|E
500|$|The {{ratings of}} the Itchy & Scratchy Show segment on the Krusty the Clown Show {{suddenly}} fail. Krusty orders the cartoon's producer, Roger Meyers, {{to find a way}} to fix the sagging ratings, or else a Chinese cartoon will replace Itchy and Scratchy. Meyers decides to commission a focus group to discover why Itchy and Scratchy has lost its popularity. Bart and Lisa <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> by watching cartoons and answering the questions. However, things do not go well, with the children contradicting themselves when explaining what they want. Eventually, Lisa tells the executives that there is nothing wrong with the show and that it is as good as it has ever been—but after being on TV for so long, the show does not have as much an impact on audiences as it did in its early years. Meyers thanks Lisa for [...] "saving" [...] Itchy and Scratchy, and decides that his cartoon's salvation lies in a new character. He tells Krusty and his team of writers that this new character should be a dog with [...] "attitude", who will be called Poochie.|$|E

500|$|Peters has co-starred in {{a number}} of {{television}} movies, including The Last Best Year (1990) with Mary Tyler Moore, Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1997) with Brandy (receiving a nomination for the [...] "Golden Satellite Award" [...] for her role), and Prince Charming (2003) with Martin Short. She co-starred in her own television series, All's Fair, with Richard Crenna in 1976–77. [...] She played a young, liberal photographer, who becomes romantically involved with an older, conservative columnist. [...] Although Peters was praised for her charismatic performance, the show ran for only one season. [...] Peters was nominated for a Golden Globe award as Best TV Actress– Musical/Comedy. [...] In March 2005, she made a pilot for an ABC situation comedy series titled Adopted, co-starring with Christine Baranski, but it was not picked up. Peters appeared in the Lifetime television movie Living Proof, which was first broadcast on October 18, 2008. She played the role of Barbara, an art teacher with breast cancer, who is initially reluctant to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> for the cancer drug Herceptin. Andrew Gans of Playbill wrote, [...] "Peters is able to choose from an expansive emotional palette to color the character, and her performance... is moving, humorous and ultimately spirit-raising".|$|E

2500|$|Medical ethics {{considerations}} {{were limited}} {{from the start}} and rapidly deteriorated. The PHS asked black Tuskegee Institute physicians to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> by offering funds, employment, and interns to encourage the ongoing participation of the patients. Additionally, the study intentionally employed Eunice Rivers, a black nurse from Macon County, to be primary source of contact and build personal, trusting relationships with patients to promote their participation. To ensure that the men would {{show up for the}} possibly dangerous, painful, diagnostic, and non-therapeutic spinal taps, the doctors sent the 400 patients a misleading letter titled [...] "Last Chance for Special Free Treatment". The study also required all participants to undergo an autopsy after death in order to receive funeral benefits. After penicillin was discovered as a cure, researchers continued to deny such treatment to many study participants. Many patients were lied to and given placebo treatments so that researchers could observe the full, long-term progression of the fatal disease.|$|E

2500|$|The {{events at}} Yen Bai mutiny and the {{discovery}} that the VNQDD had infiltrated many other units reinforced the need for closer military–civilian relations and fast tracked the process of improved relations. According to Morlat, the Sûreté's indirect penetration of military affairs involved linking the military intelligence service (SRM) to the Sûreté and the information provided by it, thereby making itself dependent on the political information and even political judgement and agenda of the civilian authorities. The central SRM then relayed this information to its local branches {{as part of its}} SRM Bulletin. There, [...] "ALL OFFICERS (and not just those of the SRM" [...] were to be <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of the revolutionary groups. As a result of the uprising, the SRM became more closely linked to the Sûreté and its methodology and philosophy in of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial activity. The number of recipients of such intelligence increased markedly due to the decision to have all officers involved in studying revolutionary parties. The focus thus widened from observing only internal army activities to include developments among Vietnamese anti-colonial organisations at large.|$|E
