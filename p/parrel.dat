60|$|Many {{other points}} were {{discussed}} between {{the father and}} son, the latter promising if anything of importance occurred, to find the means of communicating it to his friends at the Knoll, while <b>Parrel</b> was to follow his master, {{at the end of}} six weeks or two months, with letters from the family. Many of the captain's old army-friends were now in situations of authority and command, and he sent to them messages of prudence, and admonitions to be moderate in their views, which subsequent events proved were little regarded. To general Gage he even wrote, using the precaution not to sign the letter, though its sentiments were so much in favour of the colonies, that had it been intercepted, it is most probable the Americans would have forwarded the missive to its direction.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{remember}} no more; till suddenly--a frightful roar of wind, {{a shriek}} of terror from the awakening crew, and a whip-like sting {{of water in}} our faces. Some of the men ran to let go the haulyards and lower the sail, but the <b>parrel</b> jammed and the yard would not come down. I sprang {{to my feet and}} hung on to a rope. The sky aft was dark as pitch, but the moon still shone brightly ahead of us and lit up the blackness. Beneath its sheen a huge white-topped breaker, twenty feet high or more, was rushing on to us. It was on the break--the moon shone on its crest and tipped its foam with light. On it rushed beneath the inky sky, driven by the awful squall behind it. Suddenly, in the twinkling of an eye, I saw the black shape of the whale-boat cast high into the air on the crest of the breaking wave. Then--a shock of water, a wild rush of boiling foam, and I was clinging for my life to the shroud, ay, swept straight out from it like a flag in a gale.|$|E
50|$|Junk rigs feature {{full-length}} battens {{that facilitate}} short-handed sail handling, including reefing. The battens are attached loosely to the mast with lines called batten <b>parrels</b> that allow fore-and-aft motion as the sail {{is controlled by}} individual sheets leading to multiple battens.|$|R
5000|$|... the batten <b>parrels</b> {{are short}} lengths of line or strap that are {{responsible}} for holding the junk sail to the mast. They are quite long, allowing the fore and aft movement of the battens across the mast {{under the control of the}} running rigging.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{opinion from}} someone who does the job: The tar, or [...] "slush" [...] {{is a mixture of}} Stockholm tar, boiled linseed oil, and Japan drier. Many [...] "recipes" [...] for slush exist, but the intent is always to allow a penetrating coat of preservative pine tar that then cures to a harder finish that will not so easily rub off on sails and crew. The term [...] "slush" [...] is also used to describe the grease applied to the masts to lubricate the <b>parrels</b> so that the yards can raise and lower freely.|$|R
60|$|We were, however, pretty long in resolving, and hankered {{about the}} Rio de la Plata a long time. At last we spied a sail to windward, {{and it was}} such a sail as I believe had not been seen {{in that part of the}} world a great while. It wanted not that we should give it chase, for it stood {{directly}} towards us, as well as they that steered could make it; and even that was more accident of weather than anything else, for if the wind had chopped about anywhere they must have gone with it. I leave any man that is a sailor, or understands anything of a ship, to judge what a figure this ship made when we first saw her, and what we could imagine was the matter with her. Her maintop-mast was come by the board about six foot above the cap, and fell forward, the head of the topgallant-mast hanging in the fore-shrouds by the stay; at the same time the <b>parrel</b> of the mizzen-topsail-yard by some accident giving way, the mizzen-topsail-braces (the standing part of which being fast to the main-topsail shrouds) brought the mizzen-topsail, yard and all, down with it, which spread over part of the quarter-deck like an awning; the fore-topsail was hoisted up two-thirds of the mast, but the sheets were flown; the fore-yard was lowered down upon the forecastle, the sail loose, and part of it hanging overboard. In this manner she came down upon us with the wind quartering. In a word, the figure the whole ship made was the most confounding to men that understood the sea that ever was seen. She had no boat, neither had she any colours out.|$|E
5000|$|... the tack <b>parrel</b> and tack line {{secure the}} tack of the junk sail. The tack <b>parrel</b> {{will hold the}} tack into its {{horizontal}} position (parallel to the deck) as a snotter tensions a sprit. The tack line will hold the tack in its vertical position (down to the deck). The tack <b>parrel</b> and tack line can be rigged with either standing or running rigging. The latter, if chosen, will rarely be adjusted.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{running rigging}} {{for the modern}} junk sail can be divided between the [...] "pull ups" [...] (halyard and topping lift) and the [...] "pull downs" [...] (yard hauling <b>parrel,</b> luff hauling <b>parrel,</b> and sheets).

50|$|In the 19th century, a French captain {{is said to}} have marvelled at {{the sight}} of a {{flotilla}} of trading vessels assembled from all corners of the globe in the harbour off Duyong island: Arab dhows, Indonesian perahus, Portuguese lorchas, English schooners, and Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai junks. The two perahu besar of Terengganu, the pinas and the bedar are the result of this cultural interchange. Pinas carry traces of French influence from French pinasse, while the bedar shows Arab/Indian (dhow) elements. Jib and bowsprit in the two are of western origin, as junks almost never carry these features. The sails of both of types are that of a classic Chinese junk: The rigging has an elaborate sheet system, <b>parrels,</b> snotter and lazy jack system. All have been documented in Chinese literature for over 2000 years. The desire for ever faster and more manoeuvrable vessels combined these positive elements and created these junk hybrids.|$|R

5000|$|... secure jaws of the gaff {{around the}} mast with <b>parrel</b> beads if the gaff is a jawed gaff, or {{rely on the}} hoop if hoops are employed.|$|E
50|$|A set of <b>parrel</b> beads {{is formed}} from small balls, size {{depending}} on the application, threaded {{on a piece of}} small line and secured with a stopper knot at each end.|$|E
50|$|The gunter {{is created}} by hoops or <b>parrel</b> beads which secure the gaff loosely to the mast in a {{vertical}} position. A halyard is bent to the gaff jaws to control height.|$|E
50|$|Raising {{the junk}} sail {{is done by}} easing the sheets until the furled sail is blown down wind. This will take the {{pressure}} off the sail and ease the raising. Then {{it is important to}} watch the lines that will run in while the sail is raised, including the gaff hauling <b>parrel,</b> luff hauling <b>parrel,</b> the downhauls if equipped, and the sheets. Hauling the sail with a 3:1 or 4:1 purchase will ease the burden, but the length of halyard will consequently be very long. The fully battened sail will remain calm in the lee of the mast during the hauling. Due to the weight of a huge canvas sail and its many spars, some junk sailors find a winch is needed for the last few feet. There is probably already a standing tack line in place, so the halyard is hauled until the tack line is taut, although {{there is no need to}} tighten up the leech severely to avoid scallops as in trimming the triangular sails. After hauling and securing the halyard, the fore and aft position of the leech is set by hauling the yard hauling <b>parrel</b> until the halyard is close to the mast. A short pull on the luff hauling <b>parrel</b> may be needed to extend the middle battens toward the leech to control wrinkles in the sail. The last act is to haul the sheets and set the sail to the wind.|$|E
50|$|<b>Parrel</b> beads (also spelled parral or parrell) are {{an element}} of sailing rigging, usually {{deployed}} at the jaws of a gaff on a gaff rigged or gunter rigged craft, or on the tack of a spinnaker rigged over a furled jib.|$|E
5000|$|... fix the gaff loosely to {{the mast}} in a {{vertical}} position, parallel to it, with either hoops or <b>parrel</b> beads {{so that it}} will slide freely to the desired height, and ensure that the sail is bent to the gaff.|$|E
50|$|Emergency furling is {{fast and}} simple. When {{the sheets and}} halyard are let go, the sail will blow down wind, drop into the cradle of the topping lifts, while being steadied by the full battens. While this is fast and easy, it will also make a mess of the halyards, boom hauling <b>parrel,</b> yard hauling <b>parrel,</b> and downhauls. They {{will have to be}} put in order before raising the sail again. For non-emergency furling, it is {{preferable}} to drop the sail with two crew so that the slackening lines can be hauled in and maintained in order. Alternatively, a single-handed sailor can lower the sail in stages and attend to the slack lines.|$|E
50|$|Reefing a junk rigged sail is very easy. When sailing {{close to}} the wind, {{all that is needed}} is to ease the halyard. As the sail lowers by its own weight, the other running lines will also relax. The sail is lowered until the desired batten is along the boom. Then the gaff hauling <b>parrel</b> and luff hauling <b>parrel</b> are trimmed, and the sheet is hauled to reset the sail to the wind. When reefing on other points of sail, it is helpful to ease the sheet first to take the {{pressure}} off the sail, and then ease the halyard and trim the other running lines. When sailing dead down wind, it may be helpful to use a downhaul to reef larger sails.|$|E

50|$|One end of {{the line}} is usually {{permanently}} bent to the movable item. When in use the movable item is positioned where it is required, and the free {{end of the}} <b>parrel</b> bead line is passed around the static item and secured back to the movable item. Their function is to secure the movable item in place, but to allow it to move along and around the device.|$|E
50|$|Carved {{images of}} the birlinn from the sixteenth century and earlier show the typical rigging: braces, {{forestay}} and backstay, shrouds (fore and aft), halyard and a <b>parrel</b> (a movable loop used to secure a yard or gaff to a mast). There is a rudder with pintles on the leading edge, inserted into gudgeons. It is possible that use was made of a wooden bowline or reaching spar (called a beitass by the Norse). This was used to push the {{luff of the sail}} out into the wind.|$|E

50|$|Parraleta {{is a red}} Spanish {{wine grape}} variety which might also be known under various other names, such as Tinta Caiada (Alentejo, Portugal) in several Mediterranean countries. Parraleta is chosen as a prime name as it (old synonym <b>Parrel)</b> was used in Somontano, region located in the {{north-east}} Spain, which is its likely place of origin. DNA profiles of Tinta Caiada (Alentejo, Portugal), and Carenisca (Sardinia, Italy), and Salceño Negro (Somontano, Spain) with that of Parraleta suggests that they {{are one and the}} same variety.|$|E
50|$|The lateen style {{triangular}} shaped sail {{was used}} in the Mediterranean as early as the Antique time. With the week winds frequent in the Mediterranean basin, the lateen sail quickly replaced other forms of sails as it made sailing against the wind possible. The rig was commonly consisting of the mast, the lanteen with a triangular sail attached to it, the halliard for raising the lanteen, the <b>parrel</b> (usually placed on the left mast side); a sequence of thin short ropes on the sail for shortening it, the tacking rig used for insuring the front lateen end, and the sheet or poža / škota for keeping in place the back sail end.|$|E
5000|$|Like the symmetric, the Asymmetrical {{spinnaker}} {{is often}} {{stored in a}} turtle, with the corners on top for easy access. While a symmetric spinnaker is flown with a [...] "guy" [...] and a [...] "sheet", an asymmetric spinnaker is flown with a tackline and a [...] "sheet." [...] The tack attaches to the bow or (often retractable) bowsprit, and the two sheets attach to the clew. The head of the sail {{is attached to the}} spinnaker halyard, which is used to raise the sail. The sheets are passed to either side of the forestay, attached to the clew; they may be passed forward of the luff of the asymmetric, or aft of the luff of the asymmetric, between the tack line and the forestay. The sheet on the downwind (lee) side of the hull is used to trim the sail, and the opposite sheet is left slack. Often a tack line is used at leading edge to provide adjustable tension on the luff of the spinnaker. To keep the tack near the centerline of the boat, it may be attached to the forestay with a sliding collar (often riding over the furled jib on <b>parrel</b> beads, tacker or similar device) adjustable with a down haul, or tack line [...] This allows the tack to slide up and down the forestay to adjust the luff tension. [...] On racing boats, the tack of the asymmetric is often rigged to a retractable bowsprit, which increases the foretriangle area and prevents interference with the jib. As this trend becomes more popular in racing boats, it may result in similar adaptations to cruising boats as well.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a fifth-order {{numerical}} scheme is developed and implemented for {{the solution of}} homogeneous heat equation u t = &# 97 u xx with nonlocal boundary condition {{as well as for}} inhomogeneous heat equation u t = &# 97 u xx + s (x,t) with nonlocal boundary condition. The results obtained show that the numerical method based on the proposed technique is fifth-order accurate as well as L -acceptable. In the development of this method second-order spatial derivative are approximated by fifth-order finite-difference approximations which give a system of first order,linear, ordinary differential equations whose solution satisfies a recurrence relation which leads to the development of algorithm. The algorithm is tested on various heat equations and no oscillations are observed in the experiments. This method is based on partial fraction technique which is useful in <b>parrel</b> processing and it does not require complex arithmetic...|$|E
