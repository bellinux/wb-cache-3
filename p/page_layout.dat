5|$|Netherlandish artists found {{increasingly}} inventive ways {{to highlight}} and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored {{the interplay between}} the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the Nassau book of hours (c.1467–80) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland (possibly Gerard Horenbout), known for his innovative <b>page</b> <b>layout.</b> Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred {{the line between the}} miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.|$|E
5|$|Anti-phishing {{integrates}} with Internet Explorer. It analyzes sites, {{examining the}} website's URL, title, form, <b>page</b> <b>layout,</b> visible text and links, {{and uses a}} blacklist to detect phishing sites. Users are blocked access from suspected phishing sites, however are presented an option to continue. In PC Magazine testing, the feature blocked 22 of 24 phishing sites, while Internet Explorer 7 recognized 17 of the 24 sites. In PC Pro testing, the feature successfully blocked access to every phishing site it was tested against. Spam filtering no longer includes a language feature, Symantec claims it is less useful with current spam and created false positives. Tested against 1,500 messages by PC Magazine, Norton let {{over half of the}} spam to the inbox. Five percent of valid mail were marked as spam. This version utilizes Symantec's Veritas VxMS technology to better identify rootkits. VxMS allows Norton to find inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login. This release drops support for Windows 2000 and was compatible with Windows Vista upon its release with an update.|$|E

25|$|Many {{websites}} are skinnable, {{particularly those}} that provide social capabilities. Some sites provide skins that make primarily cosmetic changes, while some—such as H2G2—offer skins that make major changes to <b>page</b> <b>layout.</b> As with standalone software interfaces, this is facilitated by the underlying technology of the website—XML and XSLT, for instance, facilitate major changes of layout, while CSS can easily produce different visual styles.|$|E
25|$|The {{activities}} of typesetting, <b>page</b> <b>layout,</b> {{the production of}} negatives, plates from the negatives and, for hardbacks, the preparation of brasses for the spine legend and Imprint are now all computerized.

30|$|In {{phishing}} {{web site}} detection, comprehensively evaluating page similarity remains a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a learning-based aggregation analysis mechanism to determine similarity of <b>page</b> <b>layouts</b> and detect phishing pages. Our approach automatically trains classifiers to determine web page similarity from CSS layout features, {{which does not}} require human expertise. We prototyped our approach and evaluated it using {{a large amount of}} phishing web pages. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach is accurate and effective in determining similarity from <b>page</b> <b>layouts.</b> Our approach can effectively enhance the performance of existing anti-phishing mechanisms.|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} desktop {{publishing}} {{made it possible}} for type and images to be modified easily on personal computers for eventual printing by desktop or commercial presses. The development of digital imagesetters enabled print shops to produce negatives for platemaking directly from digital input, skipping the intermediate step of photographing an actual <b>page</b> <b>layout.</b> The development of the digital platesetter during the late 20th century eliminated film negatives altogether by exposing printing plates directly from digital input, a process known as computer to plate printing.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 the Rabbinical Assembly {{released}} {{the first in}} a series of successor volumes, Lev Shalem ("A full heart") 2010 saw the release of Mahzor Lev Shalem, for Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, while 2016 brought the release of Siddur Lev Shalem, for Shabbat and Festivals. These prayerbooks contain entirely new translations and commentaries, and slightly different choices of prayers. They often give more literal translations of the prayers. English transliterations are offered for all prayers and lines recited aloud by the congregation. The <b>page</b> <b>layout</b> surrounds prayers with a variety of English commentaries and readings, as one finds in classical rabbinic commentaries.|$|E
500|$|The book makes {{frequent}} deliberate use {{of silent}} panels, focused on imagery with the narrative moved {{forward by the}} characters' actions. [...] Riel's [...] "despairs over the decisions he makes" [...] are expressed through pictures, as Brown {{had come to believe}} that historical comics had been too [...] "narration-heavy". [...] He wanted Louis Riel [...] "to show what the medium is capable of", and made use of greater panel-to-panel continuity. [...] While the grid of panels gives a feeling of page symmetry, the pages are not composed as a unit—scenes change anywhere on the page with little regard to <b>page</b> <b>layout.</b>|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the run of}} the manga, {{the series}} used digital editing processes. After a rough sketch of a page was created, the <b>page</b> <b>layout</b> and basic detail were drawn and scanned into an Apple Macintosh. The major page {{elements}} were then shaded or filled with patterns, and elements that were drawn separately were added digitally to the page. [...] The manga also used a series of [...] "banked images", which were basic line drawings of locations, such as a characters room. Instead of redrawing a location from scratch every time it was used, these banked images {{could be used as a}} base, and extra detail added to them depending on the requirements for the scene.|$|E

2500|$|Baskerville's design {{innovations}} {{extended beyond}} type design itself into typesetting, graphic design and <b>page</b> <b>layout,</b> where he {{moved away from}} the then-current use of decorative symbols and embellishments, instead emphasising the use of visual proportion and white space to maintain aesthetic appeal. In the words of a 2001 British Library publication, [...] "such simplicity, even minimalism, was revolutionary. It was a defining moment in bookmaking, ridding it of the [...] irrelevant, flowery decoration of hitherto".|$|E
5000|$|Adaptive {{web design}} uses {{multiple}} <b>page</b> <b>layouts</b> {{for a single}} web page and sometimes progressive enhancement (PE).

2500|$|An inline link may {{display a}} {{modified}} version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview, cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. [...] The full content will then usually be available on demand, as is the case with print publishing software – e.g., with an external link. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a <b>page</b> <b>layout.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Adobe FreeHand (formerly Macromedia Freehand and Aldus Freehand) was a {{computer}} application for creating two-dimensional vector graphics oriented primarily to professional illustration, desktop publishing and content creation for the Web. FreeHand wassimilar in scope, intended market, and functionality to Adobe Illustrator, CorelDraw and Xara Designer Pro.

2500|$|Later, {{after the}} {{university}} denied him {{access to the}} codex, Mordechai Breuer began his own reconstruction of the Masoretic text {{on the basis of}} other well-known ancient manuscripts. His results matched the Aleppo Codex almost exactly. Thus today, Breuer's version is used authoritatively for the reconstruction of the missing portions of the Aleppo Codex. The Jerusalem Crown (כתר ירושלים, [...] "Jerusalem Crown"), printed in Jerusalem in 2000, is a modern version of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex and the work of Breuer: It uses a newly designed typeface based on the calligraphy of the Codex and is based on its <b>page</b> <b>layout.</b>|$|E
