5|$|Blakeney Point {{has been}} {{designated}} {{as one of the}} most important sites in Europe for nesting terns by the government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. In the early 1900s, the small colonies of common and little terns were badly affected by egg-taking, disturbance and shooting, but as protection improved the common terns population rose to 2,000 <b>pairs</b> by mid-century, although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 <b>pairs</b> by 2000, perhaps due to predation. Sandwich terns were a scarce breeder until the 1970s, but there were 4,000 <b>pairs</b> by 1992. Blakeney is the most important site in Britain for both Sandwich and little terns, the roughly 200 <b>pairs</b> of the latter species amounting to eightper cent of the British population. The 2,000 <b>pairs</b> of black-headed gulls sharing the breeding area with the terns are believed to protect the colony as a whole from predators like red foxes. Other nesting birds include about 20 <b>pairs</b> of Arctic terns and a few Mediterranean gulls in the tern colony, ringed plovers and oystercatchers on the shingle and common redshanks on the salt marsh. The waders' breeding success has been compromised by human disturbance and predation by gulls, weasels and stoats, with ringed plovers particularly affected, declining to 12 <b>pairs</b> in 2012 compared to 100 <b>pairs</b> twenty years previously. The pastures contain breeding northern lapwings, and species such as sedge and reed warblers and bearded tits are found in patches of common reed.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes breathe {{through two}} <b>pairs</b> of spiracles located ventrally on each segment {{near the base}} of the legs. Each opens into an {{internal}} pouch, and connects to a system of tracheae. The heart runs {{the entire length of the}} body, with an aorta stretching into the head. The excretory organs are two <b>pairs</b> of malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. The digestive tract is a simple tube with two <b>pairs</b> of salivary glands to help digest the food.|$|E
5|$|Mingulay {{has a large}} seabird population, and is an {{important}} breeding ground for razorbills (9,514 <b>pairs,</b> 6.3% of the European population), guillemots (11,063 <b>pairs)</b> and black-legged kittiwakes (2,939 <b>pairs).</b> shags (694 individuals), fulmar (11,626 <b>pairs),</b> puffins (2,072 <b>pairs),</b> storm petrel, common terns, Arctic terns, bonxies and various species of gull also nest in the sea-cliffs. Manx shearwaters nested on Lianamul stack until the late 18th century, when they were driven away by puffins, and tysties have also been recorded there.|$|E

5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three <b>pairs</b> of spines on the back, with an additional two <b>pairs</b> at the sides near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven <b>pairs</b> of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight <b>pairs.</b> Both have three to seven <b>pairs</b> of spines near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five <b>pairs</b> of back spines and a pair of spines at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two <b>pairs</b> of back spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E

5|$|The {{nervous system}} of an insect {{can be divided}} into a brain and a ventral nerve cord.

5|$|Ebla was a polytheistic state. During {{the first}} kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon {{of the first}} Ebla {{included}} <b>pairs</b> of deities {{and they can be}} separated into three genres; in the first and most common one, there were the couples, such as the deity and his female consort. The second type of <b>pairs</b> was the divine twosomes, such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos, like in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons. The third type included divine <b>pairs</b> who were actually a single deity that had two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first genre of <b>pairs</b> included Nidakul, who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu ("his wife"); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. The third genre included the artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain Gods; Shahar as the morning star and Shalim as the evening star.|$|E
