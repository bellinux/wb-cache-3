40|$|The {{influence}} of different flow patterns inside the combustion chamber on the combustion process, and thus on performance, consumption, exhaust and noise emissions {{was investigated in}} different operating conditions with varying spark plug types and positions. The charge movement was measured by laser doppler anemometry, optical waveguides were used for measuring the flame front and and indicating system for the combustion curve and exhaust analysis. It was found that flow structures with {{a high rate of}} inlet-generated base flow are favourable for the combustion process. A central spark <b>plug</b> <b>unit</b> is important. In unfavourable conditions, e. g. with exhaust recirculation, spark plugs with aggressive sparks may be more advantageous.

This is followed by a highly simplified protocol to compute multiplications over shared secrets. This is a major component in secure multiparty computation protocols and accounts for much of the complexity of proposed solutions. Using our protocol as a <b>plug</b> in <b>unit</b> for known protocols reduces their complexity.

The displayed results include the transformer step‐down voltage waveform, the unfiltered and capacitor‐filtered dc rectified waveforms and the ripple voltage waveform. The 146 mV peak‐to‐peak ripple voltage obtained accounted for less than 2 percent of the 12 V rectified dc voltage and it matches the theoretical values computed.

50|$|The Leslie {{speaker is}} a {{specially}} constructed amplifier/loudspeaker cabinet {{used to create}} special audio effects such as vibrato, chorus and tremolo. The Leslie creates these effects by rotating the tweeters or horns or a spinning a sound-directing duct around the bass woofer speaker, which causes the Doppler effect. Named after its inventor, Donald Leslie, it is particularly associated with the Hammond organ, but is used {{with a variety of}} instruments (notably electric guitar) and sometimes with vocals. The Hammond/Leslie combination has become a key element of the sound in many genres of music, including early heavy metal music (e.g., Deep Purple), blues, jazz organ trios and some rock genres. The Leslie Speaker and the Hammond Organ brands are currently owned by Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation. Due to the large size and heavy weight of the Leslie Speaker cabinet, some keyboardists use a small effects unit, such as the Uni-vibe, instead, and <b>plug</b> the <b>unit</b> into a regular keyboard amp.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} concept of pulsed plasma {{thruster}} (PPT) micropulsing. Micropulsing was a premise behind a power processing unit (PPU) and an energy storage unit (ESU) design that for certain mission profiles, it was advantageous to operate a PPT at lower energy but higher frequency rather than at a higher energy but lower frequency. This premise allows for reductions in the ESU volume and mass without paying a penalty in thrust. To complete the evaluation, an independent spark <b>plug</b> initiation <b>unit,</b> a {{high voltage power supply}} and a variety of mica foil capacitors at 2. 6, 5, 10, and 20 capacitance were used to conduct a series of tests on a single PPT to map performance levels of thrust, impulse bit, efficiency and specific impulse over a comparable power range. Testing at NASA Glenn Research Center was conducted with breadboard PPT hardware. The test results showed that operating in the lower energy ESU micropulsing mode produced similar thrust levels to a higher energy ESU operating at high power level. Further testing however showed a reduction in specific impulse and efficiency when the smaller capacitances were used at the highest power levels. This would require more fuel mass for a mission that was predominately high power, potentially negating the ESU mass savings. Therefore, micropulsing is advantageous where most of a mission profile occurs at low power, but retains the ability to conduct high thrust maneuvers when necessary...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} atmosphere of incubation in the detection of clinically important bacteremia and fungemia in adults, we compared the yield of microorganisms from 10, 541 paired 5 -ml samples of blood incubated aerobically and anaerobically. The medium, supplemented peptone broth (SPB) with 0. 03 % sodium polyanetholesulfonate, and the ratio of blood to broth (1 : 10) were {{the same for all}} cultures. Only cultures with adequate blood samples (greater than or equal to 80 % of stated volume) were compared statistically. More fungi (P less than 10 (- 7)) grew in continuously vented bottles of SPB. Aerobic incubation also favored (P less than 0. 01) isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Eubacterium; more than 80 % of these bacterial organisms were detected only in vented bottles. Anaerobic incubation (<b>plugged</b> venting <b>units)</b> did not significantly favor the isolation of any genus of microorganisms, although an estimated 11 % more Bacteroidaceae grew in the unvented bottle of SPB. By comparison of our data with published results for other media, we conclude that the need for both aerobic and anaerobic incubation of blood cultures is dependent upon the medium used and the microorganisms likely to be encountered. Vented incubation of blood cultured in SPB is crucial for detection of fungi and some bacteria. Routine use of an unvented bottle of SPB may not be worthwhile for patients in whom Bacteroidaceae cause bacteremia infrequently. However, when Bacteroidaceae are suspected as the cause of sepsis, use of an unvented bottle of SPB is prudent...|$|R

50|$|Ring {{circuits}} {{are commonly}} used in British wiring with socket-outlets taking fused plugs to BS 1363. Because the breaker rating {{is much higher than}} that of any one socket outlet, the system can only be used with fused plugs or fused appliance outlets. They are generally wired with 2.5 mm2 cable and protected by a 32 A fuse, an older 30 A circuit breaker, or a European harmonised 32 A circuit breaker. Sometimes 4 mm2 cable is used if very long cable runs (to help reduce volt-drop) or derating factors such as very thick thermal insulation are involved. 1.5 mm2 mineral-insulated copper-clad cable (known as pyro) may also be used (as mineral insulated cable can withstand heat more effectively than normal PVC) though more care must be taken with regard to voltage drop on longer runs. The protection devices for the fixed wiring need to be rated higher than would protect flexible appliance cords, so BS 1363 requires that all <b>plugs</b> and connection <b>units</b> incorporate fuses appropriate to the appliance cord.|$|R
