5|$|Six years later, Logan {{is working}} as a logger in Canada, where {{he lives with his}} girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero {{approach}} Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the team's members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, Logan realizes Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's <b>personal</b> <b>weapon,</b> but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.|$|E

25|$|The game {{preserves}} many of {{the core}} features of the Halo franchise's gameplay experience. Players step into the MJOLNIR powered armor of a Spartan and control that character's actions. MJOLNIR armor provides deflector shields, which diminish whilst protecting the wearer from weapons fire but recharge after a short recovery. Spartans may only carry two personal weapons at a time, but may swap them out at any time for any other weapon (including those dropped by slain enemies) and may also carry and fire a crew-served weapon (discarded when the player switches back to a <b>personal</b> <b>weapon).</b> Spartans may also throw grenades and use their weapons for pistol-whipping. Finally, some of the vehicles and their mounted weapons are available for use.|$|E
500|$|Before he was born, Gaara's father, the Fourth Kazekage Rasa, had Chiyo make Gaara {{into the}} Jinchuriki for the tailed beast [...] {{while he was}} still in his mother's womb before she died giving birth to him. Though {{believed}} at the time to be Shukaku's power in action, Gaara can manipulate sand, which subconsciously protects him. Rasa intended to use Gaara as the village's <b>personal</b> <b>weapon,</b> but Shukaku's bloodlust proved too much for Gaara as he suffered night terrors brought about by the tailed beast's influence. With Gaara's sand adding to his inability to control Shukaku, the boy became feared to the point his father decided to have him assassinated. Gaara has the belief that he could only rely upon himself and Shukaku, and that he had to kill others in order to confirm the value of his own existence. He thus became narcissistic, even permanently scarring his left temple with the kanji for [...] for his new drive.|$|E

[...] The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible. Once clear they headed for their assembly area, which was also the commando medical post.
