Paces Ferry Rd. connects {{historic}} Vinings in the west, on the Chattahoochee River in Cobb County, {{to the western}} edge of Atlanta's Buckhead area in the east.

The Georgia Governor's Mansion is on this street. Continuing east, West <b>Paces</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> becomes East <b>Paces</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> after intersecting Peachtree Road in Buckhead's entertainment and nightlife district. East <b>Paces</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> runs as far east as Lenox Square mall, after being severed by SR 400.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} <b>Pace's</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> {{was begun}} during the Georgia Gold Rush {{as a stage}} coach bringing people from Decatur to Vinings, where they could continue on to gold country. The road went southeast from the river to Irbyville (later Irby, now Buckhead), then following {{what is now called}} [...] "Old Decatur Road", then Cheshire Bridge Road, through what is now Emory University on Clifton Road, along Haygood Drive then North Decatur Road until that hits Clairmont Road, which was then known as the Shallowford Road.|$|R
5000|$|In 1838, Henry Irby {{purchased}} 202 1/2 acres {{surrounding the}} present intersection of Peachtree, Roswell, and West <b>Paces</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>roads</b> from Daniel Johnson for $650. Irby subsequently established a general store and tavern at {{the northwest corner}} of the intersection. The name [...] "Buckhead" [...] comes from a story that Irby killed a large buck deer and placed the head in a prominent location. Prior to this, the settlement was called Irbyville. By the late 1800s, Buckhead had become a rural vacation spot for wealthy Atlantans. In the 1890s, Buckhead was rechristened Atlanta Heights but by the 1920s it was again [...] "Buckhead".|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{settlement}} {{began at}} {{what would become}} the Buckhead section of Atlanta, several miles north of today's downtown. In 1838, Henry Irby started a tavern and grocery at {{what would become the}} intersection of <b>Paces</b> <b>Ferry</b> and Roswell <b>Roads.</b>|$|R
50|$|In modern times, <b>Paces</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> (dropping the apostrophe) {{is still}} an {{important}} east/west route across northern Atlanta. West <b>Paces</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> runs {{from the center of}} Buckhead Village as far west as a dead-end in Paces, while <b>Paces</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> splits off to the northwest at Nancy Creek and runs across the river to Vinings in Cobb County, where it is the address for the world headquarters of The Home Depot. Beginning at Atlanta Road and going east, it crosses I-285 at mile 18, and heads into historic Vinings where it crosses the Chattahoochee River. This river crossing is very near the old ferry location, just down from the 1904 bridge that replaced the ferry. That first wooden bridge had been used for pedestrians since being replaced by a concrete one in the early 1970s.|$|E

At I-285, Northside Drive forms an unusual interchange, with the road splitting off to the right to form New Northside Drive, a one-way street. New Northside Drive then joins back together with Northside Drive at a four-way intersection with Riveredge Lane, just before it ends by a sharp right turn to avoid the Chattahoochee River.|$|R
