40|$|Many {{people in}} less {{developed}} countries drink water with microbial contamination, {{which leads to the}} annual death of 5 million children. Although some people currently boil water, all microbes that cause disease in humans do not survive at temperatures> 65 ºC, which solar water <b>pasteurizers</b> can easily produce. These <b>pasteurizers</b> are similar to box solar cookers, and typically have a small rectangular reflector. The objective of this work is to calculate the increase in output due to compound parabolic concentrators (CPCs) using numerical simulation. A CPC concentrates the maximum amount of radiation on a planar receiver consistent with the laws of thermodynamics. Since the average water temperature is nearly independent of the solar radiation, the heat losses are nearly constant. Therefore, higher concentration factors yield significantly higher efficiencies. Depending on climate, CPCs increase output by 1, 000 %- 4, 000 %, while the additional reflector would only ~double the cost and necessitate weekly tilting...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Introduction: Ohmic heating	(OH) 	(also	called	Joule heating,	electrical	resistance	heating,	direct	electrical	resistance	heating,	electroheating,	or	electroconductive heating) 	is	defined	as	a	process	where	electric	currents	are	passed	through	foods	to	heat	them	(Figure	 18. 1). 	Heat	is	internally	generated	due	to	electrical	resistance	[1]. 	OH	is	distinguished	from	other	electrical	heating	methods	by	(a) 	the	presence	of	electrodes	contacting	the	foods	(in	microwave	and	inductive	heating	electrodes	are	absent),	(b) 	the	frequency	applied	(unrestricted,	except	for	the	specially	assigned	radio	or	microwave	frequency	range),	and	(c) 	waveform	(also	unrestricted,	although	typically	sinusoidal).

40|$|An {{innovative}} solar water <b>pasteurizer</b> {{was developed}} to directly heat the water by solar radiation using a “Parabolic Trough Concentrator” (PTC).

40|$|Brämhults Juice AB is a Swedish company {{producing}} fresh {{juice for}} the Scandinavian market. Fresh juice {{is rich in}} taste but has limited durability and must be treated with special care throughout the whole supply chain. Not only will {{the quality of the}} product be affected if mistreated, but there are also contamination risks meaning that people actually could get sick, although the risk is very small. There are also other kinds of flow-related risks like single-sourced packages. To reduce the risk of spoiled juice, Brämhults installed a <b>pasteurizer</b> in their production process during spring 2005. An interesting question is how this affected the risks in the supply chain flow. One of the authors (Paulsson 2007) has in another study developed a model, called the DRISC (Disruption Risks In Supply Chains) model, for the structuring, evaluation and handling of risks related to disruptions in the product flow in the supply chain. The DRISC model, seen from the angle of an individual (focal) company in the supply chain, covers all product flow-related disruption risks in the total supply chain from natural resources to the delivered final product, and makes it possible to classify them into 15 different risk exposure boxes, of which 3 boxes have “known result impact” and 12 have “expected result impact”, and also to summarize them in a figure for the total negative result impact. The risk analysis phase of the model is applied in the project to Brämhults juice before and after the installation of the <b>pasteurizer</b> in order to see the effects on the risk "picture". The analysis showed that there was an increase in two of the three “known result impact boxes” and a decrease in the third one. There was also a decrease in eight of the “expected result impact boxes”, and the remaining four were unchanged. Especially interesting is that the three risks linked to market confidence, which before were high or very high, were now all medium. There has also been a change towards comparatively more known result impacts and fewer expected result impacts. The investment in the <b>pasteurizer</b> was about 2 million SEK, and there was a minor increase in the operating costs by 800. 000 SEK annually. Since the costs for returns and withdrawals caused by spoiled juice, which before the <b>pasteurizer</b> were about 6 million SEK annually, dropped by about 90 %, the investment has had a payback time of about 5 months. But the <b>pasteurizer</b> also prolonged durability from 10 to 18 days, thereby making it possible for Brämhults to change from distribution by the company’s own drivers and lorries to all the different shops over to transporting to a limited number of DCs (distribution centres) belonging to different food chains. If we split the <b>pasteurizer</b> investment 50 / 50 on risk and on distribution, we will get a payback time concerning the risk part of the investment of only 2 to 3 months, indicating that it was a very profitable investment. In the costs for returns and withdrawals, only the direct, immediate costs are included. If the negative effects of disruptions on future sales are also considered, the payback time will be even shorter...|$|E

40|$|Pasteurized {{bottled milk}} {{supplied}} {{by a single}} dairy was frequently found to be contaminated with Yersinia spp. Investigations were carried out at the dairy {{in an effort to}} pinpoint the source of these organisms. Viable counts obtained from milk bottle rinses indicated that bottle washing was often unsatisfactory, and on one occasion Y. frederiksenii was isolated from the pooled rinse water of six bottles. Samples of milk were taken on arrival at the dairy and at various stages following pasteurization. Heat resistance tests carried out on strains of yersinia isolated from pasteurized milk indicated that they would not survive the pasteurization process. However two strains of yersinia were isolated from a sample of milk taken immediately after pasteurization but before bottling. The thermograph indicated that the time/temperature conditions applied during pasteurization were adequate. The presence of yersinia strains in the milk at this stage therefore suggests that undetectable levels of raw milk were being allowed to contaminate the pasteurized milk. The absence of yersinia in cartoned samples produced on the same day as contaminated bottled samples indicated that environmental contamination of the bottle filler valve also may have occurred at times.

The SPC was determined at pre-pasteurization, 0 (immediately post-pasteurization), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 24 h post-pasteurization. Final general linear model testing for factors associated with LogSPC was highly explanatory (R 2 = 0. 71), and significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). This final model for LogSPC included time since pasteurization, season, farm, the interaction of time and season, and the interaction of season and farm. The model showed that passage of time was associated with increased LogSPC, especially during summer. In a northern temperate climate under the conditions observed during this study, milk could safely be fed, if defined as SPC 3 ̆c 20, 000 cfu/ml for at least 8 h post-pasteurization during fall and spring, and for 24 h during winter, but only for 3 h, if milk was stored outside during the summer. These results suggest that for milk kept outdoors during summer, any milk remaining after first feeding following pasteurization should not be fed to calves at subsequent feedings, but instead should be re-pasteurized or discarded...|$|R
40|$|The {{industry}} sector {{accounts for a}} high share of the final energy consumption, with industries in EU- 28 accounting {{for a quarter of}} the final energy demand. Studies also show that 45 % of the industrial heatdemand in EU- 27 is in a temperature range that can be supplied with present day solar collectors. Despitethis large potential, solar heat faces obstacles hindering its growth in the industrial sector. The mostsignificant obstacle is the low insight of the industrial system designs and energy demands. Those arecrucial factors for the feasibility and dimensioning of solar heating systems. Three case studies aretherefore conducted in dairy and pharmaceutical plants in order to review the most promising integrationpoints for parabolic trough solar collectors in terms of annual heat demand, temperature level andintegration effort. Two case studies are performed in dairy plants and one in a pharmaceutical plant, alllocated in Sweden. The analyses comprised reviewing energy mappings, process and instrumentationdiagrams of processes and boiler systems, and hourly energy demand data. Simulations have beencarried out with Polysun for the processes with hourly energy data available. Four integration points have been determined to be high priority solar heat integration points in dairyplants, when considering annual thermal energy demand, temperature levels and integration effort. Those are the low pressure steam line, heating of feedwater, clean in place systems and <b>pasteurizers.</b> Solar heat integration concepts have been presented for all the aforementioned heat sinks andsimulations have been conducted for the low pressure steam line and heating of feedwater. A significantamount of excess heat is produced as a result of fluctuating heat demands and peak solar heat productionhours. Further investigation should be carried out, in order to review the potential of supplying excessheat to other heat sinks. Despite the reviewed potential of the clean in place systems and pasteurizers,lack of the hourly energy demand has hindered further analyses of those systems. It is thereforerecommended to conduct energy measurements before taking further measures. Two integration points have been identified in the pharmaceutical plant, namely autoclaves andmultiple-effect distillers. Solar steam generation concepts have been presented for both processes. Theautoclaves are provided with 4, 5 bar steam intermittently, as they work with batches and can have ondutyand off-duty intervals ranging from 3 - 30 minutes. The multiple-effect distillers are providedwith 7 bar steam, which is of rather high pressure for the solar collectors model on which thesimulations are based. The heat demand of the distillers is more or less constant. It was generally easier to acquire data for the integration points at the supply level. For instance, all heatsinks at the supply level had energy demand data available, contrary to the process level. This inclinesadditional focus on integration to the supply level, if the extent of the feasibility study is to be kept to aminimum...|$|R
