40|$|The {{response}} of the forest carbon balance to changes in nitrogen (N) deposition is uncertain, partly owing to diverging representations of N cycle processes in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Here, we examine how different assumptions about the degree of flexibility of the ecosystem’s C:N stoichiometry contribute to this uncertainty, and which of these assumptions best correspond to available data. We applied these assumptions {{within the framework of}} a DGVM and compared the results to responses in net <b>primary</b> productivity, <b>leaf</b> N content, and ecosystem N partitioning, observed at 22 forest N fertilisation experiments. Employing flexible ecosystem pool C:N ratios generally resulted in the most convincing model-data agreement with respect to production and foliar N responses. An intermediate level of stoichiometric flexibility in vegetation, where wood C:N changes were decoupled from plant C:N changes, led to consistent similation of production and N cycle responses to N addition. The scaling of leaf N concentration changes to other tissues, commonly assumed by DGVMs, was not supported by reported ecosystem N partitioning. Our analysis further suggested that the purely heuristic way to simulate foliar N changes can lead to ecologically implausible results, which potentially could be reduced by considering resource-use efficiency...|$|R

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which are correlated to a number of vegetation properties (e. g., net <b>primary</b> production, <b>leaf</b> area index), were compared. The results show that there is a large disagreement between NDVI and EVI anomalies in 1998 and 1999 for Northern Asia. The NDVI anomaly in 1998 was largely affected by atmospheric contamination, predominantly aerosols from extensive forest fires in that year. The EVI anomaly in 1998 was less sensitive to residual atmospheric contamination, as it is designed to be, and thus EVI is a useful alternative vegetation index for the large-scale study of vegetation.

40|$|In forest {{headwater}} streams {{where the}} riparian canopy limits autochthonous <b>primary</b> production, <b>leaf</b> litter decomposition {{is a key}} process controlling nutrient and carbon cycling. Any alteration of the riparian vegetation may influence litter decomposition and detrital food webs. We evaluated the effect of non-native Platanus hybrida riparian plantations on leaf litter decomposition in Mediterranean streams. The experiment was conducted in six headwater streams; three lined by native riparian vegetation and three crossing P. hybrida plantations. We have characterized the processing rates of alder leaves and the assemblages of shredder macroinvertebrates and fungi. Litter decomposition was significantly faster in the P. hybrida than in the reference streams. Although the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration was higher in P. hybrida, no significant effect was observed in decomposition rates. Differences in decomposition rates reflected the macroinvertebrate and shredder colonization in alder litter, with higher abundance and richness in the P. hybrida streams. However, aquatic hyphomycete sporulation rate was higher in reference streams, suggesting that the variation in decomposition rates is {{a direct consequence of}} shredder abundance.

40|$|Theory {{suggests}} {{evolutionary change}} can significantly influence {{and act in}} tandem with ecological forces via ecological-evolutionary feedbacks. This theory assumes that significant evolutionary change occurs over ecologically relevant timescales and that phenotypes have differential effects on the environment. Here we test the hypothesis that local adaptation causes ecosystem structure and function to diverge. We demonstrate that populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), characterized by differences in phenotypic and population-level traits, differ in their impact on ecosystem properties. We report results from a replicated, common garden mesocosm experiment and show that differences between guppy phenotypes result in the divergence of ecosystem structure (algal, invertebrate, and detrital standing stocks) and function (gross <b>primary</b> productivity, <b>leaf</b> decomposition rates, and nutrient flux). These phenotypic effects are further modified by effects of guppy density. We evaluated the generality of these effects by replicating the experiment using guppies derived from two independent origins of the phenotype. Finally, we tested the ability of multiple guppy traits to explain observed differences in the mesocosms. Our findings demonstrate that evolution can significantly affect both ecosystem structure and function. The ecosystem differences reported here are consistent with patterns observed across natural streams and argue that guppies {{play a significant role}} in shaping these ecosystems...|$|R

In plants, a photosynthetic FNR (pFNR) transfers electrons from reduced ferredoxin to NADPH {{for the final}} step of linear electron flow, providing reductant for carbon fixation. pFNR is also thought to play important roles in two different mechanisms of cyclic electron flow around photosystem I; and photosynthetic reductant is itself partitioned between competing linear, cyclic, and alternative electron flow pathways. Four pFNR protein isoforms in wheat that display distinct reaction kinetics with leaf-type ferredoxin have previously been identified.

The role of alternative N-terminal processing of pFNRI is also discussed in terms of its importance for thylakoid targeting.
