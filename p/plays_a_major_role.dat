5|$|As of 2012, {{renewable}} energy <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> {{in the energy}} mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for {{renewable energy}} technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which {{are far higher than}} those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{applications}} of Hilbert spaces exploit {{the fact that}} Hilbert spaces support generalizations of simple geometric concepts like projection and change of basis from their usual finite dimensional setting.

Fox received an honorary doctorate in medicine from Karolinska Institutet for his contributions to research in Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} stories with {{predominantly}} indigenous casts, Drama dari Krakatau {{is set in}} a rural area, far from the cities where the ethnic Chinese populace were concentrated. Geography <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role.</b> The novel starts on a macro scale, depicting the origins of the archipelago from rising sea levels caused by the sinking of Poseidonis, then progresses increasingly towards the micro scale, passing through views of Java, Sumatra, and Krakatoa, before focusing on the home of Tjakra Amidjaja {{and the beginning of the}} plot. A later passage details the view from Mount Ciwalirang, showing Java, Krakatoa and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Iravan, {{also known}} as Iravat and Iravant, is a minor {{character}} from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata. The son of Pandava prince Arjuna (one of the main heroes of the Mahabharata) and the Naga princess Ulupi, Iravan is the central deity of the cult of Kuttantavar {{which is also the}} name commonly given to him in that cult—and <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in the cult of Draupadi. Both these cults are of Tamil origin, from a region of the country where he is worshipped as a village deity and is known as Aravan. He is also a patron god of well-known transgender communities called ThiruNangai (also Aravani in Tamil, and Hijra throughout South Asia).|$|E

5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer {{semi-arid}} conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in excavating the larger canyons.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Presidency is {{administrative}} and political. On the administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising {{the work of the}} Council during its term. This includes summoning the Council for meetings along with directing the work of COREPER and other committees and working groups. The political element is the role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council. In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence {{in the work of the}} Council during its term. The Presidency also <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in representing the Council within the EU and representing the EU internationally, for example at the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in erosion of the surface.|$|E
5|$|As {{often the}} most {{abundant}} apex predator within its ecosystem, the blacktip reef shark <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in structuring inshore ecological communities. Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including mullet, groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, surgeonfish, and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against the shore for easier feeding. Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, shrimp, and mantis shrimp are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare. Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including Acrochordus granulatus, Hydrelaps darwiniensis, Hydrophis spp. and Lapemis hardwickii. Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water. Miscellaneous items {{that have been found}} inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, bryozoa, rats, and stones.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in determining {{the composition of the}} soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, {{there is some evidence that}} wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E
