Numerous expeditions were mounted to search for this treasure, all which ended in failure. The illustration of El Dorado's location on maps only made matters worse, as it made some <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city of El Dorado's existence had been confirmed. The mythical city of El Dorado on Lake Parime was marked on numerous maps until its existence was disproved by Alexander von Humboldt during his Latin America expedition (1799–1804).|$|E
25|$|In the {{political}} philosophy of healthcare, {{the debate between}} universal healthcare and private healthcare is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives {{by the federal government}} to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a giant step in the direction of socialized medicine, many <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage. Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that already exists in the United States.|$|E

[...] The song [...] "Spit" [...] {{was inspired by the}} attitude of local bands towards Kittie. According to Morgan Lander, Spit is [...] "a dark album, but it's about every day life which isn't always peachy". According to Talena Atfield, the album's songs are about [...] "life experiences, basically. Oppression, people mistreating us, people putting you down because you're different, giving you a hard time because of who you are",which she said she experienced or saw in school. Spit was controversial because of its song titles, which made many <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album's songs are about sex. In an interview with NY Rock, Atfield said that none of the album's songs are about sex.|$|E
5000|$|While {{poverty and}} {{inequality}} are important causes of child prostitution, {{part of the}} problem is also a social attitude that views sex--including paid sex--between adult men and adolescent girls as normal.Luis Gonzalez-Polar Zuzunada, president of La Restinga (an Iquitos-based nonprofit organization that works with at-risk children) said about teenage prostitution:"It's not seen as a crime. <b>People</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> way it is.

60|$|When the British troops {{first entered}} New Jersey, and before any battles had been fought, the {{commander}} in chief took advantage of this state of feeling, and endeavored as far as possible to make the <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Redcoats were in reality good friends, and intended them no harm.

Of course rumours get about as to the action of the Nihilists and of the police, but as little is said as possible. It is, of course, a mere rumour that a plot was discovered at the Opera-house. Probably there were an unusual number of police at all the entrances, and a very little thing gives rise to talk and conjecture. <b>People</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police would not have been there had they not had suspicion that something or other was going to take place, and as everything in our days is put down to the Nihilists, it was naturally reported that the police had discovered some plot; and as two of the grand-dukes were there, people made sure it was in some way connected with them.|$|E

60|$|The {{object of}} the Restoration in 1867-8 was, at any rate in part, to restore the {{constitution}} of 645 A.D. The {{object of the}} constitution of 645 A.D. was to restore the form of government that had prevailed {{in the good old}} days. What the object was of those who established the government of the good old days, I do not profess to know. However that may be, the country before 645 A.D. was given over to feudalism and internal strife, while the power of the Mikado had sunk to a very low ebb. The Mikado had had the civil power, but had allowed great feudatories to acquire military control, so that the civil government fell into contempt. Contact with the superior civilization of China made intelligent <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chinese constitution deserved imitation, along with the Chinese morals and religion. The Chinese Emperor was the Son of Heaven, so the Mikado came to be descended from the Sun Goddess. The Chinese Emperor, whenever he happened to be a vigorous man, was genuinely supreme, so the Mikado must be made so.|$|E

50|$|Further {{criticism}} of the sanctions came during subsequent NCAA's investigations into other programs such as Ohio State, University of Miami, and University of Oregon for recruiting violations, all of which led to substantially more lenient punishment than USC's for arguably greater offenses.
