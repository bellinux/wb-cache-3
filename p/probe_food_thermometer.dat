From 1998 to 2010, ten outbreaks implicated undercooked not-ready-to-eat entrées. In each outbreak, affected individuals prepared entrées in a microwave oven, did not follow recommended cooking instructions, and failed to take the internal temperature of the cooked product. This dissertation surveyed grocery stores for product availability, evaluated consumers’ preparation practices of raw, breaded, frozen chicken entrées, and validated on-package label instructions. The survey of retail revealed that several manufacturers fail to provide consumers clear preparation instructions. A video capture system was used to observe food preparation practices of 41 consumers– 21 primary meal preparers and 20 adolescents–in a mock domestic kitchen using uncooked, frozen, breaded chicken products, and determined if differences exist between consumers’ reported safe food handling practices and actual food handling behavior as prescribed on product labels. Differences between self-report and observed food safety behaviors were identified between groups. Many participants reported owning a <b>food</b> <b>thermometer</b> (73 percent) and reported using one when cooking raw, breaded chicken entrées (19. 5 percent); however, only five participants (12. 2 percent) were observed measuring the final internal temperature with a <b>food</b> <b>thermometer</b> despite instructions on the product packaging to do so. Food handling errors identified during the meal preparation sessions were then mimicked in a controlled laboratory setting to determine the impact of such deviations on end-product temperature. For all products, highly variable internal temperatures were recorded across entrées when prepared in a 600 W microwave oven. Microwave cooking of raw breaded poultry products is unpredictable in achieving uniform target end-point temperatures; however, a 1000 W microwave oven consistently produced a safe end product. Data collected through direct observation more accurately reflected consumer food handling behaviors than data collected through self-reported surveys. Low wattage microwave ovens failed to produce a safe end product. Processors should validate instructions for not-ready-eat entrées using a range of microwave ovens rather than a single wattage, develop a unique set of instructions for entrées, and provide consumers clear cooking instructions that result in a safe end product...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{implement}} a culturally appropriate food safety educational program using the conceptual change teaching method while preparing a meal. The food safety educational program was based on the FightBac!™ concepts (CLEAN, SEPARATE, COOK AND CHILL). Quantitative and qualitative date were collected, compared, and analyzed. Two pilot studies were conducted with Native American participants on non-reservation sites in Omaha and Lincoln. A total of 27 participants completed a pre and post knowledge survey and were video recorded preparing a meal. The majority of the participants were female (78 %), had at least a high school education or GED, and were unemployed. The educational component of the program started with an introduction and discussion. Next, participants formed groups of 3 - 4 and prepared a meal to implement food safety practices learned. Participants increased their washing hands knowledge (33. 3 % to 51. 9 %). When participants were asked “after you have used a cutting board to slice raw meat, chicken, or fish and need to cut other foods, which of these is the best way to prevent food poisoning?” an increase in knowledge was found (77. 8 % to 97. 6 %, p= 0. 0002). However, when asked about cleaning cutting boards when coming into contact with raw meats, a decrease in knowledge was found (77. 8 % to 51. 86 %). From video observations, the participants washed their hands prior to food preparation. However, this was the only time participants were observed washing their hands. Many of the participants wiped the counter tops and cutting boards with disinfectant wipes. To ensure doneness of the chicken, most participants used a <b>food</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The educational program was well perceived by the Native American participants at both non-reservation sites.
