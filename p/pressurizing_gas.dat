50|$|Care must be taken, {{especially}} during long burns, to avoid excessive cooling of the <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas</b> due to adiabatic expansion. Cold helium won't liquify, {{but it could}} freeze a propellant, decrease tank pressures, or damage components not designed for low temperatures. The Apollo Lunar Module Descent Propulsion System was unusual in storing its helium in a supercritical but very cold state. It was warmed as it was withdrawn through a heat exchanger from the ambient temperature fuel.|$|E
5000|$|The HIP process {{subjects}} {{a component}} to both elevated temperature and isostatic gas pressure {{in a high}} pressure containment vessel. The <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas</b> most widely used is argon. An inert gas is used, so that the material does not chemically react. The chamber is heated, causing the pressure inside the vessel to increase. Many systems use associated gas pumping to achieve the necessary pressure level. Pressure {{is applied to the}} material from all directions (hence the term [...] "isostatic").|$|E

50|$|Accumulators are {{a common}} part of {{hydraulic}} machinery. Their function is to store energy by using <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas.</b> One type is a tube with a floating piston. On {{one side of the}} piston is a charge of <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas,</b> {{and on the other side}} is the fluid. Bladders are used in other designs. Reservoirs store a system's fluid.|$|R

5000|$|The {{system has}} four spherical <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas</b> tanks in two {{separated}} circuits. Each circuit connects two tanks, and has its individual pressure transducer, valves, pressure regulator and electrically actuated valves. The circuits {{are separated by}} two squib actuated valves that enable to share both circuits, to use a single one, or to use both systems independently.The Helium is stored initially at [...] and is regulated to , with a maximum pressure of [...] and a minimum of , which is the minimum required pressure to activate the pneumatically actuated valves of the SKD.|$|E
50|$|Pressure fed engines have simple {{plumbing}} {{and have no}} need for complex and often unreliable turbopumps. A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas</b> to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks. Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened. If the fuel and oxidizer are hypergolic, they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter. Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed, if the pressurization system also has activating valves. They can be operated electrically, or by gas pressure controlled by smaller electrically operated valves.|$|E

[...] As of March 2016, Orbital ATK is also evaluating Blue engines for its launch vehicles. One of the most innovative features of the BE-4 {{is the use of}} Liquefied Natural Gas rather than other rocket fuels like Kerosene. This new approach allows for autogenous pressurization, which is the use of gaseous fuel to pressurize remaining liquid fuel. This is beneficial because it eliminates the need for costly and complex pressurization systems which require storage of a <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas,</b> such as helium. Furthermore, LNG leaves no soot byproducts as kerosene does.|$|E

40|$|A graphic {{method for}} {{determining}} the composition and phases exist-ing within a propellant tank when liquid oxygen is pressurized with ni-trogen gas is presented, and {{an example of the}} calculations involved is included. The assumed limiting conditions are that the <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas</b> flows adiabatically from the pressure tank and that the equilibrium state exists in the oxygen-nitrogen system. Enthalpy-concentration plots for the oxygen-nitrogen mixtures at constant pressures from 100 to 600 pounds per square inch absolute are presented. Both the equilibrium considerations and a small amount of experimental testing show that gas-eous nitrogen is unsuited for pressurizing liquid-oxygen systems. IMRODUCTION Gas-pressurization systems provide a simple and commonly used means for feeding propellants into rocket combustion chambers. Nitrogen and helium are often so used.

40|$|The {{start-up}} {{of solid}} rocket motors represents a critical phase during their whole operational life, that may induce severe {{impact on the}} payload comfort and on the dynamic operational environment of the launch vehicle. This paper is aimed at providing a first assessment of the ignition transient with the SPIT code of the new large monolithic SRM foreseen in the future configuration of the VECEP upgraded first stage, {{that is based on}} the concept to be an over-loaded version of the current VEGA first stage P 80. The SRM configuration selected is inspired to the P 105, VECEP first stage, designed as a stretched version of the P 80 SRM, with an aft-finocyl configuration and the same igniter and nozzle configuration of the P 80. The parametric analysis considers the impact on the SRM behavior of different kinds of <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas,</b> exploiting the experience and know-how achieved during the VEGA development phase, with a conservative assessment based on the outcomes of the P 80 firings analysis. An accurate analysis of the P 80 firings, in fact, indicates that a conservative assessment of the dynamic environment induced during {{the first phase of the}} SRM start-up can be obtained assuming a mixture of helium with a small percentage of nitrogen as <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas.</b> Results for the P 80 XL stretched tentative configuration indicates that the use of helium as <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas</b> is mandatory for controlling the SRM behavior during the ignition transient...|$|E

40|$|A three-stage launcher, with solid-propellant {{first and}} second stage and a hybrid-propellant third stage is considered. The design of the hybrid-propellant upper stage and the whole ascent {{trajectory}} are simultaneously optimized {{by means of a}} nested direct/indirect procedure, while the characteristics of the {{first and second}} stages are assigned. Direct optimization of the parameters that affect the motor design is coupled with indirect trajectory optimization to maximize the launcher payload. A mission profile based on the Vega launcher is considered. The feed system exploits a <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas,</b> namely helium, with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer, and polyethylene as the fuel. The simplest blowdown design is compared with a more complex pressurizing system, which has an additional gas tank that allows for a phase with constant pressure in the oxidizer tank. The optimization provides the optimal values of the main engine design parameters (<b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas</b> mass, nozzle expansion ratio, and initial values of tank pressure, mixture ratio and thrust), the corresponding grain and engine geometry, and the control law (thrust direction during the ascent trajectory and engine ignition and shutoff times).

40|$|Trouble-free {{operation}} of liquid rocket engines (LRE) depends, among other factors, on the nonstop {{supply of liquid}} rocket fuel components in the fuel tank feed line with continuous flow. This condition becomes especially relevant for the aerial vehicles (AV) in orbital (suborbital) environment. With a little filled fuel tanks discontinuity of flow may occur because of <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas</b> blow-by in the feed line {{as a result of}} the funnel generation (with or without vortex formation) and so-called phenomenon of dynamic failure of the interface "liquid-gas”. The paper presents a mathematical model of the process of emptying tank initially a little filled and having a reduced level of the gravity acceleration. Using the developed mathematical model a parametric study has been conducted to find how stabilization rate of liquid flow effects on the volume of drained liquid. The computational experiment defines gas blow-by points in the feed line and propellant residuals, depending on the flow rate, physical properties of the fuel components, residual value of the acceleration, and diameter of the feed line. As a result, an effect is discovered that previously has been never mentioned in publications on research of the emptying processes of the aircraft fuel tanks, namely: with abrupt bootstrap of the flow rate a blow-by of gas occurs at the initial stage of emptying tank. In this case, to ensure LRE trouble-free operation there is a need in a special inner-tank device to prevent premature blow-by of <b>pressurizing</b> <b>gas</b> in the tank feed line. </p...|$|E
40|$|Trees of Central Amazonian {{whitewater}} floodplain {{forests are}} subjected to extended flood periods lasting several months. They must therefore be highly adapted to long-term flooding and to oxygen shortage in the soil and roots {{which is expected to}} be the main stress factor in this environment. The improvement of oxygen transport to the roots by <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas</b> transport, known for some tree species of the temperate zone, is one specific adaptation to flooding. To evaluate its significance, gas transport measurements were carried out under experimental conditions with saplings of five Amazonian tree species. Internal aeration of the roots was improved under conditions of <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas</b> transport as shown by polarographical measurements of oxygen exchange between root and rhizosphere. Tracer gas measurements using sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) showed gas permeability of transport pathways between stem base and roots. Based on the data, we suppose that <b>pressurized</b> <b>gas</b> transport significantly contributes to internal aeration of roots in Amazonian floodplain saplings growing on the higher levels in the flooding gradient, with low water columns, and is an important adaptation for establishment in these temporarily inundated habitats also in the weeks of rising and lowering water levels...|$|R
