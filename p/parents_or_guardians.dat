25|$|On appeal, Salaam's {{supporters}} and attorneys charged {{that he had}} been held by police without access to <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardians.</b> The majority appellate court decision noted that Salaam had initially lied to police in claiming to be 16, and he had backed up his claim with a transit pass that indeed (falsely, as it turned out) indicated that he was 16. If a suspect has reached 16 years of age, his <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardians</b> no longer have a right to accompany him during police questioning, or to refuse to permit him to answer any questions. When Salaam informed police of his true age, police permitted his mother to be present.|$|E

25|$|According to the Pāli Canon & Āgama (the Early Buddhist scriptures), {{there is}} no any saying that same or {{opposite}} gender relations {{have anything to do}} with sexual misconduct, and some Theravada monks express that same-gender relations do not violate the rule to avoid sexual misconduct, which means not having sex with someone under age (thus protected by their <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardians),</b> someone betrothed or married and who have taken vows of religious celibacy.|$|E
25|$|TCKs {{who have}} <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardians</b> {{affiliated}} with the military have varying levels of exposure to local culture. This {{is due to the}} possibility of living on base or off base. TCKs who live off base or who are not closely {{affiliated with the}} military (such as contractors) will have higher exposure and cultural shaping, while those who spend the majority of their time on the base will have lower exposure and minimal cultural shaping. Military children who are immersed in local culture from birth tend to show an extremely high level of cultural shaping, and upon relocation they are likely to cling to said culture for years, if not their lifetime. Relocation for these particular TCKs has shown to be particularly marring for them emotionally.|$|E
25|$|In tennis, {{a junior}} is a player under 18 {{who is still}} legally {{protected}} by a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardian.</b> Players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardian.</b> These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.|$|R
25|$|If {{the victim}} is a minor, consent must come from a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardian.</b> However, if the legal <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardian</b> is absent, unconscious, {{delusional}} or intoxicated, consent is implied. A responder {{is not required to}} withhold life-saving treatment (e.g., CPR or the Heimlich maneuver) from a minor if the <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardian</b> will not consent. The <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardian</b> is then considered neglecting, and consent for treatment is implied by default because neglect has been committed. Special circumstances may exist if child abuse is suspected (the courts will usually give immunity to those first responders who report what they reasonably consider to be evidence of child abuse or neglect, similar to that given to those who have an actual duty to report such abuse, such as teachers or counsellors).|$|R

The curriculum contains only general education until the 9th year at which point vocational subjects are introduced.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Black {{did not believe}} that the equal {{protection}} clause made poll taxes unconstitutional. During his first term on the Court, he participated in a unanimous decision to uphold Georgia's poll tax in the case of Breedlove v. Suttles. Then, twenty-nine years later, he dissented from the Court's ruling in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections (1966), invalidating the use of the poll tax as a qualification to vote, in which Breedlove was overturned. He criticized the Court for exceeding its [...] "limited power to interpret the original meaning of the Equal Protection Clause" [...] and for [...] "giving that clause a new meaning which it believes represents a better governmental policy." [...] He also dissented from Kramer v. Union Free School District No. 15 (1969), in which a majority struck down a statute that prohibited registered voters from participating in certain school district elections unless they owned or rented real property in their local school district, or were <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> <b>guardians</b> of children attending the public schools in the district.|$|E

In later times, influenced in a measure by the Christian parochial schools of the thirteenth century, the reading of the prayers and benedictions and the teaching of the principles of the Jewish faith were included.
