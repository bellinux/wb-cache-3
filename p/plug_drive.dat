40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} both experimentally and theoretically {{the dynamics of}} a liquid <b>plug</b> <b>driven</b> by a cyclic forcing inside a cylindrical rigid capillary tube. First, it is shown that {{depending on the type}} of forcing (flow rate or pressure cycle), the dynamics of the liquid plug can either be stable and periodic, or conversely accelerative and eventually leading to the plug rupture. In the latter case, we identify the source of the instability to be a combination of a flow memory resulting from liquid film deposition on the walls and a lubrication effect, i. e. a reduction of the plug resistance to motion when the walls are prewetted. Second, we show that contrary to unidirectional pressure forcing, cyclic forcing enables breaking of large plugs in confined space though it requires longer times. All the experimentally observed tendencies are quantitatively recovered from an analytical model. This study not only reveals the underlying physics but also opens up the prospect for the simulation of " breathing " of liquid plugs in complex geometries and the determination of optimal cycles for obstructed airways reopening...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the propagation of}} a liquid <b>plug</b> <b>driven</b> by a constant pressure within a rigid axisymmetric tube whose inner surface is coated by a thin liquid film. The Navier–Stokes equations are solved using the finite-volume method and the SIMPLEST algorithm. The effects of precursor film thickness, initial plug length, pressure drop across the plug, and constant surface tension on the plug behavior and tube wall mechanical stresses are investigated. As a plug propagates through a liquid-lined tube, the plug gains liquid from the leading front film, and it deposits liquid into the trailing film. If the trailing film is thicker (thinner) than the precursor film, the plug volume decreases (increases) as it propagates. For a decreasing volume, eventually the plug ruptures. Under {{a specific set of}} conditions, the trailing film thickness equals the precursor film thickness, which leads to steady state results. The plug speed decreases as the precursor film thins because the resistance to the moving front meniscus increases. As the pressure drop across the plug decreases, the plug speed decreases resulting in thinning of the trailing film. As the plug length becomes longer, the viscous resistance in the plug core region increases, which slows the plug and causes the trailing film to become even thinner. The magnitude of the pressure and shear stress at the tube inner wall is maximum in the front meniscus region, and it increases with a thinner precursor film. As the surface tension increases, the plug propagation speed decreases, the strength of the wall pressure in the front meniscus region increases, and the pressure gradient around the peak pressure becomes steeper...|$|R

30|$|Spontaneous {{imbibition}} test acceptably simulates {{the production}} from fractured reservoirs in the tertiary oil recovery stage. In {{this type of}} experiment, the fluid in the fracture (brine around the core) penetrates into the core <b>plug</b> and <b>drives</b> the trapped oil out of the core. The fluid displacement in the Spontaneous imbibition phenomena is governed by both capillary and gravity forces. However, the small height of core plug and also the significance of capillary pressure {{in the case of}} tight rocks might lead to the capillary force as dominant mechanism, whereas the gravity force becomes negligible. Wettability alteration of pore surfaces towards water-wetness by imbibing fluid {{would be one of the}} main mechanisms that lead to the oil production from core plug during imbibition test. As above mentioned, the low-salinity water injection has been proposed to reach this purpose (Tang and Morrow 1997 a; Shehata and Nasr El-Din 2015).|$|R

5000|$|Avery started {{building}} agricultural trucks in 1910. Early truck manufacturers were uncertain how to market their product {{and whether they}} should just be used to haul goods or should also be useful in the field. Avery described its truck as a 'gasoline farm wagon' and 'general farm power machine' for city, town, and country hauling. Their advertising suggested the farmer could use it to haul livestock, grain, hay, and other loads, as to pull plows, road graders, harrows, discs, binders, and other farm machinery, as well as loaded wagons. The truck weighed 1 ST and featured a four-cylinder engine, open cab and chain drive. Its wheels had wooden spokes and rims, while the steel tires were 1.5 inx5 in wide. [...] Avery figured farmers could get the most use out of the machines during the harvest season. Their tractor trucks included a large belt pulley that could {{be attached to the}} front crank shaft, useful for powering grain separators and other belt-driven machines. Early models had cast steel wheels with holes. Wooden <b>plugs</b> were <b>driven</b> into the holes to provide added traction. When the wooden plugs wore down, the owner simply replaced them with new wooden plugs.|$|R

50|$|The SCSI ID of {{a device}} in a drive {{enclosure}} {{that has a}} back plane is set either by jumpers or by the slot in the enclosure the device is installed into, depending {{on the model of}} the enclosure.

A SCSI enclosure without a back plane often has a switch for each drive to choose the drive's SCSI ID. The enclosure is packaged with connectors that must be <b>plugged</b> into the <b>drive</b> where the jumpers are typically located; the switch emulates the necessary jumpers. While there is no standard that makes this work, drive designers typically set up their jumper headers in a consistent format that matches the way that these switches implement.|$|R

6000|$|The {{march of}} Bishop Hatton {{at the head}} of the Hell-cats into the mining districts was perhaps the most {{striking}} popular movement since the Pilgrimage of Grace. Mounted on a white mule, wall-eyed and of hideous form, the Bishop brandished a huge hammer with which he had announced he would destroy the enemies of the people: all butties, doggies, dealers in truck and tommy, middle masters and main masters. Some thousand Hell-cats followed him brandishing bludgeons, or armed with bars of iron, pickhandles, and hammers. On each side of the Bishop, on a donkey, was one of his little sons, as demure and earnest as if he were handling his file. A flowing standard of silk inscribed with the Charter, and which had been presented to him by the delegate, was borne before him like the oriflamme. Never was such a gaunt, grim crew. As they advanced their numbers continually increased, for they arrested all labour in their progress. Every engine was stopped, the <b>plug</b> was <b>driven</b> out of every boiler, every fire was extinguished, every man was turned out. The decree went forth that labour was to cease until the Charter was the law of the land: the mine and the mill, the foundry and the loom-shop were until that consummation to be idle: nor was the mighty pause to be confined to these great enterprises. Every trade of every kind and description was to be stopped: tailor and cobbler, brushmaker and sweep, tinker and carter, mason and builder, all, all; for all an enormous Sabbath that was to compensate for any incidental suffering that it induced by the increased means and the elevated condition it ultimately would insure--that paradise of artizans, that Utopia of Toil, embalmed in those ringing words, sounds cheerful to the Saxon race--"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work." ...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{are under}} way to develop a nanofluidic size-exclusion {{chromatograph}} (SEC), which would be a compact, robust, lightweight instrument for separating molecules of interest according to their sizes and measuring their relative abundances in small samples. About as large as a deck of playing cards, the nanofluidic SEC would serve, in effect, as a laboratory on a chip that would perform the functions of a much larger, conventional, bench-top SEC and ancillary equipment, while consuming much less power and much smaller quantities of reagent and sample materials. Its compactness and low power demand would render it attractive for field applications in which, typically, it would be used to identify and quantitate a broad range of polar and nonpolar organic compounds in soil, ice, and water samples. Size-exclusion chromatography is a special case of high-performance liquid chromatography. In a conventional SEC, a sample <b>plug</b> is <b>driven</b> by pressure along a column packed with silica or polymer beads that contain uniform nanopores. The interstices between, and the pores in, the beads collectively constitute a size-exclusion network. Molecules follow different paths through the size-exclusion network, such that characteristic elution times can be related to sizes of molecules: basically, smaller molecules reach the downstream end of the column after the larger ones do because the smaller ones enter minor pores and stay there for a while, whereas the larger ones do not enter the pores. The volume accessible to molecules gradually diminishes as their size increases. All molecules bigger than a pore size elute together. For most substances, the elution times and sizes of molecules can be correlated directly with molecular weights. Hence, by measuring the flux of molecules arriving at the downstream end as a function of time, one can obtain a liquid mass spectrum for the molecules present in a sample over a broad range of molecular weights...|$|R
40|$|In rotary piercing, as in {{most other}} metal-working processes, there occur {{redundant}} deformations, i. e. deformations which are not essential to the required change of shape of the workpiece. Since these deformations are responsible for unnecessary additional straining of the material and can impose limitations on the range of applications of the process, {{it is important to}} establish their nature {{and the way in which}} they vary with piercer conditions. Means can then be devised of reducing them and hence reducing the severity of the process. This investigation, based on work carried out on a specially designed experimental mill and using wax as model material, was concerned with three types of deformation, viz. circumferential shear, longitudinal shear, and shear due to twist. The incidence and pattern of these deformations for two-roll barrel piercers, both with freely rotating and with <b>driven</b> <b>plugs,</b> are analysed and the probable reasons for their occurrence are given. Methods of calculation of redundancy in the system are derived which enable all redundant deformations in rotary piercing to be compared with each other and, if necessary, with redundant deformations in other processes. General conclusions concerning the pattern and flow for various conditions of rotary piercing are set out and discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSodium cooled {{fast breeder}} {{reactors}} constitute {{the second stage}} of India's three -stage nuclear energy programme, for effective utilization of the country's limited reserves of natural uranium and exploitation of its large reserves of thorium. The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) at Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam, is a loop type, sodium cooled fast reactor. Its main aim is to provide experience in fast reactor operation, large scale sodium handling and to serve as a test bed for irradiation of fast reactor fuels & materials. FBTR was built on the lines of the French Rapsodie-Fortissimo reactor, with modifications to make it a generating plant. FBTR went critical on 18 th Oct 1985 with a small core of 22 fuel subassemblies of a unique, high Pu carbide fuel. The core was rated for 10. 5 MWt. The TG was rolled and synchronized to the grid in July 1997. Reactor power was progressively increased by enlarging the core, to reach 18. 6 MWt. Several challenges in reactor operation came on the way, which were successfully overcome. A large number of modifications were carried out to improve the plant performance. The reactor coolant used (Sodium) is highly reactive when exposed to atmosphere and also becomes highly active on exposure to neutron radiation. These properties of sodium make it essential to handle it carefully and safely within a leak tight containment. During course of operation of the reactor, a number of sodium laden components viz. pumps, valves, cold traps, Rupture discs, level probes, shielding <b>plugs,</b> control rod <b>drive</b> mechanisms, experimental assemblies, piping etc. are required to be removed for various maintenance, modification and replacement jobs.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of wells {{will have to be}} plugged and {{abandoned}} in the future. On the Norwegian continental shelf, 2000 wells will have to be abandoned from 2011 - 2040. The costs of plugging a well are high and can contribute with up to 25 % of the total cost of the well. In this thesis bentonite was evaluated as an alternative sealing material to cement for plug and abandonment of wells. Bentonite shows superior sealing ability {{due to the fact that}} it will swell and expand during hydration compared to cement which has the tendency to shrink. A hydrated bentonite plug also has a lower permeability than cement, and it has the ability to reshape itself and heal any cracks which may occur during subsurface movements. A literature study was performed to review previous work, and tests using bentonite as a sealing material was conducted in the lab. In the lab experiments, 9 fullbore plugs and 6 annulus plugs of different lengths made of bentonite pellets were tested. In addition, 7 fullbore plugs and 5 annulus plugs made of dry powdered bentonite were tested. Fullbore plugs were tested in an 8, 97 cm ID plastic pipe while annulus plugs were tested between the same plastic pipe and a 5, 00 cm OD plastic pipe. The total length of the test pipe was 1 m. In all the experiments, bentonite created a hydraulically solid plug, both for fullbore plugs and annulus plugs. The pressure needed to dislodge the plugs varied from 20 kPa to 101 kPa with plug lengths from 23 cm to 91 cm. The pressure was found to increase linearly with the length of the plug for both fullbore plugs and annulus plugs, whether bentonite pellets or dry powdered bentonite were used to create the plugs. This leads to the shear strength &# 964; being independent of plug length. The shear strength &# 964; between the hydrated plugs made of bentonite pellets and the plastic pipes was found to be 1, 33 kPa for fullbore plugs and 1, 02 kPa for annulus plugs. For plugs prepared by powdered bentonite the shear strength was found to be 1, 40 kPa for fullbore plugs and 0, 89 kPa for annulus plugs. The density of the hydrated bentonite pellets plugs was found to be 1, 533 g/cm 3. The expansion from dry volume of pellets to hydrated plug volume was in the range of 92 %- 120 %. The dry density of the pellets before hydration was measured to 2, 025 g/cm 3. The density of plugs made of powdered bentonite was found to be 1, 102 g/cm 3. The expansion from dry volume of powdered bentonite to hydrated plug volume was in the range of 283 - 332 %. The dry density of the powdered bentonite was measured to 1, 09 g/cm 3. Theory and experiments from soil <b>plugs</b> in <b>driven</b> piles predict that a relatively short sand plug can resist very large forces. By placing a suitable sand plug on top of a bentonite plug, the result could be a short total plug length which is impermeable due to bentonite and can resist large forces due to the sand plug. Plug height needed to achieve a plug capacity of 200 bar in a 5 ½” casing is 352 m for bentonite pellets using the shear strength found for plastic pipes. By taking the increased roughness of a steel pipe into account the height needed is estimated to 89 m. The same pressure rating can be achieved using a combination of a 2 m long sand plug placed on top of a 10 m long bentonite plug. Further work is suggested to be carried out on combining a bentonite plug with a sand plug located on top. Improved methods for placement of bentonite and sand in the wellbore should also be investigated. </p...|$|R
