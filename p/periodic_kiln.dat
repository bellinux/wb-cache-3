50|$|The kiln at Griggsville Landing {{is known}} as a <b>periodic</b> <b>kiln.</b> The <b>periodic</b> <b>kiln</b> is an older {{technology}} which was used in the United States mostly before the Civil War. The technology utilized at Griggsville Landing, however, is far superior to the so-called heap kilns used in lime production.|$|E
50|$|The heap kiln went by {{the wayside}} as the <b>periodic</b> <b>kiln</b> came into vogue. Periodic kilns are much more {{efficient}} than the log heap kiln that preceded them. The most efficient type of <b>periodic</b> <b>kiln</b> is a stone or brick walled vertical kiln. This walled vertical kiln is what appears at Griggsville Landing. The specific kiln at Griggsville has an opening at the base and at the top, with walls nearly three feet thick. The appearance of {{the walls of the}} Griggsville Landing Kiln suggests that they were either dry laid or laid with a mud mortar that has since been dusted away by time. The walls of the vertical kiln at Griggsville Landing rise 17 feet above the forest floor and the inside has a diameter of 13 feet.|$|E
50|$|The Griggsville Landing Lime Kiln {{is one of}} the best-preserved <b>periodic</b> lime <b>kilns</b> {{found in}} the U.S. state of Illinois. When it was built is unknown but it has been {{established}} that it is likely it was constructed in the mid-1850s. Local traditions hold that the Griggsville Landing kiln was used by English stonemason William Hobson. It is said Hobson used the kiln in conjunction with the construction of homes, barns and stone arch bridges in the area during the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The Griggsville Landing Lime Kiln {{is one of}} only a few old lime kilns {{preserved}} {{across the}} state of Illinois. Some examples can be found in such places as, Maeystown, where a <b>periodic</b> vertical <b>kiln</b> remains, Kankakee River State Park in Will County, where pieces of an old lime kiln lie in an old limestone quarry. Other kilns can be found in Ogle County, near Polo, where a stone kiln remains, a poorly preserved vertical kiln in Port Byron and a well-preserved kiln in Cordova, Illinois.|$|R
50|$|The Griggsville Landing Lime Kiln {{is located}} near village of Valley City, Illinois in Pike County. The <b>periodic</b> lime <b>kiln</b> is {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places, a {{designation}} it gained in August 1999. It is actually {{within the boundaries of}} the Ray Norbut State Fish and Wildlife Area. The kiln represents an example of an 1850s lime kiln, one of the best-preserved examples of such a kiln. In its heyday the kiln's raw product would have been quicklime. The kiln is one of twelve Pike County sites included in the National Register of Historic Places. Some other examples are the Lyman Scott House, in Summer Hill and the New Philadelphia Town Site, somewhere near Barry, Illinois.|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the problem of}} air pollution burning organic waste from agricultural and drinks production sectors. Chicken and pig manure and biogas dregs after extraction, i. e. after the process of fermentation in laboratory bioreactors were selected {{as an object of}} research. The article presents the method of fermented waste incineration and the experimental results of waste incineration. <b>Periodic</b> surveys of <b>kiln</b> load disclosed that under combustion, pollutant concentrations change over time depending on the stage of combustion.
