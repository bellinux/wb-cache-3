25|$|Morphological {{operations}} {{is the second}} least used <b>pre-processing</b> method in 2014 review. The main objective of this method is to provide contrast enhancement, especially darker regions compared to background.|$|E
25|$|After <b>pre-processing</b> of funduscopic image, {{the image}} will be further {{analyzed}} using different computational methods. However, the current literature agreed that some methods are used {{more often than}} others during vessel segmentation analyses. These methods are SVM, multi-scale, vessel-tracking, region growing approach, and model-based approaches.|$|E
25|$|Prior to analysis, {{flow cytometry}} data must {{typically}} undergo <b>pre-processing</b> to remove artifacts and poor quality data, {{and to be}} transformed onto an optimal scale for identifying cell populations of interest. Below are various steps in a typical flow cytometry preprocessing pipeline.|$|E
25|$|Blowfish is a fast block cipher, {{except when}} {{changing}} keys. Each new key requires <b>pre-processing</b> equivalent to encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, {{which is very}} slow compared to other block ciphers. This prevents its use in certain applications, but {{is not a problem}} in others.|$|E
25|$|If {{the learned}} {{patterns}} {{do not meet}} the desired standards, subsequently it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the <b>pre-processing</b> and data mining steps. If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards, then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Opera Mini {{was derived}} from the Opera web browser. Opera Mini {{requests}} web pages through Opera Software's compression proxy server. The compression server processes and compresses requested web pages before sending them to the mobile phone. The compression ratio is 90% and the transfer speed is increased by two to three times as a result. The <b>pre-processing</b> increases compatibility with web pages not designed for mobile phones. However, interactive sites which depend upon the device processing JavaScript do not work properly.|$|E
25|$|Before {{data mining}} {{algorithms}} can be used, a target data set must be assembled. As data mining can only uncover patterns actually {{present in the}} data, the target data set must {{be large enough to}} contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse. <b>Pre-processing</b> is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining. The target set is then cleaned. Data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data.|$|E
25|$|Non-uniform {{illumination}} correction is {{a technique}} that adjusts for non-uniform illumination in fundoscopic image. Non-uniform illumination can be a potential error in automated detection of diabetic retinopathy because of changes in statistical characteristics of image. These changes can affect latter processing such as feature extraction and are not observable by humans. Correction of non-uniform illumination (f') {{can be achieved by}} modifying the pixel intensity using known original pixel intensity (f), and average intensities of local (λ) and desired pixels (μ) (see formula below). Walter-Klein transformation is then applied to achieve the uniform illumination. This technique is the least used <b>pre-processing</b> method in the review from 2014.|$|E
25|$|Histogram {{equalization}} {{is useful}} in enhancing contrast within an image. This technique is used to increase local contrast. At {{the end of the}} processing, areas that were dark in the input image would be brightened, greatly enhancing the contrast among the features present in the area. On the other hand, brighter areas in the input image would remain bright or be reduced in brightness to equalize with the other areas in the image. Besides vessel segmentation, other features related to diabetic retinopathy can be further separated by using this <b>pre-processing</b> technique. Microaneurysm and hemorrhages are red lesions, whereas exudates are yellow spots. Increasing contrast between these two groups allow better visualization of lesions on images. With this technique, 2014 review found that 10 out of the 14 recently (since 2011) published primary research.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-processing</b> helped {{enhancing}} {{the quality of}} an image by filtering and removing unnecessary noises. The minutiae based algorithm only worked effectively in 8-bit gray scale fingerprint image. A reason was that an 8-bit gray fingerprint image was a fundamental base to convert the image to 1-bit image with value 0 for ridges and value 1 for furrows. As a result, the ridges were highlighted with black color while the furrows were highlighted with white color. This process partly removed some noises in an image and helped enhance the edge detection. Furthermore, there are two more steps to improve the best quality for the input image: minutiae extraction and false minutiae removal. The minutiae extraction {{was carried out by}} applying ridge thinning algorithm which was to remove redundant pixels of ridges. As a result, the thinned ridges of the fingerprint image are marked with a unique ID so that further operation can be conducted. After the minutiae extraction step, the false minutiae removal was also necessary. The lack of the amount of ink and the cross link among the ridges could cause false minutiae that led to inaccuracy in fingerprint recognition process.|$|E
500|$|The guts of {{most modern}} chelicerates are too narrow to take solid food. All {{scorpions}} {{and almost all}} spiders are predators that [...] "pre-process" [...] food in preoral cavities formed by the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps. However, one predominantly herbivore spider species is known, and many supplement their diets with nectar and pollen. Many of the Acari (ticks and mites) are blood-sucking parasites, {{but there are many}} predatory, herbivore and scavenger sub-groups. All the Acari have a retractable feeding assembly that consists of the chelicerae, pedipalps and parts of the exoskeleton, and which forms a preoral cavity for <b>pre-processing</b> food.|$|E

2500|$|ROLAP is {{generally}} more scalable. However, large volume <b>pre-processing</b> {{is difficult to}} implement efficiently so it is frequently skipped. [...] ROLAP query performance can therefore suffer tremendously.|$|E
2500|$|A related approach, {{known as}} AONT-RS, [...] applies an All-or-nothing {{transform}} {{to the data}} as a <b>pre-processing</b> step to an IDA. [...] The All-or-nothing transform guarantees that any number of shares less than the threshold is insufficient to decrypt the data.|$|E
2500|$|In practice, {{considerable}} <b>pre-processing</b> of {{the data}} is required—correction for random coincidences, estimation and subtraction of scattered photons, detector dead-time correction (after the detection of a photon, the detector must [...] "cool down" [...] again) and detector-sensitivity correction (for both inherent detector sensitivity and changes in sensitivity due to angle of incidence).|$|E
2500|$|... }} A page is compressed, then {{delivered}} to the phone in a markup language called Opera Binary Markup Language (OBML), which Opera Mini can interpret. According to Opera Software, the data compression makes transfer time about {{two to three times}} faster, and the <b>pre-processing</b> improves the display of web pages not designed for small screens. The turbo mode was added later and is similar to Mini mode but bypasses compression for interactive functionality, at the expense of less extreme data compression. The turbo and uncompressed modes use the [...] "WebView" [...] on Android and WebKit layout engine on iOS.|$|E
2500|$|In image processing, a Gaussian blur (also {{known as}} Gaussian smoothing) {{is the result}} of {{blurring}} an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect in graphics software, [...] typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the bokeh effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination. Gaussian smoothing is also used as a <b>pre-processing</b> stage in computer vision algorithms in order to enhance image structures at different scales—see scale space representation and scale space implementation.|$|E
2500|$|Data mining [...] is the {{computing}} {{process of}} discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods {{at the intersection}} of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. It is an essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns. It is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use. Aside from the raw analysis step, it involves database and data management aspects, data <b>pre-processing,</b> model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating. Data mining is the analysis step of the [...] "knowledge discovery in databases" [...] process, or KDD.|$|E
2500|$|Support vector {{machine is}} by far the most {{frequently}} used classifier in vessel segmentation, up to 90% of cases. SVM is a supervised learning model that belongs to the broader category of pattern recognition technique. The algorithm works by creating a largest gap between distinct samples in the data. The goal is to create the largest gap between these components that minimize the potential error in classification. In order to successfully segregate blood vessel information from the rest of the eye image, SVM algorithm creates support vectors that separate the blood vessel pixel from the rest of the image through a supervised environment. Detecting blood vessel from new images can be done through similar manner using support vectors. Combination with other <b>pre-processing</b> technique, such as green channel filtering, greatly improves the accuracy of detection of blood vessel abnormalities. Some beneficial properties of SVM include ...|$|E
2500|$|Using a {{different}} annealing technology based on {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR), a quantum Hopfield network was implemented in 2009 that mapped the input data and memorized data to Hamiltonians, allowing the use of adiabatic quantum computation. NMR technology also enables universal quantum computing, and it {{was used for the}} first experimental implementation of a quantum support vector machine to distinguish hand written number ‘6’ and ‘9’ on a liquid-state [...] quantum computer in 2015. The training data involved the <b>pre-processing</b> of the image which maps them to normalized 2-dimensional vectors to represent the images as the states of a qubit. The two entries of the vector are the vertical and horizontal ratio of the pixel intensity of the image. Once the vectors are defined on the feature space, the quantum support vector machine was implemented to classify the unknown input vector. The readout avoids costly quantum tomography by reading out the final state in terms of direction (up/down) of the NMR signal.|$|E
2500|$|... mRNA capping in eukaryotes {{have shown}} to exist {{and have been}} studied {{extensively}} regarding the 5’ 7-methylguanylate cap and its poly-A tail. It provides RNA stability, processing, localization and translational efficiency. Recently, researchers have proven a similar mechanism in RNA <b>pre-processing</b> in prokaryotes. In prokaryotic (E.coli) mRNA, the 5’ is capped with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ or NADH) or 3’-desphospho-coenzyme A (dpCoA). It was previously thought that the NAD+,NADH, dpCoA modification occurs after transcription analogously with the 7-methylguanylate cap; however, recently {{it has been shown}} that modifications are incorporated during transcription initiation by acting as a non-canonical initiating nucleotides (NCIN) for de novo transcription by cellular RNA polymerase. RppH and NudC pyrophosphohydrolases cleaves specific phosphate bonds to eliminate the cap modification. ATP was initially known to cap an RNA product in prokaryotes while NAD+, NADH and dpCoA was still being studied. RppH specifically cleaves 5’-triphosphate and 5’-diphosphate RNAs to 5’-monophosphate RNA products which only targets the ATP capped RNAs. On the other hand, NudC cleaves 5’-(NADH,NAD+,dpCoA) capped RNAs to 5’-monophosphate RNAs but does not cleave ATP capped RNAs. This discovery of two specific hydrolases that target specific products lead to the discovery of NCIN-mediated transcription.|$|E
