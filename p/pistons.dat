5000|$|An {{electropneumatic}} hammer {{is often}} called a [...] "rotary hammer," [...] because it has an electric motor, which rotates a crank. The hammer has two pistons—a drive <b>piston</b> and a free flight <b>piston.</b> The crank moves the drive <b>piston</b> {{back and forth in}} the same cylinder as the flight <b>piston.</b> The drive <b>piston</b> never touches the flight <b>piston.</b> Instead the drive <b>piston</b> compresses air in the cylinder, which then propels the flight <b>piston</b> against a striker, which contacts the drill bit.|$|R

40|$|Abstract>> As {{an initial}} step {{to develop a}} liquid {{hydrogen}} pump of <b>piston</b> type operated under cryogenic and high pressure, leakage and <b>piston</b> head shape for the <b>piston</b> pump were discussed with temperature and pressure. As the results, the leakage depended on correlation among density, viscosity, clearance area by the low temperature. In {{order to reduce the}} leakage, {{it was found that the}} air-tightness can be improved by minimizing contact surface between <b>piston</b> and cylinder, and also increasing pressure in-cylinder can reduce <b>piston</b> clearance. Among the proposed <b>piston</b> shapes, D type <b>piston</b> shape had the most air-tightness. D type <b>piston</b> had smaller contact surface than other <b>piston</b> shape and easier expansion of cup shape by pressure.

5|$|The game, {{like many}} {{previous}} meetings {{between the two}} teams, was dominated by defense. The Pacers {{got off to a}} quick start, opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before halftime. The <b>Pistons</b> managed to cut into the lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The <b>Pistons</b> opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a layup from Jamaal Tinsley heading into the fourth quarter. Richard Hamilton and Lindsey Hunter started the last quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the <b>Pistons</b> cut into the lead again. But Stephen Jackson's back-to-back field goals pushed the lead back to 93–79 with 3:52 remaining, essentially putting the <b>Pistons</b> away.

40|$|Automotive {{engine is}} one of the {{internal}} combustion engines in which combustion of mixture (air-fuel) burn internally. It contain different parts which are to relate together to have required engine efficiency. Among these parts is the <b>piston</b> which contains the <b>piston</b> ring that maintains a perfect seal between the cylinder wall and the <b>piston.</b> The dimensional relationship of the <b>piston</b> ring determines the degree by which their seats in the groove of the <b>piston</b> thereby determine the efficiency of the compression of the engine which affects the output of the engine. This paper examines the effect of <b>piston</b> ring radial thickness on the <b>piston</b> ring gap. Visual basic computer code was developed for computation of <b>piston</b> ring radial thickness corresponding to the <b>piston</b> ring gap. Aided by the developed software, the relationship between <b>piston</b> ring radial thickness and <b>piston</b> ring gap was investigated. Results obtained for case studies examined by varying the angular coordinate of the ring, showed that <b>piston</b> ring gap increases with <b>piston</b> ring radial thickness.

50|$|The flow of {{air through}} the venturi creates a reduced static {{pressure}} in the venturi. This pressure drop is communicated to the upper side of the <b>piston</b> via an air passage. The underside of the <b>piston</b> is open to atmospheric pressure. The difference in pressure {{between the two sides}} of the <b>piston</b> lifts the <b>piston.</b> Opposing this are the weight of the <b>piston</b> and the force of a spring that is compressed by the <b>piston</b> rising. Because the spring is operating over a very small part of its possible range of extension, its force is approximately constant. Under steady state conditions the upwards and downwards forces on the <b>piston</b> are equal and opposite, and the <b>piston</b> does not move.|$|R

5|$|In the {{following}} 1987–1988 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6points and 8.7rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The <b>Pistons</b> fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the <b>Pistons</b> were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the <b>Pistons</b> never recovered.

40|$|The gas force {{due to the}} {{combustion}} in the cylinder of an IC engine will cause the <b>piston</b> to move with primary motion and secondary motion. The primary motion of the <b>piston</b> from TDC to BDC is linear in nature. This motion is desired for translation of motion of engine components. Secondary motion {{is due to the}} transverse motion of the <b>piston</b> while <b>piston</b> moving from TDC to BDC and vice-versa. The secondary motion of the <b>piston</b> is considered as the main source for the <b>piston</b> slap, which in turn causes the impact on the cylinder walls resulting in engine vibration and noise. In the present study, an effort is made to understand the effect of the thermal load, generated by {{the combustion}} of fuel inside the cylinder, on the <b>piston</b> deformation and thermal stresses induced in <b>piston.</b> This deformation of the <b>piston</b> inside the cylinder causes the gap between the cylinder and <b>piston</b> to vary and also the <b>piston</b> to move transversely along with impact forces. The transverse motion of the <b>piston</b> in the cylinder is observed experimentally by measuring the gap between <b>piston</b> and cylinder at thrust side load condition. Finite element analysis (FEA) is considered {{as one of the best}} numerical tools to model and analyze the physical systems. FEA is carried out to find the <b>piston</b> deformation due to thermal load on the <b>piston</b> for the temperature data obtained from experiments. The three dimensional <b>piston</b> is modeled in CATIA V 5 R 19 and analyzed in ANSYS 12 solver.
