50|$|Century funds its {{loans to}} {{affordable}} housing developers {{from a combination}} of its own capital assets, lines of credit provided by commercial banks and charitable foundations, and participation in publicly sponsored loan funds, including the City of Los Angeles New Generation Fund, the Los Angeles County Housing Innovation Fund and the State of California Golden State Acquisition Fund. Century's financing of housing developments is typically early-stage, relatively high risk capital provided to borrowers to acquire property, perform necessary <b>predevelopment</b> <b>studies</b> and analyses, line up construction and permanent capital from public agencies and other private lenders, and acquire needed permits from public agencies. For some developers, Century also provides construction capital. The entitlement and financing process may require two or more years, and Century's loans are usually repaid from the construction or permanent financing the developer acquires from others.|$|E
40|$|Low impact {{development}} (LID) {{practices are}} gaining popularity {{as a way}} to manage stormwater close to the source. This reduces infrastructure requirements and helps to maintain hydrologic processes close to <b>predevelopment</b> conditions. <b>Studies</b> have shown LID practices to be effective in reducing runoff and improving water quality. However, little has been done to aid decision makers in selecting the most effective practices for their needs and budgets. ^ To this end, the L-THIA LID model has been applied. Using readily available data sources, multiple scenarios can quickly be examined, and then analyzed to determine the cost of implementation and the approximate period needed to see a return on the investment. This has been demonstrated by modeling four neighborhoods in greater Lafayette, Indiana using the L-THIA LID model to estimate the levels of runoff reduction that could be achieved through retrofitting LID practices. Based on LID practice cost of implementation, the payback period was determined for each practice. Depending on the LID practice and adoption level, 10 to 70 percent reductions in runoff volumes could be achieved. Cost per cubic meter of runoff reduction was highly variable depending on the LID practice and the land use it was applied to, ranging from around $ 3. 00 to almost $ 600. 00. In some cases the savings from reduced runoff volumes paid back the LID practice cost with interest in less than 3 years, while in other cases {{it was not possible to}} generate a payback. This information can help decision makers establish realistic goals and make informed decisions regarding LID practices before moving into detailed designs, thereby saving time and resource [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{model was}} developed to study the flow of groundwater in the sloping Ogallala Aquifer at a steady state during predevelopment condition. The sloping base was approximated using a stepping base model. GIS applications were applied during data collection and preparation, and later during interpretation of model results. Analytical and numerical methods were employed {{in the development of}} this model which was used to try to understand long-term water balance in the study region. The conservation of mass was achieved by balancing groundwater input, output, and storage; this led to understanding the interactions of groundwater and surface water in the <b>predevelopment</b> conditions. The <b>study</b> resulted in identification of where natural discharge from groundwater to surface water occurred, and the quantity of these flows was obtained. The Ogallala Aquifer is thick in the south western part of Kansas, this region had an average saturated thickness of 100 m during predevelopment conditions. The model found that groundwater flowed at a discharge per width of approximately 17 m 2 /d in this region. The aquifer thickness tends to gradually decrease from west to east and from south to north...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{successful}} {{new products}} in New Zealand Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is difficult due to several factors. These include greater expectations, new technology, reduced product lifecycles, high project failure rates, and the pressures from competition. This presents a significant challenge {{for a product}} development team as it leaves companies searching for opportunities to gain an advantage in the market place. The low level of research performed in relation to SMEs over the past number of years, especially {{in the field of}} New Product Development (NPD), has resulted in an increase in interest by practitioners and academics. This research was aimed at exploring the pre-development phase currently employed by SMEs within the New Zealand manufacturing industry. The purpose was to gauge the understanding and importance of this early stage in NPD amongst practitioners from these SMEs, as the literature highlighted this as an area of weakness requiring empirical research. Specifically, the objectives set for this research investigation were to survey manufacturing SMEs in New Zealand, compare the findings with past and current research on a national and international level, and make conclusions in relation to: • The nature and complexity of the pre-development activities performed by New Zealand manufacturing SMEs. • The difficulties and/or limitations New Zealand manufacturing SMEs encounter whilst implementing the pre-development activities. • The importance of and attitude towards the pre-development phase with regards to the overall NPD process and the company’s product development efforts. The study consisted of a questionnaire survey, run during June and July 2007 with twenty-two SMEs representing the light engineering/manufacturing, electronics, and food industry sectors. The questionnaire survey was followed up with one-on-one interviews with some of the participating companies allowing for both quantitative and qualitative data to be obtained. The research investigation found that the difficulties in carrying out the five <b>predevelopment</b> activities <b>studied</b> were common, compounded by the lack of skills inhouse to do so. Of the five pre-development activities studied, the preliminary technical analysis was found to be given the most attention by the companies with regard to overall project time, with lesser emphasis placed on the other four activities. Many of the companies developed ‘new to the world’ products or entered new markets with existing products where they primarily took part in the business-tobusiness market. Good relationships existed between the manufacturing SMEs and their suppliers, distributors and customers. Management were found to have a high level of involvement in product planning, as they tend to be involved in key decision making in NPD in SMEs. Many of the companies had difficulty when it came to identifying opportunities and customer needs, with the addition of numerous barriers limiting the implementation of NPD. The greatest difficulties arose during the practical implementation of tools and techniques due to several challenges, such as limited budgets, lack of time and resources as well as incompatibility within the existing company culture. Clearly, the pre-development phase is the basis {{for the remainder of the}} NPD process with essential development decisions being made here. This phase is therefore crucial in determining the likely outcome of NPD projects. The research findings suggested that greater consideration and effort should be placed on the pre-development phase, even more so with the cost increasing exponentially when mistakes are made later in development. The study highlighted the need to improve the tools and techniques available for use during the pre-development phase, as companies are aware of its importance but find it the most difficult to undertake. High new product failure rates; over-expenditure of project time; lack of awareness, commitment, and formality; and the high level of difficulty experienced by the New Zealand SMEs studied, suggests there is a need for the implementation of better tools and techniques during the predevelopment phase to aid successful NPD in New Zealand manufacturing SMEs...|$|R

StewardA {{one-dimensional}} {{model was}} developed to study the flow of groundwater in the sloping Ogallala Aquifer at a steady state during predevelopment condition. The sloping base was approximated using a stepping base model. GIS applications were applied during data collection and preparation, and later during interpretation of model results. Analytical and numerical methods were employed {{in the development of}} this model which was used to try to understand long-term water balance in the study region. The conservation of mass was achieved by balancing groundwater input, output, and storage; this led to understanding the interactions of groundwater and surface water in the <b>predevelopment</b> conditions. The <b>study</b> resulted in identification of where natural discharge from groundwater to surface water occurred, and the quantity of these flows was obtained. The Ogallala Aquifer is thick in the south western part of Kansas, this region had an average saturated thickness of 100 m during predevelopment conditions. The model found that groundwater flowed at a discharge per width of approximately 17 m[superscript] 2 /d in this region. The aquifer thickness tends to gradually decrease from west to east and from south to north. The northern part had an average saturated thickness of 40 m during predevelopment conditions; the model found that groundwater flowed at a discharge per width of approximately 3 m[superscript] 2 /d in this region. It was also found that groundwater leaves the Ogallala Aquifer on the eastern side with discharge per width between 0 - 3 m[superscript] 2 /d. The discharge from groundwater to surface water was summed over contributing areas to river basins. The discharge to streams necessary to satisfy long-term conservation of mass computed by the model showed that Cimarron River has total baseflow of about 5. 5 m[superscript] 3 /s; this was found to be almost 100 % of the total streamflow recorded during predevelopment conditions. The Arkansas River was found to have total baseflow of about 0. 97 m[superscript] 3 /s, which is approximately 14. 3 % of the total streamflow recorded during predevelopment conditions. The Smoky Hill River was found to have total baseflow of about 1. 7 m[superscript] 3 /s, which is approximately 73. 9 % of the total streamflow recorded during predevelopment conditions. The Solomon River was found to have total baseflow of about 0. 95 m[superscript] 3 /s, which is approximately 41. 1 % of the total streamflow recorded during predevelopment conditions. The Saline River was found to have total baseflow of about 0. 25 m[superscript] 3 /s, which is approximately 62. 5 % of the total streamflow recorded during predevelopment conditions. The Republican and Pawnee River was found to have total baseflow of about 0. 38 m[superscript] 3 /s and 0. 22 m[superscript] 3 /s, which is approximately 18. 5 % and 12. 6 % of the total streamflow in the predevelopment conditions respectively. The model was found to be always within - 16 to + 12 meters between observed values and the model results, with an average value of 0. 15 m and a root mean square error of 1. 98 m. Results from this study can be used to advance this study to the next level by making a transient model that {{could be used as a}} predictive tool for groundwater response to water use in the study region...|$|R
