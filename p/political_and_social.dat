5|$|Betances is {{considered}} a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism. His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the middle part of the 19th. century. These ideas, considered subversive in the severely restricted Puerto Rico of the era, had nevertheless a considerable impact in the island nation's <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> history.

For the first time, in both verbal and literary debate, Smuts began to grapple with the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> issues facing South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Polyethnicity {{refers to}} the {{proximity}} of people from different ethnic backgrounds within a country or other specific geographic region. It also relates to the ability and willingness of individuals to identify themselves with multiple ethnicities. It occurs when multiple ethnicities inhabit a given area, specifically through means of immigration, intermarriage, trade, conquest and post-war land-divisions. This has had many <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> implications on countries and regions.|$|E
5|$|Skelton {{was bitter}} about CBS's {{cancellation}} {{for many years}} afterwards. Believing the demographic and salary issues to be irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the anti-establishment, anti-war faction {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War, saying his conservative <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen, to appear on his program.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} greatly disturbed Russian and British {{influence in}} Central and South Asia, raising {{concerns about the}} security of their interests in the region.

5|$|The main {{duty of the}} Society was {{improving}} the city of Quito. Its 24 members came together weekly to discuss agricultural, educational, <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> problems and to promote the physical and natural sciences. The Society founded Quito's first newspaper, Primicias de la Cultura de Quito, published by Espejo starting on January 5, 1792. Through this newspaper liberal ideas, already somewhat known {{in other parts of}} Hispanic America, were spread among the people of Quito.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests, and <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> interests.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E

5|$|At forty, Chamberlain {{was expecting}} {{to remain a}} bachelor, but in 1910 {{he fell in love}} with Anne Cole, a distant {{relative}} by marriage, and married her the following year. She encouraged and supported his entry into local politics and was to be his constant companion, helper and trusted colleague, and to share in full his interests in housing and other <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> activities after his election as an MP. The two had a son and a daughter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the premiere, Italy had {{experienced}} <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
