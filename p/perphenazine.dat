25|$|The {{utility of}} broadly {{grouping}} the antipsychotics into first generation and atypical categories has been challenged. It {{has been argued}} that a more nuanced view, matching the properties of individual drugs to the needs of specific patients is preferable. While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and extrapyramidal symptoms in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring. In 2005 the US government body NIMH published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project). This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, <b>perphenazine,</b> among 1,493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only olanzapine outperformed <b>perphenazine</b> in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging 9.4lbs over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. No other atypical studied (risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) did better than the typical <b>perphenazine</b> on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic <b>perphenazine</b> (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Leucht et al. published in The Lancet), although more patients discontinued <b>perphenazine</b> owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002). A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings. Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types. Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{prescribing}} {{medication for}} these conditions which often resolve spontaneously, recommendations {{have pointed to}} improved skin hygiene, good hydration via fluids, good nutrition, and installation of padded bed rails with use of proper mattresses. [...] Pharmacological treatments include the typical neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol and <b>perphenazine</b> which block dopamine receptors; these are {{the first line of}} treatment for hemiballismus. [...] Quetiapine, sulpiride and olanzapine, the atypical neuroleptic agents, are less likely to yield drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. [...] Tetrabenazine works by depleting presynaptic dopamine and blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, while reserpine depletes the presynaptic catecholamine and serotonin stores; both of these drugs treat hemiballismus successfully but may cause depression, hypotension and parkinsonism. [...] Sodium valproate and clonazepam have been successful in a limited number of cases. Stereotactic ventral intermediate thalamotomy and use of a thalamic stimulator {{have been shown to be}} effective in treating these conditions.|$|E
50|$|In low doses {{it is used}} {{to treat}} {{agitated}} depression (together with an antidepressant). Fixed combinations of <b>perphenazine</b> and the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline in different proportions of weight exist (see Etrafon below). When treating depression, <b>perphenazine</b> is discontinued as fast as the clinical situation allows. <b>Perphenazine</b> has no intrinsic antidepressive activity. Several studies show that the use of <b>perphenazine</b> with fluoxetine (Prozac) in patients with psychotic depression is most promising, although fluoxetine interferes with the metabolism of <b>perphenazine,</b> causing higher plasma levels of <b>perphenazine</b> and a longer half-life. In this combination the strong antiemetic action of <b>perphenazine</b> attenuates fluoxetine-induced nausea and vomiting (emesis), as well as the initial agitation caused by fluoxetine. Both actions can be helpful for many patients.|$|E

50|$|<b>Perphenazine</b> {{is roughly}} {{five times as}} potent as chlorpromazine; thus <b>perphenazine</b> is {{considered}} a medium-potency antipsychotic.|$|E
50|$|Fluoxetine causes higher plasma-levels and {{a longer}} {{half-life}} of <b>perphenazine,</b> therefore a dose reduction of <b>perphenazine</b> might be necessary.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Perphenazine</b> is used {{to treat}} {{psychosis}} (e.g. in people with schizophrenia and the manic phases of bipolar disorder). <b>Perphenazine</b> effectively treats the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions, but its effectiveness in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as flattened affect and poverty of speech, is unclear. Earlier studies found the typical antipsychotics to be ineffective or poorly effective {{in the treatment of}} negative symptoms, but two recent, large-scale studies found no difference between <b>perphenazine</b> and the atypical antipsychotics.A 2015 systematic review compared <b>Perphenazine</b> with other antipsychotic drugs: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Perphenazine</b> intensifies {{the central}} {{depressive}} action of drugs with such activity (tranquilizers, hypnotics, narcotics, antihistaminics, OTC-antiemetics etc.). A dose reduction of <b>perphenazine</b> {{or the other}} drug may be necessary.|$|E
50|$|Prednazate, a {{combination}} of prednisolone hemisuccinate with <b>perphenazine,</b> is a synthetic glucocorticoid corticosteroid as well as typical antipsychotic and sedative/tranquilizer.

5000|$|As {{a member}} of the {{phenothiazine}} type of antipsychotics, <b>perphenazine</b> shares in general all allergic and toxic side-effects of chlorpromazine. A 2015 systematic review of the data on <b>perphenazine</b> conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that [...] "there were no convincing differences between <b>perphenazine</b> and other antipsychotics" [...] in the incidence of adverse effects.Perphenazine causes early and late extrapyramidal side effects more often than placebo, and at a similar rate to other medium-potency antipsychotics and the atypical antipsychotic risperidone.|$|E

50|$|In many countries, depot {{forms of}} <b>perphenazine</b> exist (as <b>perphenazine</b> enanthate). One {{injection}} works for 1 to 4 weeks {{depending on the}} dose of the depot-injection. Depot-forms of <b>perphenazine</b> {{should not be used}} during the initial phase of treatment as the rare neuroleptic malignant syndrome may become more severe and uncontrollable with this form. Extrapyramidal side-effects may be somewhat reduced due to constant plasma-levels during depot-therapy. Also, patient compliance is sure, as many patients do not take their oral medication, particularly if feeling better once improvement in psychosis is achieved.|$|E

50|$|When {{used for}} its strong {{antiemetic}} or antivertignosic effects in cases with associated brain injuries, it may obscure the clinical course and {{interferes with the}} diagnosis.
