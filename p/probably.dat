5|$|Although Pluto is {{currently}} the largest known KBO, {{there is at least}} one known larger object currently outside the Kuiper belt that <b>probably</b> originated in it: Neptune's moon Triton (which, as explained above, is <b>probably</b> a captured KBO).|$|E
5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, it is likely that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus <b>probably</b> possessed a squared snout. This means that it was <b>probably</b> a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} performance, <b>probably</b> on 9 February 1727.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Cawkwell and Sealey {{suggest the}} Maroneia {{campaign}} was in 353 BC (though without explicit justification). The Maroneia campaign might therefore {{have been part}} of the campaign that Philip fought against Cetriporis (<b>probably</b> 355 BC), or a camapaign against Amadokos (<b>probably</b> 353 BC).|$|E

5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus <b>probably</b> did not frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they <b>probably</b> used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|John {{also had}} illegitimate {{children}} {{with a number of}} mistresses, including nine sons—Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and (<b>probably)</b> Philip—and three daughters—Joan, Maud and (<b>probably)</b> Isabel. Of these Joan was the best known, since she married Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon <b>probably</b> had a {{profound}} impact on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It <b>probably</b> targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon <b>probably</b> used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|On the Roman side, Ammianus attests one vexillatio of equites sagittarii (mounted archers) at Strasbourg. It is {{also likely}} {{that at least one}} {{regiment}} of foot archers took part, <b>probably</b> an auxilium of sagittarii (archers). There were thus <b>probably</b> about 1,000 archers in dedicated units on the Roman side. In addition, a number of ordinary infantry units <b>probably</b> included archers.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Mongol forces most <b>probably</b> never reached Pagan. They were held at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya, Yazathingyan and Thihathu, and <b>probably</b> never got closer than 160km north of Pagan. (An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army.) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was <b>probably</b> minimal. At any rate, the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to Tagaung. They remained there as the treaty was now void.|$|E
5|$|Robert was <b>probably</b> one of {{the sons}} of Gilbert de Gant, who is {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book. Gilbert was from Flanders and came to England during 1069. Gilbert, who died around 1095, was married to Alice, daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert's conjectured siblings were Emma– wife of Alan de Percy, Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, Gilbert de Gant– who died before his father, and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of Gilbert, he was a younger son, <b>probably</b> {{the youngest of the}} four brothers, and <b>probably</b> was born sometime around 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there were older siblings. Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter. Robert was <b>probably</b> also the uncle of Gilbert de Gant, later Earl of Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|The Kena is {{the oldest}} of the verse Upanisads {{followed}} by <b>probably</b> the Katha, Isa, Svetasvatara, and Mundaka. All these Upanisads were composed <b>probably</b> in the last few centuries BCE.|$|E
5|$|The Siberian Notebook (Сибирская тетрадь) (<b>probably</b> 1852–3): an undated {{manuscript}} comprising 486 numbered notes written during Dostoyevsky's imprisonment in Omsk. <b>Probably</b> {{preserved by}} a feldsher.|$|E
5|$|The {{impacting}} object <b>probably</b> had a mass {{comparable to}} that of Mars, and the impact <b>probably</b> occurred {{near the end of the}} period of giant impacts. The collision kicked into orbit some of the impactor's mantle, which then coalesced into the Moon. The impact was <b>probably</b> the last in the series of mergers that formed the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{complement of}} a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines. In the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines, {{and this was}} <b>probably</b> also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes. Furthermore, the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could <b>probably</b> carry a maximum of 4045 soldierstriremes {{seem to have been}} easily destabilised by extra weight. There were therefore <b>probably</b> around 5,000 hoplite marines with the League fleet.|$|E
5|$|The third Persian army, {{under the}} command of Otanes and Artaphernes, {{attacked}} Ionia and Aeolia. They re-took Clazomenae and Cyme, <b>probably</b> in 497 BC, but then seem to have been less active in 496 BC and 495 BC, <b>probably</b> {{as a result of the}} calamity in Caria.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Æthelwold's {{immediate}} family. Æthelred was born in about 848 and died in 871, so his sons must have been young children when he died. Æthelred's wife was <b>probably</b> the Wulfthryth who witnessed a charter in 868. Æthelwold {{and his older brother}} Æthelhelm are first recorded in King Alfred's will in the 880s. Æthelhelm is not heard of again, and he <b>probably</b> died soon afterwards. The only other record of Æthelwold before Alfred's death is as a witness to a charter that <b>probably</b> dates to the 890s.|$|E
5|$|We wrote 'Mama' when I {{was going}} through a bad phase with my mum. The sentiments are really that your mum's <b>probably</b> the best friend that you've got. Whether she's an over-protective mother or a bit of a landmine, she <b>probably</b> knows you better than {{yourself}} in some ways.|$|E
5|$|Adeliza (or Adelida, Adelaide) {{died before}} 1113, {{reportedly}} betrothed to Harold II of England, <b>probably</b> a nun of Saint Léger at Préaux.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal <b>probably</b> allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were <b>probably</b> for display.|$|E
5|$|Agathaeromys is an extinct genus of oryzomyine rodents {{from the}} Pleistocene of Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. Two species are known, which differ {{in size and}} some details of tooth morphology. The larger A.donovani, the type species, is known from {{hundreds}} of teeth, found in four localities that are <b>probably</b> 900,000 to 540,000 years old. A.praeuniversitatis, the smaller species, is known from 35teeth found in a single fossil site, which is <b>probably</b> 540,000 to 230,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Al-Tabari's account {{does not}} mention the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; {{focusing}} on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account is certainly based {{on the story of}} Zenobia, it is <b>probably</b> conflated with the story of a semi-legendary nomadic Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba' fortress was <b>probably</b> Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|Alan Durward is {{recorded}} making provision for an existing Hospital, <b>probably</b> founded {{by his father}} Thomas de Lundin or Thomas Durward.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers did not observe {{large amounts}} of water {{following}} the collisions, and later impact studies found that fragmentation and destruction of the cometary fragments in an 'airburst' <b>probably</b> occurred at much higher altitudes than previously expected, with even the largest fragments being destroyed when the pressure reached , well above the expected depth of the water layer. The smaller fragments were <b>probably</b> destroyed before they even reached the cloud layer.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were now}} {{led by a}} praefectus (prefect), who could be either a native nobleman, who would <b>probably</b> be granted Roman {{citizenship}} for the purpose (e.g. the famous German war leader Arminius gained Roman citizenship <b>probably</b> by serving as an auxiliary prefect before turning against Rome); or a Roman, either of knightly rank, or a senior centurion.|$|E
5|$|Bach based {{parts of}} the music on a homage cantata of the same name, , which he had {{composed}} for the birthday of a Leipzig University teacher and first performed in spring 1725. The text was <b>probably</b> written by Picander, who modified it to a congratulatory cantata for Countess Charlotte Friederike Wilhelmine of Anhalt-Köthen, , first performed on 30 November 1726. Another version was a congratulatory cantata for {{a member of the}} Rivinius family from Leipzig, , <b>probably</b> in 1735.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 8 September 1726, and <b>probably</b> played the organ part himself.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata {{at least three}} times, first on 8 October 1724, a second time <b>probably</b> on 24 October 1734 when the sopranino {{was replaced by a}} violino piccolo, and a third time <b>probably</b> on 1 October 1740. The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff suggested performances in 1744/47, Klaus Hofmann in 1747, when the corno part was given to a trombone.|$|E
5|$|Buena Vista {{features}} an early architectural style that {{differs from that}} at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and <b>probably</b> without superstructures. They {{were built in the}} Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena Vista and Motul <b>probably</b> results from differing epochs of construction.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage was <b>probably</b> domesticated {{later in}} history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops {{developed}} from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were <b>probably</b> the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe that}} the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (<b>probably</b> for feeding behavior), and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and <b>probably</b> shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were <b>probably</b> used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{body was}} embalmed at Berkeley Castle, {{where it was}} viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester. It was then taken to Gloucester Abbey on 21 October, and on 20 December Edward was buried by the high altar, the funeral having <b>probably</b> been delayed to allow Edward III to attend in person. Gloucester was <b>probably</b> chosen because other abbeys had refused or been {{forbidden}} to take the King's body, {{and because it was}} close to Berkeley. The funeral was a grand affair and cost £351 in total, complete with gilt lions, standards painted with gold leaf and oak barriers to manage the anticipated crowds. Edward III's government <b>probably</b> hoped to put a veneer of normality over the recent political events, increasing the legitimacy of the young King's own reign.|$|E
5|$|European music between 800 and 1100 {{became more}} sophisticated, more {{frequently}} requiring instruments capable of polyphony. The 9th-century Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that, in the Byzantine Empire, typical instruments included the urghun (organ), shilyani (<b>probably</b> {{a type of}} harp or lyre), salandj (<b>probably</b> a bagpipe) and the lyra. The Byzantine lyra, a bowed string instrument, is an ancestor of most European bowed instruments, including the violin.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus nesiotes, {{described}} by Mayr in 1941, {{is found in}} Fiji and <b>probably</b> also Vanuatu and New Caledonia. It is non-migratory.|$|E
