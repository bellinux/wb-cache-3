40|$|Abstract—Nitric oxide (NO) {{synthesis}} in {{vascular endothelium}} {{of patients with}} hypertension is altered. Calcium antagonists {{have been shown to}} improve endothelial function in hypertensive patients. Here we report that <b>pranidipine,</b> one of the latest long-acting calcium antagonists in the dihydropyridine group, enhances the actions of NO released from endothelial cells (ECs). <b>Pranidipine</b> significantly enhanced cGMP accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells cocultured with ECs, whereas amlodipine and nifedipine had no significant effects. In addition, <b>pranidipine</b> also suppressed basal and thrombin-stimulated endothelin- 1 production from ECs. <b>Pranidipine</b> also enhanced cGMP accumulation in rat aortic segments with endothelium but not in endothelium-denuded vessels. In contrast, <b>pranidipine</b> had no effect in the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of NO synthesis. <b>Pranidipine</b> did not affect the basal expression of endothelial NO synthase in ECs. However, <b>pranidipine</b> upregulated the activity of superoxide dismutase in ECs. These findings suggest that <b>pranidipine</b> enhances NO action through inhibition of superoxide-induced NO decomposition in the vessel wall. Thus, <b>pranidipine</b> may be useful in the treatment of impaired endothelial function in patients with hypertension. (Hypertension. 2000; 35 : 82 - 85.)

40|$|Role {{of protein}} kinase C in {{angiotensin}} II-induced constriction of renal microvesselsBackgroundAlthough angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts its action through multiple vasomotor mechanisms, {{the contribution of}} phosphoinositol hydrolysis products to Ang II-induced renal vasoconstriction remains undetermined. MethodsThe role of protein kinase C (PKC) in Ang II-induced afferent (AFF) and efferent (EFF) arteriolar constriction was examined using the isolated perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney. ResultsAng II (0. 3 nmol/L) -induced EFF constriction was refractory to inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels by <b>pranidipine</b> (1 μmol/L, 19 ± 2 % reversal) but was completely reversed by a PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine (1 μmol/L, 96 ± 2 % reversal). Furthermore, direct PKC activation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 1 μmol/L) caused prominent EFF constriction, and this constriction was inhibited by manganese and free calcium medium. In contrast, Ang II-induced AFF constriction was completely abolished by <b>pranidipine</b> (98 ± 4 % reversal) and was partially inhibited by chelerythrine (55 ± 3 % reversal). Although PMA elicited marked AFF constriction, this constriction was insensitive to the calcium antagonist, but was totally inhibited by manganese or free calcium medium. ConclusionsPKC plays an obligatory role in Ang II-induced EFF constriction that requires extracellular calcium entry through nonselective cation channels. In contrast, in concert with our recent findings demonstrating a complete dilation by thapsigargin, Ang II-induced AFF constriction is mainly mediated by inositol trisphosphate (IP 3) and voltage-dependent calcium channel pathways, but could not {{be attributed to the}} PKC-activated calcium entry pathway (for example, nonselective cation channels). Rather, Ang II-stimulated PKC may cross-talk to the IP 3 /voltage-dependent calcium channel pathway and could modulate the vasoconstrictor mechanism of the AFF. Thus, the role of PKC during Ang II stimulation differs in AFF and EFF, which may constitute segmental heterogeneity in the renal microvasculature...|$|E
