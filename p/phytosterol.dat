25|$|Plants make {{cholesterol}} in {{very small}} amounts. Plants manufacture phytosterols (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which {{can compete with}} cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the <b>phytosterol</b> molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ~200–300mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700mg/day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Phytosterols</b> are {{bioactive}} compounds {{found in}} foods of plant origin, {{which can be}} divided into plant sterols and plant stanols. Clinical studies consistently indicate that the intake of <b>phytosterols</b> (2 g/day) is associated with a significant reduction (8 - 10 %) in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol). Thus, several guidelines recommend the intake of 2 g/day of plant sterols and/or stanols in order to reduce LDL-cholesterol levels. As the typical western diet contains only about 300 mg/day of <b>phytosterols,</b> foods enriched with <b>phytosterols</b> are usually used to achieve the recommended intake. Although <b>phytosterols</b> decrease LDL-cholesterol levels, {{there is no evidence that}} they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases; on the contrary, some studies suggest an increased risk of atherosclerosis with increasing serum levels of <b>phytosterols.</b> This review aims to address the evidence available in the literature on the relationship between <b>phytosterols</b> and risk of cardiovascular disease...|$|R

40|$|Objective: <b>Phytosterols</b> {{have been}} used alone, or {{combined}} with lipid-altering drugs, to reduce cholesterol levels and the burden of cardiovascular disease. Considerable variation {{in the composition of}} <b>phytosterols</b> exists and its consumption, in a regular diet, by the Brazilian population is still unknown. Thus, the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the <b>phytosterols</b> content of the most consumed plant foods and to estimate the <b>phytosterols</b> intake by this population. Methods: Intake of plant foods of a representative population of the city of São Paulo (n = 1609), randomly selected on the basis of the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics census data (2010), was obtained by a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Foods were chosen on the basis of the Consume Expenditure Survey (2002 - 2003) and from answers to the FFQ. <b>Phytosterols</b> composition of most consumed greens, legumes, cereals, and seeds, fruits, and vegetable oils was determined by gas chromatography (flame ionization detection). Daily <b>phytosterols</b> intake was estimated in terms of mg per 100 g (mg/ 100 g(- 1)) of edible portion. Underreporters and overreporters were excluded. Results: Mean (SE) daily <b>phytosterols</b> intake in the diet of the study population was 100. 6 (1. 2) mg, with beta-sitosterol as the largest sterol component (65. 4 %), followed by campesterol (23. 2 %), and stigmasterol (10 %). No significant changes in daily <b>phytosterols</b> intake were observed after exclusion of underreporters and overreporters. Considerable variation was observed in <b>phytosterols</b> content among the most consumed plant foods. Conclusions: Analysis of <b>phytosterols</b> composition in most consumed plant foods has shown that <b>phytosterols</b> content varied among food groups. Dietary intake of <b>phytosterols</b> in a large population of the city of São Paulo is in the same range of some countries. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Steroids {{are found}} in plants, animals and fungi. All steroids are made in cells either from the sterols {{lanosterol}} (animals and fungi) or from cycloartenol (plants). Both lanosterol and cycloartenol are derived from the cyclization of the triterpene squalene. Triterpenes are terpenes consisting of six isoprene units and have the molecular formula C 3017148 (e. g carotenoids). The steroids derived from animal are the cholesterol while the steroids derived from plant is the <b>phytosterols.</b> There are more than 100 types of <b>phytosterols</b> {{have been reported in}} plant species, but the more abundant are sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol. The importance of <b>phytosterols</b> is their contribution towards lowering body cholesterol. Cholesterol is transported in blood in the form of lipoprotein which includes the high density (HDL) and low density (LDL) lipoproteins where LDL is the bad cholesterol. Too much LDL cholesterol in the blood can cause cholesterol to build up in the artery walls, leading to the narrowing of the arteries, Atherosclerosis. Thus dietary cholesterol intake is reduced in patients with such disease. Another way to reduce blood cholesterol is to consume <b>phytosterols</b> which compete with cholesterol absorption. The objective of this project is to find the new sources of <b>phytosterols</b> from plant found in Malaysia. The plant use in this project is Petai (Panda speciosa). Petai is an edible legume, the seeds of which are already consumed in Malaysia as a minor vegetable.

25|$|From a dietary perspective, plant cells do not {{manufacture}} cholesterol, {{and it is}} {{not found}} in plant foods. Some plant foods, such as avocado, flax seeds and peanuts, contain <b>phytosterols,</b> which compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines, reducing the absorption of both dietary and bile cholesterol. However, a typical diet contributes on the order of 0.2 grams of <b>phytosterols,</b> which is not enough to {{have a significant impact on}} blocking cholesterol absorption. <b>Phytosterols</b> intake can be supplemented through the use of phytosterol-containing functional foods or dietary supplements that are recognized as having potential to reduce levels of LDL-cholesterol. Some supplemental guidelines have recommended doses of <b>phytosterols</b> in the 1.6–3.0grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA).

As summarized by Devaraj and Jialal [31] evidence for this has been observed in hypercholesterolemic, diabetic, and healthy volunteers. The mechanism proposed by which <b>phytosterols</b> accomplish this is by lowering cholesterol absorption due to the structural similarities these compounds share with cholesterol [27, 29]. Apart from lowering cardiovascular risk factors associated with diabetes, <b>phytosterols</b> (â-sitosterol in particular) {{have been shown to}} positively affect diabetes by directly lowering fasting blood glucose levels by cortisol inhibition [30]. Additionally, <b>phytosterols</b> have been shown to reduce biomarkers for oxidative stress and inflammation [31], as well as to reduce cancer development by enabling antitumor responses by increasing immune recognition of cancer, influencing hormonal-dependent growth of endocrine tumors, and altering sterol biosynthesis due to the structural similarities of the <b>phytosterols</b> with these compounds and their substrates [32]. <b>Phytosterols</b> have also been shown to directly inhibit tumor growth by slowing cell cycle progression, by induction of apoptosis, and by the inhibition of tumor metastasis [32].|$|R

To this end, we quantified the major fatty acids (laurate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, oleate, linoleate) and <b>phytosterols</b> (campesterol, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol) in 20 commercially available saw palmetto supplements using GC-FID and GC-MS, respectively.

The results showed that there was no difference between Octa- 6 and Ricewax treatments in any of the lipid parameters measured, and both had similar levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (T-C), and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) as the control. Octa- 6 but not Ricewax increased (P= 0. 03) non-HDL-C as compared with the control. <b>Phytosterols</b> reduced T-C (P< 0. 0003) and HDL-C (P< 0. 004) without a significant effect on TG and non-HDL-C as compared to the control. Ricewax plus <b>phytosterols</b> had effects similar to those with <b>phytosterols</b> alone. Free cholesterol synthetic rates were not different among the treatments.
