5|$|Systemin and AtPEP1 {{are found}} in the cell cytosol. The <b>precursor</b> to tomato systemin is {{transcribed}} as a 200 amino acid polypeptide. It does not contain a putative signal sequence suggesting that it is synthesised on free ribosomes in the cytosol. The <b>precursor</b> to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a signal sequence. In tomato, mRNA encoding the <b>precursor</b> for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the phloem in vascular bundles of mid veins. The <b>precursor</b> accumulates exclusively in the phloem parenchyma cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. The <b>precursor</b> to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursors}} for systemin and AtPEP1 are both processed to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the <b>precursor.</b> It {{has been speculated}} that ProAtPEP1 is processed by CONSTITUTIVE DISEASE RESISTANCE 1, an apoplastic aspartic protease. The precursors to HypSys are processed into more than one active peptide. In tobacco, it is processed into two peptides, in petunia into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the <b>precursor</b> to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest <b>precursor</b> described. The production of multiple signalling peptides from one <b>precursor</b> is a common feature found in animals.|$|E

30|$|The {{contents}} of various lignin <b>precursors,</b> monolignols, p-hydroxycinnamaldehydes, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid peaked in August in S. tootsik (Figs.  5, 6, 7). This {{may be a}} consequence of a delay in the consumption of lignin <b>precursors</b> and the pool of intermediate compounds; indeed, the rate of lignification decreased during August (Fig.  2 b). Accumulation of lignin <b>precursors</b> and declining lignification in August may result from diminished transport activity if the <b>precursors</b> are localized in the cytosol, or decreased polymerization activity if the <b>precursors</b> {{are present in the}} cell wall. The rate-limiting step for the cessation of lignification in bamboo may not be the biosynthesis of lignin <b>precursors,</b> but rather their transport or polymerization. Further research is needed to elucidate how lignin <b>precursors</b> are transported to the cell wall, and how lignification is controlled during culm development.|$|R
40|$|Humic acid (HA) was {{extracted}} {{and separated}} into different molecular weight (MW) fractions, then coagulated by aluminum chloride and polyaluminum chloride (PACI). The removal of disinfection byproduct (DBP) <b>precursors</b> and the aluminum speciation {{variation of the}} coagulants were investigated in detail. In particular, the role of aluminum speciation in the removal of DBP <b>precursors</b> was discussed. During the coagulation process, AlCl(3) hydrolyzed into dominating in situ Al(13) species at pH 5. 5. The in situ Al(13) species exhibited better removal ability for haloacetic acid (HAA) <b>precursors</b> than PACI. At pH 7. 5, in situ hydrolyzed Al(13) species of AlCl(3) decomposed into dimeric Al species. In this case, preformed Al(13) of PACI had a high removal ability of HAA <b>precursors.</b> Specially,the greatest reduction of HAA <b>precursors</b> with a low MW (30 kDa) fractions was through adsorption at pH 7. 5. Different from HAA <b>precursors,</b> the in situ Al(13) species {{did not have a}} high removal ability of trihalomethane (THM) <b>precursors.</b> Therefore, PACI exhibited a better removal ability of THM <b>precursors</b> than AlCl(3) at different pH values.

5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The <b>precursor</b> for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the <b>precursor</b> for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The <b>precursor</b> to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the <b>precursor</b> producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E

In jeb mutants, visceral mesoderm <b>precursors</b> form, but they fail to migrate or differentiate normally; no visceral muscles develop. Jeb protein is produced in somatic muscle <b>precursors</b> and taken up by visceral muscle <b>precursors.</b> jeb reveals a signaling process in which somatic muscle <b>precursors</b> support the proper migration and differentiation of visceral muscle cells.

40|$|Transparent-exopolymer-particles (TEP) {{have been}} {{recently}} {{identified as a}} significant contributor to surface biofouling, such as on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. TEP research has mainly focused on algal TEP/TEP <b>precursors</b> while limited investigations have been conducted on those released by bacteria. In this study, TEP/TEP <b>precursors</b> derived from both algae and bacteria were isolated and then characterized to investigate their similarities and/or differences using various advanced analytical techniques, thus providing {{a better understanding of}} their potential effect on biofouling. Bacterial TEP/TEP <b>precursors</b> were isolated from two species of marine bacteria (Pseudidiomarina homiensis and Pseudoalteromonas atlantica) while algal TEP/TEP <b>precursors</b> were isolated from two marine algae species (Alexandrium tamarense and Chaetoceros affinis). Results indicated that both isolated bacterial and algal TEP/TEP <b>precursors</b> were associated with protein-like materials, and most TEP <b>precursors</b> were high-molecular-weight biopolymers. Furthermore all investigated algal and bacterial TEP/TEP <b>precursors</b> showed a lectin-like property, which can enable them to act as a chemical conditioning layer and to agglutinate bacteria. This property may enhance surface biofouling. However, both proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and the nitrogen/carbon (N/C) ratios suggested that the algal TEP/TEP <b>precursors</b> contained much less protein content than the bacterial TEP/TEP <b>precursors.</b> This difference may influence their initial deposition and further development of surface biofouling...|$|R
