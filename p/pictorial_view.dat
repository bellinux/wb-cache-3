40|$|A major {{drawback}} of directional {{and horizontal}} well drilling is the numerous complex computations {{required to be}} done while planning a well. These computations are very stressful and time consuming especially when done manually. One of the objectives {{of this study was}} to develop a user friendly Excel Spreadsheet program that would make the computations of these well trajectory parameters easier, faster and accurate. An Excel Spreadsheet program was developed employing the Minimum Curvature method (and for other five methods) for wellpath design and planning. This would help increase the usage of these trajectory methods especially the Minimum Curvature method. The program is able to provide <b>pictorial</b> <b>views</b> both in the vertical and horizontal plane of the trajectory of the drilling bit’s position in the wellbore. This w ould therefore help to minimize risk and uncertainty surrounding hitting predetermined target.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{explored}} how participant socioeconomic position (SEP) and gender {{is related to}} perceptions of the pathways connecting neighborhood influences and mental well-being. This research used the concept mapping method, an intensive structured conceptualization process that produces <b>pictorial</b> <b>views</b> of how concepts are connected and interrelated. Thirty-six low and non-low SEP {{men and women from}} Toronto, Canada participated in the concept mapping sessions. One hundred and twenty unique neighborhood characteristics were felt to be related to mental well-being and those items were grouped into six distinct clusters. Notable differences in cluster importance by participant SEP status were found. While no overall differences were observed for males verses females, further stratification by both participant SEP and gender suggested that gendered perceptions are not uniform. Participant-created diagrams illustrated how the cluster domains are related {{to each other and to}} good mental well-being. These findings are important for uncovering the mechanisms by which neighborhoods differentially affect the mental health of residents from different SEPs and genders.

40|$|Abstract––Minimization {{of errors}} and {{maximization}} of efficiency {{is the most}} important parameters in the competeting world. Sheet metal forming is a widely used and costly manufacturing process, in industrial applications. This work is done to study the finite element (elastic-plastic) analysis of sheet metal forming process using the finite element software. Ansys simulation is carried out to gain accurate and critical understanding of sheet forming process. Simulation of elastic-plastic behavior of mild steel sheet is carried out with non-linear condition to investigate sheet metal forming process to compare experimentally available data. In the present work contact elements are generated between sheet metal and the dies for forming process. Displacement convergence is considered in the problem to get correct shape. All the results are represented with suitable graphical and <b>pictorial</b> <b>views.</b> The analysis is based on nonlinear properties with bi-linearity in the problem. Initial problem is carried out to compare experimentally available punch load with analysis value to analyse the use of finite element techniques in manufacturing industry. Total of 116 steps are considered for proper convergence of the problem. The critical stresses of radial, hoop and vonmises stresses are represented for the problem along with contact pressure distribution. Keywords– – Sheet metal forming. Deep drawing. Ansys simulation.

40|$|This {{invention}} {{yields the}} most accurate and clinically useful predictor of myocardial viability - with no ionizing radiation or radioactive agents. The system is a software add-on to MRI systems that gives clear and clinically significant evaluations of left ventricle (LV) function. MPS uses p-vector finite element analysis to evaluate over 15, 000 discrete points in the left ventricle in three axes; it compares {{the variance in the}} movement against a “normal” database to display variations from a standard deviation from normal. It compares the function of each of the points in the LV against a normal database. The resulting images are unique in that LV function is quickly and clearly displayed. These pictures are, for clinicians and surgeons, clinically superior to existing imaging modalities. They are easily understood by the layperson. Further, where existing tests (PET, Thallium SPECT, CT) are expensive, invasive and add radiation, MPS is inexpensive and non-invasive with no radiation. MPS is more accurate in regional, transmural viability determination. It quantitates what other modalities describe qualitatively. Potential Areas of Applications: 	 * Agnostic to all existing MR machines * Gives crystal clear and easily understood <b>pictorial</b> <b>views</b> of LV function * Very inexpensive * Added on to an already scheduled MR scan * Displaces more expensive and less useful tests * Strong IP position - US and foreign applications * Three month adaptation time to commercial MR systems Inventor(s) : 	Michael Pasque, M.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate students' perceptions of function as they interacted with the different dynamic representations of function made available through computer environments. Microworlds were designed comprising sequences of activities around the software, Function Probe, and two adaptations of DynaGraph, DG Parallel (with parallel axes) and DG Cartesian (using Cartesian axes). A series of case studies of four pairs of students was undertaken in Brazil in order to trace the evolution in students' perceptions of a selection of function properties; namely turning point, variation, range, symmetry and periodicity. This diversity of properties was chosen to examine different ways students analyse functions: pointwise, variational, global and pictorial. Starting with an examination of the curriculum followed by the case study students as a means to describe the origins of their perceptions, a longitudinal investigation was undertaken in order to identify the main features of each of the microworlds that appeared to contribute to students' progress. The students' perceptions were analysed by drawing attention to their origins, their usefulness and their potential limitations (from a mathematical point of view). A methodology for this longitudinal study was devised which incorporated visual presentations to capture the main characteristics of students' perceptions. The results showed that DG Parallel, a 'new' representation, prompted the development of perceptions free of previous limitations and sufficiently robust to allow revision. However, properties previously perceived pictorially were rarely identified in DG Parallel. Together with DG Cartesian, interactions with this microworld provoked the students to develop a variational view of some of the function properties. In addition, DG Cartesian served as a two-way bridge between variational and <b>pictorial</b> <b>views.</b> By way of contrast, using the tools in FP to transform graphs seemed not to shape perceptions, but to assist in the exploration of the function properties...|$|R
