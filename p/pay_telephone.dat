500|$|Historian David Carter {{presents}} information {{indicating that}} the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those {{who worked in the}} Financial District. They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay Wall Street customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's <b>pay</b> <b>telephone.</b> The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered, ...|$|E
500|$|Simone {{was known}} for her temper and {{frequent}} outbursts. In 1985, she fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealing royalties. Simone said she [...] "tried to kill him" [...] but [...] "missed". In 1995, she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with an air gun after the boy's laughter disturbed her concentration. According to a biographer, Simone took medication for a condition from the mid-1960s on. All this was only known to {{a small group of}} intimates, and kept out of public view for many years, until the biography Break Down and Let It All Out written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan revealed this in 2004, after her death. [...] Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone's, related in her own autobiography, Society's Child: My Autobiography, two instances to illustrate Simone's volatility: one incident in which she forced a shoe store cashier, at gunpoint, to take back a pair of sandals she'd already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a royalty payment from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian's songs, and then ripped a <b>pay</b> <b>telephone</b> out of its wall when she was refused.|$|E

50|$|Starting in the 1970s <b>pay</b> <b>telephones</b> {{were less}} and less {{commonly}} placed in booths in the United States. In many cities where they were once common, telephone booths have now been almost completely replaced by non-enclosed pay phones. In the United States this replacement was caused, at least in part, by {{an attempt to make}} the <b>pay</b> <b>telephones</b> more accessible to disabled people. However, in the United Kingdom, telephones remained in booths more often than the non-enclosed set up. Although still fairly common, the number of phone boxes has declined sharply in Britain since the late 1990s due to the boom of mobile phones.|$|R

These stations were supervised by telephone company attendants or agents who collected the money due after people made their calls. In 1889, the first coin-operated telephone was installed by inventor William Gray at a bank in Hartford, Connecticut. However, it was a [...] "postpay" [...] machine that only accepted coins deposited after the call was placed.|$|E

By 7:30a.m., he was talking [...] "casually" [...] to the winner of the {{previous}} day's sailing race and gave no indication that anything was amiss. At 8:00a.m., Gargan and Markham joined Kennedy at his hotel where they had a [...] "heated conversation." [...] According to Kennedy's testimony, the two men asked why he had not reported the crash. Kennedy responded by telling them [...] "about my own thoughts and feelings as I swam across that channel... that somehow when they arrived in the morning {{that they were going to}} say that Mary Jo was still alive." [...] The three men subsequently crossed back to Chappaquiddick Island on the ferry, where Kennedy made a series of telephone calls from a <b>pay</b> <b>telephone</b> near the crossing. He made the phone calls to his friends for advice. Again, Kennedy did not report the crash to authorities.|$|E
