40|$|SIMP {{is a novel}} {{multiple}} instruction-pipeline parallel architecture. It {{is targeted}} for enhancing the performance of SISD processors drastically by exploiting both temporal and spatial parallelisms, and for keeping <b>program</b> <b>compatibility</b> as well. Degree of performance enhancement achieved by SIMP depends on; i) how to supply multiple instructions continuously, and ii) how to resolve data and control dependencies effectively. We have devised the outstanding techniques for instruction fetch and dependency resolution. The instruction fetch mechanism employs unique schemes of; i) prefetching multiple instructions {{with the help of}} branch prediction, ii) squashing instructions selectively, and iii) providing multiple conditional modes as a result. The dependency resolution mechanism permits out-of-order execution of sequential instruction stream. Our out-of-order execution model is based on Tomasulo’s algorithm which has been used in single instruction-pipeline processors. However, it is greatly extended and accommodated to multiple instruction pipelining with; i) detecting and identifying multiple dependencies simultaneously, ii) alleviating the effects of control dependencies with both eager execution and advance execution, and iii) ensuring a precise machine state against branches and interrupts. By taking advantage of these techniques, SIMP {{is one of the most}} promising architectures toward the coming generation of high-speed single processors. 1...|$|E
40|$|Culture was {{investigated}} to explore {{its role in}} finding more effective programs for young offenders of different cultural backgrounds. The methodological framework developed by Dorothy E. Smith is employed as the main source that directed inquiry into the influence of culture on the everyday experiences of people. Hirschi's social control theory {{is used as a}} starting point for the investigation into culture. This was based on his claims that family bonding maintains conformity. This exploratory, qualitative study drew on a small sample of participants from the Portuguese community in Montreal. From these in-depth interviews several themes emerged that illuminate culture to be an important element that impacts the socialization process of individuals. The main pattern that surfaced as an indicator of cultural transmission was drawn from respondents' descriptions of the family. Patterns of behavior emerged around the following themes: gender roles, communication, discipline methods, surveillance, education, and social bonds. The identification of these patterns supports the argument that rehabilitation programs need to be adapted to the culture(s) of young offenders. Implications are outlined relating to an assessment of <b>program</b> <b>compatibility</b> to individual offenders (e. g. group vs. individual counseling, reward-based programs, degree of expression, level of program structure, and benefits within involvement in extra-curricular activities).

40|$|Name: Twittie Senivongse Degree: PhD in Computer Science Evolution Transparency for Distributed Service Types Abstract Large {{software}} {{systems are}} never static as they exist {{in an environment}} that is subject to constant changes in both functionality and technology. Managing this evolution {{is one of the major}} challenges in the engineering of large-scale software systems. When a distributed service evolves its interface, other parties in its environment who need to continue using the service will themselves have to evolve correspondingly if the evolved service, although functionally compatible, is not type-compatible with the original one. The autonomous and decentralised nature of distributed components makes such an assumption impractical since the service provider and client systems may not agree on the evolution. It may not even be possible to track down and alter all client programs which are distributed over the network. The best way to tackle this problem is to provide 'evolution transparency' to give the affected components the illusion that the service does not change. This thesis presents an RM-ODP-based model that hides from clients details of changes occuring to distributed service types over time. By allowing type versioning, the model supports <b>program</b> <b>compatibility</b> by enabling a client program of one type version to access a service instance of another functionally compatible type version, even though the versions are not considered compatible by the supporting type system. The model manages a cross-version binding and maintains semantic information which is used to transform the client's invocation to the format recognised by the accessed service object. With a prototype implementation on ANSAware together with an analysis of its mechanism, the evolution transparency support proves useful; clients are given the flexibility to defer their own evolution, and type substitutability is also extended from syntactic to functional compatibility...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of evaluating implementation fidelity is acknowledged, {{little is known about}} heterogeneity in fidelity over time. This study aims to generate insight into the heterogeneity in implementation fidelity trajectories of a health promotion program in multidisciplinary settings and the relationship with changes in patients' health behavior. This study used longitudinal data from the nationwide implementation of an evidence-informed physical activity promotion program in Dutch rehabilitation care. Fidelity scores were calculated based on annual surveys filled in by involved professionals (n[*]=[*]±[*] 70). Higher fidelity scores indicate a more complete implementation of the program's core components. A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on the implementation fidelity scores of 17 organizations at three different time points. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to explore organizational and professional differences between identified trajectories. Regression analyses were conducted to determine differences in patient outcomes. Three trajectories were identified as the following: 'stable high fidelity' (n[*]=[*] 9), 'moderate and improving fidelity' (n[*]=[*] 6), and 'unstable fidelity' (n[*]=[*] 2). The stable high fidelity organizations were generally smaller, started earlier, and implemented the program in a more structured way compared to moderate and improving fidelity organizations. At the implementation period's start and end, support from physicians and physiotherapists, professionals' appreciation, and <b>program</b> <b>compatibility</b> were rated more positively by professionals working in stable high fidelity organizations as compared to the moderate and improving fidelity organizations (p[*]<[*]. 05). Qualitative data showed that the stable high fidelity organizations had often an explicit vision and strategy about the implementation of the program. Intriguingly, the trajectories were not associated with patients' self-reported physical activity outcomes (adjusted model β[*]=[*]-[*] 651. 6, t(613) [*]=[*]-[*] 1032, p[*]=[*]. 303). Differences in organizational-level implementation fidelity trajectories did not result in outcome differences at patient-level. This suggests that an effective implementation fidelity trajectory is contingent on the local organization's conditions. More specifically, achieving stable high implementation fidelity required the management of tensions: realizing a localized change vision, while safeguarding the program's standardized core components and engaging the scarce physicians throughout the process. When scaling up evidence-informed health promotion programs, we propose to tailor the management of implementation tensions to local organizations' starting position, size, and circumstances.

40|$|Time shared {{computer}} {{systems have been}} based upon the two techniques of multiprogramming and swapping. Multiprogramming is based on restricting each program to {{a portion of the}} total computer memory. Swapping requires considerable overhead time for loading and unloading programs. To alleviate the size restriction due to multiprogramming, segmentation is employed, resulting in fact in vastly increased swapping. A new system architecture is proposed for time shared computing that alleviates the high overhead or program size restriction. It utilizes a hierarchy of processors, where each processor is assigned tasks on the basis of four factors: interactive requirements, frequency of use, execution time, and program length. In order to study the hierarchical approach to system architecture, the Moore School Problem Solving Facility (MSPSF) was built and used. The study of the manner of operation and the reactions of the users clarified and defined the Hierarchy of Processors system architecture. The Moore School Problem Solving Facility was implemented on second generation equipment, the IBM 7040, and therefore {{it is not possible to}} adequately compare the efficiency with third generation computers operating in a swapping mode. The conclusions of this dissertation center around the methodology of designing such a system, including the specification of facilities for each level of the hierarchy. Six major conclusions are given: (1) Three processors in the hierarchy have been necessary, but it is conceivable that more may be employed in other future situations. (2) Each of the processors in the hierarchy should be general purpose. (3) <b>Program</b> <b>compatibility</b> between the processors is necessary. (4) The assigning of tasks to the processors within the system should be optionally user directed or automatic. Similarly, if a task exceeds the resources of the processor to which it has been assigned, redirection should be possible either automatically or by the user. (5) A macro language is necessary between every pair of processors for effective communication. Such a language processor, IXSYS, has been constructed and its use is described in detail in the dissertation, demonstrating the need and utility. (6) In addition to the three hierarchical processors, a separate processor may be advantageously used for storage, retrieval and management of information in files. Such a processor should be directly accessible from each of the other processors...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{implementation of}} an evidence-informed parent education program for parents with intellectual disability, called Parenting Young Children (PYC), in the Swedish social services. The empirical studies {{on which the}} thesis is based aimed to evaluate how feasible and successful implementation of PYC has been to date, examining program fidelity, {{and the provision of}} program support. Study I explored perceptions of competence development and the training process for Swedish program users (support workers) who participated in monthly peer support groups. Focus groups discussed experiences of PYC and completed a competency questionnaire on two occasions. Perceived competence was high and increased over time. PYC peer support groups were thought to be beneficial for performance evaluation, exchange of information and coping with problems. However, many reported few opportunities to implement the program. Study II investigated peer group facilitators’ (Area Coordinators) perceptions of working in peer support groups. Area Coordinators completed diaries each month after meetings, recording topics covered, difficulties experienced by the group and general reflections about peer support. Area Coordinators also attended a focus group. Several opportunities and barriers to program implementation were perceived within the groups. Interaction between the peer support groups and the organization/managers was thought to be particularly important, but difficult to achieve. In Study III fidelity was examined by tracking frequency of implementation of program activities and teaching approaches in support workers. Feasibility was explored through questionnaires addressing perceived program complexity and compatibility in support workers and their managers. Implementation of PYC was reported to be highly feasible, with overall positive attitudes to Evidence-Based Practice, good <b>program</b> <b>compatibility</b> and low perceived program complexity, as well as high satisfaction with implementation support. However, some behavioural aspects of PYC were rarely reported to be used in practice. Low implementation intensity was also reported. Study IV aimed to develop a PYC fidelity measure that included the perspective of program recipients. Two questionnaires were developed; one measured parents’ perceptions of support workers’ fidelity, the other was a self-report questionnaire for support workers. Items from the support worker and parent versions were compared for inter-rater reliability. Parents and support workers both reported very high fidelity. Scores were consistent over a three month period. Inter-rater reliability between parents and support workers was, however, only fair. Taken together, these results highlight enthusiasm and perceived need for PYC in the social services. Further work is needed in order to assist implementation of PYC and to develop both the program itself and program suppor...|$|E
