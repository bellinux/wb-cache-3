50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>to</b> <b>Multipoint</b> is {{the most}} popular {{approach}} for wireless communications that have a large number of nodes, end destinations or end users. <b>Point</b> <b>to</b> <b>Multipoint</b> generally assumes there is a central Base Station to which remote Subscriber Units or Customer Premises Equipment, CPE (a term that was originally used in the wired telephone industry) are connected over the wireless medium. Connections between the Base Station and Subscriber Units can be either Line of Sight or for lower-frequency radio systems Non-Line-of-Sight where link budgets permit. Generally, lower frequencies can offer non-Line-of Sight connections. Various software planning tools can be used to determine feasibility of potential connections using topographic data as well as link budget simulation. Often the <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>multipoint</b> links are installed to reduce the cost of infrastructure and increase the number of CPE's and connectivity.|$|E

The 'Virtual Room Video conferencing System' (VRVS) has been developed since 1995, in order to provide a low cost, bandwidth-efficient, extensible means for video conferencing and remote collaboration over networks within the High Energy and Nuclear Physics communities.

VRVS uses the Internet 2 and ESnet high-performance networks infrastructure to deploy its Web-based system, which now includes more than 5790 registered hosts running VRVS software in more than 50 different countries. VRVS hosts an average of 100 -multipoint videoconference and collaborative sessions worldwide every month. There are around 35 reflectors that manage the traffic flow, at HENP labs and universities in the US and Europe. So far, there are 7 Virtual Rooms for World Wide Conferences (involving more than one continent), and 4 Virtual Rooms each for intra-continental conferences in the US, Europe and Asia.

Multicast protocols support a wide range of multipoint applications ranging from teleconferencing to network games.

In addition, the heterogeneity of network components and technologies has introduced new failure modes that have not been considered traditionally in the design of multicast protocols; such as unicast routing anomalies and selective loss over LANs. The presence of these failures exacerbates the design and testing problems of multicast protocols, due to the esoteric interaction between the different layers in the protocol sta [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{represents}} Energy preservation in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{will be a}} important issue. Energy preservation {{has received}} increased attention in the recent years. The new transmission scheme for energy-constrained WSNs was using stateless multicast protocol. The scheme, called MIHOP (Made It Happen On Purpose), combines cluster-based virtual MIMO and multihop technologies. The multihop mode is employed in data transmission. Here the related sensors are located within a specific number of hops from the sink, and the virtual MIMO mode is used for transmitting data from the remaining sensor nodes. The comparison of the energy consumption of different transmission schemes was performed and propose an algorithm for determining the optimal hop count in MIHOP. The controllable mobile sink reduces the energy consumed in sensor transmission is also adopted for data collection. This project combine both MIMO with multi point relay set. MIMO technology takes {{the advantage of a}} radio wave phenomenon called multipath where transmitting the information to other objects. Getting the receiving antenna multiple times via different angles and at slightly different times. In multihop wireless networks are used in communication between two end nodes is carried out through a number of intermediate nodes whose function is to relay information from one <b>point</b> <b>to</b> another. <b>Multipoint</b> relays (MPR) are nodes in wireless Ad-Hoc networks that do the job of relaying the messages between nodes. Multipoint relays are also have the main role in selecting the proper route from any source to any desired destination node.

50|$|In {{nearly every}} {{metropolitan}} area worldwide, operators and hobbyists deployed {{more and more}} unlicensed broadband <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>multipoint</b> systems.

50|$|Another concept within RPR is what {{is known}} as spatial reuse. Because RPR strips the signal once it reaches the {{destination}} (unlike a SONET UPSR/SDH SNCP ring, in which the bandwidth is consumed around the entire ring) it can reuse the freed space to carry additional traffic. The RPR standard also supports the use of learning bridges (IEEE 802.1D) to further enhance efficiency in <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>multipoint</b> applications and VLAN tagging (IEEE 802.1Q).|$|E
