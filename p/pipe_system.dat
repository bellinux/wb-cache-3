5|$|Pipeline transport: The ancient Chinese {{made use}} of {{channels}} and pipe systems for public works. The Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. 189AD) ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside {{the capital city of}} Luoyang. These chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware <b>pipe</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Infamously, in the 1845 Arctic expedition of Sir John Franklin, crew members suffered from severe lead poisoning, thought to be caused by eating tin canned food.

25|$|In 1952, {{the concept}} of {{installing}} perforated pipes in dams was introduced to control water levels at the Northeastern Wildlife Conference as a solution for problem beaver ponds. In 1963, Laramie reported that the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department had successfully installed and maintained beaver pipes in 46 dams. In 1978, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation began designing and testing various culvert protection devices, of which the T-culvert guard was {{the most effective and}} cost-beneficial. In 1992, Clemson University developed the Clemson Beaver Pond Leveler, a device that prevented beavers from damming areas of concern by directing water through existing dams using a strategically designed <b>pipe</b> <b>system.</b> Over the years, these designs have been modified and improved in order to address flow problems that occur in a variety of different landscapes. The most recent innovations in flow devices combine fencing techniques which exclude beaver with pipe systems which deceive beaver.|$|E

500|$|The Israelis had {{constructed}} {{a series of}} fortifications along the canal called the Bar Lev Line, which was considered impregnable. The main obstacle of these defences was a massive artificial sand wall erected by Israeli engineers, [...] high with a 45–60 degree incline, along the entire Suez Canal. The rampart were reinforced by concrete that also prevented any attempt by amphibious vehicles to climb the sand wall. To blast through the sand barrier the Israelis estimated would take at least twenty-four, probably forty-eight hours. Behind this rampart were a series of 22 fortifications comprising 35 strongpoints. On average, the fortifications were [...] apart. A strongpoint was several stories deep into the sand and provided protection from a 1000-pound (~½ ton) bomb. Strongpoints incorporated trenches, barbed wire, minefields 200 meters deep, numerous bunkers and troop shelters, and firing positions for tanks. Each strongpoint had an underground reservoir filled with crude oil. The oil could be pumped into the Suez Canal via a <b>pipe</b> <b>system,</b> and ignited to create temperatures reaching [...] A second defensive line, [...] behind the main line, was concentrated at likely crossing areas, and designed to be occupied by armored forces, incorporating tank firing positions. A third defensive line, [...] behind the sand rampart, had its defences concentrated on the main roads and principal routes of advance for an attacker. Behind the main line on the canal were concentration areas for armor and infantry, supply depots, numerous artillery positions and so forth.|$|E
500|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} the tone holes varies {{the length of}} the pipe, changing the resonant frequencies of the enclosed air column and hence the pitch. A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the register key; clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register [...] "the break". The open register key stops the fundamental frequency from being reinforced, and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally. This produces a note a twelfth above the original note. Most instruments overblow at two times the speed of the fundamental frequency (the octave), but as the clarinet acts as a closed <b>pipe</b> <b>system,</b> the reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a rarefaction. This means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away. The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register key, plays third harmonics (a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals). The first several notes of the altissimo range, aided by the register key and venting with the first left-hand hole, play fifth harmonics (a major seventeenth, a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth, above the fundamentals). The clarinet is therefore said to overblow at the twelfth and, when moving to the altissimo register, seventeenth. By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave or (like the ocarina and tonette) do not overblow at all. A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes, a chromatic octave and a half from bottom E to B, in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, sounding a further sixth and fourth (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register. This is also why the inner [...] "waist" [...] measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.|$|E

2500|$|The {{district}} was formerly a watery area, with several small creeks combining into one before emptying into Øverlandselva. Most of the Nadderud Watershed (...) has been led underground through a <b>pipe</b> <b>system.</b> One creek, Eiksbekken/Gravsbekken, originates north of Eiksmarka, and portions of it still exist. Another creek, Nadderudbekken, originated at Eikeli and flowed {{more or less}} in a straight southwestern direction, and at one point formed the pond Nadderuddammen. It was used for leisure ice skating during the winter, but exists no more. Another minor creek originated at Lønnås, and another creek Hoslebekken originated at Hosle. This is the only other significant portion of the watershed which is still visible. The three main creeks confluated south of Gjønnes farm. After this, much of the riverbed is used as a pedestrian road between Gjønnes and the road Kirkeveien at Haslum. Where the creek crossed Kirkeveien, there was formerly a bridge, but it has been filled with solid material.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{vibration}} of <b>pipe</b> <b>systems</b> {{not only}} worsens their working environment, but also {{may result in}} the loosening of mechanical connections between pipelines, {{as well as the}} structural fatigue damages. This paper presents a new method for vibration control of <b>pipe</b> <b>systems,</b> by specially designing some pipe structures based on two vibration reduction mechanisms of phononic crystals, for the vibration frequency in the actual tests. Some numerical analyses are then performed about the effects of the parameters of vibrator, for instance, the ratio of material components, and the numbers of period. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed phononic crystals structures can reduce the vibration of <b>pipe</b> <b>systems</b> effectively...|$|R

[...] Upon stepping through the terracotta leather covered and gold trimmed wooden doors into the auditorium, a patron would have been softly bathed in the shimmering glow of 94 gas lights. [...] These lights, were crafted of polished brass and fitted with etched glass globes. [...] The stage itself was equipped with 174 gas lights. [...] All the lights in the entire theatre were controlled from the stage by means of a <b>pipe</b> <b>system,</b> allowing the stage manager to ignite or extinguish any or all of these brilliant lights in an instant. [...] Beneath a dome resplendent with painted cherubs, a large chandelier, known as an [...] "Opal glass reflector", scattered sparkles of reflected light over all. [...] Elegant red Brussels' carpet softened patrons' steps, and grand opera chairs, upholstered in dark Cardinal plush awaited to seat them. [...] These chairs were engraved with the monogram, B.S.T., Barton Tibbits' initials, and many of these chairs offered foot rests and hat and umbrella racks. [...] Amazingly the auditorium originally held 1,000 seats for patrons. [...] The seating area was divided into the parquet and the parquet circle – two separate areas {{on the floor in front}} of the orchestra pit. [...] The walls of the auditorium, colored in cameo tints and dashes of cardinal, green, and gold color in [...] "conventional figures" [...] produced [...] "a warm, sunny effect and [...] the auditorium a bright and airy appearance which is very pleasing." [...] Dominating the scene was a grandly ornate -wide by -long proscenium stage with elegant opera boxes situated within the massive tin and plaster arch.|$|E
