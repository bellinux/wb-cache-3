5|$|USB2.0 devices use {{a special}} {{protocol}} during reset, called chirping, {{to negotiate the}} high bandwidth mode with the host/hub. A device that is USB2.0 High Speed capable first connects as a Full Speed device (D+ <b>pulled</b> <b>high),</b> but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D− driven LOW by host for 10 to 20ms) it pulls the D− line high, known as chirp K. This indicates to the host that the device is high bandwidth. If the host/hub is also HS capable, it chirps (returns alternating J and K states on D− and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at high bandwidth. The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ chirps before it changes to high bandwidth terminations and begins high bandwidth signaling. Because USB 3.0 uses wiring separate and additional to that used by USB2.0 and USB1.x, such bandwidth negotiation is not required.|$|E

25|$|This {{standard}} defines an Alert# {{signal that}} is used by an eSPI slave to request service from the master. In a performance-oriented design or a design with only one eSPI slave, each eSPI slave will have its Alert# pin connected to an Alert# pin on the eSPI master that is dedicated to each slave, allowing the eSPI master to grant low-latency service because the eSPI master will know which eSPI slave needs service and will not need to poll all of the slaves to determine which device needs service. In a budget design with more than one eSPI slave, all of the Alert# pins of the slaves are connected to one Alert# pin on the eSPI master in a wired-OR connection, which will require the master to poll all the slaves to determine which ones need service when the Alert# signal is pulled low by one or more peripherals that need service. Only after all of the devices are serviced will the Alert# signal be <b>pulled</b> <b>high</b> due to none of the eSPI slaves needing service and therefore pulling the Alert# signal low.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} {{personality}} traits have predictive validity for trichotillomania (TTM) diagnosis, pulling severity and control, and hair pulling style. Methods: In study 1, logistic regression was used with TTM cases (n= 54) and controls (n= 25) {{to determine if}} NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) personality domains predicted TTM case vs. control classification. In study 2, hierarchical multiple regression was used with TTM cases (n= 164) to determine whether NEO-FFI personality domains predicted hair pulling severity and control as well as focused and automatic pulling styles. Results: TTM case vs. control status was predicted by NEO-FFI neuroticism. Every 1 -point increase in neuroticism scores resulted in a 10 % greater chance of TTM diagnosis. Higher neuroticism, higher openness, and lower agreeableness were associated with greater <b>pulling</b> severity. <b>Higher</b> neuroticism was also associated with less control over hair <b>pulling.</b> <b>Higher</b> neuroticism and lower openness were associated with greater focused pulling. None of the personality domains predicted automatic hair pulling. Conclusions: Personality traits, especially neuroticism, can predict TTM diagnosis, hair pulling severity and control, and the focused style of pulling. None of the personality traits predicted automatic pulling. Longitudinal {{studies are needed to}} determine whether personality variables predispose to TTM onset, impact disorder course, and/or result from hair pulling behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to obtain a database on the flowfield past an array of vortex generators (VGs) in a turbulent boundary layer. All testing was carried out in a low speed wind tunnel with a flow velocity of 29 ft/sec, giving a Reynolds number of 17, 500 based on the width of the VG. The flowfield generated by an array of five ramp-shaped vortex generators was examined with hot wire anemometry and smoke flow visualization. The magnitude and extent of the velocity increase near the wall, the penetration of the velocity deficit into the core flow, and the peak streamwise vorticity are examined. Influence of various parameters on the effectiveness of the array is considered on the basis of the ability to <b>pull</b> <b>high</b> momentum fluid into the near wall region...|$|R

40|$|This {{review article}} {{examines}} previous weightlifting literature {{and provides a}} rationale {{for the use of}} weightlifting pulling derivatives that eliminate the catch phase for athletes who are not competitive weightlifters. Practitioners should emphasize the completion of the triple extension movement during the second pull phase that is characteristic of weightlifting movements as this is likely to have the greatest transference to athletic performance that is dependent on hip, knee, and ankle extension. The clean pull, snatch <b>pull,</b> hang <b>high</b> <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh pull are weightlifting pulling derivatives {{that can be used in}} the teaching progression of the full weightlifting movements and are thus less complex with regard to exercise technique. Previous literature suggests that the clean pull, snatch <b>pull,</b> hang <b>high</b> <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh pull may provide a training stimulus that is as good as, if not better than, weightlifting movements that include the catch phase. Weightlifting pulling derivatives can be implemented throughout the training year, but an emphasis and de-emphasis should be used in order to meet the goals of particular training phases. When implementing weightlifting pulling derivatives, athletes must make a maximum effort, understand that pulling derivatives can be used for both technique work and building strength–power characteristics, and be coached with proper exercise technique. Future research should consider examining the effect of various loads on kinetic and kinematic characteristics of weightlifting pulling derivatives, training with full weightlifting movements as compared to training with weightlifting pulling derivatives, and how kinetic and kinematic variables vary between derivatives of the snatch...|$|R
50|$|The game {{is housed}} in a custom cabinet that {{includes}} two sets (one set per player) of three control buttons (up, down, and fire). The game PCB is composed of discrete technology with game sprites stored in ROM. There is an undocumented option available that switches the planes into UFOs. Pin 14 of the 003127 IC — a PROM located at grid location K1 — is tied to ground, but also has a pullup resistor.

50|$|Ground bounce {{is usually}} seen on high density VLSI where {{insufficient}} precautions {{have been taken}} to supply a logic gate with a sufficiently low resistance connection (or sufficiently high capacitance) to ground. In this phenomenon, when the gate is turned on, enough current flows through the -collector circuit that the silicon in the immediate vicinity of the emitter is <b>pulled</b> <b>high,</b> sometimes by several volts, thus raising the local ground, as perceived by the transistor, to a value significantly above true ground. Relative to this local ground, the base voltage can go negative, thus shutting off the transistor. As the excess local charge dissipates, the transistor turns back on, possibly causing a repeat of the phenomenon, sometimes up to a half-dozen bounces.|$|E

50|$|The {{airframe}} {{also has}} G-Force limitations {{depending on whether}} the aircraft was fully loaded as the real F-16 has stores configuration categories. When fully loaded, the player can only pull 5.5G's, instead of the 9G's a clean F-16 is capable of. Airspeed & Mach speed would be lower when fully laden as well. The player can even jettison the fuel and weapons in the event of emergency to enable the aircraft to <b>pull</b> <b>higher</b> G's, such as in an emergency or in combat or an aborted mission. Spins and ground effect are not simulated, as is with other simulations of its time, although another rare feature, turbulence is a user selectable option at Briefing & Weather screen. Turbulence in the simulation causes random and slight variations in the aircraft's bank angle and heading, making it a little bit more difficult to land, but it never affects the altitude.|$|R

50|$|All {{signals from}} the drives are TTL-buffered and have 150 ohm pullups. Maxi and mini signals are wired and at the pullup side of the buffers. Signals, which {{do not apply to}} the mini (i.e., READY and SEP CLOCK), are {{disabled}} and <b>pulled</b> <b>high</b> when the mini is selected. Signals to the drives from the 1771 are TTL-buffered with separate buffers for mini and maxi connectors. The STEP output is stretched by IC37 to about 16 microseconds before going to the drives. The HLD (head load) output does not go directly to the drives but rather enables the drive select lines through IC10 pin 1. Thus, the actual drive select signal to the drive is the coincidence of a latched drive selection (done at port 34H) and HLD from the 1771. Head loading time is determined by counters IC36 and 27. Timeout is controlled by the count loaded into lC3's by IC53. Signals DRQ, HLD, and INTRQ (or EOJ) are available at input port 34H (rC9). Various control signals are assigned to output port 34H and are latched by rcs 24 and 41.|$|E
50|$|A grey-out may be {{experienced}} by aircraft pilots <b>pulling</b> <b>high</b> positive g-forces as when pulling {{up into a}} loop or a tight turn forcing blood to the lower extremities {{of the body and}} lowering blood pressure in the brain. This is the reverse of a redout, or a reddening of the vision, which is the result of negative g-forces caused by performing an outside loop, that is by pushing the nose of the aircraft down. Redouts are potentially dangerous and can cause retinal damage and hemorrhagic stroke. Pilots of high performance aircraft can increase their resistance to greyout by using a g-suit, which controls the pooling of blood in the lower limbs but there is no suit yet capable of controlling a redout. In both cases symptoms may be remedied immediately by easing pressure on the flight controls. Continued, or heavy g-force will rapidly progress to g-LOC (g-force induced Loss of Consciousness).|$|R
