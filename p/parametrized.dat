5|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by numerical integration on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions. In the field of numerical relativity, powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes. In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as naked singularities. Approximate solutions may also be found by perturbation theories such as linearized gravity and its generalization, the post-Newtonian expansion, {{both of which were}} developed by Einstein. The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light. The expansion involves a series of terms; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity, whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton's theory due to general relativity. An extension of this expansion is the <b>parametrized</b> post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories.|$|E

40|$|In {{the thesis}} {{we present a}} new method for <b>parametrizing</b> {{algebraic}} varieties over the field of characteristic zero. The problem of <b>parametrizing</b> is reduced to a problem of finding an isomorphism of algebras. We introduce the Lie algebra of a variety as a Lie algebra related to its group of automorphisms. Constructing an isomorphism of this one and some classical Lie algebra (for example the algebra of matrices of the zero trace) then leads to <b>parametrizing</b> the variety. The problem of finding an isomorphism of Lie algebras is further reduced to trivializing an associative algebra, which means finding an isomorphism of the algebra and a full matrix algebra. The last is a classical problem in number theory, when regarded over algebraically non-closed fields. We give algorithms for trivializing algebras of degrees up to 4 over number fields. In our work we used the method to <b>parametrize</b> Del Pezzo surfaces of degrees 8 and 9 over number fields. The algorithms are implemented for {{the case of the}} field of the rationals.

The distinct monomial symmetric functions are <b>parametrized</b> by the integer partitions (each m has a unique representative monomial X with the parts i in weakly decreasing order). Since any symmetric function containing any of the monomials of some m must contain all of them with the same coefficient, each symmetric function can be written as an R-linear combination of monomial symmetric functions, and the distinct monomial symmetric functions therefore form a basis of R as R-module.|$|E
25|$|In principle, Monte Carlo {{methods can}} be used to solve any problem having a {{probabilistic}} interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the sample mean) of independent samples of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is <b>parametrized,</b> mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. That is, in the limit, the samples being generated by the MCMC method will be samples from the desired (target) distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the MCMC sampler.|$|E
25|$|Early {{tests of}} general {{relativity}} were hampered {{by the lack of}} viable competitors to the theory: it was not clear what sorts of tests would distinguish it from its competitors. General relativity was the only known relativistic theory of gravity compatible with special relativity and observations. Moreover, it is an extremely simple and elegant theory. This changed with the introduction of Brans–Dicke theory in 1960. This theory is arguably simpler, as it contains no dimensionful constants, and is compatible with a version of Mach's principle and Dirac's large numbers hypothesis, two philosophical ideas which have been influential in the history of relativity. Ultimately, this {{led to the development of}} the <b>parametrized</b> post-Newtonian formalism by Nordtvedt and Will, which parametrizes, in terms of ten adjustable parameters, all the possible departures from Newton's law of universal gravitation to first order in the velocity of moving objects (i.e. to first order in , where v is the velocity of an object and c is the speed of light). This approximation allows the possible deviations from general relativity, for slowly moving objects in weak gravitational fields, to be systematically analyzed. Much effort has been put into constraining the post-Newtonian parameters, and deviations from general relativity are at present severely limited.|$|E
