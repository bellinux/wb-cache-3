5|$|The breed has {{no known}} genetic health issues. Blue Picardy Spaniels can {{be prone to}} ear infections, which are common among dogs with <b>pendulous</b> ears, {{including}} Basset Hounds and other breeds of Spaniel. It has an average life expectancy of thirteen years.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, <b>pendulous</b> ears are more {{predisposed}} to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|George placed B.aculeata in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} {{inflorescence}} {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B.ser. Tetragonae because of its <b>pendulous</b> inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B.caleyi, from which it differs in having narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.|$|E
5|$|In his 1981 {{monograph}} The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Alex George placed B. lemanniana in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles. He made it the type species of B.ser. Tetragonae, the members of which are defined by their <b>pendulous</b> inflorescences and tetragonal limbs. He considered it closely related to B.aculeata and B.caleyi, which are smaller, more compact, shrubs with red- or pink-tinged inflorescences.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with <b>pendulous</b> ears, they {{are prone to}} ear infections such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} 1950s onwards, {{breeding}} resumed in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. New plants were produced by crossing among the species and existing cultivars of S. truncata, S. russelliana and the hybrid S. × buckleyi. Treatments which induced mutations were also used. The {{result was a}} wide range of flower colours which had not been available before, including the first true yellow to be sold commercially, S. 'Gold Charm' (which was a sterile triploid). Breeders aimed for plants which grew strongly, were upright at the point of sale rather than <b>pendulous,</b> had many flowers or buds, and were adapted to living as house plants.|$|E
5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. Ears are small, <b>pendulous</b> (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{primates}} {{have two}} mammary glands, {{but the number}} and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines. Lorises have two pairs, while others, like the ring-tailed lemur, have one pair on the chest (pectoral). The aye-aye also has two mammary glands, but they are located near the groin (inguinal). In females, the clitoris is sometimes enlarged and <b>pendulous,</b> resembling the male penis, which can make sex identification difficult for human observers. The clitoris may also have a bony structure in it, similar to the baculum (penis bone) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip.|$|E
5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in France {{for use as}} a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought {{to be one of the}} two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with <b>pendulous</b> ears, it can be prone to ear infections.|$|E
5|$|Several {{plants are}} {{immediately}} evident to the visitor. Banyan (Ficus macrophylla subsp. columnaris) {{is a remarkable}} tree with a buttressed trunk and <b>pendulous</b> aerial roots: {{it can be seen}} on the track to Clear Place and near Ned's Beach. Pandanus tree (Pandanus forsteri) has spectacular teepee-like prop roots and pineapple-like fruits that are orange-red when mature, the tough leaves being used for basketry. It occurs in damp areas like creek beds and fine specimens can be seen along the Boat Harbour track. There are ten species of orchid on the island, the most noticeable being the bush orchid (Dendrobium macropus subsp. howeanum) on lowland trees and rocks, bearing cream flowers from August to September. Other prominent flowering plants in the summer include, on the mountain slopes, the whiskery red flowers of mountain rose (Metrosideros nervulosa and Metrosideros sclerocarpa), the massed small yellow flowers of corokia (Corokia carpodetoides), orange plump flowers of pumpkin tree (Negria rhabdothamnoides), and white spikes of Fitzgerald tree (Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii). The kava bush has large, aromatic, heart-shaped leaves. After heavy rain the endemic glowing mushrooms Mycena chlorophanos and Omphalotus nidiformis {{can be found in the}} palm forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree that owes its common {{name to the}} white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often <b>pendulous</b> and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seed get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, {{and one of the}} first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties.|$|E
5|$|The parish of Selborne lies in {{the extreme}} eastern corner of the county of Hampshire, {{bordering}} on the county of Sussex, and {{not far from the}} county of Surrey; is about fifty miles south-west of London, in latitude fifty-one, and near mid-way between the towns of Alton and Petersfield. Being very large and extensive, it abuts on twelve parishes, two of which are in Sussex—viz, Trotton and Rogate.... The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects. The high part of the south-west consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village, and is divided into a sheep-down, the high wood and a long hanging wood, called The Hanger. The covert of this eminence is altogether beech, the most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind or bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful <b>pendulous</b> boughs. The down, or sheepwalk, is a pleasing park-like spot, of about one mile by half that space, jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an assemblage of hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water. The prospect is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains called the Sussex Downs, by Guild-down near Guildford, and by the Downs round Dorking, and Ryegate in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, with the country beyond Alton and Farnham, form a noble and extensive outline.|$|E
25|$|Hantu kopek (nipple ghost) {{appears as}} an old woman with <b>pendulous</b> breasts.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{small tree}} usually 30 through 80 feet (10 through 24 meters) in height, with a short, slender trunk and spreading, often <b>pendulous</b> branches, which form a broad or narrow, round-topped canopy. The roots are thick, fleshy and stoloniferous. This species as has a shrubby growth form.|$|E
25|$|Human {{fertility}} {{was a major}} {{aspect of}} Egyptian mythology, and was often entwined with the crop fertility provided by annual flooding of the river Nile. This connection was shown in iconography of Nile-gods, such as Hapy, god of the Nile River, and Wadj-wer, god of the Nile Delta, who although male were depicted with female attributes such as <b>pendulous</b> breasts, symbolizing the fertility the river provides.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{there are}} over 300 {{recorded}} cultivars of Prunus mume. These are divided into three groups by phylogenetics (P. mume and hybrids). These are further classified {{by the type of}} branches: upright (直枝梅類), <b>pendulous</b> (垂枝梅類), and tortuous (龍游梅類); and by the characteristics of the flower. Some varieties are especially famed for their ornamental value, including the hongmei (红梅), taigemei, zhaoshuimei (照水梅), lü'emei (绿萼梅), longyoumei (龍游梅), and chuizhimei (垂枝梅).|$|E
25|$|In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company {{were the}} first to measure cup size by the letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, and D, though the letters {{represented}} how <b>pendulous</b> the breasts were and not their volume. Camp's advertising in the February 1933 issue of Corset and Underwear Review featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts. Cup sizes A through D were not intended to be used for larger-breasted women.|$|E
25|$|B.rosseraes {{relationship}} to other Banksia species is uncertain. Its leaves are virtually indistinguishable from narrow-leaved forms of B.laevigata (Tennis Ball Banksia), and like that species it has condensed, roughly spherical inflorescences, and slender styles. However, unlike B.laevigata {{it has a}} lignotuber, and terminal inflorescences that hang down instead of being held erect. The lignotuber suggests an affinity with B.lullfitzii, while the <b>pendulous</b> inflorescences suggest {{a relationship with the}} Banksia ser. Tetragonae series.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pendulous</b> breasts {{can make}} it {{difficult}} for a person to properly fit a bra. For best results, the breasts should be measured twice: once when standing upright, once bending over at the waist with the breasts hanging down. If the difference between these two measurements is more than 10cm, then the average is chosen for calculating the cup size. A number of reports, surveys and studies in different countries have found that between 80% to 85% of women wear incorrectly fitted bras.|$|E
25|$|A {{much wider}} range of shapes, sizes, and colors is grown in India and {{elsewhere}} in Asia. Larger cultivars weighing up to a kilogram (2.2 pounds) grow in the region between the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, while smaller ones are found elsewhere. Colors vary from white to yellow or green, as well as reddish-purple and dark purple. Some cultivars have a color gradient—white at the stem, to bright pink, deep purple or even black. Green or purple cultivars with white striping also exist. Chinese cultivars are commonly shaped like a narrower, slightly <b>pendulous</b> cucumber. Also, Asian cultivars of Japanese breeding are grown.|$|E
25|$|Bra-wearers {{who have}} {{difficulty}} calculating a correct cup size {{may be able}} to find a correct fit using a method adopted by plastic surgeons. Using a flexible tape measure, position the tape at the outside of the chest, under the arm, where the breast tissue begins. Measure across the fullest part of the breast, usually across the nipple, to where the breast tissue stops at the breast bone. This measuring approach assumes that the breasts are not so large or <b>pendulous</b> that they sag significantly, making measuring across the fullness of the breast impractical. Only women whose breasts are firm and spherical can measure without a bra.|$|E
25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{area between}} the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest. Breast and buttock cleavages, sharing a similarity between their appearances, {{are considered to be}} very sexual. British zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks. Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the <b>pendulous</b> shape of breasts and cleavage.|$|E
25|$|Hornbeams {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} trees, Carpinus betulus reaching {{a height of}} 32m. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, and simple with a serrated margin, and typically vary from 3–10cm in length. The flowers are wind-pollinated <b>pendulous</b> catkins, produced in spring. The male and female flowers are on separate catkins, but on the same tree (monoecious). The fruit is a small nut about 3–6mm long, held in a leafy bract; the bract may be either trilobed or simple oval, and is slightly asymmetrical. The asymmetry of the seedwing makes it spin as it falls, improving wind dispersal. The shape of the wing {{is important in the}} identification of different hornbeam species. Typically, 10–30 seeds are on each seed catkin.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} shoots may be erect or nodding, with erect or <b>pendulous</b> flowers, {{which may}} become more erect as the plant matures. The flowers themselves, in common {{with other members of}} the Ericaceae, have corollas that are generally bell- or cup-shaped, though the petals themselves may or may not be fused. However, the Monotropoideae lack the poricidal anthers that are characteristic of the majority of the Ericaceae. (The Pyroleae do have poricidal anthers, however.) Pollen grains are released as a monad, in contrast to the majority of the Ericaceae, which release pollen grains in tetrad groups. (The Pyroleae variously release pollen as monads, tetrads, or polyads.) Fruits are dry loculicidal dehiscent (or sometimes indehiscent) capsule or a berry. Seeds are highly reduced dust seeds. The shoot may or may not be persistent after seed dispersal.|$|E
25|$|The baths of {{the villa}} are of {{considerable}} size on a triangular plot. The {{remains of the}} frescoes show it was finely decorated with depictions of large <b>pendulous</b> branches. Access to the spa area is via an atrium, painted with wrestlers and boxers, followed by apodyterium, tepidarium, frigidarium, palaestra and caldarium: the pool in the caldarium, which is accessible by stone steps, is 7x5m and 1.5m deep. In excavations in the pool, part of the bottom was removed exposing a large brick furnace heating a large bronze boiler which was removed in 1798 by Lord Hamilton to be transported to London, but during the trip the Colossus was shipwrecked. The caldarium was covered with marble slabs. From the baths {{there are a number}} of ramps connecting the villa with the flat area close to the sea.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} of his extant works, {{known as}} Liber spectaculorum, {{was first published}} {{at the opening of}} the Colosseum in the reign of Titus. It relates to the theatrical performances given by him, but the book as it now stands was presented to the world in or about the first year of Domitian, i.e. about the year 81, by him. The favour of the emperor procured him the countenance of some of the worst creatures at the imperial courtamong them of the notorious Crispinus, and probably (certainly it is thrilling to consider) of Paris, the supposed author of Juvenal's exile, for whose monument Martial afterwards wrote a eulogistic epitaph. The two books, numbered by editors xiii. and xiv., and known by the names of Xenia and Apophoretainscriptions in two lines each for presentswere published at the Saturnalia of 84. In 86 he bore for the world the first two of the twelve books on which his <b>pendulous</b> and sterling reputation rests.|$|E
500|$|Willow carr (locally {{uncommon}} wet woodland {{including the}} [...] "mangrove swamp") with goat willow, grey willow, and some crack willow, with hybrids. The shrubs and field layer {{are similar to}} compartment 1; there is some honeysuckle and common horsetail, hemlock water dropwort, gypsywort, yellow flag, <b>pendulous</b> sedge.|$|E
500|$|The Picardy Spaniel has {{no known}} {{hereditary}} health problems, {{and has an}} average lifespan of 14 years. However being a hunting spaniel, the breed is prone to ear infections.

500|$|In a {{comparison}} test {{published in the}} CAR March 1994 issue the testers liked the [...] "sheer blistering pace, looks and a superb cabin" [...] but its size, the doors not opening far enough and handling were criticised: [...] "If there's a more evil device on our roads, I wouldn't like to find it, for the XJ220 suffers from immense initial understeer followed by violent and snappy <b>pendulous</b> oversteer." ...|$|E
500|$|The King Charles has large dark eyes, a short nose, a high domed {{head and}} a line of black skin around the mouth. On average, it stands [...] at the withers, with a small but compact body. The breed has a {{traditionally}} docked tail. It has the long <b>pendulous</b> ears typical of a spaniel and its coat comes in four varieties, [...] trait it shares with its offshoot, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.|$|E
500|$|Minnie's {{paintings}} {{include two}} main design themes. The first is free-flowing and parallel lines in a <b>pendulous</b> outline, depicting the body painting designs used in women's ceremonies, or awelye. The second theme involves circular shapes, used to symbolise bush tomato (Solanum chippendalei), bush melon, and northern wild orange (Capparis umbonata), {{among a number}} of forms of bushfood represented in her works. Together, the designs were characterised by one reviewer as [...] "broad, luminescent flowing lines and circles".|$|E
500|$|The breed has short legs, with an {{elongated}} body. Unusually among Scottish terrier breeds, it has <b>pendulous</b> ears. The neck is muscular, having {{developed from the}} breed's use against larger game. The typical height at the withers is , and they can weigh anywhere between [...] While the Dandie generally is a hardy breed, it may have issue climbing stairs. They have a silky coat which forms a topknot {{on top of the}} dog's head. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier has a similar body shape to the Skye Terrier, but the Skye's coat is thicker and longer.|$|E
500|$|On June 17, 1825, an {{expedition}} from HMS Blonde, led by botanist James Macrae, reached {{the summit of}} Mauna Kea. Macrae {{was the first person}} to record the Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense), saying: [...] "The last mile was destitute of vegetation except one plant of the Sygenisia tribe, in growth much like a Yucca, with sharp pointed silver coloured leaves and green upright spike of three or four feet producing <b>pendulous</b> branches with brown flowers, truly superb, and almost worth the journey of coming here to see it on purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|Aloe vera is a {{stemless}} or very short-stemmed plant {{growing to}} 60–100cm (24–39in) tall, spreading by offsets. The leaves are thick and fleshy, green to grey-green, with some varieties showing white flecks on their {{upper and lower}} stem surfaces. The margin of the leaf is serrated and has small white teeth. The flowers are produced in summer on a spike up to [...] tall, each flower being <b>pendulous,</b> with a yellow tubular corolla 2–3cm (0.8–1.2in) long. Like other Aloe species, Aloe vera forms arbuscular mycorrhiza, a symbiosis that allows the plant better access to mineral nutrients in soil.|$|E
500|$|The leaves have short slender stalks and are [...] long, {{triangular}} with broad, untoothed, wedge-shaped bases, slender pointed {{tips and}} coarsely double-toothed, serrated margins. They are sticky with resin {{at first but}} this dries as they age leaving small white scales. The foliage is a pale to medium green and turns yellow early in the autumn before the leaves fall. In mid-summer, the female catkins mature and the male catkins expand and release pollen, and wind pollination takes place. The small 1 to 2mm winged seeds ripen in late summer on <b>pendulous,</b> cylindrical catkins [...] long and [...] broad. The seeds are very numerous and are separated by scales, and when ripe, the whole catkin disintegrates and the seeds are spread widely by the wind.|$|E
