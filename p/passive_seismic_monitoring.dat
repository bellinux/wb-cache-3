40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{is now a}} {{standard}} tool to follow the evolution of hydrocarbon, geothermal as well as CO 2 geological storage reservoirs. Despite the fact that large volumes of data have already been acquired {{in one of the}} contexts just mentioned, our understanding of the relation of the microseismicity to the hydraulic fracture geometry is still very poor. Very precise location of seismicity is the first step to better understand and delineate hydraulic fracture geometry. Among many factors that contribute to microseismic location errors, the largest contribution is {{due to the lack of}} knowledge of the wave-propagation medium. Precise location of hypocenters requires a very accurate P and S velocity model, the calibration of this model is a difficult task but cannot be neglected. In addition, this required calibration/inversion of the velocities is a totally non-linear problem; taking into account this difficulty we developed a non-linear (Monte Carlo) tomographic inversion algorithm. This paper presents our non-linear calibration algorithm that updates the P and S velocity model in the context of <b>Passive</b> <b>Seismic</b> <b>Monitoring.</b> Furthermore the uncertainties associated to the velocity model are computed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn January 2010, an {{integrated}} CO 2 Capture and Storage (CCS) project, including CO 2 capture, transportation and geological storage {{started in the}} Lacq-Rousse area, Southwest of France. Until March 2013, 51 thousands metric tons of CO 2 were injected into a fractured dolomitic depleted gas reservoir at around 4500 -m depth. Key objectives of the project were to develop, test, and validate the methodology and the technology required for managing safely such storage operations, and in particular to define an “optimal” monitoring program, economically and technically viable. A monitoring plan was designed, including the deployment of a hybrid multi-scale <b>passive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> network to address 3 monitoring objectives: watch seal integrity, distinguish natural seismicity from induced seismicity, and assess injection-induced seismicity. A near-surface network (Master Network), and a downhole array deployed in the injection well (Research Network), were installed between 2009 and 2011. In addition, detection of regional seismicity was also available through a seismometer. Data have been collected for 9 months prior to injection, during injection, and also after injection, {{as part of the}} post-injection monitoring program planned for 3 years. Starting from March 2011, as per end July 2014, the hybrid system allowed detecting about 2500 events. Over two third of those events were not energetic enough to be located. Over 600 events, with estimated magnitudes above - 2. 3 and not exceeding - 0. 5 were located in the reservoir. The monitoring therefore helped in concluding that the CO 2 injection did not generate an adverse impact on reservoir integrity. Actual network performances have been in line with expectations. The effective Master Network location sensitivity is about magnitude - 0. 6 (completeness magnitude) in the volume of interest, confirming its ability to serve for an efficient seismic hazard monitoring. In this paper we show how the proper design of a passive seismic network consistent with the monitoring plan can benefit the different phases of a CCS project, and how <b>passive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> during the full duration of the injection can bring reliable evidence for reservoir integrity. The paper concludes that <b>passive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> with a limited number of near-surface sensors constitutes an effective alarm network. In addition <b>passive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> can provide a permanent seismic risk evaluation tool by continuously comparing seismic activity with the energy input into the reservoir. This second type of application is certainly not necessary for most oil and gas development, but it may constitute a precise element of monitoring if seismic hazards need to be closely monitored...|$|E

40|$|Geomechanical and {{geophysical}} monitoring are {{the techniques}} which can {{complement each other}} and provide enhancement in the solutions of many problems of geotechnical engineering. One {{of the most promising}} geophysical techniques is <b>passive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The essence of the technique is recording the acoustic signals produced in the subsurface, either naturally or in response to human activity. The acoustic signals are produced by mechanical displacements on the contacts of structural elements (e. g., faults, boundaries of rock blocks, natural and induced fractures). The process can be modeled by modern numerical techniques developed in geomechanics. The report discusses a study that was aimed at the unification of the <b>passive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> and numerical modeling for the monitoring of the hydraulic fracture propagation. The approach adopted in the study consisted of numerical modeling of the seismicity accompanying hydraulic fracture propagation and defining seismic attributes and patterns characterizing the process and fracture parameters. Numerical experiments indicated that the spatial distribution of seismic events is correlated to geometrical parameters of hydrofracture. Namely, the highest density of the events is observed along fracture contour, and projection of the events to the fracture plane makes this effect most pronounced. The numerical experiments also showed that dividing the totality of the events into groups corresponding to the steps of fracture propagation allows for reconstructing the geometry of the resulting fracture more accurately than has been done in the majority of commercial applications...|$|E

We discuss the possibility of using the Source Independent Converted Phase Imaging method to image the position in the subsurface where these phases have been generated. We examine the limitations of that method for imaging the position of shallow interfaces such as the ones at Groningen. The station spacing required to apply the imaging method to the data is shown to correlate well with the estimated Fresnel Zone dimension for the interface depth and data frequency. By using a kinematic version of the Source Independent Converted Phase Imaging Condition, we can map those interfaces.

40|$|Many {{of the key}} {{processes}} governing fast glacier flow involve {{interaction between}} a glacier and its basal hydrological system, which is hidden from direct observation. <b>Passive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> has shown promise {{as a tool for}} remotely monitoring basal processes, but lack of glacier-bed access prevents clear understanding of the relationships between subglacial processes and corresponding seismic emissions. Here we describe direct measurements of basal hydrology, sliding, and broadband seismicity made in a unique subglacial facility in Norway during the onset of two summer melt seasons. In the most pronounced of these episodes, rapid delivery of surface meltwater to the bed briefly enhanced basal slip following a period of elevated high-frequency seismic activity related to surface crevassing. Subsequent ground tilt derived from ultralong-period seismic signals was associated with subglacial bedrock deformation during transient pressurization of the basal hydraulic system. These signals are interpreted to represent hydraulic jacking as the supply of water to the bed exceeded the capacity of the hydraulic system. Enhanced slip terminated 2. 5 h after it started, when ice-bed decoupling or increased connectivity in the basal cavity network relieved cavity overpressure. The results support theoretical models for hydraulic jacking and illustrate how melt-induced increases in speed can be short lived if cavity growth or ice-bed decoupling allows basal water more efficient drainage...|$|E

Geophysical monitoring methods are sensitive to subsurface changes that result from injection of CO 2 and will be used for: (1) tracking the spatial extent of the free phase CO 2 plume, (2) monitoring advancement of the pressure front, (3) identifying or mapping areas where induced seismicity occurs, and (4) identifying and mapping regions of increased risk for brine or CO 2 leakage from the reservoir.

This paper demonstrates a workflow that integrates Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) simulation with Tomographic Fracture Imaging ™ (TFI), a <b>passive</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> method (Geiser et al, 2012; Lacazette et al, 2013). DFN models are {{built at the}} level of detail of individual fractures using information resolved using the TFI approach.

This paper shows examples of DFN simulations that predict frac propagation and reactivation of natural fractures by hydro-shearing and hydrojacking. By tracking fracture propagation and reactivation, the simulator produced hydraulic fracture fields that can be compared to and calibrated with observed TFIs. This process provides confidence in both the Stimulated Rock Volume (SRV) and Tributary Drainage Volume (TDV) determined for the fracture treatment. The distinction between SRV and TDV is important, because induced hydraulic fractures and natural fracture reactivation can produce seismic activity in a larger volume than actually contributes production. Also, natural fractures can contribute to production from regions outside the SRV if hydraulic fractures effectively connect the well to the natural fracture network. The calibrated simulations of TDVs provide a basis for improved frac designs, well-test analyses and production forecasts. ...|$|E
