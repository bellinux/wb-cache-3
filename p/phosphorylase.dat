5|$|In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This poly(A) tail {{promotes}} degradation by the degradosome, {{which contains}} two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase</b> and RNase E. Polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase</b> binds to the 3' end of RNAs and the 3' extension {{provided by the}} poly(A) tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3' end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation and degradation of the 3' end by polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase</b> allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The poly(A) tail can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.|$|E
5|$|While many {{bacteria}} and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, {{they also have}} another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase</b> itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria, mitochondria, plastids and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea that have an exosome). It can synthesise a 3' extension where {{the vast majority of}} the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase</b> promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.|$|E
5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of <b>phosphorylase,</b> the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating <b>phosphorylase.</b> Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E
5|$|The {{most ancient}} polyadenylating enzyme is polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase.</b> This enzyme {{is part of}} both the {{bacterial}} degradosome and the archaeal exosome, two closely related complexes that recycle RNA into nucleotides. This enzyme degrades RNA by attacking the bond between the 3'-most nucleotides with a phosphate, breaking off a diphosphate nucleotide. This reaction is reversible, and so the enzyme can also extend RNA with more nucleotides. The heteropolymeric tail added by polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase</b> is very rich in adenine. The choice of adenine is most likely the result of higher ADP concentrations than other nucleotides {{as a result of}} using ATP as an energy currency, making it more likely to be incorporated in this tail in early lifeforms. It has been suggested that the involvement of adenine-rich tails in RNA degradation prompted the later evolution of polyadenylate polymerases (the enzymes that produce poly(A) tails with no other nucleotides in them).|$|E
5|$|Research on RNA {{has led to}} many {{important}} biological discoveries and numerous Nobel Prizes. Nucleic acids were discovered in 1868 by Friedrich Miescher, who called the material 'nuclein' since it {{was found in the}} nucleus. It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain nucleic acids. The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939. Severo Ochoa won the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with Arthur Kornberg) after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory. However, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa (polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase)</b> was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not RNA synthesis. In 1956 Alex Rich and David Davies hybridized two separate strands of RNA to form the first crystal of RNA whose structure could be determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
25|$|Glycogen <b>Phosphorylase</b> Isoenzyme BB-(GPBB) is {{an early}} marker of cardiac {{ischemia}} {{and is one of}} three isoenzyme of Glycogen <b>Phosphorylase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Phosphoprotein {{phosphatase}} {{is activated}} by the hormone insulin, {{which indicates that}} there is a high concentration of glucose in the blood. The enzyme then acts to dephosphorylate other enzymes, such as <b>phosphorylase</b> kinase, glycogen <b>phosphorylase,</b> and glycogen synthase. This leads to <b>phosphorylase</b> kinase and glycogen phosphorylase's becoming inactive, while glycogen synthase is activated. As a result, glycogen synthesis is increased and glycogenolysis is decreased, and the net effect is for energy to enter and be stored inside the cell.|$|E
25|$|Glucose is {{the major}} energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their {{monomers}} (glycogen <b>phosphorylase</b> removes glucose residues from glycogen). Disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} fasting state, {{cortisol}} stimulates gluconeogenesis (the formation of glucose), and activates antistress and anti-inflammatory pathways. Cortisol also plays an important, but indirect, role in liver and muscle glycogenolysis, the breaking down of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose. This is done through its passive influence on glucagon. Additionally, cortisol facilitates the activation of glycogen <b>phosphorylase,</b> which {{is necessary for}} epinephrine {{to have an effect}} on glycogenolysis.|$|E
25|$|After a meal {{has been}} digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin {{secretion}} is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When {{it is needed}} for energy, glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. Glycogen <b>phosphorylase</b> is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is {{the primary source of}} blood glucose used {{by the rest of the}} body for fuel.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} forms of arsenic that can enter the body, arsenic (III) and arsenic (V). Arsenic (III) enters the cells though aquaporins 7 and 9, which {{is a type of}} aquaglyceroporin. Arsenic (V) {{compounds}} use phosphate transporters to enter cells. The arsenic (V) can be converted to arsenic (III) by the enzyme purine nucleoside <b>phosphorylase.</b> This is classified as a bioactivation step, as although arsenic (III) is more toxic, it is more readily methylated.|$|E
25|$|G6P, {{the product}} of glucokinase, is the {{principal}} substrate of glycogen synthesis, and glucokinase has a close functional and regulatory association with glycogen synthesis. When maximally active, GK and glycogen synthase appears to {{be located in the}} same peripheral areas of hepatocyte cytoplasm in which glycogen synthesis occurs. The supply of G6P affects the rate of glycogen synthesis not only as the primary substrate, but by direct stimulation of glycogen synthase and inhibition of glycogen <b>phosphorylase.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{molecule}} {{that allows}} the genetic material to be realized as a protein was first hypothesized by François Jacob and Jacques Monod. Severo Ochoa won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for developing a process for synthesizing RNA in vitro with polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase,</b> which was useful for cracking the genetic code. RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase was established in vitro by several laboratories by 1965; however, the RNA synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested {{the existence of an}} additional factor needed to terminate transcription correctly.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{needed to}} perform short lasting, high {{intensity}} bursts of activity {{is derived from}} anaerobic metabolism within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to aerobic respiration which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen {{is required for the}} resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via glycogen <b>phosphorylase</b> into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic condition is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. Lastly, adenylate kinase catalyzes a reaction by which 2 ADP are combined to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This reaction takes place during low energy situations such as extreme exercise or conditions of hypoxia, but is not a significant source of energy. The creation of AMP resulting from this reaction stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) which is the energy sensor of the cell. After sensing low energy conditions, AMP kinase stimulates various other intracellular enzymes geared towards increasing energy supply and decreasing all anabolic, or energy requiring, cell functions.|$|E
500|$|Gerty Cori and {{her husband}} Carl Ferdinand Cori won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 in {{recognition}} of their work on enzymes. [...] They made several discoveries critical to understanding carbohydrate metabolism, including the isolation and discovery of the Cori ester, glucose-1 phosphate, and {{the understanding of the}} Cori cycle. [...] They determined that the enzyme <b>phosphorylase</b> catalyzes formation of glucose 1-phosphate, which is the beginning and ending step in the conversions of glycogen into glucose and blood glucose to glycogen. Gerty Cori was also the first to show that a defect in an enzyme can be the cause of a human genetic disease. The Beckman DU spectrophotometer was used in the Cori laboratory to calculate enzyme concentrations, including <b>phosphorylase.</b>|$|E
500|$|They {{continued}} their collaboration at Washington University. While working with minced frog muscle, they discovered an intermediate compound that enabled {{the breakdown of}} glycogen, called glucose 1-phosphate, {{now known as the}} Cori ester. They established the compound's structure, identified the enzyme <b>phosphorylase</b> that catalyzed its chemical formation, and showed that the Cori ester is the beginning step in the conversion of the carbohydrate glycogen into glucose (large amounts of which are found in the liver). It can also be the last step in the conversion of blood glucose to glycogen, as it is a reversible step. Gerty Cori also studied glycogen storage disease, identifying at least four forms, each related to a particular enzymatic defect. [...] She was the first to show that a defect in an enzyme can be the cause of a human genetic disease.|$|E
2500|$|In liver cells, {{adrenaline}} binds to the β adrenergic receptor, which changes conformation {{and helps}} Gs, a G protein, exchange GDP to GTP. This trimeric G protein dissociates to Gs alpha and Gs beta/gamma subunits. Gs alpha binds to adenyl cyclase, thus converting ATP into cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP binds to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A: Protein kinase A phosphorylates <b>phosphorylase</b> kinase. Meanwhile, Gs beta/gamma binds to the calcium channel and allows calcium ions {{to enter the}} cytoplasm. Calcium ions bind to calmodulin proteins, a protein present in all eukaryotic cells, which then binds to <b>phosphorylase</b> kinase and finishes its activation. <b>Phosphorylase</b> kinase phosphorylates glycogen <b>phosphorylase,</b> which then phosphorylates glycogen and converts it to glucose-6-phosphate.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956 Edwin Krebs and Edmond Fischer {{discovered}} that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) {{is required for}} the conversion of glycogen <b>phosphorylase</b> b to glycogen <b>phosphorylase</b> a. While investigating the action of adrenaline on glycogenolysis the next year, Sutherland and Walter Wosilait reported that inorganic phosphate is released when the enzyme liver <b>phosphorylase</b> is inactivated; but when it is activated, it incorporates a phosphate. The “active factor” that the hormones produced [...] was finally purified in 1958, and then identified as containing a ribose, a phosphate, and an adenine in equal ratios. Further, it was proved that this factor reverted to 5’-AMP when it was inactivated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{understanding}} {{of the concept of}} second messengers, and in particular the role of cyclic nucleotides and their ability to relay physiological signals to a cell, has its origins in the research of glycogen metabolism by Carl and Gerty Cori, for which they were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947. [...] A number of incremental but important discoveries through the 1950s added to their research, primarily focusing on the activity of glycogen <b>phosphorylase</b> in dog liver. [...] Glycogen <b>phosphorylase</b> catalyzes the first step in glycogenolysis, the process of breaking glycogen into its substituent glucose parts. [...] Earl Sutherland investigated the effect of the hormones adrenaline and glucagon on glycogen <b>phosphorylase,</b> earning him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971.|$|E

2500|$|RNAP was [...] {{discovered}} independently by Charles Loe, Audrey Stevens, and Jerard Hurwitz in 1960. By this time, {{one half}} of [...] the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine had been awarded to Severo Ochoa for the discovery of what {{was believed to be}} RNAP, but instead turned out to be polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase.</b>|$|E
2500|$|AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in {{skeletal}} muscle by phosphorylating [...] Rab-GTPase-activating protein TBC1D1, which ultimately induces fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane. [...] AMPK stimulates glycolysis by activating phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2/3 and activating phosphorylation of glycogen <b>phosphorylase,</b> and it [...] inhibits glycogen synthesis through inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. [...] In the liver, AMPK inhibits gluconeogenesis by inhibiting transcription factors including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2).|$|E
2500|$|When {{the body}} needs glucose for energy, {{glycogen}} <b>phosphorylase,</b> {{with the help}} of an orthophosphate, can cleave away a molecule from the glycogen chain. [...] The cleaved molecule is in the form of glucose-1-phosphate, which can be converted into G6P by phosphoglucomutase. [...] Next, the phosphoryl group on G6P can be cleaved by glucose-6-phosphatase so that a free glucose can be formed. [...] This free glucose can pass through membranes and can enter the bloodstream to travel to other places in the body.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} work in RNA {{structural biology}} coincided, more or less, {{with the work}} being done on DNA in the early 1950s. [...] In their seminal 1953 paper, Watson and Crick suggested that van der Waals crowding by the 2`OH group of ribose would preclude RNA from adopting a double helical structure identical to the model they proposed - {{what we now know}} as B-form DNA. This provoked questions about the three-dimensional structure of RNA: could this molecule form some type of helical structure, and if so, how? [...] As with DNA, early structural work on RNA centered around isolation of native RNA polymers for fiber diffraction analysis. [...] In part because of heterogeneity of the samples tested, early fiber diffraction patterns were usually ambiguous and not readily interpretable. [...] In 1955, Marianne Grunberg-Manago and colleagues published a paper describing the enzyme polynucleotide <b>phosphorylase,</b> which cleaved a phosphate group from nucleotide diphosphates to catalyze their polymerization. This discovery allowed researchers to synthesize homogenous nucleotide polymers, which they then combined to produce double stranded molecules. [...] These samples yielded the most readily interpretable fiber diffraction patterns yet obtained, suggesting an ordered, helical structure for cognate, double stranded RNA that differed from that observed in DNA. [...] These results paved the way for a series of investigations into the various properties and propensities of RNA. [...] Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, numerous papers were published on various topics in RNA structure, including RNA-DNA hybridization, triple stranded RNA, and even small-scale crystallography of RNA di-nucleotides - G-C, and A-U - in primitive helix-like arrangements.

5000|$|Glycogen <b>phosphorylase</b> {{is one of}} the <b>phosphorylase</b> enzymes (...) [...] Glycogen <b>phosphorylase</b> catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycogenolysis {{in animals}} by {{releasing}} glucose-1-phosphate from the terminal alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond.

50|$|<b>Phosphorylase</b> a and <b>phosphorylase</b> b each {{exist in}} two forms a T (tense) {{inactive}} state and R (relaxed) state. <b>Phosphorylase</b> b is normally in the T state, inactive {{due to the}} physiological presence of ATP and Glucose 6 phosphate, and <b>Phosphorylase</b> a is normally in the R state (active).|$|E
5000|$|PP1 plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{regulation}} of blood-glucose levels in the liver and glycogen metabolism. PP1 is important to the reciprocal regulation of glycogen metabolism by ensuring the opposite regulation of glycogen breakdown and glycogen synthesis. <b>Phosphorylase</b> a serves as a glucose sensor in liver cells. When glucose levels are low, <b>phosphorylase</b> a in its active R state has PP1 bound tightly. This binding to <b>phosphorylase</b> a prevents any phosphatase activity of PP1 and maintains the active phosphorylated configuration. Therefore, there <b>phosphorylase</b> a will accelerate glycogen breakdown until adequate levels of glucose are achieved.
