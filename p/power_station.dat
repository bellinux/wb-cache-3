5|$|Drax <b>power</b> <b>station</b> {{is a large}} {{coal-fired}} <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in North Yorkshire, England, {{capable of}} co-firing biomass and petcoke, and its name comes from the nearby village of Drax. It is situated on the River Ouse between Selby and Goole. Its generating capacity of 3,960megawatts is the highest of any <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in the United Kingdom (and second-highest in Western Europe, after 4,200MW Neurath <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> in Germany), providing about 7% of the United Kingdom's electricity supply.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the 48MW Kohtla-Järve Power Station– {{the first}} <b>power</b> <b>station</b> {{in the world}} to use {{pulverised}} oil shale at an industrial scale– was commissioned, followed by the 72.5MW Ahtme <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> in 1951. To ensure sufficient electricity supply in Estonia, Latvia and north-west Russia, the Balti <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> (1,430MW) and the Eesti <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> (1,610MW) were built, the former between 1959 and 1971 and the latter between 1969 and 1973. The stations, collectively known as the Narva Power Stations, are the world's two largest oil shale-fired power stations. In 1988 Moscow-based authorities planned a third oil shale-fired <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in Narva with a capacity of 2,500MW, together with a new mine at Kuremäe. The plan, disclosed {{at the time of the}} Phosphorite War and the Singing Revolution, met with strong local opposition and was never implemented.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1959 to {{coincide}} with the Hunterston A nuclear <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in Ayrshire. Cruachan uses cheap off-peak electricity generated at night to pump water to the higher reservoir, which can then be released during the day to provide power as necessary. The <b>power</b> <b>station</b> is open to visitors, and around 50,000 tourists visit it each year.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The {{stations}} were built during {{a period in which}} there were great advances in <b>power</b> <b>station</b> technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> came into full operation in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000homes.|$|E
5|$|Dunston <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> {{refers to}} a pair of {{adjacent}} coal-fired power stations in the North East of England, now demolished. They were built on the south bank of the River Tyne, in the western outskirts of Dunston in Gateshead. The two stations were built on a site which is now occupied by the MetroCentre. The first <b>power</b> <b>station</b> built on the site was known as Dunston A <b>Power</b> <b>Station,</b> and the second, which gradually replaced it between 1933 and 1950, was known as Dunston B <b>Power</b> <b>Station.</b> The A Station was, in its time, {{one of the largest in}} the country, and as well as burning coal had early open cycle gas turbine units. The B Station was the first of a new <b>power</b> <b>station</b> design, and stood as a landmark in the Tyne for over 50years. From the A Station's opening in 1910 until the B Station's demolition in 1986, they collectively operated from the early days of electricity generation in the United Kingdom, through the industry's nationalisation, and until a decade before its privatisation.|$|E

5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth <b>power</b> <b>station</b> is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Its {{construction}} {{was linked to}} that of Hunterston A nuclear <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> to store surplus night-time nuclear generated electrical energy.

2500|$|Commercial {{electric}} utility <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are usually constructed {{on a large}} scale and designed for continuous operation. Virtually all Electric <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> use three-phase [...] electrical generators to produce alternating current (AC) electric power at a frequency of 50Hz or 60 Hz. Large companies or institutions may have their own <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> to supply heating or electricity to their facilities, especially if steam is created anyway for other purposes. [...] Steam-driven <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> have been used to drive most ships in most of the 20th century until recently. Steam <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are now only used in large nuclear naval ships. Shipboard <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> usually directly couple the turbine to the ship's propellers through gearboxes. <b>Power</b> <b>stations</b> in such ships also provide steam to smaller turbines driving electric generators to supply electricity. [...] Nuclear marine propulsion is, with few exceptions, used only in naval vessels. [...] There have been many turbo-electric ships in which a steam-driven turbine drives an electric generator which powers an electric motor for propulsion.|$|R
