25|$|When {{a mother}} commits neonaticide, killing an infant younger than 24 hours old, the child's birth being {{the result of}} rape is a main cause, {{although}} other psychological and situational factors are generally present. Some <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> to drugs or alcohol to cope with emotional trauma after a rape; use of these during pregnancy can harm the fetus.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} pillars of REBT is that irrational and {{dysfunctional}} ways and patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving are contributing to much, though hardly all, human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset.|$|E
25|$|Zimbardo's book, The Lucifer Effect, {{gets its}} title from the {{metamorphosis}} of Lucifer into Satan. Though the Christian Scriptures {{do not make}} this claim, according to the Biblical account, Lucifer was once God's favorite angel until he challenged God's authority and was cast into Hell {{with all the other}} fallen angels. Thus, Zimbardo derives this title to explain how good <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> evil. Zimbardo's main assumption on why good people do terrible things is due to situational influences and power given from authority.|$|E

25|$|In 1954 Leon Festinger, a {{well known}} social psychologist, {{presented}} his influential social comparison theory, which proposes that people seek to obtain accurate self-evaluations by comparing themselves to similar others. Furthermore, <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> to their social environment {{to search for}} clarification when faced with obscure or confusing environmental situations or sensations. Thus extending this theory to emotions would posit that after experiencing emotional situations that {{do not conform to}} held expectations or that are ambiguous, one would be expected to later share that emotional experience with others.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of the 99 {{responses}} to the survey show that the library {{is one of the}} last places that transgender <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> for information due to lack up to date health information, or an unwelcoming environment. Library collections meant to support the needs of transgender individuals were generally less comprehensive than those serving their gay and lesbian counterparts. The authors found that librarians should do more outreach to transgender communities to communicate a message of welcome, and that the internet could be a potentially powerful tool for outreach to these underrepresented populations.|$|E
25|$|Early {{identification}} and treatment results in less chance to spread disease, {{and for some}} conditions may improve the outcomes of treatment. There is often a window period after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period, the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test. Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional. One report indicated that <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> to the Internet rather than to a medical professional for information on STIs to a higher degree than for other sexual problems.|$|E

25|$|The series cast became {{stars in}} Australia and {{had their own}} Number 96 Passenger train, {{specially}} designed for cast and crew travel which for the show's first few years they would take the train from Sydney to Melbourne for the annual TV Week Logie Awards in a multi-carriaged train with the Commissioner's carriage hooked up at the rear for VIPS. This train was specially-organised by Publicity Director Tom Greer. Whistle stops at country sidings saw thousands of <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> out to see their favourite stars. These whistle stops were all beamed back by country television stations and went live to air.|$|E
25|$|This {{elected and}} en-stooled chief enjoys a great majestic {{ceremony}} {{to this day}} with much spectacle and celebration. He reigns with much despotic power, including {{the ability to make}} judgments of life and death on his subjects. However, he does not enjoy absolute rule. Upon the stool, the Chief is sacred, the holy intermediary between people and ancestors. His powers theoretically are more apparent than real. His powers hinge on his attention to the advice and decisions of the Council of Elders. The chief can be impeached, de-stooled, if the Elders and the <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> against him. He can be reduced to man, subject to derision for his failure.|$|E
25|$|The use by {{marketers}} {{of customer}} {{information has been}} criticized. In the United States, there has been widespread community anger against telemarketers {{which led to the}} United States National Do Not Call Registry (2003). Similar issues have been raised in other countries leading to setting up of Do not call lists, such as Canada's National Do Not Call List (2004), and Australia's Do Not Call Register (2006). Some people also object to the display of caller ID on the called party's phone, especially if this finishes being used for commercial purposes by the recipient or sold on to a third party. Some <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> off the caller ID feature on their phone.|$|E

25|$|The Duck Race is {{a long-running}} {{event in the}} village. It is held each year, on the May Day bank holiday. Entrants pay a small fee (usually £1) to enter their 'duck' into the race. The duck has to travel along the river Darent from the war {{memorial}} in the village, to the bridge before the old Mill. A 'duck' can be anything from a shop-bought rubber duck to a model made by the entrant(s). Actual ducks are forbidden. It is a large event {{in the village and}} several hundred <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> out each year to line the riverbanks and watch. Anyone can enter and there is a prize for the 'Best Duck in Show' (awarded before the race begins) and the 'First placed Duck.' The money raised goes towards charitable organisations in the village.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge has a nasty {{temper and}} rarely hesitates to use cartoon {{violence}} {{against those who}} provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to-door salesmen); however, {{he seems to be}} against the use of lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this is to save himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in fairy tales do bad <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word—never breaking a promise once given. In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions.|$|E

It's this neat paradox that makes millions of <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> away from the three big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons." [...] Tucker would also describe the show as a [...] "pop-cultural phenomenon, a prime-time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family." ...|$|E

Usually the picture is hung high on the wall so you have to crane your neck backward, looking up toward her feet.

500|$|Electricity and gas {{companies}} rely on weather forecasts {{to anticipate}} demand, {{which can be}} strongly affected by the weather. They use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating (heating degree day) or cooling (cooling degree day). These quantities {{are based on a}} daily average temperature of [...] Cooler temperatures force heating degree days (one per degree Fahrenheit), while warmer temperatures force cooling degree days. In winter, severe cold weather can cause a surge in demand as <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> up their heating. Similarly, in summer a surge in demand can be linked with the increased use of air conditioning systems in hot weather. By anticipating a surge in demand, utility companies can purchase additional supplies of power or natural gas before the price increases, or in some circumstances, supplies are restricted through the use of brownouts and blackouts.|$|E

500|$|To the Griffins' (mainly Lois') surprise, many <b>people</b> <b>turn</b> up for {{the first}} worship service, much to the {{annoyance}} of Brian, who dislikes the idea that Peter is a religious leader (likely due to Brian being an atheist). In order to stop Peter from continuing his new religion, Brian joins forces with Francis {{to find a way to}} deter people from worshiping the Fonz. Three representatives from other religions show up to the services of the Church of the Fonz. The first informs people that he has formed the Church of George Jefferson (from All in the Family) and a good portion of the congregation leaves with him. The second claims to have created the Church of Captain Stubing (from The Love Boat) and another chunk of the congregation leaves with him. The third person is Kirk Cameron and Peter assumes that Cameron is there to announce the formation of the Church of Mike Seaver (Cameron's character on Growing Pains), but Cameron lets him know that he's only here to convert people back to Christianity and the remainder of the congregation leaves with him. Back at home, Lois comforts Peter, who is upset at the failure of his Church, by telling him that if his church embraced the Fonz's values of friendship, it is worthwhile, but Peter highly doubts it and Peter converts back to Christianity, however the scene shifts and Francis is shown looking at a picture of the Fonz, puts it down on a table, gets on his knees as if to pray, and claps to the beat of [...] "Rock Around the Clock" [...] as the episode ends.|$|E
