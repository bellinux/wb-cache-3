5|$|In {{the wake}} of the NATO attacks, the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>government</b> refused to attend the Bonn conference {{scheduled}} on 5 December 2011. The event in Bonn, Germany is an important international conference on Afghanistan. International pressure over Pakistan amounted as it refused to attend the Bonn conference. Secretary Hillary Clinton contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister but her plea was rejected because Pakistani public opinion prohibited attendance. The conference was generally regarded as a disappointment, partially because of Pakistan's absence.|$|E

By 10 July, the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>government</b> reported that 100 militants and between 300 and 400 women and children remained inside the mosque.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{came under}} intense {{international}} scrutiny after the raid. The <b>Pakistani</b> <b>government</b> denied {{that it had}} sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009. The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After the raid, there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine {{the wreckage of the}} crashed helicopter.|$|E

After exchanging fire with Pakistani troops, students set fire to a Ministry of Environment building near Lal Masjid.|$|E

5|$|The {{perpetrators}} conducted nighttime raids, assaulting {{women in}} their villages, often {{in front of their}} families, as part of the terror campaign. Victims aged 8 to 75 were also kidnapped and held in special camps where they were repeatedly assaulted. Many of those held in the camps were murdered or committed suicide, with some taking their own lives by using their hair to hang themselves; the soldiers responded to these suicides by cutting the women's hair off. Time magazine reported on 563 girls who had been kidnapped and held by the military; all of them were between three and five months pregnant when the military began to release them. Some women were forcibly used as prostitutes. While the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>government</b> estimated the number of rapes in the hundreds, other estimates range between 200,000 and 400,000. The <b>Pakistani</b> <b>government</b> had tried to censor reports coming out of the region, but media reports on the atrocities did reach the public worldwide, and gave rise to widespread international public support for the liberation movement.|$|E
5|$|There was {{confusion}} in the country over Keila's intensity; the IMD classified it as a cyclonic storm, while officials in Oman designated it as a deep depression, based on available observations.

5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} with the Taliban were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Government</b> and the Taliban, was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called {{for the implementation of}} Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held {{within the framework of the}} Pakistani constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Indo-Pakistani {{conflict}} was {{sparked by the}} Bangladesh Liberation war, a conflict between the traditionally dominant West Pakistanis and the majority East Pakistanis. In 1970, East Pakistanis demanded autonomy for the state, but the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>government</b> failed to satisfy these demands and, in early 1971, a demand for secession took form in East Pakistan. In March, Pakistan Armed Forces launched a fierce campaign to curb the secessionists, including the soldiers and police from East Pakistan. Thousands of East Pakistanis died, and nearly ten million refugees fled to West Bengal, an adjacent Indian state. In April, India decided {{to assist in the}} formation of the new nation of Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pakistani</b> <b>government</b> was {{severely}} criticised for its {{handling of the}} relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and in the international media. In the December national elections, the opposition Awami League gained a landslide victory, gaining 160 of the 162 East Pakistani seats. Continuing unrest between East Pakistanis and the central government trigged the Bangladesh Liberation War, which concluded {{with the creation of}} the state of Bangladesh. This {{is one of the first}} times that a natural event helped to trigger a civil war.|$|E
50|$|Following the attacks, the Indian and <b>Pakistani</b> <b>governments</b> both {{agreed to}} {{postpone}} scheduled diplomatic talks. Pakistani authorities reportedly arrested {{several members of}} Jaish-e-Muhammad, though not Masood Azhar, who was placed in protective detention. It was reported that Azhar's exact location was being kept secret to prevent any attempts by his followers to free him.|$|R
5000|$|According to Amnesty International, if a {{government}} is negligent in prosecuting perpetrators, it is liable and complicit in those abuses.

5|$|The complex was besieged from 3 to 11 July 2007, while {{negotiations}} were attempted between the militants and the state's Shujaat Hussain and Ijaz-ul-Haq. Once negotiations failed, the complex was stormed and {{captured by the}} Pakistan Army's Special Service Group. The government reported that the operation resulted in 154 deaths, and 50 militants were captured (other estimates were higher). It also prompted pro-Taliban rebels along the Afghan border to nullify a 10-month-old peace agreement with the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Government.</b> This event triggered the Third Waziristan War, which marked another surge in militancy and violence in Pakistan and has resulted in more than 3,000 casualties.|$|E
5|$|After the conflict, the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>government</b> {{decided on}} a policy of silence {{regarding}} the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E

The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly {{before the end of}} his wife's second term. He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>government</b> claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to claim that he actually was the beneficial owner. , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continues.|$|E
