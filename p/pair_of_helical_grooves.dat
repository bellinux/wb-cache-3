40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The provision <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> {{on the surface of}} a plain journal bearing can improve the stability of a rotor-bearing system. However, the improvement depends on the arrangement of the grooves along the axial length of the bearing. In order to verify this improved stability three types <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> bearing and a reference plain journal bearing were investigated. The <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> journal bearings were: a symmetrical, an asymmetrical and a partial grooved bearing. The bearing test rig was used to measure the oil flow rate, load carrying capacity, power losses, bearing surface temperatures, and stability characteristics. A theoretical model was developed to calculate the load carrying capacity, stiffness and damping coefficients, and stability characteristics of the various types of bearing. The experimental and theoretical results show that at the expense of a reduced load capacity the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> bearings are more stable particularly at low eccentricity ratios. However, the experimental observations showed that the partial <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> bearing is not a practical bearing because the bearing becomes misaligned above certain load. For a given eccentricity ratio and speed the symmetrical bearing ran hotter and with greater power losses in comparison to the other three bearings. At the same eccentricity ratio and speed, the asymmetrical bearing ran at about the same temperature as the plain journal bearing.

Focused ion sputtering is used to shape a variety of miniature cutting tools including microgrooving / threading tools. Tools are made of cobalt M 42 high speed steel or C 2 grade tungsten carbide, and have cutting widths between 10 and 30 µm. FIB sputtering is useful for shaping tools, because this numerically controlled technique reproducibly affords sub-micron dimensional resolution, different tool geometries and sharp tool cutting edges. Micro-grooving /threading tools consist of nonplanar facets with well-defined lengths and relative angles. Facets provide back rake, side rake and clearance taper behind cutting edges.

30|$|In summary, current {{studies on}} the {{finishing}} of a free-abrasive have mainly focused on improving the surface quality without involving the surface modification. In addition, current {{studies on the}} polishing of free-abrasives mainly focused on the movement and control of a single abrasive grain, and research into the different parts has been lacking. The shape and structure of a spiral groove restrict its use as a polishing tool. Therefore, the free-abrasive grain of tool-less finishing is {{an effective way to}} improve the surface quality and accuracy of the shape of a non–machined spiral groove. In this paper, the spiral groove of a revolving body is taken as the research object. A method used to make a <b>helical</b> movement <b>of</b> a workpiece, and cut and polish an abrasive grain, is proposed. The principle of the relative motion of the abrasive ball trajectory is studied. The trajectory and design helix are in concordance with a mathematical model. The grooved drum parts were polished and tested to verify that not only can the error in the shape <b>of</b> the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> be corrected but the surface roughness <b>of</b> the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> can also be reduced, and the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> <b>of</b> the rotating body can be repaired and polished, providing a theoretical basis for free-abrasive tool polishing without a modification.|$|R

The circumferentially grooved stator has a lower resistance to leakage than the 20 [*]deg and 30 [*]deg stators.

Differently from the one-helical mode spin-triplet superconductor, we find that the presence of a finite amount of electronic hybridization with the two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Majorana <b>helical</b> modes leads to nonvanishing charge current independently of the ferromagnetic exchange.
