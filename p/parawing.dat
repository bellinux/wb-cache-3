25|$|NASA {{experimented with}} the {{flexible}} Rogallo wing, which they renamed the <b>Parawing,</b> {{in order to}} evaluate it as a recovery system for the Gemini space capsules and recovery of used Saturn rocket stages. Under a directive by Paul Bikle, NASA engineer Charles Richard in 1961–1962 designed the collapsible four-tube Rogallo wing used in the Paresev. The Paresev series included wing configurations that were tightly foldable from the nose plate for easy transport, using initially a cloth sail and later one of Dacron.|$|E
25|$|The Paresev {{completed}} nearly 350 flights {{during a}} research program that ran from 1962 until 1964. Using the fully flexible <b>parawing</b> or the tube-stiffened paraglider of the Paresev 1A, 1B, 1C as an alternate to spacecraft recovery was deemed too unreliable upon unfolding so round parachutes for water landings were used instead. The Paresev and other flexible-wing {{projects such as}} the Ryan XV-8 stopped being funded by NASA on 1965. Although Rogallo wrote about, modeled, and spoke about recreational applications including hang gliding, NASA {{was not in the}} business of applying Rogallo's family of airfoils to personal aircraft such as kites, hang gliders, and powered light aircraft.|$|E

The troopers wear black uniforms consisting of police clothing/SAS Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) Wing overalls and a red Royal Military Police beret, and equipment. Insignia is a small silver-metal UNIT parawings on a red beret and a large UNIT <b>Parawing</b> patch worn over the left breast pocket on the utility vest or fatigues. Commanding officers wear [...] with UNIT insignia. Variations include Captain Magambo from [...] "Turn Left" [...] (2008) wearing a black version of service dress with a red beret, and Colonel Karim in The Sarah Jane Adventures story Death of the Doctor wearing black civilian clothes with UNIT insignia and rank epaulettes. This UNIT also includes a uniform for scientists: a lab-coat with the UNIT insignia on the chest.|$|E

5000|$|On October 4, 1957, the Russian Sputnik began beeping {{its message}} from orbit, and {{everything}} changed. The space race caught {{the imagination of}} the newly formed NASA and Rogallo was in position to seize the opportunity. The Rogallos released their patent to the government, and with Rogallo's help at the wind tunnels, NASA began a series of experiments testing the <b>Parawing</b> (NASA renamed the Rogallo wing the <b>Parawing,</b> and modern hang glider pilots often refer to it as the flexible Rogallo wing) at altitudes up to 200,000 feet and as fast as Mach 3 [...] in order to evaluate them as alternative recovery system for the Gemini space capsules and used rocket stages. By 1960, NASA had made test flights of a framed <b>Parawing</b> powered aircraft, called the [...] "flying Jeep" [...] or Fleep, and of a weight shift <b>Parawing</b> glider, called Paresev, in a series of several shapes and sizes, manned and unmanned. A key wing configuration applying Francis Rogallo's leadership that gave base to kited gliders with hung pilots using weight-shift control was designed by Charles Richards and constructed by the Richards team in 1961-2; such wing became a template for recreational use or Rogallo's inventions, ending up mechanically and ornamentally in Skiplane, ski-kites, and hang gliders of the 1960-1975.|$|E

50|$|Parachute kites:(see {{paraglider}} below) Parachutes {{that have}} a directional venting small (parasail, directional parachutes) or massive (Jalbert parafoil, Rogallo <b>parawing)</b> are kites moored to free-falling body or payload. Symmetrical, non-directional zero-lift/drag ratio parachutes are streamers and not kites; no net deflection from the stream occurs in a true parachute.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{consisted of}} a crew module designed by extending the Gemini B exterior cone to a 419-cm-diameter heat shield and a cargo propulsion module. Recovery of the crew module would be effected {{by means of a}} gliding parachute (<b>parawing).</b> The parametric analysis and point design of the <b>parawing</b> were accomplished by Northrop- Ventura Company under a subcontract, and the contents of their final report were incorporated into the document. The landing attenuation of the spacecraft would be accomplished by a skid landing gear extended {{from the bottom of the}} crew module, allowing the crew to land in an upright position. The propulsion functions of transfer, rendezvous, attitude control, and retrograde would be performed by a single liquid propellant system, and launch escape would be provided by a large Apollo-type launch escape system.|$|E

50|$|The {{best known}} design is the NASA <b>Parawing</b> or NPW. For more, see rogallo wing. This {{is a very}} simple kite with mixed performance. It has {{excellent}} pull, but is slow to maneuver and suffers from a limited wind window.Its simple construction and forgiving design make it very popular among hobbyists and some traction enthusiasts, especially ski- and sledge-borne expeditions across both Arctic and Antarctic lands, but its drawbacks make it unsuitable for high efficiency and many water-borne sports.|$|E
50|$|Today, most Rogallo {{wings are}} also {{controlled}} by changing their {{pitch and roll}} by means of shifting its center of gravity. This is done by suspending the payload from one or more points beneath the wing and then moving the pendulumed mass of the payload (pilot and things else) mass left or right or forward or aft. Several control methods were studied in NASA for Rogallo wings from 1958 through the 1960s embodied in {{different versions of the}} <b>Parawing.</b>|$|E

NASA considered Rogallo's flexible wing as an alternative recovery system for the Mercury and Gemini space capsules, and for possible use in other spacecraft landings, but the idea was dropped from Gemini in 1964 in favor of conventional parachutes.|$|E
50|$|In {{more modern}} times the British navy also used kites to haul human lookouts {{high into the}} air to see over the horizon and {{possibly}} the enemy ships, for example with the kite developed by Samuel Franklin Cody. Barrage kites were used to protect shipping during the Second World War. Kites and kytoons were used for lofting communications antenna. Submarines lofted observers in rotary kites. The Rogallo <b>parawing</b> kite and the Jalbert parafoil kite were used for governable parachutes (free-flying kites) to deliver troops and supplies.|$|E
