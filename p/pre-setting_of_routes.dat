The second weakness is that the selecting threshold is set via several rounds of experiments, which requires adjusting the parameters in different datasets.

30|$|We {{utilized}} {{a benchmark}} network intrusion dataset NSL-KDD [11]. To stimulate the domain shift, we generated training and testing datasets by sampling attacks from {{different types of}} attacks, from big category of attacks (e.g., DoS, R 2 L), and also the subcategory of attacks (i.e., 22 subtypes). We compared the proposed CeHTL with HeTL [6], {{as well as any}} other baselines, including traditional classification without transfer learning and several novel transfer learning approaches. We also evaluated the approaches on imbalanced datasets, which is common in real-world cyber attack practice. We performed sensitivity analysis by tuning parameters and using different sizes of training set. The results showed that CeHTL demonstrated the most stable results, which means that it does not rely on the <b>pre-setting</b> <b>of</b> parameters and thus is more effective in detecting unknown attacks.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel method using both Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and least mean Square {{algorithm}} (LMS) is proposed. The main parameters tap-length and tap-weight are updated using the PSO and the LMS algorithm respectively {{according to the}} value of mean square error (MSE).

Although many LMS algorithmic methods perform well under certain conditions, performance can be degrade by noise and having performance sensitivity over parameter setting. In this paper, a new concept is introduced to vary the step size based upon evolutionary programming (SSLMSEV) algorithm is described.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to study the {{feasibility}} <b>of</b> quantitatively <b>pre-setting</b> the ink key distribution on an off-set press. Presently the <b>pre-settings</b> <b>of</b> the ink keys has been left to the pressmens 2 ̆ 7 ability and experience. This, in many cases, involves much 2 ̆ 2 trial and error 2 ̆ 2 work along with lengthy makeready times. This study attempted to reduce makeready time by quantitatively pre-setting ink keys from data obtained from an estimating unit and use of a set of calibration curves. A photoelectric estimating unit was designed and constructed to read integrated densities of copy to be printed. There was one reading for each area of copy corresponding to an ink key on the press. The estimating unit consisted of a series of lenses, a photoelectric tube and a meter movement. The estimating unit yielded readings of the image area for which an ink key is responsible for the supply of ink. The press was a standard off-set type with small paper dials mounted on the face of each ink key. A series of calibration tints were printed. From these tints key settings and their estimated density values curves were generated for use in the <b>pre-setting</b> <b>of</b> the ink keys for any type of copy. Through one test it was found that there are many ways to have the ink keys set and still have the job within specifications. The reasons for this are explained within. Sample copy was read using the estimating unit. Through a series of steps predicted ink key settings were found. This copy was then printed using the ink key pre-settings. All press runs were evaluated to determine whether or not the pre-settings were producing printed copy within specifications. One hundred and ten possible ink key pre-settings were attempted. The results of the study show good correlation between pre-setting ink keys and actual settings done entirely empirically. With a quantitative method pre-setting the ink distribution keys, the makeready time required will be shorter...|$|R

30|$|In this study, {{source and}} target domain data {{refers to the}} same network {{environment}} at a different time. We assumed that attacks in a source domain are already known and labeled, and attacks in a target domain are new and different than the source. We formularized the problem by using source domain data to differentiate new attacks in the target domain. Previously, we developed a transfer learning-enabled detection framework and proposed a feature-based heterogeneous transfer learning, called HeTL [6], to detect unseen variants of attacks. HeTL can find new feature representations for source and target domain by transforming them on a common latent space. Nevertheless, we observed that the performance of HeTL depended on manual <b>pre-settings</b> <b>of</b> a hyper-parameter: relevance between the source and target domain [6]. In this paper, we proposed another approach—a hierarchical transfer learning algorithm with clustering enhancement, called CeHTL, which can cluster source and target domain and compute the relevance between them.|$|R

30|$|Based on the EARTH design, five {{organizations}} {{from diverse}} sectors {{were involved in}} the course <b>pre-setting</b> <b>of</b> possible innovation collaborations between student teams and organizations. Three organizations were selected by student teams for active innovation collaboration. Reasons for both engaging and not engaging with external organizations were questioned by measuring the students’ responses to their perceived relevance of the innovation challenge(s). Approximately one half (47 %) responded positively and another half (48 %) responded negatively or indifferently to the relevancy of organizational innovation challenges. The responses were qualified with observations and dialogues with some students who expressed that they wanted to develop ideas themselves rather than participate in an already defined collaboration with an organization. This would indicate that the course provides ground for supporting self-reliance and creativity that allows for venturing beyond traditional academic frameworks rather than satisfice with constructed opportunities. However, for those students who engaged in secondary relations, these organizations were registered in competencies cards as part of the students future networks thereby indicating a measure of collaborative success.|$|R

The target function for the OPTIS programme, worked out by the programme package Microsoft Visual Basic, is selection of optimal cutting conditions from commercial databases with respect to the lowest costs of machining by taking into account the technological limitations of the metal removal process.

40|$|Background: Standard {{instructions}} for biopsy using the convex curvilinear endobronchial ultrasound scope include visualization and adjustment of the sheath housing the biopsy needle before every puncture. In our practice, we pre-set this relationship before inserting the endobronchial ultrasound scope {{and leave it}} fixed for every puncture. Objective: We postulated that this approach is more efficient than repeated re-adjustment and aimed {{to show that it}} would not increase the frequency of endobronchial ultrasound scope damage. Methods: Retrospective review of every biopsy using the endobronchial ultrasound scope over a 6 -year period with documentation of damages and costs. Results: There were 15 scope damages out of 1792 procedures (0. 8 %). Eight damages were determined to be due to needle damage, one due to patient bite, three due to Williams airway abrasions, and three were camera failures. All damages occurred during the first 5 [*]years of the study. Costs totaled US$ 138, 725, for an average of US$ 23, 120 per year. This rate of damages appears to be similar to or lower than that reported when standard instructions are followed.
