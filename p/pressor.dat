5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognized}} works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 {{with the publication of}} On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule, by the English physician Thomas Addison. In his monography, Addison described what the French physician George Trousseau would later name Addison's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations. In 1894, English physiologists George Oliver and Edward Schafer studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their <b>pressor</b> effects. In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from the adrenal cortex to treat Addison's disease. Edward Calvin Kendall, Philip Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the adrenal hormones.|$|E

These effects lasted 2–3 minutes, peaking at ~30 seconds after administration. l-Synephrine was thus the more potent enantiomer, with about 1/60x the potency of the standard <b>pressor</b> l-epinephrine in the same assay.|$|E

Average Day 1 fluids were 3.7  L (median 3.1  L), {{lowest in}} those without <b>pressors</b> (3.2  L) and highest {{in those with}} MV and septic shock (5.4  L). Hospital mortality was 16.5  % for Day 1 survivors, varying from 7.8  % in those with no MV nor <b>pressors</b> (NMNP), to 53  % among those with MV and <b>pressors</b> (MVAP). Significant associations between volume of Day 1 fluids and hospital survival was seen. Overall mortality was ca. 15  %, 19.4  % and 29.3  % for those receiving 1 - 5  L of fluid, 6  L fluid and (9 [*]+[*]L) respectively.For NMNP cases (57  %) both actual and expected mortality rates decreased with increased fluid volume (8.3  % at 1  L, 6.6  % at 9 [*]+[*]L). Patients receiving <b>pressors</b> and MV (17  %) exhibited minimal variation in expected mortality but presented with a decrease in mortality from low to middle ranges (23.2  % at 1  L to 15.7  % at 5  L) {{and an increase in}} mortality from middle to high ranges (15.7  % at 5  L to 25.4  % at 8  L). The highest severity group exhibited no change in actual or expected mortality with fluid administration. Septic shock requiring MV (13  % of cases) had no variation in mortality across the lower groups of day 1 fluid use (1  L to 5  L). However, higher ranges of 6 [*]+[*]L (38  % of the group) had increased actual mortality rates (40  % at 6  L to 45  % at 9 [*]+[*]L), higher than predicted.|$|R

25|$|Research on the catecholamines was {{interwoven}} {{with research}} on their receptors. In 1904, Dale became {{head of the}} Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratory in London and started research on ergot extracts. The relevance of his communication in 1906 ″On some physiological actions of ergot″ lies less in {{the effects of the}} extracts given alone than in their interaction with adrenaline: they reversed the normal <b>pressor</b> effect of adrenaline to a depressor effect and the normal contraction effect on the early-pregnant cat’s uterus to relaxation: adrenaline reversal. The <b>pressor</b> and uterine contraction effects of pituitary extracts, in contrast, remained unchanged, as did the effects of adrenaline on the heart and effects of parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Dale clearly saw the specificity of the ″paralytic″ (antagonist) effect of ergot for ″the so-called myoneural junctions connected with the true sympathetic or thoracic-lumbar division of the autonomic nervous system″ – the adrenoceptors. He also saw its specificity for the ″myoneural junctions″ mediating smooth muscle contraction as opposed to those mediating smooth muscle relaxation. But there he stopped. He did not conceive any close relationship between the smooth muscle-inhibitory and the cardiac sites of action of catecholamines.|$|E

Persons with {{a family history of}} hypertension manifest augmented vasoconstrictor and sympathetic responses to laboratory stressors, such as cold <b>pressor</b> testing and mental stress, that may predispose them to hypertension.

2500|$|Four isomers of {{methylphenidate}} are possible, {{since the}} molecule has two chiral centers. One pair of threo isomers and {{one pair of}} erythro are distinguished, from which primarily d-threo-methylphenidate exhibits the pharmacologically desired effects. The erythro diastereomers are <b>pressor</b> amines, a property not shared with the threo diastereomers. When the drug was first introduced it was sold as a 4:1 mixture of erythro:threo diastereomers, but it was later reformulated to contain only the threo diastereomers. [...] "TMP" [...] refers to a threo product that does not contain any erythro diastereomers, i.e. (±)-threo-methylphenidate. Since the threo isomers are energetically favored, {{it is easy to}} epimerize out any of the undesired erythro isomers.

40|$|BACKGROUND Overtreatment of {{asymptomatic}} bacteriuria (ASB) {{is widespread}} and {{may result in}} antibiotic side-effects, excess costs to the healthcare system, and may potentially trigger antimicrobial resistance. According to international management guidelines, ASB is not an indication for antibiotic treatment (with few exceptions). AIM To determine reasons for using antibiotics to treat ASB {{in the absence of}} a treatment indication. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland during 2011. We interviewed 21 internal medicine residents and attending physicians selected by purposive sampling, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Responses were analysed in an inductive thematic content approach using dedicated software (MAXQDA(®)). FINDINGS In the 21 interviews, the following thematic rationales for antibiotic overtreatment of ASB were reported (in order of reporting frequency) : (i) treating laboratory findings without taking the clinical picture into account (N =  17); (ii) psychological factors such as anxiety, overcautiousness, or anticipated positive impact on patient outcomes (N =  13); (iii) external <b>pressors</b> such as institutional culture, peer pressure, patient expectation, and excessive workload that interferes with proper decision-making (N =  9); (iv) difficulty with interpreting clinical signs and symptoms (N =  8). CONCLUSION In this qualitative study we identified both physician-centred factors (e. g. overcautiousness) and external <b>pressors</b> (e. g. excessive workload) as motivators for prescribing unnecessary antibiotics. Also, we interpreted the frequently cited practice of treating asymptomatic patients based on laboratory findings alone as lack of awareness of evidence-based best practices...|$|R

Carisoprodol (as with its metabolite meprobamate) is particularly dangerous in combination with alcohol. Flumazenil (the benzodiazepine antidote) is not effective {{in the management of}} carisoprodol overdose as carisoprodol acts at the barbiturate binding site.

[...] This is done by requiring a participant to place their hand in the cold <b>pressor</b> {{for as long as they}} can. Once pain is present, they let the researcher know. Once the pain is unbearable, the participant removes his/her hand. This provides a measure of threshold (first feeling pain) and tolerance (total time minus threshold). This method is the most frequently used application of the cold <b>pressor</b> task.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: One of {{the most}} catastrophic events {{following}} major surgery is anastomotic leak. Leak leads to sepsis and if not treated promptly, to septic shock, multiple organ failure and death. When major surgical procedures are performed, various intraoperative hemodynamic alternations may occur. These are treated by the anesthesiology team with fluid loads and/or administration of inotropes and <b>pressors.</b> The study presented here investigates {{the effect of these}} drugs on tissue perfusion and hypoxia. We will evaluate the potency of such drugs to deteriorate perfusion, thus reducing the chance of the anastomosis to heal. METHODS: This was an experimental, prospective, observational study. Eight sus scrofa landrace swine were used. Transhiatal esophagectomy was performed, followed by administration of <b>pressors</b> and inotropes in a predetermined sequence. Originally the animals were stabilized and then, dopamine and nitroglycerine were administered, each for a time period of one hour. After that, we provoked hemorrhagic shock and we resuscitated the animals with noradrenaline. Microdilaysis (CMA microdialysis, Sweden) was used to evaluate the impact of these drugs on tissue perfusion. Microdialysis is a technique that allows monitoring of cell biochemistry. With the use of a catheter that mimics capillary microcirculation, anaerobic glucolysis can be determined. Simultaneously we were monitoring arterial blood pressure and heart rate of the animals. RESULTS: Esophagectomy was feasible in all cases. We had no intraoperative complications and all animals survived the procedure. The operation provoked minor anaerobic metabolism as underlined by a minor increase in lactate to pyruvate ratio which is a marker of hypoxia. The clinical reaction to the procedure was tachycardia and hypotension. The administration of dopamine and nitroglycerine did not affect either the metabolic state or the clinical condition of the animals. However, the hemorrhagic shock and, more importantly, the administration of noradrenaline compromised perfusion to the anastomosis as recorded by an elevation on lactate to pyruvate ratio. At the same time, clinical indices such as blood pressure and heart rate were rather unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from a bedside curiosity, microdialysis is a powerful tool for oxygen metabolism monitoring. Anastomotic integrity is influenced by a variety of parameters (adequate blood supply, meticulous technique). Some are known and are being taken care of intraoperatively. Specific drugs, especially <b>pressors,</b> should be avoided in the management of intraoperative hypotension since they may compromise the blood supply of the anastomotic line. This is particularly the case with esophagectomy, where the blood supply of the graft is dependent on a single artery, the right gastroepiploic artery. ...|$|R
