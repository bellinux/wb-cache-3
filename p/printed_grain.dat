50|$|By 1960, Vox had forsaken {{the more}} {{conservative}} TV-front look for the now legendary cabinet design that has remained largely unchanged since 1960. The new cabinets featured a different covering known as fawn Rexine, which {{was a sort of}} beige leathercloth with a subtle <b>printed</b> <b>grain.</b> The front baffle was now divided by a thin gold-toned strip with the upper valence covered in fawn Rexine, and the lower grille covered in brown diamond cloth. Ventilation was provided by three small brass vents {{on the top of the}} cabinet, and the TV-front's single suitcase type handle was replaced with three leather straps.|$|E

But as θ approaches 90°, the curvature transforms into a saddle shape. Understanding this, then, the team could carefully control {{the effects of}} anisotropy and break lines of symmetry to create helicoids, ruffled profiles, and more.David Correa et al. is working with wood composite materials that change shape based on their <b>printed</b> <b>grain</b> direction and anisotropic swelling when water is absorbed. This work is 3D printed and studied on the macro scale rather than micro scale, with layer heights at fractions of millimeters rather than microns. The filament used in this research is a wood composite which is 60% co-polyester and 40% cellulose. The co-polyester binds the cellulose together while the cellulose provides the hygroscopic properties to the composite. Two methods {{have been developed for}} this kind of printing. The first method uses only the wood composite material. Designed deformation shape is printed by controlling the grain pattern, grain orientation, print layer thickness, and print layer interaction. In this method, hygroscopic bending occurs perpendicular to the grain direction. The second method uses both the wood composite as well as standard 3D printing plastics. This is an extension of the first method that introduces a separate layer of non-hygroscopic material that will not swell when exposed to water. This idea builds off of previous research of thermal bimetal  properties based on their relative expansion. Hygroscopic bending occurs only within the wood composite layers when prints of this method are exposed to water. Therefore, deformation shape is a product of both the patterning of material layers as well as the grain of the wood composite layers, offering quicker and more severe deformation than wood composite construction alone. Both methods allow their materials to deform when subject to moisture, as well as regain their shape. The quickest method observed for shape change is by fully submerging prints in warm water.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 Houghton Boston Printers {{took over}} <b>printing</b> of <b>Grain</b> magazine. This year also marked {{a change in}} Short Grain sponsorship. Cheryl and Henry Kloppenburg, Barristers and Solicitors of Saskatoon, began {{sponsoring}} the Short Grain contest, which they continue to do.|$|R

30|$|The gloss of wood is {{a unique}} texture {{compared}} to that of other materials. To express it quantitatively, two digital-image analyses were performed. One method was multiresolutional contrast analysis, which was the new method developed in this study. The other method was fractal image analysis. Twenty-four specimens, including solid woods, wood-plastic composites (WPCs), <b>printed</b> <b>grains,</b> and granites, were prepared. Digital images of specimens were obtained in five sizes and in two illuminant directions (perpendicular and parallel to the grain). The multiresolutional contrast values of perpendicular illuminated images were calculated and compared among specimens. The result of this quantitative analysis was that the gloss of wood was characterized by bright spots in a relatively small area. Using fractal analysis, the fractal dimension of a digital image was used as an index of brightness changes, not for expressing the self-similarity. These indices showed results {{similar to those of the}} multiresolutional contrast analysis.|$|R
50|$|NVF Company, {{formerly}} known as National Vulcanized Fiber, is a private company based in Yorklyn, Delaware. One of its original products, a sheet-like material called Forbon, is commonly used on guitar pickups. NVF also makes a product called Yorkite, another vulcanized fibre, that has wood <b>grain</b> <b>printed</b> directly on the material.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the demands for a higher visual resolution spherical widescreen process, Paramount created an optical process, VistaVision, which shot horizontally on the 35 mm film roll, and then printed down to standard 4-perf vertical 35 mm. Thus, a negative with a finer grain was created and release <b>prints</b> had less <b>grain.</b> The first Paramount film in VistaVision was White Christmas. VistaVision died out for feature production in the late 1950s {{with the introduction of}} faster film stocks, but was revived by Industrial Light & Magic in 1975 to create high quality visual effects for Star Wars and ILM's subsequent film projects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Synthetic {{decorative}} {{materials such}} as synthetic leather and <b>printed</b> wood <b>grain</b> are widely used in our everyday life, but we often notice that they are imitations because they lack richness of the appearance. One {{of the differences between}} the appearances of natural materials and synthetic ones is the complicated variance of reflection, but imitations have no means for reproducing the optical effect. In this paper, we first propose a technique for reproducing light and view dependent appearance of modeled CG objects onto real objects by forming anisotropic reflection on real object surfaces using microscopic grooves related with the normal vector field of modeled objects. We also propose an efficient technique to capture the normal vector field of natural materials and it makes it possible to reproduce the appearance of natural textures onto materials like plastics. Our method can be applied on mass production at a low cost, so the method is practically useful to give richness of the appearance on industrial products such as synthetic leather and wallpapers. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "electronic tonalities" [...] soundtrack for {{the classic}} MGM science fiction film Forbidden Planet was first {{released}} in 1976 by Louis and Bebe Barron at MidAmeriCon. It {{was on a}} vinyl LP album, done for the film's 20th anniversary, on the Barron's own PLANET Records label (later changed to SMALL PLANET Records and distributed by GNP Crescendo Records). The LP was premiered at the convention by the Barrons {{as part of a}} 20th Anniversary celebration of the film being held at MidAmeriCon. They helped the convention's film programming staff arrange for the rental of fine <b>grain</b> <b>print</b> of the film from MGM's archival storage vaults. Three separate screenings of Forbidden Planet were held as part of the convention's all 35mm science fiction and fantasy film retrospective. The Barrons were on-hand to promote their signed soundtrack LP, and they introduced the first of the three screenings of the film.|$|R
2500|$|The 1960s {{version of}} Tecelares {{is even more}} organic and {{expressive}} than the earlier 1959 version. The <b>print</b> shows the <b>grain</b> of the woodblock even more overtly in the bottom portion of the print, while the top portion remains relatively muted. As in the other prints in this series, Sem Título [...] (1960) is cut by diagonal lines that disrupt {{the continuity of the}} horizontal wood grain pattern, creating movement and distinct planes in the artwork, though they are considerably more subtle than the 1959 Sem Título [...] print of the same series. Also similar to the 1959 print, the 1960 print has the same imprecise quality created by the feathering of the ink on the rice paper. It also has a very organic quality, which is produced through the patterns and swirls of the wood grain. Because of this organic pattern, this print seems to overtly oppose the mechanic properties associated with Concrete art.|$|R
40|$|Reservoir quality {{depends on}} sand composition, itself a {{function}} of hinterland processes: provenance, tectonic setting, sand evolution and transportation, climate, and the depositional environment. Knowing the percentage of mineral composition such as quartz, feldspar and lithics in the subsurface, one {{may be able to}} predict porosity and permeability of reservoir units as they undergoes diagenesis. Sediments in the modern dryland Umbum Creek, western Lake Eyre Basin, Central Australia reflects the nature of the source region. Six petrographic provenances were identified and established in the Umbum Creek drainage basin, according to the six principal geological units drained: (1) the Palaeoproterozoic-Peake and Denison inliers; (2) the Neoproterozoic; (3) the Palaeozoic Arckaringa basin; (4) the Mesozoic Eromanga basin; (5) the Tertiary Formations; and (6) the Quarternary Formations. Source to sink samples from the Umbum Creek catchment were used to assess the provenance through time as well as finger <b>printed</b> each <b>grain</b> to its provenance lithotype. Climate has a strong influence on the petrogenesis of the Umbum Creek drainage basin sand, but mixing with tributaries is the main process that modifies composition of the Umbum Creek sand. The modern sand is not only directly proportional to the hinterland bedrock lithology, but also cannibalizes all outcropping bedrock along the transport path. This leads to an ultimate sand composition that is not only the result of the hinterland processes but also of the entire drainage basin. Therefore, the whole drainage basin configuration needs to be considered when attempting to predict sediment composition in the subsurface. Saju Menacherry, Tobias H. D. Payenberg, and Simon.

40|$|The purolindolines {{are small}} cysteine-rich {{proteins}} which {{are present in}} the grain of wheat. They {{have a major impact on}} the utilisation of the grain as they are the major determinants of grain texture, which affects both milling and baking properties. Bread and durum wheats were transformed with constructs comprising the promoter regions of the Puroindoline a (Pina) and Puroindoline b (Pinb) genes fused to the uidA (GUS) reporter gene. Nine lines showing 3 : 1 segregation for the transgene and comprising all transgene/species combinations were selected for detailed analysis of transgene expression during grain development. This showed that transgene expression occurred only in the starchy endosperm cells and was not observed in any other seed or vegetative tissues. The location of the puroindoline proteins in these cells was confirmed by tissue <b>printing</b> of developing <b>grain,</b> using a highly specific monoclonal antibody for detection and an antibody to the aleurone-localised 8 S globulin as a control. This provides clear evidence that puroindolines are only synthesised and accumulated in the starchy endosperm cells of the wheat grain. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in digital fabrication technologies and new materials development allow for direct control and programmability of physical material transformations. By utilizing multimaterial 3 D printing technologies and anisotropic material compositions, we can physically program hygroscopic {{materials such as}} wood to precisely sense and self-transform based on fluctuations in the environment. While wood {{remains one of the}} most common building materials in use today, it is still predominantly designed to be industrially standardized rather than taking advantage of its inherent anisotropic properties. This research aims to enhance wood's anisotropic and hygroscopic properties by designing and 3 D <b>printing</b> custom wood <b>grain</b> structures to promote tunable self-transformation. In this article we present new methods for designing hygroscopic wood transformations and custom techniques for energy activation. A differentiated printing method promotes wood transformation solely through the design of custom-printed wood fibers. Alternatively, a multimaterial printing method allows for greater control and intensified wood transformations through the precise design of multimaterial prints composed of both synthetic wood and polymers. The presented methods, techniques, and material tests demonstrate the first successful results of differentiated printed wood for self-transforming behavior, suggesting a new approach for programmable material and responsive architectures.
