Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or <b>ploughed</b> <b>land.</b> After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. The trees are defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the mistle thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{volcanic}} loam soils, such as {{are found}} in New Zealand, {{require the use of}} four heavy draught horses to pull a double-furrow plough. Where paddocks are more square than long-rectangular it is more economical to have horses four wide in harness than two-by-two ahead, thus one horse is always on the <b>ploughed</b> <b>land</b> (the sod). The limits of strength and endurance of horses made greater than two-furrow ploughs uneconomic to use on one farm.|$|E
25|$|A single {{draught horse}} can {{normally}} pull a single-furrow plough in clean light soil, but in heavier soils two horses are needed, one {{walking on the}} land {{and one in the}} furrow. For ploughs with two or more furrows more than two horses are needed and, usually, one or more horses have to walk on the loose ploughed sod– and that makes hard going for them, and the horse treads the newly <b>ploughed</b> <b>land</b> down. It is usual to rest such horses every half-hour for about ten minutes.|$|E
25|$|Driving {{the tractor}} with the furrow-side wheels in the furrow bottom {{provides}} the most efficient line of draft between tractor and plough. It is also easier to steer the tractor and driving with the front wheel against the furrow wall will keep the front furrow at the correct width. This is less satisfactory when using a tractor with very wide front tyres, for although they make better use of the tractor power, the tyres may compact part of the last furrow slice turned on the previous run. The use of furrow widener or a longer mouldboard on the rear body will overcome the problem. The latter moves the soil further towards the <b>ploughed</b> <b>land</b> leaving more room for the tractor wheels on the next run.|$|E

2500|$|Ploughing is {{not always}} {{regarded}} as essential nowadays, but the plough can improve soil by inverting it to improve soil aeration and drainage, release nutrients through weathering, and expose harmful pests to predators. [...] It is also an effective method of weed control. [...] Ploughing depth in Britain varies between 5–6inches in some limestone regions to up to 18inches in deep stoneless silt land. [...] Most British ploughs are designed to turn a furrow of up to about a foot deep, which is relatively shallow compared to some other countries, where furrows of up to 16inches are common. [...] Other machines used to prepare land include cultivators (to break up land too heavy for a normal plough), harrows (to level the surface of <b>ploughed</b> <b>land),</b> rolls or rollers (used for firming the soil), sprayers and dusters (used to spread herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and fertilisers).|$|E

The improvements needed to acquire the land were labour-intensive, and settlers farmed in family groups or ethnic bloc settlements of the same language to assist one another. [...] Early homesteaders grew mainly subsistence crops which would feed their own family and livestock. [...] Pioneer activities supported harvest work groups, recreational sports, pioneer farm exhibitions, rodeos and community dances to provide support and social interaction for isolated neighbors who lived a [...] apart from each other.

2500|$|The Anglo-Saxons did not {{settle in}} an {{abandoned}} landscape on which they imposed new types of settlement and farming, as was once believed. By the late 4th century the English rural landscape was largely cleared, generally occupied by dispersed farms and hamlets, each surrounded by its own fields but often sharing other resources in common (called [...] "infield-outfield cultivation"). Such fields, whether of prehistoric or Roman origin, fall into two very general types, found both separately and together: irregular layouts, in which one field after another had been added to an arable hub over many centuries; and regular rectilinear layouts, often roughly following the local topography, that had resulted from the large-scale division of considerable areas of land. Such stability was reversed within a few decades of the 5th century, as early [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] farmers, affected both {{by the collapse of}} Roman Britain and a climatic deterioration which reached its peak probably around 500, concentrated on subsistence, converting to pasture large areas of previously <b>ploughed</b> <b>land.</b> However, there is little evidence of abandoned arable land.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of tools needed for agriculture, from {{ploughing}} to harvesting, were manufactured. The basic tool was a plough also known as meli, nanchil and kalappai. It consists of a wooden plank to tie the oxen and an iron bar attached to the plank, that tilled the land. This tool helped to bring the low-lying soil to the upper layer and send the top layer to the bottom, thereby aerating the land. For digging earth, a spade with wooden handle and a sharp terminal was used. A wooden leveler known as palli or maram was used to level the <b>ploughed</b> <b>land.</b> Palliyadutal refers {{to the process of}} removing weeds by means of a toothed implement attached to a plank and drawn by oxen. Farmers used a bullock-propelled contrivance called Kapilai for bailing out water from deep wells and a manual setup called Erram, for shallow wells. Water bales were also known as ampi and kilar. [...] Protecting the standing crops from stray animals and birds was an important activity and was carried out by young girls and lower-class peasants. While the young girls used rattles to scare birds away, the Kuravan and Kurathi used a stone-sling device called Kavan to drive away elephants and birds. It is said that an accurate shot from the sling could even kill an animal. Bugles and burning torches were other mechanisms used to keep wild animals away from the fields. Sickles were used for harvesting fully grown paddy and reaping the ripe ears of corn. The paddy grain was separated by thrashing the sheaths on the ground. Ears of millets were stamped on by farm workers and that of black gram were beaten by a stick.|$|E
