25|$|The feminist {{historian}} Deborah Willis {{asserts that}} the witch-hunts resulted from a societal fear of maternal power.

25|$|The Jerusalem Talmud and Midrash Leviticus Rabbah (x.) {{give the}} {{following}} interpretation: The coat symbolized atonement for murder {{or for the}} sin of wearing mixed garments, and the undergarment typified atonement for unchastity.

The breastplate represented atonement for any <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> the Law, the ephod for idolatry, and the robe for slander.|$|E

25|$|When Siaka Stevens {{entered into}} {{politics}} in 1968 Sierra Leone was a constitutional democracy. When he stepped down, seventeen years later, Sierra Leone was a one-party state. Stevens' rule, sometimes called “the 17 year plague of locusts,” saw the destruction and <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> every state institution. Parliament was undermined, judges were bribed, and the treasury was bankrupted to finance pet projects that supported insiders. When Stevens failed to co-opt his opponents, he often resorted to state sanctioned executions or exile.|$|E
25|$|His {{knowledge}} of the coasts of New England and the Great Lakes area was appreciated by Frontenac, governor of New France, and Pontchartrain, Secretary of State for the Navy. This earned him various favors, including the Order of Saint Louis from King Louis XIV. The Jesuits in Canada, however, criticized his perceived <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> the Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island, also known as North America, with his alcohol trading. La Mothe was imprisoned {{for a few months}} in Quebec in 1704, and again in the Bastille on his return to France in 1717.|$|E
25|$|From the minuteness {{with which}} I have traced Waverley's pursuits, and the bias which they unavoidably communicated to his imagination, the reader may perhaps anticipate, in the {{following}} tale, an imitation of Cervantes. But he will do my prudence injustice in the supposition. My intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable author, in describing such total <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> intellect as misconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses, but that more common aberration from sound judgment, which apprehends occurrences indeed in their reality, but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic tone and colouring.|$|E

25|$|In Alien Resurrection, due to {{significant}} genetic tampering {{in an attempt}} to recover DNA from the deceased Ellen Ripley and the Alien Queen within her, the resulting cloned Aliens show a number of minor human traits. The cloned Queen inherits a <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> a human womb, and as a result it ceases to lay eggs and gives birth to a humanoid mutant hybrid. Physically, the human-Alien Newborn is very different from other alien young, being larger, with pale, translucent skin, a skull-shaped face with eyes, a human tongue and a complete absence of a tail. The Newborn fails to bond with its Alien Queen mother, killing it, and imprinting on the Ripley clone instead.|$|E
25|$|A related issue, said Pius, is the {{relation}} between capital and labour and the determination of fair wages. Pius develops the following ethical mandate: The Church considers it a <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> industrial society to have developed sharp opposite camps based on income. He welcomes all attempts to alleviate these differences. Three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family, the economic condition of the enterprise, and {{the economy as a}} whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and a sound enterprise. Thus, Pius concludes that cooperation and not conflict is a necessary condition, given the mutual interdependence of the parties involved.|$|E
25|$|The witches' teat is {{associated}} with the <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> maternal power by witches in early modern England. The witches' teat {{is associated}} with the feeding of witches' imps or familiars; the witch's familiar supposedly aided the witch in her magic in exchange for nourishment (blood) from sacrificial animals or from the witch's teat. It is also where the devil supposedly suckles when he comes at night to bed his faithful servants, sometimes impregnating them with his seed. Once the devilish half-breed has been conceived, the cambion may only feed upon this teat and no other. Folklore suggests that on the 7th day of the 7th week of consecutive feeding upon the teat, the cambion would grow to adulthood immediately and begin wreaking havoc with a range of demonic powers inherited from its supernatural father. However, should the ritual be disrupted during the 49-day period, the process has to restart all over again.|$|E

25|$|The New Industrial State {{not only}} {{provided}} Galbraith with another best-selling book, it also extended once again, {{the currency of}} institutionalist economic thought. The book also filled a very pressing need in the late 1960s. The conventional theory of monopoly power in economic life maintains that the monopolist will attempt to restrict supply {{in order to maintain}} price above its competitive level. The social cost of this monopoly power is a decrease in both allocative efficiency and the equity of income distribution. This conventional economic analysis of the role of monopoly power did not adequately address popular concern about the large corporation in the late 1960s. The growing concern focused {{on the role of the}} corporation in politics, the damage done to the natural environment by an unmitigated commitment to economic growth, and the <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> advertising and other pecuniary aspects of culture. The New Industrial State gave a plausible explanation of the power structure involved in generating these problems and found a very receptive audience among the rising American counterculture and political activists.|$|E
25|$|On 19 February 2013, Strate {{applied for}} a trial de novo based on {{evidence}} that the presiding judge had committed numerous instances of <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> justice against Mollath in the case. According to Strate, the judge was responsible for Mollath's detention for almost three weeks without disclosure of the charges or presentation to a judge, failure to respond to Mollath's complaints or forward them to the higher court that should have decided them, manipulation of the court's composition, obvious misrepresentations in {{the reasons for the}} judgment, and unconscionable refusal to discharge Mollath's assigned counsel in spite of many petitions to do so, followed by use of said counsel as a witness against his own client. To prevent duplication of effort with the prosecution, which was preparing a similar application of its own, the application was based exclusively on material that was, or should have been, available to the original court {{at the time of the}} original verdict. The application was debated in the legal committee of the Bavarian Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Jesus of Nazareth is an {{important}} figure in Rastafari. However, practitioners refute the traditional depiction of Jesus present in Christianity, particularly the depiction {{of him as a}} white European, believing that this is a <b>perversion</b> <b>of</b> the truth. They believe that Jesus was a black African and that he was a Rasta. Christianity is treated with suspicion out of the view that the oppressors and the oppressed cannot share the same God, with many Rastas taking the view that the God worshipped by most white Christians is actually the Devil. Rastas therefore often view Christian preachers as deceivers, and regard Christianity as being guilty of furthering the oppression of the African diaspora. Jesus is given particular prominence among a Rastafari denomination known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Rastas belonging to this group refer to Jesus as Yahshua and Yesus Kritos, and believe that his second coming is forthcoming. Accordingly, they do not share the view of other Rastas that Haile Selassie was the second coming of Jesus.|$|E
