5|$|X. bracteatum can {{be grown}} in large pots or window boxes, and is a good <b>pioneer</b> <b>plant</b> in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are {{suitable}} for hanging baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried flowers are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan.|$|E

40|$|Eruption of Merapi volcano caused {{accumulation}} of lahar materials {{that led to}} extensive land degradation.   This research was to study the population of <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> and their correlation with endomycorrhiza population at  different land qualities after Merapi eruption.   Samples of soil, <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants,</b> and endomycorrhiza were collected from Merapi volcano, 1 year after eruption, using stratified sampling method based on plant densities, with the following categories: dense vegetation, moderately dense vegetation, sparse vegetation, and control (bare land), with 3 replications for each category.   <b>Pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> and endomycorrhiza were identified. Plant biomass, soil pH, total-C,-N, and exchangeable-K, -Ca, -Mg, -Fe were analyzed. The abundance of <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> and their interaction with mycorrhiza was strongly correlated with depth of eruption material, quantity of sandy texture, soil pH, total-C and total-N, exchangeable-K, exchangeable-Ca, exchangeable-Mg, and exchangeable-Fe.   Among the 12 identified <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants,</b> only Acacia villosa, Fiurena ciliaris, and Bidens pilosa were recommended as plant-remediator to improve soil chemical, physical and biological properties. Among the 3 genera of endomycorrhiza (Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Glomus), only Acaulospora was recommended to be a biological agent to rehabilitate sandy soil area.   This research indicated that adaptive <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> and endomycorrhiza  {{were likely to be}} suitable for biological agents to stimulate recovery of degraded land through improvement of physical, chemical, and biological properties, that will stimulate plant growth and biodiversity.

40|$|Acid sulfate soil is {{generated}} by chemical and microbial oxidization of sulfide-rich minerals/sediments. Although revegetation of the soil is difficult due to low-pH and poor nutrient availability, <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> may adapt to such an extreme environment via associating with mycorrhizal fungi and/or N-fixing bacteria for acquisition of mineral nutrients. In this study, an abandoned quarry in which acid sulfate soil was found was chosen to investigate the influence of soil acidity on the levels of colonization by the microsymbionts, {{the identities of the}} microsymbionts that associated with <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> and the dependency of <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> on the microsymbionts. The levels of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization in pioneer grass, forbs and legume shrubs grown in the field were assessed, and no significant decline in the levels with an increase in soil acidity was observed. Most of the legume shrubs formed root nodules. Several AM fungi and bradyrhizobia were cultured from the rhizosphere soils of <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> grown in the quarry and identified based on the sequences of the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes. Pot experiments revealed that the microsymbionts isolated from the field significantly promoted the growths of pioneer grasses and legume shrubs in acid sulfate soil at pH 3. 4. These results suggest that plant-microbial symbiotic associations play significant roles in the growth of <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> in acid sulfate soil...|$|R
50|$|Grey dunes {{are formed}} when <b>pioneering</b> <b>plant</b> species inhabit embryo dunes and begin a {{successional}} process toward dune stabilization and soil formation. <b>Pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> capture saltating sand grains {{carried by the}} wind and deposit them to continue build up the dune. Grey dunes are then formed after the root structures of <b>pioneering</b> <b>plants</b> stabilize foredunes. Sand stabilization allows for dead plant material to be decomposed within the soil, adding nutrients and water-retention abilities to the soil. As soil starts to slowly form, new plant species colonize the stable dunes ultimately developing more extensive root structures and plant diversity. When the dune has become continuously vegetated, lichen and moss grows in the understory, providing a water-repellent surface that reduces erosion (through rainfall and wind), this results in the official formation of the grey dune.|$|R
25|$|A. mearnsii {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the ecosystem in its native Australia. As a <b>pioneer</b> <b>plant</b> it quickly binds the erosion-prone soil following the bushfires that are common in its Australian habitats. Like other leguminous plants, it fixes the atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. Other woodland species can rapidly use these increased nitrogen levels provided by the nodules of bacteria present in their expansive root systems. Hence they play a critical part in the natural regeneration of Australian bushland after fires.|$|E

The treatments, in factorial scheme 3 x 3 with three replicates, corresponded to three species of pioneer leguminous trees (Acacia mangium, Senna multijuga and Leucaena leucocephala combined with Hymenaea courbaril) and three spacings among <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> (4 x 2; 4 x 3 and 4 x 4 m).

Acacia mangium showed growth characteristics superior to those of Senna multijuga and Leucaena leucocephala, however, no influence of spacing between species in relation to these characteristics.

30|$|The high {{incidence}} of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria in sequencing of DGGE bands confirmed the importance of both phyla in mountain acid and oligotrophic soils, in opposition to plants of agricultural soils that showed predominance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes (Smalla et al. 2001). The absence of major bacterial taxa in some rhizospheres and bare soil {{could be explained by}} the soil chemistry of the acidic ferrous rocks which characterize the valley. In a previous study about five different environmental matrices from Matsch Valley (Esposito et al., 2013), authors found similar patterns. For instance, Proteobacteria were rare in bare soils, representing less than 10 % on average, while they were much more abundant in biofilms (40 %) or in lichen thalli (50 %). Also Acidobacteria showed a quite uncommon trend, with more presence in soils (40 %) and no detection in biofilms. Other studies involving single <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> showed the scattered microbial diversity maybe due to <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> exudation and/or to mineral characteristics of the microsites (Edwards et al., 2006). The general role of <b>pioneer</b> <b>plants</b> in selecting their own bacterial communities from the overall bacterial taxa available in the surrounding environment is highlighted by our finding that of a decrease of alpha diversity values (of both ARISA and DGGE results) within replicated rhizospheres compared to beta diversities between plant species or plants and unvegetated soil.|$|R
