50|$|The {{system was}} made by Nippon Otis Elevator, a company specialising in {{elevators}} and escalators. It was technically (and legally) not a railway, but a horizontal elevator; cars were attached to a cable that moved them, like a funicular. The cars did not have wheels; instead, they float on a 0.2-millimetre layer of <b>pressured</b> <b>air.</b> This was the first use of such a system {{to be used in}} an airport, as well as the first in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Fifty-six metres underground, a cavern was reached. Tapping {{signs were}} heard, and the rescuers let food, water {{and even a}} {{microphone}} down to the men below. Ludwig Erhard, who had been elected Bundeskanzler just weeks earlier, came to Lengede {{and spoke to the}} trapped men, then the real drilling began. Because of concerns about the poor condition of Old Man, water was considered too heavy for use in the drilling below 40 metres and <b>pressured</b> <b>air</b> was used instead. At 6 a.m. on November 7, the men were reached. Two miners went down with the Dahlbusch-Bombe to help their colleagues come up. Eleven men were rescued.|$|E
50|$|Four {{men went}} to the {{elevated}} end of a gallery; {{even though it was}} below water level, the air pocket there prevented the water from entering.

As it was of utmost importance to protect the air pocket, <b>pressured</b> <b>air</b> was pumped down. After six days, three men were finally rescued; a fourth had died in the meantime. The men were brought up with the Dahlbusch-Bombe, a tiny metal pipe which allows one man to stand inside. They had to spend several hours in a pressure chamber before being released.|$|E

5000|$|On 5 May 2015 the Trident {{whistleblower}} William McNeilly {{described the}} incident {{as told to}} him by a Chief on Vanguard at the time: The French submarine had took a massive chunk {{out of the front}} of HMS Vanguard and grazed {{down the side of the}} boat. The High <b>Pressured</b> <b>Air</b> (HPA) bottle groups were hanging off and banging against the pressure hull. They had to return to base port slowly, because if one of HPA bottle groups exploded it would've created a chain reaction and sent the submarine plummeting to the bottom. Luckily the boat made it back safely for repair. There was a massive cover up of the incident. For the first time the 'no personal electronic devices with a camera' rule was enforced.|$|E
5000|$|An initial {{comprehensive}} study of 24 known cases was conducted by multiple doctors from various disciplines at the Mayo Clinic. They identified {{the cause of this}} neurological disease to be occupational exposure to aerosolized pig neural tissue. Investigators from the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) simultaneously determined that the 70 ppsi pressure used to liquefy and extract the pig brains caused the aerosolization of the pig neural tissue, sending it into the air in a fine mist. The workers closest in proximity to the [...] "head" [...] table, the area in the plant where high <b>pressured</b> <b>air</b> was used to evacuate the brain tissue from the pig's skull, were the most likely to be affected. The aerosolized mist was inhaled and readily absorbed into the workers' mucus membranes. The pig neural tissue was recognized by their systems as foreign and an immune response was initiated. The pig antigen was found most prominently in the nerve roots of the spine which were also swollen. Researchers determined that the irritation was due to the voltage-gated potassium channels being blocked. They identified 125 1-α-dendrotoxin as the antagonist that binds to and blocks the channels, causing an intracellular build-up of potassium ions which causes inflammation and irritation, and consequently, hyper-excitability in the peripheral nervous system. It is this hyper-excitability that leads to the tingling, numbness, pain, and weakness.|$|E
30|$|After {{drilling}} {{about one-third}} of the test specimen depth (NKR- 1), compressed air is injected into the pressure cell at a fixed rate of 8 – 9 SCFM and the <b>pressured</b> <b>air</b> travels {{from the bottom of the}} test specimen to the top via the hole through the centre of the specimen.

The enhancement apparatus includes an enclosure which surrounds the space between the mirror and microphone, and contains a gas heavier than air, such as Freon, through which sound moves slower and therefore with a shorter wavelength than in air, so that a mirror of given size has greater resolving power. An acoustically transparent front wall of the enclosure which lies forward of the mirror, can include a pair of thin sheets with <b>pressured</b> <b>air</b> between them, to form an end of the region of heavy gas into a concave shape...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{disclosure}} {{is to provide a}} vacuum hold-down for holding thin sheets to a support surface, which permits the thin sheet to change dimensions as it is held down. The hold-down includes numerous holes in the support surface, through which a vacuum is applied from a vacuum source. The holes are arranged in zones. The vacuum is repeatedly interrupted at only one or a few zones, while it continues to be applied to other zones, to allow the workpiece to creep along that interrupted zone. The vacuum to different zones is interrupted at different times, as by a slowly turning valve number, to allow each zone of the workpiece to creep. A positive pressure may be applied from a <b>pressured</b> <b>air</b> source to a zone when the vacuum is interrupted there, to help lift the corresponding workpiece zone off the surface to aid in creeping. The workpiece may undergo dimensional changes because of heating, cooling, drying, or other procedure...|$|E
40|$|CrN/Cr {{multilayer}} coating {{is prepared}} on 316 L stainless steel as bipolar plates for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) by pulsed bias arc ion plating (PBAIP). Interfacial conductivity of the bipolar plate with CrN/Cr multilayer is improved obviously, presenting an interfacial contact resistance (ICR) of 8. 4 m Omega cm(- 2) under 1. 4 MPa. The results tested by potentiodynamic and potentiostatic measures in simulated PEMFC environments {{show that the}} bipolar plate with CrN/Cr multilayer has good anticorrosion performance. The corrosion current density of the bipolar plate with CrN/Cr multilayer is approximately 10 (- 8. 0) A cm(- 2) at 0. 6 V (vs. SCE) in a 0. 5 M H(2) SO(4) + 5 ppm F(-) solution at 70 degrees C with <b>pressured</b> <b>air</b> purging. The results of SEM and ICR before and after corrosion tests indicate that the bipolar plate with CrN/Cr multilayer is considerably stable electrochemically. The bipolar plate with CrN/Cr multilayer combined the prominent interfacial conductivity and the excellent corrosion resistance, showing great potential of application in PEMFC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to control the {{residual}} vibrations of a clamped-free beam subjected to a moving load. The dynamic response of the beam is calculated by using the finite element method in order to design a suitable control technique and the numerical results are verified by vibration measurements. All the numerical calculations are performed by a commercial finite element package. Two laser displacement sensors are used to measure the dynamic response of the beam. The moving load is obtained by <b>pressured</b> <b>air</b> directed to the beam via a nozzle, and the movement of the load is achieved by an industrial robot manipulator having 6 degrees of freedom. In this study, the suppression of the residual vibrations that occur after the moving load has left the beam is considered as the main subject. Piezoelectric actuators are used for active vibration control study and displacement feedback is employed. The numerical results agree well with the experimental results. The results show that the finite element method can be used effectively for designing a suitable vibration control strategy...|$|E

The purpose of this study was to analyze Bcl- 2 protein as antiapoptosis and caspase- 3 as apoptosis indicator of intermittent hypobaric hypoxia exposure. Experimental study >was subjected to Spraque Dawley male mice during January–April 2010 by exposing them to several intermittent hypobaric hypoxias (one to four treatment) in an interval of one week. Protein expression on mice heart cell were detected by immunohistochemistry in the Department of Pathology Anatomy Padjadjaran University-RS Dr. Hasan Sadikin Bandung and western blot methods in Department Biomolecullar Indonesia University Jakarta. Bcl- 2 protein expressions increased according with the frequency of intermittent hypobaric hypoxia exposures while a reverse trend was found for caspase- 3 protein expressions (rs=- 0. 448, p= 0. 013).
