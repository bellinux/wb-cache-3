[...] That was their response to the Populist movement of the 1890s, a destabilising threat to the [...] "Republican-Democrat" [...] two-party system. Moreover, despite the US defeating Imperial Spain, within the Republican Party, the Populist movement soon yielded to a Progressive movement led by Senator Robert La Follette, which culminated {{in the presidential election}} of 1912, wherein more than 70 per cent of the votes were against the incumbent US president, William Howard Taft (1909-13), whi was in third place: [...] "The <b>privileged</b> <b>interests</b> ... seemed about to receive their death blow.

Yet there are no guarantees that any particular realised innovation will necessarily be positive. Indeed, powerful forces ‘close down’ innovation in the directions favoured by the most <b>privileged</b> <b>interests.</b> So harnessing the positive transformative potential for innovation in any given area, is not about optimizing some single self-evidently progressive trajectory in a ‘race to the future’.

40|$|Today, {{whether in}} the name of accountability, higher standards, or {{economic}} competitiveness, we risk putting the formal school curriculum ahead of the child—a problem that Dewey addressed in 1902.

Such panels can be beneficial, however, new legislation means decision-making rests with Neoliberal-oriented Federal government who can ignore the report. Extractive industries have disproportionate access and influence over Canadian policy, so though consultations occur, the structures inhibit citizen’s capacity to contest <b>privileged</b> <b>interests.</b> Many Indigenous Peoples, citizens, municipalities, unions, scientists, and economists have denounced the JRPs legitimacy, promising legal action and vowing to fight NGP on the ground. FPIC and Deliberative Democracy were {{used to analyze the}} JRP in a political ecology framework. I argue participation is not synonymous with meaningful negotiation; participation is being included at the table but fails to define the value of input, resulting in a passive exercise of agency - relegated to tokenism or worse, spectatorship. Fairness, access and justice should be minimum standards in consultations, so preoccupations with legalism and procedures attempt to realize these standards in complex pluralistic, multicultural, post-colonial societies in practice, but fail. Legal mechanisms do not automatically provide equality and procedural elements can facilitate systemic exclusion. Relying on fair procedures then denying the results of difficult negotiations negates the worth of challenging and costly participation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} establishing a recovery orientation in community, non-government, mental health organisations in Aotearoa Zealand. It addresses the discursive constructions of key concepts such as madness, recovery and community care. In addition, it {{examines the}} wider, societal and institutional pressures that influence how important features of a recovery discourse, such as empowerment and an ordinary life in community, are articulated and enacted within organisational environments. It also investigates how institutional hegemonies are contested, and opportunities identified for institutional change and organisational transformation. Critical and postmodern perspectives in healthcare provided a rationale for utilising the framework for organisational communication research, developed by Dennis Mumby and Cynthia Stohl (1996, 2007). The framework addressed the problematics of (1) voice, (2) rationality, (3) the relationship between organisations and the state, as well as (4) the problematic of organising itself. Critical Appreciative Inquiry (Grant & Humphries, 2006) was the methodology used for this project. Focus groups and interviews facilitated dialogue among support workers, team leaders and senior managers {{from a range of}} community mental health organisations throughout Aotearoa Zealand. These encounters encouraged conversations about what worked well in organisations, and how to enhance a recovery-orientation, without shying away from a critical analysis of what was impeding best practice. The dialogues also enabled examination of how these organisations were situated within the larger socio-political and cultural environment. The findings of the study showed that organisational stakeholders constructed and translated the discourses of madness, illness and recovery very differently. Translations reflected the relative power of particular discourse communities, with powerful groups able to control meaning systems through their greater social legitimacy. Institutionalised discourses of biomedicine and managerialism proved difficult to “deinstitutionalise”, and institutional agents “translated” recovery discourses in ways that ensured little disruption to powerful and <b>privileged</b> <b>interests.</b> In addition, it was apparent that institutions undertook defensive institutional work when challenged. Defensive strategies were primarily discursive, e. g. translation, but were important mechanisms through which institutional interests subsumed alternative discourses, and maintained power over an organisational field. This thesis contributes to the field of organisational communication by demonstrating that perceptions of organisational, and institutional change, are frequently discursive, rather than substantive. Effective organisational change, therefore, needs to challenge institutional structures and systemic relationships of power. Sustained, and sustainable, change requires fundamental shifts in the rational bases of institutional logics. This has important implications for how less powerful actors and organisations can establish alternative discourses in institutionalised fields, such as mental healthcare...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{shed light}} on an area where {{particularly}} far-reaching changes in the participation of non-state actors occurred during the 1990 s: EC social policy. There, we witness some signs of what was called neo-corporatism or 'social partnership' at the national level, i. e. a decision modus based on the collective agreement of organised interests and on their participation in governance and social guidance as co-responsible 'partners' (Schmitter 1981). This development is embedded in other changes in governance: the move towards cooperative public-private governance is only the most prominent aspect. The process of change in EC social policy concerned basically all characteristic elements of a 'system of governance' (Kohler-Koch). Thus, innovations occurred on the levels of: 1) belief systems about appropriate principles of action (shared responsibility between the European and the national levels with horizontal and vertical subsidiarity principles); 2) actor constellation (a few <b>privileged</b> <b>interest</b> groups are incorporated in EC decision-making on public policies); 3) decision-making routines (very specific processes are established); and 4) boundaries (territorial exclusion of the UK; functional exclusion of various aspects of social policy). This contribution will first outline the traditional patterns of EC social policy and briefly analyse failed efforts towards more co-operative governance patterns during the 1970 s and 1980 s. Only when a major change in EC social policy was believed inevitable during the 1991 IGC, the employers agreed to participate in a quasi-corporatist modus of governance. The changes in EC social policy governance brought about under the Maastricht Treaty will be outlined in detail before their practice shall be discussed. Subsequently, the changes will be put into the wider perspective of European governance...|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} based on the text of a keynote address to the annual conference of the Japanese Association of Occidental Historians at Sendai in 2003. This address {{introduced}} the core session of the conference – on the transition from European empire to American hegemony in South and South-East Asia in the middle decades of the twentieth century. The article argues that India achieved a substantial measure of independence from both Britain and the United States after 1947. This was partly because she was not part of any Cold War conflict; but, more importantly, it was because the Indian nationalist movement had managed to establish a strong sense of national identity and self-interest, and an effective set of governance institutions. Imperialism exercised hegemony over colonial subjects through military force, ideologies that denied local national identity, and by imposing structures of administration that excluded local influence or that <b>privileged</b> external <b>interests</b> over internal ones. In parts of Asia these mechanisms remained in place after independence. But in India, by contrast, the hegemonic tools of empire had been blunted well before 1947, and these were not effective thereafter. Thus the political, ideological and administrative competence and strength of post-independence regimes is a vital variable in assessing the extent of hegemonic control that could be exercised by the super-powers in Asian countries after the end of formal imperial rule...|$|R

40|$|Defence date: 30 November 1998 Examining board: Prof. Gerard Delille, European University Institute; Prof. Olwen Hufton, Merton College, University of Oxford (thesis supervisor); Dr. Richard Mackenney, University of Edinburgh (external supervisor); Prof. Brian Pullan, University of ManchesterFirst made {{available}} online 29 August 2017 This study seeks {{to account for}} the political tranquillity of the Venetian people in early modem Venice (1550 - 1700). According to the ideology of the aristocratic elite, this was primarily attributable to its unique system of justice. Gasparo Contarini, the classic exponent of the 'myth' of Venice, derived the republic’s famed political stability from its guiding principle that, justice should be equally administered to all. Many studies have sought to explode this myth of Venetian justice by comparing these high principles with their operation in practice. The study focuses on the operation of the justice system in a specific area which touched the lives of all Venetians: the regulation of the internal market. As in other European cities, the market had a corporate structure, being divided up among guilds - <b>privileged</b> <b>interested</b> groups which possessed a monopoly on a limited sector of the market. While unusually, Venetian guilds were denied any formal political participation, alternative channels of communication between guilds and government existed in the courts, where the laws regulating the market might become the object of negotiation. The study of the courts therefore illuminates the whole question of guild-state relations in Venice. The role of the government in market justice was a dual one: it prosecuted lawbreakers {{in the name of the}} public interest, but was also the adjudicator of civil disputes between the rival private interests of the guilds. This is reflected in the division of the thesis into two halves. The first half examines the relation between public and private in the administration of the public law, while the second half focuses upon the resolution of private disputes, both between the guilds and within them. The study begins with a historiographical introduction to the problematic of political stability, justice and the world of the guilds. The first chapter examines the structure of the government courts and the extent to which the system was in fact governed by private interests. The gap between the law of the court-room and the reality of the street is examined in chapter two. The unreliability of the police forced the government to rely upon a system of self-interested policing by the guilds, and this gave the guilds significant influence over the implementation of policy in practice. Chapter three shows how government efforts to implement its own agenda in the public interest were often compromised by this need to cooperate with the guilds. The fourth chapter turns aside from issues of public law and looks within the boundaries of the guilds, seeking to determine to what extent they were genuinely popular institutions. Government regulations to protect ordinary guildsmen from dominance by a minority were also motivated by the desire to prevent the emergence of a wealthy class of elite guildsmen, who might have demanded political participation. Chapter five examines the nature of the external boundaries between guilds - their definition, violation and formation. The increasing rigidity of these boundaries in the seventeenth century and the consequent intensification of disputes between guilds were related to the imposition of an inflexible system of taxation by the government. Chapter six goes on to examine the resolution of such disputes, in terms of costs and legal procedures, and the consequences of this for rich and poor. Government attempts to impose an efficient system of summary justice were resisted by 'parasitic' elements within the courts - in particular those poorer nobles who earned their living from civil litigation. Tensions at the heart of the ruling elite therefore ensured that the free play of wealth in the court system was allowed to continue. The implications of the study are summarised in the conclusion...|$|R

Knowledge of the elemental distribution of the local concentration and chemical nature of ions at the biomaterials/living tissues interface is primordial to understand the complex interfacial reactions and physico-chemical properties of materials involved during the material integration, biomimetism processes, and bone bonding. Moreover, quantitative chemical mapping of relevant bone trace elements can permit improvement in the quality and above all the functionality of these biomaterials. These elements released in trace quantities physiologically interesting can induce specific cellular responses. Thus, it is important to study at the micrometer and nanometer scale interfaces that biomaterials develop in vitro and in vivo.

Miller High was chosen for its early integration in 1956, and for its location in a community that transformed, over {{the last half of}} the twentieth century, from rural, to suburban, to urban-suburban; and from a predominantly white middle-class town along which lived a small African-American community established since the nineteenth century, to a multicultural population that by the 1990 s included Russian immigrants and African-American youth newly arrived from city schools. Alumni's recollections revealed three generations of students who, bound in time by different demographic configurations, different levels of school disciplinary measures, and different shades of hierarchy in student-teacher relations, constructed their associations with peers and school authorities markedly differently: "The Divided Generation" (1950 - 1969), "The Border-Crossing Generation" (1970 - 1985), and "The Re-divided Generation" (1986 - 2000). Of the three generations, "The Border-Crossing Generation" most freely crossed class, gender, and race divides. They attended Miller High at a time when school policies were relatively lax, graduating classes were still relatively small, and mostly neighborhood students from integrated feeder schools attended against the national backdrop of the civil rights movements. This analysis identifies how Miller High students across generations and across diverse backgrounds who felt exposed or alienated within school-imposed associations with peers, either when herded in large spaces such as the cafeteria or divided into tracks, or who could not find a place within youth-generated peer-groups that <b>privileged</b> shared <b>interests</b> and affinities over racial, and class identities, sought refuge within communities of shared ethnic, class, or racial backgrounds. It further identifies, within generational time periods, the role played by demographics and school authorities' disciplinary measures in loosening or reinforcing students' segregating tendencies...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to document how white property owners in Cobb County, Georgia achieved political, economic, and social influence over local and state affairs by the mid-twentieth century through processes of racial privileging and policy-making. Prior to World War Two, the county’s white property owners were historically divided into two competing political factions of equal demographic size with one faction residing in rural unincorporated parts of the county, {{and the other in}} urban centers. For much of their history, these two factions waged political battles against one another over the distribution of real and personal property taxes. In 1937, the two factions joined forces to push for a statewide homestead exemption to lower property taxes collected at the state and county level. The sudden loss of revenue financially devastated local governments across the state. In Cobb, city and county politicians and civic leaders began to search for new ways of raising revenue, including home-building campaigns, expansion of municipal utilities, and the courtship of federal investment. Through a combination of local planning and federal intervention, Cobb County’s quest to raise revenue shaped a racialized built environment that <b>privileged</b> the <b>interests</b> of white homeowners and ultimately influenced how white property owners saw themselves and the world around them through the policy-making process. The primary vehicle for this study will be tax policy, a largely understudied yet critical component of the built environment. The trajectory of the white property owner in Cobb County is complicated, as it ties the effects of local, state, and federal policy-making to sets of identity politics influenced by white supremacy and formed {{over the course of several}} decades. It is a study long overdue for investigation as it lays the groundwork for understanding how property and financial self-interest would inform the political and social positions of white homeowners in the second half of the twentieth century. Within this convergence of racial and economic issues, one question is paramount: How did the interconnected political and social formations of white supremacy and property ownership change over time within the context of state and local tax policy debates...|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the increasingly topical question of social housing. The bachelor thesis deals {{not only with the}} current situation in the housing market, but also the development in previous years, which has influenced the present situation. The secondary topic of the bachelor thesis is the Housing First philosophy of social housing, which shows significantly better results than the Czech three-degree permeable system. The issue of social housing is crucial for the future development of the Czech population, because the number of people at risk of poverty is not decreasing and the number of people "on the street" is increasing. Based on the analysis in the bachelor thesis, {{it is clear that the}} situation of people at risk of poverty is not as much influenced by the amount of state expenditures in the housing policy, as rather by the set-up of state care in the area of housing. However, the adoption of the bill on social housing and the housing allowance in its present form brings with it many problems, such as the abuse of social partments by <b>privileged</b> citizens and <b>interest</b> groups and the pressure on the state budget. Also for these reasons, the legislative process of this act is lengthy and it is therefore a question whether the act will actually be adopted, or whether the set-up of the current housing policy in the Czech Republic will only be adjusted...|$|R
40|$|This article {{identifies}} a previously-ignored {{pattern of}} Supreme Court decisions that privilege one competing constitutional value, either speech or equality, and subordinate the other—with {{little or no}} reasoning explaining its choice. In adjudicating such cases, including two cases decided last term, the Supreme Court has steadfastly treated these disputes as either a basic equality case or a simple speech case. This dichotomy is a problem because once the Court places a case within either a speech or equality paradigm, it is constrained by certain rigid analytical presumptions. These presumptions threaten to stunt the analysis and to deprive the Court of the flexibility necessary to reconcile the competing constitutional commitments. Consequently, a string of Supreme Court cases have <b>privileged</b> First Amendment <b>interests</b> of speech or association over equality interests. At times, the Court has not even recognized the equality dimensions of these cases {{in part because the}} equality interests were embedded in state antidiscrimination laws. 	Analyzing a number of key cases including the Boy Scouts and burning cross cases, I show that, contrary to the Court’s reductive assumptions, these cases are fundamentally about speech and equality. Rather than artificially force a case into a speech or equality box, my approach would fuse speech and equality doctrine. After setting forth a general framework to speech-equality intersections, this Article reconstructs the analysis of Boy Scouts of America v. Dale and R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul to show how a more balanced approach would produce a finer-grained analysis reflective of a holistic conception of the Constitution...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to social {{interactions}} research, particularly to dependency relations in the Kalmyk society of the 17 th– 19 th centuries {{in the context of}} a discussion about social structure of nomadic people. The scientific relevance of the research is due to the fact that these problems remain understudied and controversial. Nomadologists disagree on many issues of nomads’ social organization in general and individually that of the Kalmyks. There still remains some influence of former methods and social formation in the study of the Kalmyks’ social system. The analysis of law sources, especially the Mongol-Oirat laws of 1640, is particularly important. A given assessment of these laws served as the basis for ideas of many researchers. During the operational period of Ministerial committees, which were preparing the draft law on the abolition of dependency relations in the Kalmyk society, a consensus was formed: the essence of mandatory dependency of common Kalmyks is expressed as the right of Kalmyk upper classes to collect money from their dependent Kalmyks. As long as this law had the nature of a property, it could be concluded that its abolition needed to be rewarded. Obviously, the government understood and emphasized the difference between “mandatory relations” in the Kalmyk society from serfdom in the Russian countryside. Some researchers have turned their attention to the role of the Russian government in legal arrangements of Kalmyk <b>privileged</b> classes’ possessory <b>interest,</b> which in our opinion, resulted from its attempt to organize relations in the Kalmyk society by using “familiar” means and methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} of biomaterial {{as proposed by}} the European Society for Biomaterials in 1986 puts forward the overall importance {{of the notion of}} contact between the biomaterial and biological medium (cell, tissue, fluid, [...] .). The underlying concept of biocompatibility makes the interface between biomaterial and biological medium a <b>privileged</b> zone of <b>interest.</b> In this paper, we would like to give an exhaustive view of how ion beams techniques can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} such interface taking several examples dealing with bone tissue substitution. After a short presentation of ion beams techniques the paper will focus on PIXE/RBS spectroscopies and will give the basics of these coupled technique. Three examples will then be presented to illustrate the interest of these techniques to study biomaterials/biological interactions. The first example deals with metallic alloys based joint prostheses. The ionic release from the prosthesis and the wear behavior of total knee prostheses will be presented. In the last two examples, bioactive materials will be studied. The common characteristic of bioactive ceramics is the kinetic modification of their surface upon interaction which is ideally monitored by PIXE chemical mapping. The second example will review the benefit of using PIXE/RBS technique to study the effect of doping of bioactive glasses on the very first steps involved in the bioactivity mechanisms like dissolution, ionic release, and biomineralization onto the surface of the glasses. Finally, protein delivery systems based upon mesoporous hydroxyapatites will be studied. Chemical mapping allowing the quantitative determination of protein distribution inside the HAp grains will be presented for the first time...|$|R
