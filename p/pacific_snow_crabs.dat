40|$|The Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> (Chionoecetes opilio) fishery {{has become}} the {{backbone}} of the fishing industry since the closure of the groundfish fishery in the early 1990 's. In 2003, <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> contributed approximately $ 277 million to the total landed value of the fishery.

[...] For the fishing industry, <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> expansion has been {{the order of the day}} throughout the 90 's. However, in 2000, based on the fall surveys of 1999, warning signs were raised. As a result, <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> quotas were cut for the first time in over a decade. Since 2000, the crab fishery has been showing signs of declines in certain areas. The fear among industry is that this trend is going to continue and spread to other or all areas. [...] A key management objective of the <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> fishery is to protect the reproductive potential of the resource. The reproductive potential is thought to be protected by the retention of only <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> over 95 mm (3. 74 inches) carapace width and discarding all female crab. Given that the resource is declining two questions arise. First, why is this resource declining given the current management strategy?

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} develop a better {{understanding}} of <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> (Chionoecetes opilio), a nonnative species that has established in the Barents Sea. Very {{little is known about the}} species role in the ecosystem, but it can be perceived both as a pest and as a goldmine. It is expected that the population will accommodate a significant fishery. As a non-native benthic crustacean spreading throughout a continental shelf shared between Norway and Russia, <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> is legally a challenging management object. This thesis attempts to predict probable future distribution of the Barents Sea <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> as well as ecosystem effects, and discuss management challenges. The research subject has been approached with a combination of a literature review and a diet study. <b>Snow</b> <b>crab</b> can potentially colonize most of eastern, central and northern Barents Sea.

To study <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> sensitization, {{occupational}} {{allergy and}} asthma in the <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> industry in Greenland, as high {{rates have been}} found in Canada, but no reports have emerged from the same industry in Greenland. Study design. Pilot survey. Methods. Twenty workers (19 of Inuit and 1 of other origin) in a <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> (Chionoecetes opilio) and Atlantic shrimp (Pandalus borealis) processing plant in Greenland were assessed with skin prick tests (SPTs) with common aeroallergens and specific allergens from <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> and shrimp extracts, spirometry, blood sampling for total IgE and specific IgE determination. Eighteen workers contributed a questionnaire-based medical interview. Results. Positive skin prick test reactions were common to <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> (40 %) and shrimp (20 %). Specific IgE to <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> were positive in 4 workers (21 %). Two workers had elevated total IgE levels. Symptoms suggestive of asthma were common (45 %).

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Bering Sea <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> (Chionoecetes opilio) are {{a commercially}} {{important}} crab harvested in the Bering Sea. Optimal management {{of this species}} requires {{an understanding of the}} biology of this crab that is currently incomplete. Fisheries managers apply a continuous growth model in their management of <b>snow</b> <b>crab,</b> which assumes that male crabs increase in size throughout their lifespan. Male <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> undergo a morphometric molt that leads to a disproportionate increase in chelae size and it is still debated whether this molt is associated with a terminal molt. This study was conducted to determine whether adult male C. opilio are anecdysic. Using current knowledge of the hormonal regulation of crustacean growth, <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> physiology was manipulated to induce an increase in molting hormones (ecdysteroids). Since female <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> are known to undergo a terminal molt after attaining reproductive maturity, we com-pared ecdysteroid levels in eyestalk-ablated terminally molted females, small-clawed males and large-clawed males. <b>Snow</b> <b>crabs</b> were collected from the Bering Sea and maintained in circulating seawater at approxi-mately 68 C. Animals were either eyestalk-ablated or left intact. Ecdysteroid levels in hemolymph were quan-tified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Circulating ecdysteroids were significantly higher in small-clawed male crabs when compared to large-clawed males or terminally molted females. Eyestalk-ablation increased circulating ecdysteroids in small-clawed males, but had no significant effect on circulating ecdysteroids in large-clawed males or in terminally molted females...|$|R

40|$|Approximately {{two decades}} ago, <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> (Chionoecetes opilio) were {{discovered}} in the Barents Sea. The areas {{in which they have}} come to establish themselves, in many instances, overlaps with areas trawled by the commercial groundfish fleet, consequently, leading to interactions between <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> and bottom gear. <b>Snow</b> <b>crabs,</b> which after settling to the bottom go through a series of molts in order to reach maturity.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Arctic {{waters off}} the coast of Alaska have become {{increasingly}} open to human activities via dramatic climatic changes, such as reduced sea ice thickness and extent, warming ocean temperatures, and increased freshwater input. This research advances knowledge of <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> trophic dynamics and stock characteristics in Arctic waters off the Alaska coast. Here, I provided baseline information regarding <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> position in Beaufort Sea benthic food webs, its specific dietary habits in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, and expanded upon previously limited life-history and population dynamic data in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. I first detailed benthic food webs on the Alaskan Beaufort Sea shelf and <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> trophic positions within these food webs using stable δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N isotope analysis. Water column and sediment particulate organic matter (POM) were used as primary food web end members. Isotopic niche space (δ¹³C – δ¹⁵N) occupied by benthic taxa provided measures of community-wide trophic redundancy and separation. Water column and sediment POM δ¹³C values generally reflected terrestrial POM inputs in the eastern and central shallow (14 - 90 m) Beaufort regions, but were indicative of persistent marine influence in the western and central deep (100 - 220 m) regions. Food web structure, as reflected by consumer trophic levels (TLs), trophic redundancy, and trophic niche space, supported the POM findings. In the eastern and central shallow regions, consumers occupied mainly lower TL (TL= 1 - 3), whereas consumers in the western regions occupied intermediate and higher TL (TL= 3 - 4). Overall trophic redundancy and niche space occupied by food webs in these four regions, however, was similar. The central deep Beaufort food web was unique in all metrics evaluated, and the comparatively largest isotopic niche space, with high trophic niche separation but low trophic redundancy, suggests that this region may be most vulnerable to perturbations. <b>Snow</b> <b>crabs</b> occupied food webs in the central deep and western shallow and deep Beaufort regions, where they maintained a consistent TL of 4. 0 across regions. I then investigated <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> dietary habits across the Chukchi, and the Alaskan and Canadian Beaufort seas in the size range of 40 to 130 mm CW using stomach contents and stable isotope analyses. <b>Snow</b> <b>crabs</b> consumed four main prey taxa: polychaetes, decapod crustaceans (crabs, amphipods), echinoderms (mainly ophiuroids), and mollusks (bivalves, gastropods). Crab diets in the southern and northern Chukchi Sea regions were similar to those in the western Beaufort Sea in that bivalve, amphipod, and crustacean consumption was highest. The Canadian Beaufort region was most unique in prey composition and in stable isotope values. Cannibalism on <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> was higher in the Chukchi Sea regions relative to the Beaufort Sea regions, suggesting that cannibalism may have an impact on recruitment in the Chukchi Sea via reduction of cohort strength after settlement to the benthos, as known from the Canadian Atlantic. Based on a comparison with southern Chukchi Sea macrofauna data, these results document the non-selective, omnivorous role of <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> across the entire Pacific Arctic, as well as providing first evidence for cannibalism in the Chukchi Sea. Finally, I generated new estimates of stock biomass, abundance, and maximum sustainable yield, length-weight relationships, size-at-maturity, and fecundity of <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> in the Alaskan Arctic. Although <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> were more abundant in the Chukchi Sea, no crabs larger than the minimum marketable size (> 100 mm carapace width, based on Bering Sea metric) occurred in this region. Harvestable biomass of <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> only occurred in the Beaufort Sea, but was considerably lower than previous estimates in the Arctic FMP. Length-weight relationships were generally similar for male and female <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> between the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Size-at-maturity and female fecundity in the Chukchi Sea were similar to <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> occurring in other geographic regions; low sample sizes in the Beaufort prevented size-at-maturity and fecundity analysis. Together these results contribute new understanding of Arctic <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> population dynamics by utilizing a rich dataset obtained recently from the Chukchi and Beaufort regions...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> (Chionoecetes opilio) near its southern {{limit of the}} Scotian Shelf is characterized from commercial fishing locations and from groundfish trawl surveys. Groundfish surveys also provide data on bottom temperature. <b>Snow</b> <b>crab</b> are most abundant on the eastern Scotian Shelf where bottom temperature is generally < 3 °C even in summer; they are absent from the deep central Shelf, "Scotian Gulf", which has access to warmer offshore waters. West of the Scotian Gulf <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> abundance is low, likely ephemeral, and limited to pockets of cold bottom water. The fishery exploits most of the areas where <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> {{are expected to be}} abundant on the Scotian Shelf. Mean annual catch rate by trawls was correlated with mean annual commercial catch rate for the 1980 – 94 period. There is some evidence of an endogenous cycle in recruitment, but other factors such as changes in bottom temperature appear important to <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> production on the eastern Scotian Shelf. It cannot be resolved whether the high biomass {{at the beginning of the}} fishery resulted from a peak in a recruitment cycle, or from the accumulation of biomass of the virgin population. Year-classes that originated in the mid- 1970 s and those that entered the fishery from 1982 – 86 were small; those that supported high landings in the late- 1980 s and early- 1990 s may have been larger because of increased survival of early life-history stages, but the reasons for any increased survival are not clear.

40|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>crab</b> (Chionoecetes opilio) {{is a small}} crab of a high {{commercial}} value, with {{delicious and}} nutricious meat. In the global market, it is a popular marine product. As a rule, <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> is sold frozen in limb sections or as separate meat. The product price is difficult to define as it depends on a price for the exported <b>snow</b> <b>crab,</b> on the currency rate, meat quality and economic situations in importing those countries. States, which harvest this type of crab, suppose this business to be economically efficient, but certainly with an appropriate management only. <b>Snow</b> <b>crab</b> is distributed in the North-Western Atlantic Ocean and in the Northern Pacific Ocean. Recently this species {{was found in the}} northeastern part of the Atlantic Ocean, too, namely in the Barents Sea. There are two main versions of its appearance. Scientists assume, that it appeared in the Barents Sea with ballast waters from the North-Western Atlantic. Another version is that it crawled from the Far-Eastern Seas such as the Sea of Okhotsk, the Bering Sea, etc. More likely, that it occurred in the Barents Sea with ballast waters. In this case, it is considered an invasive species. Consequently, it should be destroyed as soon as possible, because its further distribution may influence negatively the new environment and ruin the balance of the ecosystem.

40|$|The <b>snow</b> <b>crab,</b> Chionoecetes opilio, is a cold-water species found {{naturally}} {{at temperatures}} below 5 °C. Its physiology and energetics were examined {{to understand the}} metabolic limitations that restrict the <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> to these temperatures. The species {{is not confined to}} cold water because of a limited respiratory system. Routine oxygen demand can be met even at lethal tempera-tures of 18 °C (56 mgO 2 kg~ 1 h" 1, with a Qi 0 of 2 - 2). Blood lactate levels remain below l'Smmoll" 1 and actually decline slightly with temperature. Energy budgets, which were constructed from an examination of oxygen uptake, activity and food consumption in morphometrically mature male animals between 0 and 18 °C, indicate that the <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> is energetically restricted to cold water. Rising metabolic costs overtake caloric intake around 7 °C. This is probably due to digestive metabolism which is temperature-sensitive. Food consumption increases up to 6 °C but then falls. Crabs stop feeding above 12 °C. Although the growth equation is positive between 1 and 7 °C, it becomes slightly negative below 1 °C.

40|$|Bitter Crab Disease (BCD) is a fatal {{disease of}} {{crustaceans}} caused by parasitic syndinian dinoflagellates {{of the genus}} Hematodinium. Over forty species of crustaceans have been reported as hosts for Hematodinium or Hematodinium-like infections with a worldwide distribution concentrated in North Pacific and Atlantic oceans. In eastern Canada BCD was first reported in <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> Chionoecetes opilio from Conception Bay, Newfoundland in 1990 with very low disease prevalence (< 0. 11 – 3. 7 %). Subsequently, BCD has spread rapidly within the eastern and northeastern bays of Newfoundland and Labrador and has resulted {{in at least three}} epizootic disease outbreaks with prevalence up to 25 % in some subpopulations of <b>snow</b> <b>crabs.</b> Hematodinium infections can be presumptively diagnosed macroscopically via visual examination in many affected species, including <b>snow</b> <b>crabs,</b> due to characteristic discolorations of the carapace and/or arthrodial membranes. Specific detection of Hematodinium spp. via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays is another diagnostic method used for the diagnosis of infection in various crustacean hosts. In our study, 100 % of mild infections (1 / 1), 40 % of infections with moderate infection intensity (2 / 5), 11 - 22 % of advanced infections (1 or 2 / 9) had false negative test results while no very advanced infections (0 / 13) had false-negative test results for diagnosis by visual exam or PCR assay. These findings suggest that diagnosis by visual exam or PCR assay is less accurate {{in the early stages of}} BCD and both diagnostic tests underestimated the prevalence of Hematodinium infection in Atlantic Canadian <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> by 1. 25 – 1. 76 %. Light microscopic examination of parasite life stages of Hematodinium sp. infections of varying intensity revealed changes in proportions of multinucleate plasmodia. In <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> with infections of mild intensity (early BCD infections) the parasitic life stages had a high proportion of multinucleate plasmodia and had enhanced cytoplasmic basophilia, changes suggestive of rapid cellular proliferation. Moderately intense infections were predominated by uninucleate cells. In advanced and very advanced infection intensities (late BCD infections) there appeared to be a progressive increase in proportion of multinucleate life stages, suggestive of a resurgence of parasitic proliferation and/or impaired cytokinesis (possibly due to reduced host resources). The uninucleate and multinucleate life stages were most often amoeboid in shape; vermiform plasmodial life stages were also observed, typically in heavily infected animals. The vermiform plasmodia were often intimately associated with cell surfaces, most commonly in the heart and also rarely in the eyestalk, gill, and leg. Ultrastructural examination of these attached vermiform plasmodia revealed cytoplasmic extensions which interdigitated with host cell membranes and which occasionally appeared to form connections between parasite cell bodies. Comparison of the in vivo and in vitro life stages of Hematodinium isolated from <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> suggests that in vitro sheet-like and arachnoid plasmodia may represent exaggerations of amoeboid plasmodia and attached vermiform plasmodial life stages observed in vivo. The rapid proliferation of the Hematodinium parasites in hemolymph and the parasites’ high metabolic requirements during growth have been reported to decrease the hosts’ protein and carbohydrate reserves and contribute to host morbidity and eventual mortality. Our research concurs with these findings and indicates that BCD is associated with depletion of protein (reduction in hemolymph refractive index) and carbohydrate (reduced reserve inclusion scores) metabolic reserves as well as potentially altering host lipid metabolism. Several BCD-associated phospholipids were identified in this study. These BCD-associated phospholipids could contribute to the bitter taste associated with this disease. Additionally, BCD-associated phospholipids could contribute to the apparent lack of a cellular immune response against Hematodinium. A histopathologic study of Newfoundland <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> confirmed that BCD was the most significant infectious cause of internal disease in the populations examined. Two patterns of necrotizing and ulcerative enteritis were also observed in this study: focal ulcers at the level of the midgut-hindgut junction and more extensive areas of enteritis in the non-chitinized midgut epithelium. The cause of these lesions is unclear; hypoxia/ischemia and/or infection with pathogenic Vibrio bacteria are possible contributing factors in lesion development. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hemocytic aggregates between Hematodinium infected <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> and uninfected <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> suggesting that the hemocytic aggregates were background lesions unrelated to Hematodinium infection. No significant difference in the prevalence of intestinal inflammation (midgut-hindgut junctional ulcers or midgut necrotizing enteritis) or in the prevalence of hemocytic aggregates between BCD- and BCD+ <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> was observed. When the data from both bays that contain cases of BCD were combined, higher prevalence of one pattern of inflammation (midgut-hindgut junctional ulcers) was seen in <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> without BCD. There was also no significant difference in the prevalence of hemocytic aggregates between Hematodinium-infected <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> and uninfected <b>snow</b> <b>crabs,</b> suggesting that hemocytic aggregates observed in animals with BCD were background lesions unrelated to Hematodinium infection. This study confirms that BCD is associated with alterations in protein, glycogen, and lipid metabolism consistent with parasite-associated negative energy balance (i. e., starvation) in affected <b>snow</b> <b>crabs.</b> Histologic examination of BCD infected <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> revealed vacuolar degeneration in hepatopancreatic epithelium although there was no definitive evidence of parasite-associated inflammation or tissue necrosis. These findings indicate that the main pathologic effects of BCD are metabolic in nature...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{mortality}} rate {{is a key}} parameter in ecology and fisheries, {{but it may be}} difficult to estimate for methodological reasons and because it is highly variable and often confounded with other factors such as fishing mortality and migration. This is especially true for crustaceans in general, because age determination is problematic, and for <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> (Chionoecetes opilio) in particular because density-dependent processes may lead to highly variable {{mortality rate}}s across life history stages. In this context, we developed an original method to estimate the natural mortality rate of adult (i. e. terminally molted) female <b>snow</b> <b>crab,</b> and its consequences on egg production. This new method relies on shell condition, carapace width and abundance of adult females and was applied to a time series (1991 – 2012) of annual trawl survey data for a <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> population in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, eastern Canada. Two natural mortality estimates were provided by the method depending on two distinct assumptions about the survey. Both estimates (0. 66 and 0. 78 year– 1) were high compared to previous estimates for <b>snow</b> <b>crab.</b> These values imply that female life expectancy after terminal molt was short and that primiparous females (first-time spawners) contributed a large share (at least 81 %) of the total number of eggs produced by the case-study population over the period 1992 – 2010...|$|R

The coupling of electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has allowed for a rapid, 2 - 3 day, technique for the identification of these proteins. The protein bands are excised from gel slices, the protein present digested using trypsin and then analyzed using a MALDI-TOF MS instrument to produce a peptide mass fingerprint. [...] On-line database searching of the peptide mass fingerprints through Swiss-Prot or other database engines provide an efficient and effective means for protein identification, provided the protein has been sequenced.

40|$|Life history, {{ecology and}} {{fluctuations}} in BSAI crab stocks Summary of Proposed Work: Water temperature {{is key to}} the distributions, growth, and reproduction of crabs, and is potentially a valuable predictor of climate warming effects on crab fisheries. In the Bering Sea, the main concentration of <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> of marketable size has shifted northward from Bristol Bay to northwest of St. Matthew Island, with further expansion likely. In our 2006 surveys, <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> were abundant north and south of St. Lawrence Island (SLI), but were less than legal size of 78 mm. From north to south, mean carapace width increased by 83 % (23 - 42 mm), and minimum size of mature females by 24 % (45 - 56 mm). More small crabs in the north may result from temperature limits on growth, which reduces cannibalism on smaller sizes. Our low catches of groundfish, and predominance of <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> as predators, suggest that crab size structure in that area is more affected by cannibalism than by predatory fish. To predict northward expansion of <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> fisheries with climate warming, we will (a) determine growth rates and diets of settled juveniles through adult stages north and south of SLI, and (b) model the energetics of growth as a function of diet and temperature. To test the hypothesis that crab size structure and fisheries in the northern Bering Sea are controlled by temperature, we will compare predicted growth and size structure to data from our study areas, and to historical data from the ChukchiSea and north of St. Matthew Island...|$|R
