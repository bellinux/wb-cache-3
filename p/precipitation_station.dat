40|$|Auto {{regressive}} integrated {{moving average}} (ARIMA) {{models have been}} widely used to calculate monthly time series data formed by interannual variations of monthly data or inter-monthly variation. However, the influence brought about by inter-monthly variations within each year is often ignored. An improved ARIMA model is developed in this study accounting for both the interannual and inter-monthly variation. In the present approach, clustering analysis is performed first to hydrologic variable time series. The characteristics of each class are then extracted and the correlation between the hydrologic variable quantity to be predicted and characteristic quantities constructed by linear regression analysis. ARIMA models are built for predicting these characteristics of each class and the hydrologic variable monthly values of year of interest are finally predicted using the modeled values of corresponding characteristics from ARIMA model and the linear regression model. A case study is conducted to predict the monthly precipitation at the Lanzhou <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> in Lanzhou, China, using the model, and the results show that the accuracy of the improved model is significantly higher than the seasonal model, with the mean residual achieving 9. 41 mm and the forecast accuracy increasing by 21 %...|$|E

Climatic variability and change of both precipitation and energy inputs will, therefore, affect rural livelihoods at both a local and a regional scale through effects on summer runoff in the River Indus. Spatial variation in precipitation has been investigated by correlation and regression analysis of long-period records. There is a strong positive correlation between winter precipitation at stations over the entire region, so that, for practical forecasting of summer runoff in some basins, a single valley-floor <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> can be used In contrast, spatial relationships in seasonal precipitation are weaker in summer and sometimes significantly negative between stations {{north and south of}} the Himalayan divide. Although analysis of long datasets of precipitation from 1895 shows no significant trend, from 1961 – 1999 there are statistically significant increases in winter, in summer and in the annual precipitation at several stations.

Precipitation data collected at 56 stations between 1955 and 1990 were used: data from 48 stations for model development and data from 8 stations for additional tests. Five topographic factors-altitude, slope, aspect, longitude, and latitude-were taken into account for model development.

However the successful {{use of the}} isotope techniques depends on local or regional hydrogeological characteristics.

The relation between these two elements in precipitation from various {{part of the world}} is δ 2 H = 8 xδ 18 O + 10.

This intercept is more generally called d-excess and may vary from 10 depending on the humidity and the temperature of the evaporation region. Then depending on the existing conditions during the formation of precipitation (=evaporation) and mostly at the site of sea-air interaction the d-excess may vary.

We compared the measured data with the modelled data of monthly and seasonal temperature means and precipitation totals. Reliable {{and as long as}} possible time series of such data represent the basic starting point of dendroclimatic analyses. We evaluated the differences in the growth response of spruce derived using different databases of the stated climatic characteristics. The stem cores used to derive the cross-correlation function were taken from Hårås locality situated in the boreal zone of the Swedish part of Lapland. We compared the measured records from the nearest meteorological stations situated 18 and 40 km away from the locality with the interpolated values from CRU TS 3. 21 climate database and with the reconstructed 502 -year-long database. The spatial resolution of the modelled databases was 0. 5 ° × 0. 5 ° of latitude and longitude. We found a systematic error of different magnitudes in the modelled values, and we also quantified a random error and the overall accuracy of the data. The temperature model underestimated the data in comparison with the measured values, while the precipitation model overestimated the data. We also found that the radial increments of spruce correlated more strongly with the temperature than with the precipitation. Hence, in the conditions of the boreal zone, temperature is a more important factor affecting tree-ring formation. We found significantly higher correlations between the radial increment and the modelled precipitation data than with the data measured at the <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> situated 18 km from the locality of interest...|$|E
40|$|Water {{infrastructures}} {{have been}} implemented to support the vital activities of human society. The infrastructure developments {{at the same time}} have interrupted the natural catchment response characteristics, challenging society to implement effective water resources planning and management strategies. The Telemark area in southern Norway has seen a large number of water infrastructure developments, particularly hydropower, over more than a century. Recent developments in decision support tools for flood control and reservoir operation has raised the need to compute inflows from local catchments, most of which are regulated or have no observed data. This has contributed for the motivation of this PhD thesis work, with an aim of improving runoff estimation at ungauged catchments, and the research results are presented in four manuscript scientific papers.  The inverse distance weighting, inverse distance squared weighting, ordinary kriging, universal kriging and kriging with external drift were applied to analyse precipitation variability and estimate daily precipitation in the study area. The geostatistical based univariate and multivariate map-correlation concepts were applied to analyse and physically understand regional hydrological response patterns. The Sobol variance based sensitivity analysis (VBSA) method was used to investigate the HBV hydrological model parameterization significances on the model response variations and evaluate the model’s reliability as a prediction tool. The HBV hydrological model space transferability into ungauged catchments was also studied.  The analyses results showed that the inverse distance weighting variants are the preferred spatial data interpolation methods in areas where relatively dense <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> network can be found.   In mountainous areas and in areas where the <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> network is relatively sparse, the kriging variants are the preferred methods. The regional hydrological response correlation analyses suggested that geographic proximity alone cannot explain the entire hydrological response correlations in the study area. Besides, when the multivariate map-correlation analysis was applied, two distinct regional hydrological response patterns - the radial and elliptical-types were identified. The presence of these hydrological response patterns influenced the location of the best-correlated reference streamgauges to the ungauged catchments. As a result, the nearest streamgauge was found the best-correlated in areas where the radial-type hydrological response pattern is the dominant. In area where the elliptical-type hydrological response pattern is the dominant, the nearest reference streamgauge was not necessarily the best-correlated. The VBSA verified that varying up to a minimum of four to six influential HBV model parameters can sufficiently simulate the catchments' responses characteristics when emphasis is given to fit the high flows. Varying up to a minimum of six influential model parameters is necessary to sufficiently simulate the catchments’ responses and maintain the model performance when emphasis is given to fit the low flows. However, varying more than nine out of the fifteen HBV model parameters will not make any significant change on the model performance.  The hydrological model space transfer study indicated that estimation of representative runoff at ungauged catchments cannot be guaranteed by transferring model parameter sets from a single donor catchment. On the other hand, applying the ensemble based model space transferring approach and utilizing model parameter sets from multiple donor catchments improved the model performance at the ungauged catchments. The result also suggested that high model performance can be achieved by integrating model parameter sets from two to six donor catchments. Objectively minimizing the HBV model parametric dimensionality and only sampling the sensitive model parameters, maintained the model performance and limited the model prediction uncertainty.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} errors in extreme {{precipitation}} in gridded station products incurred during the upscaling of station measurements to a grid, {{referred to as}} representativeness errors. Gridded <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> analyses are valuable observational data sources {{with a wide variety}} of applications, including model validation. The representativeness errors associated with two gridding methods are presented, consistent with either a point or areal average interpretation of model output, and it is shown that they differ significantly (up to 30 %). An experiment is conducted to determine the errors associated with station density, through repeated gridding of station data within the United States using subsequently fewer stations. Two distinct error responses to reduced station density are found, which are attributed to differences in the spatial homogeneity of precipitation distributions. The error responses characterize the eastern and western United States, which are respectively more and less homogeneous. As the station density decreases, the influence of stations farther from the analysis point increases, and therefore, if the distributions are inhomogeneous in space, the analysis point is influenced by stations with very different precipitation distributions. Finally, ranges of potential percent representativeness errors of the median and extreme precipitation across the United States are created for high-resolution (0. 25 °) and low-resolution areal averaged (0. 9 ° lat × 1. 25 ° lon) precipitation fields. For example, the range of the representativeness errors is estimated, for annual extreme precipitation, to be from + 16 % to − 12 % in the low-resolution data, when station density is 5 stations per 0. 9 ° lat × 1. 25 ° lon grid box...|$|E

WP classifications were recently used to improve the statistical characterisation of heavy rainfall. In this context, bottom-up approaches, combining spatial distribution of heavy rainfall observations and geopotential height fields have been used to define WP classifications relevant for heavy rainfall statistical analysis. The definition of WPs at the synoptic scale creates an interesting variable which {{could be used as a}} link between the global scale of climate signals and the local scale of <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> measurements. We introduce here a new WP classification centred on the British Columbia (BC) coastal region (Canada) and based on a bottom-up approach. Five contrasted WPs composed this classification, four rainy WPs and one non-rainy WP, the anticyclonic pattern. The four rainy WPs are mainly observed in the winter months (October to March), which is the period of heavy precipitation events in coastal BC and is thus consistent with the local climatology. The combination of this WP classification with the seasonal description of rainfall is shown to be useful for splitting observed precipitation series into more homogeneous sub-samples (i. e. sub-samples constituted by days having similar atmospheric circulation patterns) and thus identifying, for each station, the synoptic situations that generate the highest hazard in terms of heavy rainfall events. El Niño-Southern Oscillations (ENSO) significantly influence the frequency of occurrence of two coastal BC WPs. Within each WP, ENSO seem to influence only the frequency of rainy events and not the magnitudes of heavy rainfall events. Consequently, heavy rainfall estimations do not show significant evolution of heavy rainfall behaviour between Niño and Niña winters.

NAO influence on the intensity and frequency of precipitation of each region is described in terms of mean precipitation, mean rain frequency, the number of extreme events, changes in the precipitation distribution and the prevalent synoptic configuration. Results indicate a non-stationary response; NAO signal being more evident in mid-late winter. Strong regional differences in the response to NAO are also found, which vary according to the specific character of the precipitation under analysis. Thus, NAO exerts a clear effect on the intensity of total and extreme precipitation rates in northern and westernmost Spanish regions, whereas the frequency of precipitation is clearly affected by NAO in central and southwestern areas. While the correlation between NAO and precipitation is negative for most of the analyzed area, two regions reveal positive responses to NAO in total precipitation occurrence and intensity for specific months. Further analyses reveal asymmetric responses to opposite phases of NAO in the precipitation distributions of some regions. The complex regional relationship between NAO and precipitation is also revealed through the modulation of the former in the preferred Circulation Weather Types associated to precipitation in each region.

Previous attempts to document soil erosion potential have had limited success, lacking appropriate information and diagnostic tools. This study utilized geomatics technologies {{and the latest}} available information from topography, soils, climate, vegetation, and land use of a watershed in southern Malawi. The Soil Loss Estimation Model for Southern Africa (SLEMSA), developed for conditions in Zimbabwe, was evaluated and {{used to create a}} soil erosion hazard map for the watershed under Malawi conditions. The SLEMSA sub-models of cover, soil loss, and topography were computed from energy interception, rainfall energy, and soil erodibility, and slope length and steepness, respectively. Geomatics technologies including remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provided the tools with which land cover/land use, a digital elevation model, and slope length and steepness were extracted and integrated with rainfall and soils spatial information. Geomatics technologies enable rapid update of the model as new and better data sets become available. Sensitivity analyses of the SLEMSA model revealed that rainfall energy and slope steepness have the greatest influence on soil erosion hazard estimates in this watershed. Energy interception was intermediate in sensitivity level, whereas slope length and soil erodibility ranked lowest. Energy interception and soil erodibility were shown by parameter behavior analysis to behave in a linear fashion with respect to soil erosion hazard, whereas rainfall energy, slope steepness, and slope length exhibit non-linear behavior. When SLEMSA input parameters and results were compared to alternative methods of soil erosion assessment, such as drainage density and drainage texture, the model provided more spatially explicit information using 30 meter grid cells.

This study used the upper Heihe River Basin as a case study, and daily gridded precipitation data with 3 km resolution based on the spatial interpolation of gauged stations and a regional climate model were used to construct a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model. The aim was to validate the precision of high-resolution gridded precipitation for hydrological simulation in data-scarce regions; a scale transformation method was proposed by building virtual stations and calculating the lapse rate to overcome the defects of the SWAT model using traditional <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> data. The gridded precipitation was upscaled from the grid to the sub-basin scale to accurately represent sub-basin precipitation input data. A satisfactory runoff simulation was achieved, and the spatial variability of water balance components was analysed. Results show that the precipitation lapse rate ranges from 40 mm/km to 235 mm/km and decreases from the southeastern to the northwestern areas. The SWAT model achieves monthly runoff simulation compared with gauged runoff from 2000 to 2014; the determination coefficients are higher than 0. 71, the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies are higher than 0. 76, and the percentage bias is controlled within ± 15 %. Meadow and sparse vegetation are the major water yield landscapes, and the elevation band from 3500 m to 4500 m is the major water yield area. Precipitation and evapotranspiration present a slightly increasing trend, whereas water yield and soil water content present a slightly decreasing trend. This finding indicates that the high-resolution gridded precipitation data fully depict its spatial heterogeneity, and scale transformation significantly promotes the application of the distributed hydrological model in inland river basins.

Using the curve and upon choosing the fittest index PW as independent variable and the rainfall average precipitation (P) as dependent variable, from among the PW, the suitable cloud seeding threshold was estimated. The thresholds obtained through MODIS for cloud seeding and PW were compared across 17 cases. This method employed showed high correlation. The thresholds obtained were 12 mm. With these factors (PW and P) we can study on threshold of cloud seeding...|$|R
40|$|Eastern Black Sea Region {{in northeastern}} part of Turkey {{has the highest}} {{precipitation}} total in the country, approaching 2500 mm per a year. It is therefore an important region as it frequently encounters with flash floods due to heavy rains. For future planning of water resources, environment and urbanization, {{it is important to}} know the expected behavior of hydrometeorological processes, mainly precipitation and flow. Due to these facts, in this study, homogeneity of long-term annual precipitation and streamflow series of the Eastern Black Sea Region, Turkey is checked using double mass curve method and trends are determined by means of the Mann-Kendall test. The data network consists of 38 <b>precipitation</b> gauging <b>stations</b> and 40 flow gauging stations across the Eastern Black Sea Region. It is found that 27 <b>precipitation</b> <b>stations</b> out of 38 are homogeneous and no trend is available. Out of the remaining stations, nine are found non-homogeneous and four with trend. For annual flow data, it is found that 22 stations out of 40 are homogeneous and no trend is available.

40|$|The Carpathians {{and their}} rich {{biosphere}} {{are considered to}} be highly vulnerable to climate change. Drought {{is one of the major}} climate-related damaging natural phenomena and in Europe it has been occurring with increasing frequency, intensity, and duration in the last decades. Due to climate change, land cover changes, and intensive land use, the Carpathian Region is one of the areas at highest drought risk in Europe. In order to analyze the drought events over the last 50 yr in the area, we used a 1961 – 2010 daily gridded temperature and precipitation dataset. From this, monthly 0. 1 × 0. 1 grids of four drought indicators (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Reconnaissance Drought Indicator (RDI), and Palfai Aridity/Drought Index (PADI)) have been calculated. SPI, SPEI, and RDI have been computed at different time scales (3, 6, and 12 months), whilst PADI has been computed on an annual basis. The dataset used in this paper has been constructed in the framework of the CARPATCLIM project, run by a consortium of institutions from 9 countries (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine) with scientific support by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. Temperature and <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> data have been collected, quality-checked, completed, homogenized, and interpolated on the 0. 1 × 0. 1 grid, and drought indicators have been consequently calculated on the grid itself. Monthly and annual series of the cited indicators are presented, together with high-resolution maps and statistical analysis of their correlation. A list of drought events between 1961 and 2010, based on the agreement of the indicators, is presented. We also discuss three case studies: drought in 1990, 2000, and 2003. The drought indicators have been compared both on spatial and temporal scales: it resulted that SPI, SPEI, and RDI are highly comparable, especially over a 12 -month accumulation period. SPEI, which includes PET (Potential Evapo-Transpiration) as RDI does, proved to perform best if drought is caused by heat waves, whilst SPI performed best if drought is mainly driven by a rainfall deficit, because SPEI and RDI can be extreme in dry periods. According to PADI, the Carpathian Region has a sufficient natural water supply on average, with some spots that fall into the “mild dry” class, and this is also confirmed by the FAO-UNEP aridity index and the K¨oppen-Geiger climate classification.

40|$|Cloud {{samples for}} the isotopic {{analysis}} {{were collected in}} the framework of the Hill Cap Cloud Thuringia 2010 (HCCT- 2010) campaign on Schmücke (50 ° 39 'N/ 10 ° 46 'E, 937 m a. s. l.; Germany) in September and October 2010 with a three-stage Caltech Active Strand Cloudwater Collector (CASCC) during 13 different cloud events with a temporal resolution of 1 to 3 hours. In a first step, we ensured that no additional fractionation occurred during sampling with the CASCC. The d values of the three sizes classes of the CASCC (4 µm to 16 µm, 16 µm to 22 µm and > 22 µm) did not differ significantly, revealing that the cloud droplets of different sizes quickly equilibrate their delta value with the one of the surrounding vapor. delta values in the cloud droplets varied from - 77 per mil to - 15 per mil in d 2 H and from - 12. 1 per mil to - 3. 9 per mil in d 18 O and were fitted by d 2 H = 7. 8 *d 18 O + 13 * 10 **- 3. delta values decreased with temperature as well as {{towards the end of the}} campaign, representing a seasonal trend which is known from d values in precipitation. The deuterium excess of the cloud samples was generally higher than the Local Meteoric Water Line of the closest GNIP (Global Network of Isotopes in <b>Precipitation)</b> <b>station.</b> Rain decreases its deuterium excess during falling through an unsaturated air column, while the cloud droplets conserve the deuterium excess of the initial evaporation and thus have been found to be a good indicator for the airmass source region: higher deuterium excess was measured for polar air masses and lower deuterium excess for Mediterranean air masses. Changes in d values during one cloud event were up to 3. 6 per mil (d 2 H) and 0. 23 per mil (d 18 O), except for frontal passages, which were associated with increases of ~ 6 per mil per hour (d 2 H) and ~ 0. 6 per mil per hour (d 18 O). Using a box model, we showed that the influence of condensation only was able to explain the variation in the isotope signal of two cloud passages. Consequently, we deduced that the water vapor "feeding" the cloud advected the measured changes. A trajectory analysis and moisture source diagnostic revealed that it is very likely that the variations were either related to rain out along the trajectories or to meteorological changes in the moisture source region. This was the first study using stable water isotopologues in cloud water manifesting their potential in the context of atmospheric water vapor circulation...|$|E
40|$|This work aims to {{identify}} weather type circulations in the South American sector and analyze their frequency, distribution and temporal variability. Daily averages of 1000 hPa geopotential heights {{for the period}} 1979 - 2001 were used in order to perform the weather type (WT) classification. The series of daily maps {{was obtained from the}} NCEP Reanalysis 2 data provided by the NOAA-CIRES Climate Diagnostics Center. The months analyzed were those when major precipitations in central-eastern Argentina occur (October to May). This period also corresponds to the growing season of the summer crops in this area. Using k-means clustering method on the most relevant T-mode principal components, a classification into 7 fundamental circulations emerged, based on daily anomalies of geopotential over southern South America region: WT 1, negative anomalies over the SW Atlantic and SW flow over the continent; WT 2, trough over the SE Pacific and ridge over the SW Atlantic; WT 3, positive anomalies over the southern tip of the continent; WT 4, ridge over the E of the continent; WT 5, ridge over the SE Pacific and S of the continent and trough downstream; WT 6, low-pressure system centred 45 S- 55 W; WT 7, negative anomalies over the southern tip of the continent. The temporal series of seasonal frequencies of the 7 WT were studied in order to find main characteristics. Major interannual variabilities were found for those groups with enhanced westerlies (WT 1 and WT 7) while the opposite behavior was found for those days characterized by a ridge at the east of the continent (WT 4) inducing subsidence at low levels. It was observed a progressive diminution in time of cold air advection situations (WT 5). This result is coincident with the increase of summer minimum temperature values observed in recent decades over the studied area. Meanwhile an increase in seasonal frequencies of enhanced mid-latitude westerlies and disturbances migration over Patagonia (WT 7) was detected. This group exhibited pronounced low frequencies in the strongest El Niño years (1982 / 83, 1991 / 92 and 1997 / 98) showing changes in low level circulation and in westerlies intensity during these years. The analysis of the monthly frequencies for each group displayed that WT 1 presents the highest frequencies in December in agreement with the maximum in the meridional circulation index (intense South Pacific high). Situations with SE flow over central Argentina (WT 3) reach their maximum during spring and fall, this is coincident with the monthly distribution of the SE windstorm (sudestada) in the Rio de la Plata estuary. The persistence of each group was also analyzed. The less persistent groups were WT 4 and WT 6 which represent opposite situations from the dynamical point of view (positive and negative anomalies at the east of the continent respectively). While WT 2 and WT 7 were the most persistent groups. Daily <b>precipitation</b> <b>station</b> data for the Pampas region was used in order to link the WT with the regional climate. It was found that widespread rainy days (more than 10 mm in all stations) were related to WT 3, WT 6 and WT 7. On the other hand, days with no precipitation over the whole area tended to be associated with WT 4. Pages: 495 - 50...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStudy regionThe study {{considers}} six <b>precipitation</b> <b>stations</b> {{located in}} Senegal, West Africa. Senegal {{is located in}} the Sahel, an area that is threatened by climate variability and change. Both droughts and extreme rainfall have been an issue in recent years. Study focusTwo different statistical downscaling techniques were applied to the outputs of four regional climate models at six selected <b>precipitation</b> <b>stations</b> in Senegal. First, the delta-change method was applied to the mean annual precipitation as well as the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 -year return period daily precipitation events. Second, a quantile–quantile transformation (QQ) was used to downscale the monthly distributions of precipitation simulated by regional climate models (RCMs). The 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 -year daily precipitation events were afterward calculated. All extreme events were calculated assuming that maximum annual daily precipitations follow the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test was finally used to assess the performance of the quantile–quantile transformation as well as the GEV distribution fit for the annual maximum daily precipitation. New hydrological insights for the regionResults show that the two downscaling techniques generally agree on the direction of the change when applied to the outputs of same RCM, but some cases lead to very different projections of the direction and magnitude of the change. Projected changes indicate a decline in mean precipitation except for one RCM over one region in Senegal. Projected changes in extreme precipitations are not consistent across stations and return periods. The choice of the downscaling technique has more effect on the estimation of extreme daily precipitations of return period equal or greater than ten years than the choice of the climate models...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a method to}} identify homogenous sub-regions and their corresponding large-scale sector in statistical-empirical downscaling models systematically. The analysis was done with a gridded observed sea level pressure field (SLP) of the North Atlantic sector as predictor and time series of <b>precipitation</b> at 82 <b>Stations</b> as dependent variable, distributed nearly homogeneously in Spain and the south of France. The <b>precipitation</b> <b>stations</b> were classified in more homogeneous groups by cluster analysis. For some of the resulting groups {{the domain of the}} SLP field with the highest influence on rainfall was also identified. In the next step Canonical Correlation Analysis was applied between the groups suitable for a statistical downscaling and their corresponding SLP sector. The result is that the statistical skill in the validation period is increased compared to the standard downscaling model. Last, this statistical downscaling model are applied to a climate change experiment with ECHAM 4 -OPYC 3 under increasing atmospheric CO_ 2 concentrations. (orig.)
