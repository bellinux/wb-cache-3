30|$|Most of the {{investigations}} on TPV systems focus on increasing conversion’s efficiency and power density. For such purpose, the spectral control of thermal radiation from an emitter to a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> is important. One of the effective approaches for the spectral control {{is to use}} a filter that control photons selectively from an emitter to a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> The filter in a TPV system plays its role in the following two aspects: (1) recycling thermal radiation, i.e. reflecting photons whose wavelengths are above the band gap wavelength of a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> back to the emitter. This action helps to maintain a high temperature level of the emitter and reduce the cooling load of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> (2) transmitting photons selectively, i.e. selecting the photons from an emitter whose wavelengths are below the band gap wavelength of a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> to penetrate the filter and reach the cell. These photons can be absorbed and stimulate electrons out of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> The need to develop suitable filter stimulated investigation to improve the conversion’s efficiency of TPV systems. Several research groups have been devoting their work to filter’s performance, and typical filter structures have been proposed including plasma filters [7, 8], one-dimensional Photonic Crystal [4, 9] filter, and frequency selective surface [6, 10].|$|R

40|$|A <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> is a {{component}} which converts light energy into electrical energy. Different environmental parameters and internal parameters {{have a great}} impact on the output of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> To identify its characteristics and estimate the output, the well known Shockley diode equation is used. This equation contains all the parameters, as one environmental and different internal. The properties of these parameters were studied and their sensitivity have been analyzed through the use of an error function; this error function allows the study of the behaviour of the parameters and their characteristics against the output of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> through the analysis of its curves giving the sensitivity of the different parameters to the output of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> Using these results the impact of the parameters of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> has been clearly identified. White noise is included both with the ideal values and the simulation and the ideal value is imposed to get the real time environment flavor. This work analyses both systems with and without white noise...|$|R
