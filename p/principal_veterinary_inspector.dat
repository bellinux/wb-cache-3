The evolution of food regulation on one hand and the quality assurance of the veterinary services of the ONSSA according to the ISO 17020 standard on the other hand, need studying the regulation model adopted at national level. The objective of this work is to analyze the main health risks associated with fishery products from a co-regulatory perspective. The hazards targeted by this study are histamine, parasites and sulfites. The approach is based on structured interviews with fishery products professionals and <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors</b> responsible for control and certification. The main hazards are controlled by adopting health control plans (PMS) by the professionals within the establishments as well as the official control carried out by the inspecting veterinarians. The PMS implementation can produce conflicting injunctions for the <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors</b> of the competent authority. ...|$|R

40|$|In South East Benin, {{control of}} porcine {{cysticercosis}} {{is carried out}} by using meat inspection. To assess routine inspection method for diagnostic of porcine cysticercosis, two studies were carried out. The study 1 was conducted by using data collected from seizures records from 2006 to 2011. The most important organ condemned was tongue (0. 54 %, 95 % CI: 0. 48 - 0. 60) {{and the most important}} proportion of carcasses seized was 0. 74 %. Prevalence of porcine cysticercosis estimated with meat inspection records was 0. 87 % (95 % CI: 0. 79 - 0. 94). The study 2 was performed on thirty-six pigs and did not revealed porcine cysticercosis by tongue examination. Nevertheless, a case of porcine cysticercosis was observed at meat inspection and 72. 22 % of collected sera were tested positive by Ag-ELISA (26 positive on 36).

Their work is characterized by intensive and at times adverse contact with inspectees, yet limited interaction with their colleagues.

40|$|Public professionalism is {{increasingly}} subject to organizational and societal pressures, {{which has led}} to ambiguity concerning its nature. Professionals face conflicting situations due to potential clashes between multifaceted professional, organizational, and societal factors. This raises questions about how these factors affect professional work, how professionals experience conflicts and how they cope. We investigate such conflicts, confusion, and coping strategies in a group of <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors.</b> Using semi-structured interviews, we analyse their work and link the resulting insights to different perspectives on professionalism. We show that workers experience conflicts as less stressful when they accept organizational factors, or when they are able to enact a more integrated set of professional/organizational work principles. We call this organizing professionalism. We trace factors that hinder and favour such organizing coping strategies...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between tail lesions, cold carcass weight and viscera condemnations in an Irish abattoir. The following data were collected at the evisceration point from every 3 rd pig slaughtered over 7 days: farm identification, sex, tail lesion score, viscera inspection outcome and cold carcass weight. Tail lesions were scored according to a 5 point scale. Disease lesions responsible for lung (pleurisy, pneumonia and abscess), heart (pericarditis) and liver (ascariasis) condemnation were recorded based on the decision of the <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspector.</b> Data on 3, 143 pigs from 61 batches were available. The relationship between disease lesions, tail lesion score and cold carcass weight was studied at individual carcass level, whereas the relationship between disease lesions and tail lesion score was studied at both carcass and batch level. Tail lesions (score ≥ 1) were found in 72 % of the study population, with 2. 3 % affected by severe tail lesions (scores ≥ 3). Pleurisy (13. 7 %) followed by pneumonia (10. 4 %) showed the highest prevalence, whereas the prevalence of ascariasis showed the greatest variation between batches (0 to 75 %). Tail lesion score, pleurisy, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis were associated with reductions in carcass cold weight (P ≤ 0. 05) ranging from 3 to 6. 6 kg. Tail lesion score was associated with condemnations for pleurisy, pneumonia and pleuropneumonia (P ≤ 0. 05) at a batch level. <b>Veterinary</b> <b>inspector</b> shift was associated with condemnations for pneumonia, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis (P ≤ 0. 05) at a carcass level and with pneumonia at a batch level. Sex was not associated with viscera condemnations but males were more likely to be affected by tail lesions. The relationship between overall tail lesion score and the lung diseases at batch level supports the relationship between poor health and poor welfare of pigs on farms. The inclusion of tail lesion scores at post mortem meat inspection should be considered as a health and welfare diagnostic tool...|$|R

40|$|A sero-epidemiological {{survey of}} Taenia saginata {{cysticercosis}} {{was carried out}} to determine the prevalence of the infection in cattle presented for slaughter in Belgium. Between November 1997 and June 1998, a total of 1164 serum samples were collected in 20 export abattoirs. Meat inspection was routinely carried out by <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors.</b> Serum samples were examined for circulating parasite antigen using a monoclonal antibody-based sandwich enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA). Thirty six serum samples (3. 09 %) were found positive in the Ag-ELISA, while by meat inspection on the same animals cysticerci were detected in only three carcasses (0. 26 %).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the seroprevalence of brucellosis among high-risk group individuals, consisting of veterinarians and para-veterinarians, shepherds, butchers and animal owners. Methods: The present work was carried out at Project Directorate on Animal Disease Monitoring and Surveillance, Bangalore, by using the recently developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to Brucella abortus. Results: The results were compared with the conventional serological tests, Rose Bengal plate test and standard tube agglutination test.
