5|$|At the 2008 U.S. National Championships in Boston, Liukin fell on {{the floor}} on her double front tuck {{the first day of}} competition, but had a strong meet on her other events and placed second in the {{all-around}} behind Shawn Johnson. She regained her national champion title on the beam and defended her national title on the uneven bars for the fourth consecutive year, scoring a 17.050 in <b>preliminaries</b> and a 17.100 in finals, the highest recorded score for any American gymnast at any event since the advent of the new Code of Points. In June, Liukin competed in the U.S. Olympic Trials in Philadelphia, finishing second behind Johnson and earning a berth on the American team for Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{was named}} to the United States' under-20 team for the 2009 World Junior Championships in Ottawa, Ontario. He was joined on the {{national}} team by Spokane Chiefs teammates Tyler Johnson and Mitchell Wahl. Playing against Germany in the first game of <b>preliminaries,</b> he scored twice and was named player of the game. Over six games at the tournament, Bowman totalled three goals and one assist, tying for fifth in team point-scoring. After losing to Slovakia 5–3 in the quarterfinal, the United States beat the Czech Republic 3–2 in overtime of their placement game to rank fifth in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Summer Olympics, {{the stadium}} hosted the {{football}} <b>preliminaries.</b> For the next 50 years, the stadium changed little, although during the Second World War the North Bank terrace was bombed {{and had to}} be rebuilt; the roof was not restored until 1956. Floodlights were fitted in 1951, with the first floodlit match being a friendly against Hapoel Tel Aviv on 19 September of that year. The floodlights that adorn Dalymount Park, once stood at the Arsenal stadium. They were shipped to Dublin in 1962. The inaugural floodlit match saw Arsenal beat Bohemians 3–8. Undersoil heating was added in 1964. Unlike at many other grounds, Arsenal refused to install perimeter fencing, even at the height of hooliganism in the 1980s, which made it ineligible for use as an FA Cup semi-final venue.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} vacation, while the first-string team {{plays in the}} prefectural {{qualifying}} tournament for Koshien, Maeno has the portable team practice at a recently closed elementary school with the support from a mysterious old man. The portable team also has six practice matches with other local high schools, all of which reached semifinals or higher in the regional <b>preliminaries.</b> Near {{the end of summer}} vacation, the interim principal decides to dissolve the portable team. However, Coach Maeno asks for a rematch scrimmage with the first-string team, after which the losing team would be dissolved and that coach would leave. The portable team, playing with Aoba, wins a narrow victory. The first-string team is dissolved, and the head coach and the interim principal leave to work at other schools.|$|E
5|$|Then 22-year-old Nicholas Bovell participated on Trinidad and Tobago's behalf at Beijing in the men's 200meters {{individual}} medley.

5|$|During {{his next}} {{appearance}} at the 2003 World Championships in Finland, Luongo began the tournament as backup to the Phoenix Coyotes' Sean Burke. He earned wins against Latvia in the <b>preliminaries</b> and Switzerland in the qualifying round. During the semifinals against the Czech Republic, Luongo replaced Burke {{after he left the}} game with a lower-body injury eight minutes into the second period. Luongo allowed four goals in relief, but earned the win as Canada defeated the Czechs 8–4. With Burke still out for the gold medal game, Luongo made 49 saves against Sweden in a 3–2 overtime win. Despite Luongo's medal round efforts, Burke was named the Best Goaltender for the tournament, as he played in the majority of Team Canada's games. The gold-medal winning 2003 team was later named the Canadian Press national sports team of the year on January 2, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Former Dalhousie University {{student and}} {{national}} record holder Kiera Aitken participated {{on behalf of}} Bermuda for her second Olympic appearance after the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Aitken participated in the August 10 <b>preliminaries</b> for the 100meters women's backstroke, where she was placed in Heat 1 with Paraguay's Maria Virginia Baez and Panama's Christie Marie Bodden Baca. With a time of 1:02.62, Aitken ranked first in her heat, defeating Baez by almost three seconds. However, her overall ranking placed her thirty-third out of forty-nine swimmers between Alana Dillette of the Bahamas (32nd) and Hiu Wai Sherry Tsai of Hong Kong (34th). Aitken was 3.62 seconds slower than Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe, who set an Olympic record during the preliminary round {{with a time of}} 59.00seconds.

5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard <b>preliminaries</b> because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E
5|$|Lucas Rafael Bennazar Ortíz {{participated in}} the Beijing Olympics as Puerto Rico's only sharpshooter. Born in the {{northern}} city of Guaynabo, Bennazar first {{participated in the}} Olympics as a 35-year-old in Athens that competed in the men's trap shooting and double trap.

5|$|On 21 February 1809, a large French fleet under Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez {{attempted}} to escape Brest and was chased by the blockade squadron and driven to shelter under the Ile d'Aix. Shortly afterwards, three French frigates {{attempted to}} break out of Lorient, but were challenged and destroyed at the Action of 24 February 1809. These operations were the <b>preliminaries</b> to the Battle of Basque Roads in April, but also provided the cover required for Troude's force to escape Lorient while the British were engaged elsewhere. Travelling rapidly across the Atlantic, the French encountered no British warships but were able to seize a number of lone British merchant ships, from whom Troude learned that the invasion of Martinique was already underway. While Troude's expedition had been preparing at Lorient, Cochrane had been preparing his own operation to Martinique, following the interception of the same despatches warning of the island's low morale and preparedness in the summer of 1808. Amassing an expeditionary force of 44 ships and 10,000 men at Carlisle Bay, Barbados, Cochrane began the invasion on 30 January 1809 and his troops rapidly overran the French defences, despite stiff resistance in the central highlands. By 10 February, the only remaining point in French hands was Fort Desaix, which held out until the magazine was breached on 24 February, at which point Governor Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse surrendered unconditionally.|$|E
5|$|The Breves causae and Argumenta {{belong to}} a pre-Vulgate {{tradition}} of manuscripts. The Breves causae are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are not used on the text pages of the Gospels. It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations {{and would have been}} difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text. The Argumenta are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The Breves causae and Argumenta are arranged in a strange order: first come the Breves causae and Argumenta for Matthew, followed by the Breves and Argumenta for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the Argumenta of both Luke and John, followed by their Breves causae. This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow, although in the latter instance, the misplaced sections appear {{at the very end of}} the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary. In other insular manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Book of Armagh, and the Echternach Gospels, each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its <b>preliminaries</b> immediately preceding it. The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the Breves causae and Argumenta found in Durrow led scholar T. K. Abbott to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand.|$|E
5|$|The <b>preliminaries</b> to the furnace's {{construction}} {{began in}} 1885, when Valentine and Thomas, an old ironmaking firm of Bellefonte, {{decided to sell}} off its properties. These then consisted of Bellefonte Forge, on Logan Branch just south of Bellefonte, and Bellefonte Furnace, a cold blast charcoal iron furnace lying about a mile south of the town, also on Logan Branch, as well as holdings in local iron ore mines. Both plants were served by the Bellefonte, Nittany and Lemont Railroad, {{a subsidiary of the}} PRR. The ironworks and ore lands were bought on August 2, 1886, for $400,000, by the Valentine Ore Land Association, whose principals organized the Centre Iron Company to erect a new iron furnace on the site of Bellefonte Furnace, which was to be torn down. A $600,000 mortgage was immediately raised on the properties, to supply the purchase money and funds for rebuilding the furnace. The leaders of the company included Edmund Blanchard, W. M. Stewart, and B. K. Jamison, a Philadelphia banker. The plant was built in 1887, and the Nittany Valley Railroad was built to supply it with ore. It became necessary to raise additional funds, and in 1887, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased $75,000 worth of bonds in exchange for exclusive rights to rail traffic to and from the furnace. The first load of ore was delivered by the Nittany Valley on February 28, 1888, and the furnace went into blast on March 4, 1888. The company was originally headed by Jamison, but by 1890, James B. Coryell was president and Jamison vice-president. At this time, the furnace had one 70-foot (21-meter) stack and three hot-blast stoves, with a capacity of 30,000tons (27,200tonnes) of iron per year. Ore was supplied from local hematite deposits, and the furnace was fuelled by Connellsville coke. In the same year, however, the failure of Jamison's bank precipitated the closure of the furnace by the sheriff on November 15, 1890. It was subsequently sold under foreclosure.|$|E

25|$|The grave/acute {{distinction}} {{has lost}} its relevance in modern phonetics (though it may still be relevant to other disciplines). It dates from relatively early {{in the days of}} acoustic phonetics, when some phonologists believed that one could categorize all speech sounds by means of a finite set of acoustically-defined distinctive features. These were supposed to correspond to auditory impressions of sounds. The pioneering publication for this was Jakobson, Fant and Halle (1951) <b>Preliminaries</b> to Speech Analysis (MIT). The feature(s) grave/acute were defined primarily in acoustic terms (with some reference to auditory qualities), but were given a secondary description (or gloss) in terms of their articulation. Features like grave/acute could be used to divide speech sounds into broad classes. For most phoneticians, the JF features had been superseded by 1968 by the articulatory features set out in Chomsky and Halle’s Sound Pattern of English and by competing articulatory features devised by Ladefoged in such publications as <b>Preliminaries</b> to Linguistic Phonetics (1971).|$|E

Nevertheless, with French forces under pressure on other fronts Louis XIV was willing to manoeuvre for peace at Philip V's expense, and after the <b>Preliminaries</b> had been rejected he withdrew much of his army from Spain to encourage his grandson's voluntary abdication. However, by now Louis XIV had far less influence over Philip V than the Allies realised, and surrendering Spain was not something which the Spanish King, now firmly established on his throne and enjoying the support of the majority of his subjects, would countenance.|$|E
