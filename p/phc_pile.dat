Reinforced PHC piles {{make use}} of nonprestressed steel bars to {{reinforce}} the initial steel cage, with the intent being to invent novel piles that have better flexural properties than the conventional PHC piles. In this study, a comprehensive test program was carried out with 12 full-scale test piles to compare the flexural properties of {{two different types of}} PHC piles. The flexural stiffness of the reinforced <b>PHC</b> <b>pile</b> is greater than the flexural stiffness of the conventional <b>PHC</b> <b>pile.</b> The Reinforced <b>PHC</b> <b>pile</b> and the conventional <b>PHC</b> <b>pile</b> exhibited similar axial stress development, planar section remained in pile mid-span during the initial period and the neutral axis shifted upward after concrete cracking. The cracking patterns and failure modes for two different types of PHC piles are evidently different.

40|$|The high {{population}} density in Hong Kong necessitates the adoption of heavy infrastructures and high-rise buildings for public and private uses. These heavy infrastructures and high-rise buildings require the support of pile foundations. Among different pile types, the prestressed spun high strength concrete (<b>PHC)</b> <b>pile</b> {{is probably the most}} economical. Moreover, it has a smaller carbon footprint than the steel H-pile of comparable design load-carrying capacity. Installation of PHC piles by percussion is probably the most economical. However, noise, vibration and air pollution problems are often inseparable from percussion of piles. Innovative installation techniques for PHC piles to achieve environmental friendliness, quality and rapid construction, and economy are always in demand.

40|$|Comparable {{tests of}} a static load test (SLT) and a rapid load test called Statnamic (STN) on a <b>PHC</b> <b>pile</b> {{constructed}} in a gravel layer {{were carried out}} in 1993. A gas explosion pressure {{is applied to the}} pile head in the STN test without the use of reaction piles. The duration of the Statnamic loading event is approximately 100 ms. The applied force and displacement are recorded at the pile head during the STN test. The velocity and acceleration of the pile head are derived from the measured displacement. Relatively large velocity and acceleration were observed in this particular STN test. The load-displacement curve directly measured in the STN test was deviated from that obtained from the SLT. Dynamic effects due to inertial force of the pile body and penetration dependent force were adjusted by means of an interpretation method, unloading point method, of the STN test. Thus derived load-displacement curve was comparable with the SLT curve. Axial force distributions in the SLT and the STN test were also very similar. 金沢大学理工研究域環境デザイン学...|$|E

In order to study the failure mechanics and failure modes of wind power structure subjected to typhoon, the typhoon wind field in Dongtai wind farm is simulated based on the classical autoregressive (AR) model and a regional power-spectrum-density (PSD) model, and the simulated spectrum is verified {{to be in good}} agreement with the target spectrum. An integrated finite element (FE) model of wind power structure, composed of rotor, nacelle, tower, <b>pile</b> cap, and <b>PHC</b> <b>piles,</b> is established. Modal analysis reveals that pile stiffness decreases the structure’s natural frequencies, especially for high order frequencies. Structural responses under the simulated typhoon are calculated by dynamic analysis. Results show that tower buckling is the most prone failure mode of the structure.

40|$|At present, {{in large}} precast {{concrete}} enterprises, the management over precast concrete component has been chaotic. Most enterprises take labor-intensive manual input method, which is time consuming and laborious, and error-prone. Some other slightly better enterprises choose to manage through bar-code or printing serial number manually. However, on one hand, {{this is also}} labor-intensive, on the other hand, this method is limited by external environment, making the serial number blur or even lost, and also causes a big problem on production traceability and quality accountability. Therefore, to realize the enterprise’s own rapid development and cater {{to the needs of}} the time, to achieve the automated production management has been a big problem for a modern enterprise. In order to solve the problem, inefficiency in production and traceability of the products, this thesis try to introduce RFID technology into the production of <b>PHC</b> tubular <b>pile.</b> By designing a production management system of precast concrete components, the enterprise will achieve the control of the entire production process, and realize the informatization of enterprise production management. RFID technology has been widely used in many fields like entrance control, charge management, logistics and so on. RFID technology will adopt passive RFID tag, which is waterproof, shockproof, anti-interference, so it’s suitable for the actual working environment. The tag will be bound to the precast component steel cage (the structure of the <b>PHC</b> tubular <b>pile</b> before the concrete placement), which means each <b>PHC</b> tubular <b>pile</b> will have a unique ID number. Then according to the production procedure, the precast component will be performed with a series of actions, put the steel cage into the mold, mold clamping, pouring concrete (feed), stretching, centrifugalizing, maintenance, mold removing, welding splice. In every session of the procedure, the information of the precast components can be read through a RFID reader. Using a portable smart device connected to the database, the user can check, inquire and management the production information conveniently. Also, the system can trace the production parameter and the person in charge, realize the traceability of the information. This system can overcome the disadvantages in precast components manufacturers, like inefficiency, error-prone, time consuming, labor intensity, low information relevance and so on. This system can help to improve the production management efficiency, and can produce a good economic and social benefits, so, this system has a certain practical value...|$|R

To study the performance of a PHC pipe pile under hydraulic jacking, the monitoring of the strain profile along the PHC pipe pile under hydraulic jacking was carried out using FBG sensing technology. In this study, a PHC pipe pile was instrumented with two series of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors along pile axial direction and was then installed in the field using a hydraulic jacking method. To monitor the variation of strains along a <b>PHC</b> <b>pile,</b> two series of eight FBG strain sensors with different peak wavelengths were mounted {{on opposite sides of the}} pile with one meter spacing. In addition, based on the pile theory, both the axial force of the pile and average shear stress on the pile surface are calculated using the measured axial strains. It is found that there were significant residual strains in the piles after installation when hydraulic force was removed.
