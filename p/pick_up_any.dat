5|$|The MTB had {{withdrawn}} {{out of range}} at about 01:30, but not before it had suffered engine damage; a bullet had disabled the starboard engine. After 10 minutes it moved back inshore hoping to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>any</b> survivors. It was again located by the Germans at about 02:30. The MTB was forced to withdraw once again under increasingly heavy mortar and machine gun fire. Unable to locate any survivors, it recrossed the German minefield and arrived back in Portsmouth at 10:00.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player can <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>any</b> staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Ladd and the {{commander}} of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>any</b> survivors. The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed. It was not until 15:00 hours that the relief effort was launched and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.|$|E

25|$|Internationally, Hall was {{initially}} thought of solely as a limited overs cricket specialist {{and made his}} ODI debut against the West Indies at Durban in 1999. He was a regular in the ODI side until 2007, taking part in South Africa's 2003 Cricket World Cup squad and the 2007 Cricket World Cup.

Bibras Natkho's goal gave Rubin Kazan the lead at half-time; their lead would have been greater had Dan Murray not cleared Obafemi Martins' effort off the line. Rubin Kazan scored twice {{in the second half}} to complete the scoring, although Karl Sheppard did hit the bar late in the game.|$|E
25|$|Tait {{missed the}} opening {{half of the}} 2005–06 Pura Cup season with an injury to his right {{shoulder}} which he sustained on the 2005 Ashes tour.

While he failed to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>any</b> wickets against Pakistan A, he managed to take 3/67 in India A's first innings.

25|$|The club's European {{campaign}} {{concluded with}} a 4–0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur; a result that meant that Rovers failed to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>any</b> points during the group stage. In what was only their second competitive fixture {{since the end of}} the domestic season, Rovers had the better of the opening minutes and should have taken the lead after only 2 minutes, but James Paterson's effort was wrongly ruled out for offside. Steven Pienaar's first goal for Tottenham was the first goal of the match. Andros Townsend and Jermain Defoe scored Tottenham's second and third goals respectively. Although Tottenham did score a fourth goal through Harry Kane, it was Rovers who had the best of the second half, while both Jake Livermore and Carlo Cudicini were lucky to avoid red cards after bringing down Rovers players when they were through on goal. This was Michael O'Neill's final match in charge of the club.|$|E
