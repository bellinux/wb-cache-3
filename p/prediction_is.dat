5|$|In {{the first}} round, the contestants {{are asked to}} predict the most popular answer to each of three {{question}}s. Each question has three multiple choice options, and was asked {{to a group of}} 100 men. The panel is allowed to offer their opinion on the correct answer while the contestants submit their answers on their tablet computers. Each correct <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> worth $200.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prediction</b> <b>is</b> a rate {{enhancement}} {{strategy in}} which the device attempts to predict the letter, word or phrase being written by the user. The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the full word. Word prediction software may determine the words predicted based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices of the user, or grammatical suitability.|$|E
5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk {{to the point}} that he is unable to complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the wall. On the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E
30|$|After that, in step 3 {{for each}} of the action options, <b>predictions</b> <b>were</b> made of the action {{consequences}} for future states of the system. All <b>predictions</b> <b>were</b> computed by forward simulation of the agent-based model, while the considered conditions of the action option evaluated <b>were</b> applied. <b>Predictions</b> <b>were</b> based on N= 100 simulations of each scenario. A <b>prediction</b> <b>was</b> determined as the mean value of the number of passengers in the security checkpoint queue over time.|$|R
30|$|In the anterior-posterior plane, Pr <b>prediction</b> <b>was</b> {{the most}} {{accurate}} landmark (0.65  mm), followed by B’ (0.66  mm). Me’ was the least accurate (3.57  mm) landmark, followed by Li (2.31  mm). In the vertical direction, {{the tip of the}} nose <b>prediction</b> <b>was</b> {{the most accurate}} measurement (0.75  mm) while the lower lip <b>prediction</b> <b>was</b> the least accurate (3.86).|$|R
30|$|Similar <b>predictions</b> <b>were</b> {{reported}} by [18] using WAsP V 11. The errors vary in sign and are sometimes large. However, good <b>predictions</b> <b>are</b> obtained for site pair combinations involving Nyiru and Sirima mast locations, {{including all the}} self-prediction cases.|$|R
5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{numerical}} weather <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> {{to sample the}} state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate {{the state of the}} fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Sites launch radiosondes, which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the stratosphere. Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available. Compared with similar data from radiosondes, the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage, however at a lower accuracy and resolution. Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity, which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time. Additionally, if a pulse Doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined.|$|E
25|$|Behavior <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> also {{derived from}} goals. Behavior <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> to {{acknowledge}} {{the likelihood that a}} habit will form, but in order to form that habit, a goal must have been initially present. The influence of goals on habits is what makes a habit different from other automatic processes in the mind.|$|E
30|$|In tFISH, the <b>predictions</b> <b>are</b> {{repeated}} by progressively {{updating the}} offshore tsunami-waveform data. Because individual <b>predictions</b> can <b>be</b> calculated {{in less than}} one minute, tsunami <b>predictions</b> can <b>be</b> updated at short intervals of time, thus providing successive tsunami predictions with improved accuracy.|$|R
25|$|Generally such <b>predictions</b> <b>are</b> {{overly optimistic}} in timescale.|$|R
30|$|The best <b>predictions</b> <b>were</b> {{obtained}} with elastoplastic models.|$|R
25|$|International Sunspot Number—sunspot maximum {{and minimum}} 1610–present; annual numbers 1700–present; monthly numbers 1749–present; daily values 1818–present; and sunspot numbers by {{north and south}} hemisphere. The McNish–Lincoln sunspot <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> also included.|$|E
25|$|Accurate secondary-structure <b>{{prediction}}</b> <b>is</b> a {{key element}} in the prediction of tertiary structure, in all but the simplest (homology modeling) cases. For example, a confidently predicted pattern of six secondary structure elements βαββαβ is the signature of a ferredoxin fold.|$|E
25|$|ARPS the Advanced Region Prediction System {{developed}} at the University of Oklahoma is a comprehensive multi-scale nonhydrostatic simulation and prediction system {{that can be used}} for regional-scale weather prediction up to the tornado-scale simulation and prediction. Advanced radar data assimilation for thunderstorm <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> a key part of the system..|$|E
50|$|Generally such <b>predictions</b> <b>are</b> {{overly optimistic}} in timescale.|$|R
50|$|The <b>prediction</b> <b>was</b> {{fulfilled}} spiritually {{rather than}} physically.|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of the present status of J/psi suppression in pA and nucleus-nucleus interactions is presented. In both cases, model <b>predictions</b> <b>are</b> summarized and compared to the data. The ''anomalous'' J/psi suppression in Pb+Pb collisions is discussed in some detail. <b>Predictions</b> <b>are</b> also shown for quarkonium suppression at collider energies...|$|R
25|$|However, futures {{contracts}} {{also offer}} opportunities for speculation in that a trader who {{predicts that the}} price of an asset will move in a particular direction can contract to buy or sell it in the future at a price which (if the <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> correct) will yield a profit.|$|E
25|$|Operon <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> {{even more}} {{accurate}} if the functional {{class of the}} molecules is considered. Bacteria have clustered their reading frames into units, sequestered by co-involvement in protein complexes, common pathways, or shared substrates and transporters. Thus, accurate prediction would involve all of these data, a difficult task indeed.|$|E
25|$|Class <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> more {{difficult}} than class discovery, but it allows one to answer questions of direct clinical significance such as, given this profile, what is the probability that this patient will respond to this drug? This requires many examples of profiles that responded and did not respond, as well as cross-validation techniques to discriminate between them.|$|E
40|$|Long {{term and}} short term HF {{propagation}} <b>prediction</b> service <b>is</b> described. The long term <b>prediction</b> method <b>is</b> computer based. The short term <b>prediction</b> method <b>is</b> still a manual method which relies mainly {{on a number}} of continuous field strength recordings and on the forecaster's ability to interpret the recordings and to combine this information with all available solar-geophysical data. Examples of the <b>predictions</b> <b>are</b> given and are compared with actually observed HF propagation conditions...|$|R
30|$|All <b>predictions</b> <b>are</b> {{evaluated}} {{using the}} cost function g 2.|$|R
50|$|Separate sets of <b>predictions</b> <b>are</b> {{developed}} for hitters and pitchers.|$|R
25|$|Earthquake <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> {{a branch}} of the science of {{seismology}} concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits. Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.|$|E
25|$|However, {{since the}} Schrödinger {{equation}} is a wave equation, a single particle fired through a double-slit does show this same pattern (figure on right). Note: The experiment must be repeated many {{times for the}} complex pattern to emerge. Although this is counterintuitive, the <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> correct; in particular, electron diffraction and neutron diffraction are well understood and widely used in science and engineering.|$|E
25|$|Optimizing {{the speed}} and {{accuracy}} of these steps for use in large-scale automated structure <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> {{a key component of}} structural genomics initiatives, partly because the resulting volume of data will be too large to process manually and partly because the goal of structural genomics requires providing models of reasonable quality to researchers who are not themselves structure prediction experts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Predictions</b> <b>are</b> used {{to support}} {{decision-making}} processes and policy decisions.|$|R
30|$|This is a {{commonly}} used method that was first proposed by Hausman (1981). Implicitly, {{it is assumed}} that the <b>predictions</b> <b>are</b> made with no errors or that the <b>prediction</b> errors <b>are</b> ignorable.|$|R

25|$|Numerical Weather <b>Prediction</b> <b>is</b> a {{main focus}} in {{understanding}} air–sea interaction, tropical meteorology, atmospheric predictability, and tropospheric/stratospheric processes. The Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, developed a global atmospheric model called Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS). NOGAPS is run operationally at Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center for the United States Military. Many other global atmospheric models {{are run by}} national meteorological agencies.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows that}} the heat {{capacity}} of the gas is (3/2)NkB and hence, in particular, the heat capacity of a mole of such gas particles is (3/2)NAkB= (3/2)R, where NA is the Avogadro constant and R is the gas constant. Since R ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K), equipartition predicts that the molar heat capacity of an ideal gas is roughly 3cal/(mol·K). This <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> confirmed by experiment.|$|E
25|$|Statisticians use {{hierarchical}} linear modeling {{to predict}} the score for a given student in a given classroom in a given school. This <b>prediction</b> <b>is</b> based on aggregated results of all students. Each student's predicted score may take into account student level (e.g., past performance, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity), teacher level (e.g., certification, years of experience, highest degree earned, teaching practices, instructional materials, curriculum) and school level (e.g., size, type, setting) variables into consideration. Which variables are included depends on the model.|$|E
