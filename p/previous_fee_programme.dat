5000|$|Finland {{abolished}} its television fee on 1 January 2013, {{replacing it}} with a ring fenced so-called [...] "Yle tax". Unlike the <b>previous</b> <b>fee,</b> the tax is progressive, meaning that people who earn less will pay less and vice versa - from €50 to €140, depending on income. However, the new tax is also applied to all adults and not just once per household, meaning in essence that under the new system, some will pay less than before and others will pay more. Very low-income earners are completely exempt from the Yle tax.|$|R

40|$|Additional contributor: Tom Batina (faculty mentor) This {{research}} {{is designed to}} understand the impact the financial crisis has had on audit fees (the amount payable to auditors for an audit). We sought to determine whether increased financial risk drove increased audit risk {{and an increase in}} audit <b>fees.</b> <b>Previous</b> <b>fee</b> research has not been updated since 2005. Our hypotheses for the result are: 1. The audit fees for financial service companies have increased since 2006 due to portfolio valuation and going concern issues. 2. The audit fees for non-financial service companies have decreased resulting from economic pressures experienced by firms’ audit clients that translate to audit fee reductions. 3. Audit fees at the largest CPA firms have been flat or declined since 2007...|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{experimental}} digital television recordings were made, {{but at the}} time only in studios. From 1988 seniors of 70 years were exempted from payment of the licence <b>fee.</b> Minority <b>programmes</b> in other languages began too: these programmes were recorded generally in regional studios, primarily in Pécs and Szeged. MTV2 was given some independence from its sister channel MTV1, and just like at the BBC, they were given separate controllers.|$|R

40|$|The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) was amended in 1988 {{to require}} the reregistration of all {{pesticides}} registered before 1984 within 9 years. The FIFRA 88 required that all pesticide active ingredients must meet current registration standards, suspended the <b>previous</b> <b>fee</b> structure, and imposed a one-time registration fee and annual maintenance fees. New data generated because of FIFRA 88 must conform to EPA 2 ̆ 7 s Good Laboratory Practice Standards and animal studies must follow guidelines of the Animal Welfare Act. FIFRA 88 has significantly increased data requirements, data costs, and other pesticide registration and reregistration costs for most pesticides. The increased financial burden has caused industry and governmental agencies to drop minor-use registrations that could not generate sufficient profit to pay for reregistration. During 1989, over 19, 000 pesticide registrations were canceled because of the imposition of annual maintenance fees levied by FIFRA 88. More registrations will be canceled in 1990 as registrants find {{that it is not}} cost-effective to provide data for many minor-use pesticides. This will result in the loss or further use restrictions on chemicals critical to manage vertebrate pests. In addition, the reregistration process will divert funds from research on alternative pest management practices at a time when that research is critically needed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of auditor-management {{alignment}} on audit opinion over the period 2003 - 2011 on 81 firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange using logistic regression analysis. Results indicate that in companies with auditor-management alignment, auditor change level is low. In addition, the results indicate there is no relationship between auditor-management alignment, debt ratio, ownership percentage, firm size and auditor change with unqualified audit opinion. However, research evidences show that auditor's opinion type at <b>previous</b> year, audit <b>fees,</b> auditor type and return on assets ratio influence unqualified audit opinion. Among above variables, auditor's opinion types at <b>previous</b> year, audit <b>fees</b> and return on assets ratio have direct relationship with unqualified audit opinion but auditor type has a negative and inverse relationship with unqualified audit opinion...|$|R

The line now ends at Hudson; the 13-km distance between Rigaud and Hudson represented some 17% of the line's total length.
