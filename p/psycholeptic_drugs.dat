40|$|Background: The {{association}} of mental disorder with cardiac disease {{is not a}} coincidence rather a strong relationship exists in between those two. Objective: We investigated the prescription pattern of <b>psycholeptic</b> <b>drugs</b> during the discharge of patients in a national cardiovascular hospital. Methods: Data was collected from the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) at Dhaka in Bangladesh. In total, 1076 prescriptions were collected randomly from July 2012 to June 2013. Data were analyzed by using the software Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS, version 22). Results: Benzodiazepine was the highest (99. 3...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} {{and evaluate}} drug utilisation {{in a sample}} of Dutch nursing homes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of computerised medication data of 2355 residents aged 65 years and over from six nursing homes in the Netherlands was performed. For each therapeutic drug group, the number of users was determined. The ten therapeutic groups used most frequently were investigated further. For these, patient characteristics, use of therapeutic subgroups, the average daily dosages and the chronicity of drug use were determined. Chronicity was expressed as the percentage of treatment days divided by the number of residents' days in the nursing home. Results: During the study period, 89 %, 77 % and 56 % of the study population used a drug from the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) main group N (nervous system), A (alimentary tract and metabolism) and C (cardiovascular system), respectively. Eight of the ten therapeutic drug groups prescribed most frequently were used for more than 50 % of the time. In particular, <b>psycholeptic</b> <b>drugs,</b> diuretics and laxatives were used chronically (83 %, 81 %, and 80 % of the nursing home stay, respectively). Except for a few drug groups, such as laxatives and diuretics, the prescribed daily dosages were relatively low. Twenty-eight percent of the residents received loop diuretics; these were prescribed in relatively high dosages. Conclusion: Drug utilisation in the nursing homes was high and many drugs were used chronically. In view of the risk of possible adverse effects and drug-drug interactions, the prescribing and dosage of <b>psycholeptic</b> <b>drugs,</b> laxatives, loop diuretics and ulcer-healing drugs should be re-evaluated, carefully...|$|E
40|$|Linalool is a {{monoterpene}} {{often found}} {{as a major}} component of essential oils obtained from aromatic plant species., many of which are used in traditional medical systems as hypno-sedatives. Psychopharmacological evaluations of linalool (i. p. and i. c. v.) revealed marked sedative and anticonvulsant central effects in various mouse models. Considering this profile and alleged effects of inhaled lavender essential oil, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the sedative effects of inhaled linalool in mice. Mice were placed in an inhalation chamber during 60 min, in an atmosphere saturated with 1 % or 3 % linalool. Immediately after inhalation, animals were evaluated regarding locomotion, barbiturate-induced sleeping time, body temperature: and motor coordination (rota-rod test). The 1 % and 3 % linalool increased (p < 0. 01) pentobarbital sleeping time and reduced (p< 0. 01) body temperature. The 3 % linalool decreased (p< 0. 01) locomotion. Motor coordination was not affected. Hence, linalool inhaled for I h seems to induce sedation without significant impairment in motor abilities, a side effect shared by most <b>psycholeptic</b> <b>drugs.</b> (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{prescribing}} medication in palliative {{end-of-life care}} should be symptom control. Data are lacking regarding the prescription of medication {{at the end of}} life. AIM: To investigate the prescription of medication in patients {{at the end of life}} in palliative care facilities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An observational multicenter study in 7 inpatient palliative care facilities. Participants were adults with an estimated life expectancy of less than 3 months. The study was conducted from February 1, 2012, to January 1, 2013. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients were enrolled. On average, patients were prescribed 6. 1 drugs at the moment of admission and 4. 6 drugs on the day of death. The prescription of analgesics, <b>psycholeptics,</b> and <b>drugs</b> for functional gastrointestinal disorders increased from admission until death. In general, these are drug classes prescribed for symptom control. All other drug classes decreased between admission and the day of death, including different drug classes for the treatment of comorbid disease, such as anticoagulants, beta-blocking agents, drugs used in diabetes, and lipid-modifying agents. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A reduction in the total amount of medication is seen between admission and death in the palliative care facilities. Although there is an increase in prescribed symptom-specific medication and a reduction in medication prescribed for comorbid disease, there are still patients dying with medication not used for symptom control. This increases pill burden and indicates that physicians need to develop guidelines and educational programs for decreasing medication for comorbidities at the end of life...|$|R
40|$|Dose {{adjustment}} of psychotropic drugs {{in patients with}} liver cirrhosis may be important as most of these drugs are predominantly eliminated by the liver {{and many of them}} are associated with dose-dependent adverse reactions. As no surrogate parameter is available to predict hepatic metabolism of drugs, dose adjustment according to pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs is proposed. Psychotropic drugs (antiepileptics, antiparkinsonian <b>drugs,</b> <b>psycholeptics</b> such as antipsychotics, anxiolytics, sedatives and hypnosedatives, and psychoanaleptics such as antidepressants, psychostimulants and antidementia drugs) marketed in Switzerland in 2006 were therefore classified according to their hepatic extraction and/or bioavailability to predict their kinetic behaviour in patients with cirrhosis. The expected changes in hepatic metabolism predicted by pharmacokinetic properties were compared with the results from kinetic studies carried out in patients with liver disease. These studies were identified using MEDLINE searches. Of the 116 psychotropic drugs available on the Swiss market by the year 2006, only 12 were predominantly eliminated through the kidney. For five substances, no Q(0) value (the dose fraction metabolized or excreted extra-renally) could be determined because of lack of pharmacokinetic data. Of 99 drugs with predominant hepatic metabolism, 29. 3 % were categorized as high, 25. 2 % as intermediate and 38. 4 % as low extraction drugs, while seven substances could not be classified. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with liver disease were available for 55 of these 99 drugs eliminated predominantly by the liver (Q(0) -value < or = 0. 5). Only a few kinetic studies in patients with liver disease were found for antipsychotics, antiparkinsonian drugs and antidepressants, except for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and some newer antidepressants. The expected changes in pharmacokinetics were generally in good agreement with the changes reported in pharmacokinetic studies. For 12 drugs, the observed changes in pharmacokinetics from clinical studies were different from the changes expected based on their classification. However, for low extraction drugs metabolized by cytochrome P 450 isozymes, clearance may be reduced by up to 50 %. In conclusion, the classification of drugs according to their hepatic extraction and/or bioavailability is a useful tool for dose adjustment, if information from clinical studies is lacking. There is a gap in information about pharmacokinetic changes in patients with liver cirrhosis for a large number of centrally acting drugs. Kinetic studies for centrally acting drugs with predominant hepatic metabolism should be carried out in patients with liver disease to allow precise dose recommendations for enhanced patient safety...|$|R
40|$|Persons with {{profound}} intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) {{suffer from a}} wide range of health problems and use a wide range of different drugs. This study investigated for frequently used medication whether there was a health problem documented in the medical notes for the drug prescribed. Persons with PIMD with an estimated intelligence quotient of 25 and profound or severe motor disorders were studied. Data on health problems were taken from medical notes and prescribing data were obtained from pharmacies. Data covering 1 year were analysed. For four therapeutic areas (anticonvulsants, laxatives, drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and psycholeptics), we determined whether we could find an indication for prescribed medication. Some 254 persons with PIMD (46 % male, 54 % female; median age 49 years, range 6 - 82) from eight residential facilities participated. Some 226 participants (89 %) were prescribed medication over the course of 1 year. An indication for the prescribed medication was documented for 92 % (n = 130) (95 % confidence interval 88 - 96 %) of 141 participants on anticonvulsants, for 68 % (n = 112) (61 - 75 %) of 165 participants on laxatives, for 44 % (n = 58) (36 - 52 %) of 132 participants on drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and for 89 % (n = 102) (83 - 95 %) of 115 participants on <b>psycholeptic</b> <b>drugs.</b> The best level of documentation was found for anticonvulsants the worst for drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Lack of documenting an indication may be due to off-label use, inadvertent continuation of no longer indicated medication, inadequate documentation and underdiagnosis. Adequate documentation practices are essential because of the communication problems that are characteristic for persons with PIMD...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceuticals {{have been}} {{detected}} in natural waters for more than forty years, but with improvements in sample preparation procedures and analytical instrumentation, the number of scientific publications on the issue has increased significantly. Even though the concentration of pharmaceutical residues in surface and drinking water is not critical for human health according to the present level of knowledge, the consequences for the environment are not clear. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) {{have been identified as}} the primary route of pharmaceuticals to the environment, with households as the major source point for most of the over-the-counter and prescription drugs. In this thesis, the first aim was to study the occurrence, fate and removal of 43 pharmaceuticals during conventional wastewater treatment. The target compounds were {{selected on the basis of}} their high consumption in Spain or/and frequently reported detection in wastewaters and the possibility to be analyzed under the same experimental conditions. They belong to different therapeutic classes, i. e. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and analgesics, lipid modifying agents, <b>psycholeptic</b> and antiepileptic <b>drugs,</b> beta-blocking agents, beta- 2 -adrenoreceptor agonists, H 2 -receptor antagonists, antibiotics, angiotensin converting enzyme agents, diuretics and antidiabetic drugs. A wide variation in removal efficiencies was observed even for individual compounds, and across therapeutic classes and treatment processes, without clear conclusion on the removal of any particular compound. According to mass balance calculations and estimated partition coefficients, the loss of the selected pharmaceuticals during biological wastewater treatment can be fully attributed to biodegradation/biotransformation. None of the studied compounds was entirely biodegraded and/or transformed during biological wastewater treatment, but the measured concentrations were below the levels of concern according to available toxicity data. Conventional WWTPs cannot be expected to be the only mechanism for controlling the entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment because they were neither designed nor can provide their complete removal. Therefore, the challenge is to look for solutions that would be the most economical and effective means of preventing further pollution of natural waters by pharmaceuticals. More appropriate management of sewage waters before they enter treatment plants as well as a stricter control of effluent discharges, along with an in-depth investigation on the development of new designs and strategies for the improvement of existing wastewater treatments should be considered. In light of this, as the second objective of this thesis, alternative approaches for the removal of the antiepileptic carbamazepine (CBZ) were studied in aqueous media in two laboratory scale experiments: a) biodegradation using white rot fungus T. versicolor in an air-pulsed fluidized bioreactor operated in batch and continuous modes, and b) advanced oxidation using TiO 2 -heterogeneous photocatalysis under simulated solar and UV-A irradiation, and under the combined use of ultrasound and UV-A irradiation (sonophotocatalysis). We selected CBZ as a representative example of compounds that are found to be refractory to biological treatment and ubiquitous in various environmental matrices. Both, the fungal and UVA-driven TiO 2 -photocatalytic treatments, very different in their nature, have been shown to be very effective in degrading carbamazepine in aqueous media. The fungal treatment resulted in average removals of 54 and 96 % in batch and continuous reactor, respectively. Acute toxicity test using the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri showed a decrease in toxicity during the treatment in both types of bioreactor. In the other study, initial CBZ concentrations were reduced for 95 % during 120 min of the UV-driven photocatalytic experiment and sonophotocatalysis, while only 10 % of CBZ was photodegraded during under solar irradiation. A slight increase in toxicity in Daphnia magna acute toxicity testing was observed over the time-course of the photocatalytic experiments, which can be associated with the formation of transformation products of CBZ. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for a tentative identification of the transformation products of CBZ formed during the performed experiments. Most of the tentatively identified intermediates exhibited only slight modifications of the CBZ molecular structure. The fungal as well as the photocatalytic processes yielded oxygenated transformation products. In the biological treatment using T. versicolor, transformation products were formed by enzymatic epoxidation and hydroxylation of seven-membered heterocyclic ring of the carbamazepine molecule. During the photocatalytic experiments, CBZ-related transformation products emerged from hydroxylation and further oxidation of different parts of the molecule of carbamazepine. The generated transformation products appeared to be more persistent than their parent compound, as they were present, although at low concentration, until the end of the experiments. The results of the thesis contribute to a better understanding of a) the magnitude of the selected pharmaceuticals that reach the environment through the wastewater and sludge discharge, b) the efficiency of typical conventional wastewater treatment plants regarding the removal of these compounds from raw wastewater, and c) possible developments of alternative technologies for their enhanced elimination. Desde hace más de cuarenta años se ha detectado la presencia de fármacos en el ciclo de aguas, sobre todo debido a los avances en la química analítica que han permitido el desarrollo de nuevas metodologías analíticas para la determinación de estos compuestos de modo fiable y a bajas concentraciones. Las estaciones depuradoras de aguas residuales (EDARs) han sido identificadas como la ruta principal de entrada de fármacos de origen humano en el medioambiente. Por tanto, el principal objetivo de esta tesis ha sido el estudio de la presencia, destino y eliminación de 43 fármacos seleccionados, durante el tratamiento convencional realizado en las EDARs. Los compuestos estudiados fueron seleccionados en base a los índices de consumo en España, a la frecuencia de detección en aguas residuales y además en base a la posibilidad de ser analizados bajo las mismas condiciones experimentales. Estos compuestos pertenecen a diferentes clases terapéuticas, i. e. antiinflamatorios no esteroideos, los agentes que reducen los lípidos séricos, ansiolíticos y antiepilépticos, los agentes bloqueadores beta-adrenérgicos, agonistas β 2 adrenérgico, antagonistas H 2, antibióticos, inhibidores de la enzima convertidora de angiotensina, diuréticos y antidiabéticos. Para el análisis cuantitativo se utilizó la cromatografía de líquidos acoplada a espectrometría de masas en tándem (LC-MS/MS), empleando un sistema híbrido triple quadrupolo/trampa de iones lineal. Como segundo objetivo hemos considerado evaluar tratamientos avanzados alternativos al tratamiento convencional para la eliminación de un fármaco antiepiléptico, la carbamazepina, uno de los compuestos más recalcitrantes al tratamiento biológico convencional. Se procedió a estudiar su degradación en medio acuoso mediante dos procedimientos a escala laboratorio: a) biodegradación utilizando el hongo ligninolitico Trametes Versicolor en un reactor fluidizado por pulsos de aire operando en modo batch y continuo, y b) oxidación avanzada mediante un tratamiento fotocatalitico en presencia de TiO 2 bajo irradiación UV-A y solar, y aplicando la radiación UV en combinación con ultrasonidos (sonofotocatálisis). Para la evaluación de los tratamientos alternativos, se identificaron los productos de transformación de la carbamazepina, y se evaluó la toxicidad de las muestras tratadas. Se utilizó la LC-MS/MS con analizador de tipo cuadrupolo-tiempo de vuelo. También se evaluó la toxicidad de las muestras tratadas...|$|R
