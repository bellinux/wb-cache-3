5|$|Like flour mills, {{factories}} that make aspirin tablets must {{pay attention to}} {{how much of the}} powder gets into the air inside the building, because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> for aspirin of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v.

50|$|OSHA sets {{enforceable}} <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (PELs) {{to protect}} workers against {{the health effects}} of exposure to hazardous substances, including limits on the airborne concentrations of hazardous chemicals in the air. Most of OSHA’s PELs were issued shortly after adoption of the OSH Act in 1970. Attempts to issue more stringent PELs have been blocked by litigation from industry; thus, the limits have not been updated since 1971. The agency has issued non-binding, alternate occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> that may better protect workers.|$|R

40|$|<b>Permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (PELs) for {{short-term}} and career astronaut exposures to space radiation {{have been set}} and approved by NASA {{with the goal of}} protecting astronauts against health risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure. Short term PELs are intended to prevent clinically significant deterministic health effects, including performance decrements, which could threaten astronaut health and jeopardize mission success. Career PELs are implemented to control late occurring health effects, including a 3 % risk of exposure induced death (REID) from cancer, and dose limits are used to prevent cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases. For radiation protection, meeting the cancer PEL is currently the design driver for galactic cosmic ray and solar particle event shielding, mission duration, and crew certification (e. g., 1 -year ISS missions). The risk of cancer development is the largest known long-term health consequence following radiation exposure, and current estimates for long-term health risks due to cardiovascular diseases are approximately 30 % to 40 % of the cancer risk for exposures above an estimated threshold (Deep Space one-year and Mars missions). Large uncertainties currently exist in estimating the health risks of space radiation exposure. Improved understanding through radiobiology and physics research allows increased accuracy in risk estimation and is essential for ensuring astronaut health as well as for controlling mission costs, optimization of mission operations, vehicle design, and countermeasure assessment. We will review the Space Radiation Program Element's research strategies to increase accuracy in risk models and to inform development and validation of the <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R

40|$|In 1989, {{after almost}} two decades of substance-by-substance {{standard}} setting, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) promulgated its Air Contaminants Standard, imposing new <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> for 376 toxic substances encountered in U.

This paper analyzes the standard {{in the context of}} the twenty-year debate over the appropriate role for technological feasibility and economic compliance costs in occupational health policy. The political feasibility of the new standard is traced to OSHA's abandonment of "technology forcing" in favor of reliance on "off-the-shelf" technologies already in use in major firms. While important as an embodiment of OSHA's new "generic" approach to regulation, the Air Contaminants Standard cannot serve as a model for future occupational health policy, due to its reliance on informal, closed-door mechanisms for establishing regulatory priorities and <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R
5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only {{contact with the}} eyes requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (<b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limit)</b> for zirconium exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic.|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
50|$|The TLV is an {{estimate}} {{based on the}} known toxicity in humans or animals of a given chemical substance, and the reliability and accuracy of the latest sampling and analytical methods.

The TLV is a recommendation by ACGIH, with only a guideline status. As such, {{it should not be}} confused with <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> having a regulatory status, like those published and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The OSHA regulatory <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (PELs) published in 29CFR 1910.1000 Table Z1 are based on recommendations made by the ACGIH in 1968, although other <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> were adopted more recently.
