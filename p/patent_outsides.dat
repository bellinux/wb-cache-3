40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} for assessing innovation collaboration partners. Based on the evidence from existing empirical studies, we identify four elements relevant as drivers of innovation collaboration. These elements include inventive capacity, technological specialization patterns, openness to international innovation collaboration and economic potential of technology. In {{order to make the}} framework operational, we propose a set of patent-based indicators that capture the relevant elements. In a second step, we apply the framework to analyse the attractiveness of India as a partner for innovation collaboration. Except for mapping India’s technological specialization patterns evolution, we show that it is a country very open to international collaboration. Moreover, as a lion’s share of India’s inventions is <b>patented</b> <b>outside</b> of the country, it can be expected that the technology developed in India has supranational commercial potential. ...|$|R

50|$|Software patents are {{controversial}} {{in the software}} industry with many people holding different views about them. One {{of the sources of}} controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent {{does not seem to be}} honored in practice by patent lawyers—for example the patent for Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), which purported to claim rights over any programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented. Another source of controversy is the effect on innovation, with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks, and actually retard innovation. In the case of debates about software <b>patents</b> <b>outside</b> the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents.|$|R

This essay argues against abolishing the DOE, and instead proposes two reforms to mitigate the DOE 2 ̆ 7 s interference with notice. First, courts should always stay permanent injunctions against DOE infringement for a modest period of time, e. g., for one year from the date of final judgment.

40|$|This {{empirical}} article analyses {{the importance}} of information and communications technologies (ICT) in the technological diversification trend among the world's largest manufacturing firms during the 1980 s and 1990 s. The objective of the research is twofold: first, to emphasise the emerging differences among technologies when companies from different industries <b>patent</b> <b>outside</b> their traditional technological capabilities; secondly, to investigate whether the tendency among large companies from all industries to patent in ICT is distinctive {{when compared with the}} tendency to patent in other technologies. We find that technological diversification in large companies has clearly occurred in ICTs. Non-ICT specialist industries increasingly develop, rather than just utilise, the cluster of ICT-related technologies. We conclude that the development of corporate capabilities in the key technologies of the emerging ICT paradigm is more widespread than previously emphasised in the literature. One implication of this observation is that technological diversification and the information revolution may be related phenomena. Technological diversification, Large firms, ICT, Patents,...|$|R

5000|$|Prior {{to changes}} in US patent law in 1995 and 1999, the content of patent {{applications}} was kept secret during the patent approval phase. Currently, the majority of U.S. patent applications are published within 18 months of the filing date (35 U.S.C. 122). However, the applicant can explicitly certify {{that they do not}} intend to file a corresponding <b>patent</b> <b>outside</b> the U.S. at the time they file the patent, and keep the application secret. The applicant can change their mind within the first year, but the application is then published. For continuation applications which claim priority to a previously filed application, the publication is six months after the new filing date. The changes to U.S. patent law that introduced publication at 18 months also changed the duration of the patent to 20 years from the filing date of the earliest patent application in any chain of continuation patent applications. As a result, there is little benefit in postponing the grant of the patent. The enforceable life of the patent can no longer be shifted into the period when a technology has become more widely adopted, and the patent applicant must give up the chance of foreign patent protection if he is to maintain patent secrecy beyond the 18-month period.
