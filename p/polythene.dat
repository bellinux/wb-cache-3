5|$|Despite having {{completely}} {{dropped out}} of mainstream radio play since 2008, while being relegated almost solely to alternative rock stations in the United Kingdom, Silent Cry reached #8 on the albums chart in its first week of release in 2008 with 16,000 units sold. It has sold less than 50,000 units to date according to Chrysalis, {{the owners of the}} now defunct Echo Label. The subsequent Silent Cry tour was Feeder's longest playing up to 29 different dates, with many selling out. Nevertheless, Silent Cry remains their first album since 1997's <b>Polythene</b> not to achieve at least gold status. The 2010 follow-up Renegades, was less successful only spending two weeks in the chart after entering at #16, while also being their first since the aforementioned <b>Polythene</b> not to chart within the Top 10.|$|E
5|$|The Jif plastic {{containers}} were originally made from <b>polythene,</b> and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The {{plastic containers}} served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E
5|$|The {{consortium}} took {{possession of}} the mill in November 1979. The first priority {{was to make the}} mill as weathertight as possible. <b>Polythene</b> sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.|$|E

25|$|Allied to the {{extraction}} of salt was a bulk chemical industry, which became concentrated at the three ICI sites at Winnington, Wallerscote and Lostock. The first industrially practical method for producing <b>polythene</b> was accidentally discovered at the Winnington works in 1933.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene or <b>polythene</b> (abbreviated PE; IUPAC name {{polyethene}} or poly(ethylene)) is {{the most}} common plastic. The annual global production is around 80 million tonnes. Its primary use is in packaging (plastic bags, plastic films, geomembranes, containers including bottles, etc.). Many kinds of polyethylene are known, with most having the chemical formula (C2H4)n. PE is usually a mixture of similar polymers of ethylene with various values of n.|$|E
25|$|Porto Alegre {{was one of}} {{the first}} cities in Brazil to develop a {{recycling}} program and has been acknowledged as having the best management practices in the country. The city produces about 1,600 tonnes of household waste per day. Since 1997, all non-recyclable waste has been disposed of in landfill sites. Infiltration into the soil is prevented by the double-walled construction of a clay layer and a high-density <b>polythene</b> geo-membrane, the lowering of the water table and the draining off and treatment of any effluent.|$|E
25|$|Directed to {{investigate}} the fractionation of coke oven gas, Freeth was inspired by Onnes' low-temperature work; at his instigation, Brunner Mond {{set up a new}} low-temperature laboratory in Winnington in 1931 with a number of talented Dutch assistants, where <b>polythene</b> was later discovered. A number of Brunner Mond (and Imperial Chemical Industries) recruits went the other way, to the Netherlands to work with Onnes and increase the fruitful cross-pollination. Freeth was awarded a doctorate of the University of Leiden in 1924—only possible thanks to a special decree of the Dutch Parliament—and joined the Royal Society in 1926 on the recommendation of Donnan and Lord Moulton.|$|E
25|$|At the Calico Printers' Association in Manchester in 1941, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson {{discovered}} polyethylene terephthalate, {{known as}} PET, a common polyester compound found in plastic bottles and food, and {{also known as}} Terylene or Dacron. Cheslene and Crepes of Macclesfield discovered crimplene (the fabric that is now referred to as polyester). ICI Dyestuffs at Hexagon House, in Blackley in north Manchester, discovered Procion dyes. At the Winnington Laboratory on 27 March 1933, Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson discovered <b>polythene</b> in an ICI laboratory in Northwich, when reacting benzaldehyde with ethene at a pressure of 2,000 atmospheres; the process was improved in 1935 by Sir Michael Perrin.|$|E
25|$|COUM's {{earliest}} {{public events}} were impromptu musical gigs performed at various pubs around Hull; titles for these events included Thee Fabulous Mutations, Space Between the Violins, Dead Violins and Degradation, and Clockwork Hot Spoiled Acid Test. The latter combined {{the names of}} Anthony Burgess' dystopian science-fiction novel A Clockwork Orange (1962) with Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), a work of literary journalism devoted to the Merry Pranksters, a US communal counter-cultural group who advocated the use of psychedelic drugs. COUM's music was anarchic and improvised, making use of such instruments as broken violins, prepared pianos, guitars, bongos and talking drums. As time went on, they added further theatrics to their performances, in one instance making the audience crawl through a <b>polythene</b> tunnel to enter the venue.|$|E
25|$|The name {{polyethylene}} {{comes from}} the ingredient and not the resulting chemical compound, which contains no double bonds. The scientific name polyethene is systematically derived from the scientific name of the monomer. The alkene monomer converts to a long, sometimes very long, alkane in the polymerization process. In certain circumstances {{it is useful to}} use a structure-based nomenclature; in such cases IUPAC recommends poly(methylene) (poly(methanediyl) is a non-preferred alternative). The difference in names between the two systems is due to the opening up of the monomer's double bond upon polymerization. The name is abbreviated to PE. In a similar manner polypropylene and polystyrene are shortened to PP and PS, respectively. In the United Kingdom the polymer is commonly called <b>polythene,</b> from the ICI trade name, although this is not recognized scientifically.|$|E

500|$|On 16 October 1970, spans 7 and 8 of {{the pier}} {{collapsed}} during stress testing, which had been introduced in the 1950s as a requirement for obtaining insurance cover. The tests involved the placement of <b>polythene</b> tanks [...] long, [...] wide and [...] deep filled {{to a depth of}} , which created a pressure of [...] This simulated the required load agreed with the Ministry of Transport.|$|E
500|$|After {{building}} a strong fanbase {{with the release}} of Swim, the band released their first full-length album in 1997. The result <b>Polythene,</b> {{was one of the most}} critically acclaimed albums of 1997 with Metal Hammer and Kerrang!, placing the album at first and sixth in their respective end of year lists. Kerrang! later included the album in their 200 Albums For the Year 2000 list in the [...] "Essential Britrock" [...] category. Two tracks from Swim were used for the album, being [...] "Descend" [...] and [...] "Stereoworld".|$|E
500|$|Feeder's first {{official}} release was a two-track EP entitled Two Colours, released in 1995 {{which was only}} available at the band's early gigs. It was limited to 1,500 CDs and 1,000 7" [...] vinyls. In 1996, the band released their first commercially available release, being the EP Swim and received a 4/5 review in Kerrang! magazine (KKKK). Swim was later re-released in July 2001 with extra tracks, being a selection of b-sides from their earlier singles, alongside the videos for the <b>Polythene</b> singles [...] "Crash" [...] and [...] "Cement". Overall unit sales for Swim stand at 40,000 as of February 2005.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, Feeder has come to {{domestically}} accumulate a total of six gold and platinum records, with a gold record in Ireland for The Singles, bringing their British Isles (and worldwide) total to seven. In 2015, [...] "Buck Rogers" [...] received a Silver award for 200,000 UK sales, 14 years after release while two years later 2001's [...] "Just a Day" [...] also repeated this. 2017 meanwhile, saw 1997's <b>Polythene</b> receive a Gold award from the BPI for sales of 100,000; almost 20 years to its release date. Feeder's overall career album sales stand at 1,957,016 in the United Kingdom, as of 6 October 2017.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of Swim, a {{cassette}} tape titled Two Tracker was given away free with the magazines Kerrang! and Edge and contained the tracks [...] "Sweet 16" [...] and [...] "Waterfall". The latter was described on the inlay card, {{as one of the}} tracks that would be on their forthcoming debut album proper, with the working title Here in the Bubble (whose name was soon changed to <b>Polythene).</b> The photography for the inlay of Swim was produced by Grant himself, while Chris Sheldon produced the recordings. The band released [...] "Stereo World" [...] as a single after appearing at the Reading festival.|$|E
500|$|Restoration work {{involved}} {{a collaboration between}} staff from British Waterways and volunteer labour. In 1966 Sulhamstead Lock was rebuilt and the re-puddling of the dry section at Limpley Stoke was begun. In 1968, restoration work was undertaken on the Bath Locks and Burghfield Lock. In Reading at Bridge Street the navigable headroom had been reduced from [...] to [...] by girders added to {{the underside of the}} bridge. This was replaced with a new bridge, enabling craft to pass more easily. The canal was reopened from the Thames to Hungerford Wharf in July 1974. Re-puddling was a long process, so experiments with the use of heavy gauge <b>polythene</b> to line the canal were undertaken. The Avoncliff Aqueduct was lined with a concrete [...] "cradle" [...] and made water-tight in 1980.|$|E
500|$|A log is kept with {{information}} about the core, including its length and the depth it was retrieved from, and the core may be marked to show its orientation. [...] It is usually cut into shorter sections, the standard length in the US being one metre. [...] The cores are then stored on site, usually in a space below snow level to simplify temperature maintenance, though additional refrigeration can be used. [...] If more drilling fluid must be removed, air may be blown over the cores. [...] Any samples needed for preliminary analysis are taken. [...] The core is then bagged, often in <b>polythene,</b> and stored for shipment. [...] Additional packing, including padding material, is added. [...] When the cores are flown from the drilling site, the aircraft's flight deck is unheated to help maintain a low temperature; when they are transported by ship they must be kept in a refrigeration unit.|$|E
500|$|Around 40% of the {{population}} has access to sewers. However, only the toilet waste is connected to the sewer while sullage is discharged into the drains. Without a proper sanitation system, the practice of disposing sewage through septic tanks and directly discharging into Jhoras and open drains is prevalent. The entire city drains into the two rivers, Ranikhola and Roro Chu, through numerous small streams and Jhoras. Ranikhola and Roro Chu rivers confluence with Teesta River, the major source of drinking water to {{the population}} downstream. The densely populated urban area of Gangtok does not have a combined drainage system to drain out the storm water and waste water from the buildings. The estimated solid waste generated in Gangtok city is approximately 45tonnes. Only around 40% of this is collected by UDHD, while the remainder is indiscriminately thrown into Jhora, streets and valleys. The collected waste is disposed in a dump located about [...] from the city. There is no waste collection from inaccessible areas where vehicles cannot reach, nor does any system of collection of waste exist in the adjoining rural areas. The city is under a statewide ban on the use of <b>polythene</b> bags.|$|E
500|$|In early 1998, {{following}} the band's final 1997 tour {{in support of}} <b>Polythene,</b> the band travelled to the United States as a support act for Everclear. During their U.S. tour, the band released a re-worked version of [...] "Suffocate" [...] for UK release, which charted at #37. After their return to the UK, they played their own headline tour with Everclear {{this time in the}} supporting position. Later that year, Feeder started to play various music festivals in the United States, alongside a headline tour with [...] "High" [...] being released to radio stations and charting at #24 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart; it was the follow-up to [...] "Cement" [...] which had charted at #31, also on the same listing. During the band's first U.S. tour, Grant broke his ankle and picked up other injuries, while finding it hard to sleep at nights. This inspired him to write [...] "Insomnia", which later appeared on their second album. They stayed in the U.S. {{for the majority of the}} year, with a trip back to the UK for their V98 appearance. Feeder later included live-only guitarist Dean Tidey; Grant once said in an interview with Kerrang!, that he was considering bringing in another guitarist for their live gigs.|$|E
500|$|The stretch between Reading and Newbury was {{completed}} on 17 July 1990; {{at a ceremony}} held at Monkey Marsh Lock several boats competed {{to be the first}} craft through. Concerns about the adequacy of the water supply still remained when Queen Elizabeth II formally reopened the canal on 8 August 1990. The Queen was able to travel on the Trust's boat Rose of Hungerford through locks 44 and 43 on the Caen Hill flight, breaking a ceremonial tape between them. The shortage of water was addressed in 1996 by the installation of new back pumps at the flight of 29locks at Caen Hill in Devizes, at a cost of £1million. The pumps raise water [...] at a rate of [...] per hour (380litres per second). In October 1996, the Kennet & Avon Canal Partnership attracted the largest single National Lottery grant awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, £25million towards a £29million project, to complete the restoration and to make it operational, sustainable and accessible for the enjoyment of future generations. The work funded included complete rebuilding of Foxhangers Lock and bridge at Caen Hill, replacement of lock gates at Seend and Crofton, channel lining at Claverton, embankment repairs at Martinslade, improvements at Claverton pumping station and dredging at various sites. The restoration's completion was celebrated in May 2003 by a visit from HRH Prince Charles, but upgrading and maintenance continues. Between 2002 and 2004 the Dundas Aqueduct, which had been relined with <b>polythene</b> and concrete in 1984 without disturbing a colony of bats living under the aqueduct, was further restored by the replacement of engineering bricks used by the Great Western Railway with Bath Stone to match the original work.|$|E

[...] At first the only usable building was the signal box (habitable would be too strong a term), with temporary window frames covered in <b>polythene</b> and the fireplace resuscitated, it made a rough and ready base. [...] The more hardy stayed overnight in sleeping bags on the wooden floor with one brave soul suspending a hammock from the roof beams. [...] This group started work tidying up the station and evicting the rats, but more important was fencing, ditching and keying-up on 'their' section of track northwards to Newtondale.|$|E
2500|$|Kenya being a {{developing}} nation, characterized by high unemployment rates that have accumulated to {{poverty in the}} country. Most of the dwellers in Kibera are individuals that the society has failed to accommodate. In trying to help themselves into the society, people are forced to quit their rural homes and run to urban areas to find jobs. Those who migrate to Nairobi in such for the much needed [...] "greener pastures" [...] are forced to relocate to Kibera where the house rent is low as Ksh. 300 which is affordable to the lower class individuals. The houses in this Kibera made of sacks, <b>polythene</b> bags, and sticks compared to those bungalows in Runda.|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of several <b>polythene</b> bags containing parts of human torsos led the investigators {{to conclude that}} {{it was unlikely that}} the accused had links to illegal organ trade. The CBI team discovered the bags in the drains outside the Pandher residence. After interrogating Surinder Koli, they came to a prima facie conclusion that [...] "he is a psychopath used to carry out the killings". Interrogators also said that it was possible that Pandher had no role to play in the murders. The seized materials were sent to laboratory for post-mortem, individualisation, and DNA extraction. The materials received from the Uttar Pradesh police were also forwarded for forensic examination. Some liquor bottles, a double-barreled gun, cartridges, mobile phones, photographs, photo albums and a blood-stained grill were handed over to the CBI for extensive examination. Preliminary investigations revealed that the bones were not more than two years old. The CBI also revealed that only fifteen skulls had been found thus far, and not seventeen as claimed by the state police.|$|E
2500|$|Payal was {{the only}} adult victim in the string of serial murders. Young girls {{constituted}} the majority of victims. Post-mortem reports of the 17 sets of skulls and bones recovered showed that 11 of the killed were girls. Doctors at Noida Government Hospital revealed {{that there was a}} [...] "butcher-like precision" [...] in the chopping of the bodies. The post mortem reports revealed {{that there had been a}} pattern in the killings. A gory revelation was made by the AIIMS on 6 February 2007. It was also concluded that there were 19 skulls in all, 16 complete and 3 damaged. The bodies had been cut into three pieces before being disposed of by the servant. The CBI sources said that the manservant, after strangling the victims, severed their heads and threw them in the drain behind the house of his employer. Sources also revealed that he used to keep the viscera in a <b>polythene</b> bag before disposing it off in a drain, so as to prevent detection. The skulls and the other remains were forwarded to the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad for further profiling. The crime scene examination, recovery and collection of human remains and exhibits and their detailed examination was carried out by experts from AIIMS and CFSL under the chairmanship and guidance of professor T D Dogra.|$|E
