50|$|Electro-pneumatic chests, however, {{frequently}} have sealed wood channels (tubes) in their wooden structural elements and bottom boards, usually consisting of wind channels running between the <b>pipe</b> <b>valve</b> {{and the primary}} with its electromagnets. Organ builders harnessed the difference in air pressures {{inside and outside the}} organ to do heavier work, taking the weak force of an electromagnet and multiplying its effect pneumatically to pull open pipe valves. In a sense, therefore, part of the tubular-pneumatic heritage was developed in later non-tracker organ building.|$|E

50|$|Initial {{thoughts}} {{were that the}} collision {{was the result of}} a terrorist act, due to a recent string of bombings of French trains in and around Paris. This theory was supported by the fact that investigators who were examining the wrecked shell of train 153944 found the main brake <b>pipe</b> <b>valve,</b> located behind the first car, closed. When open, this valve allows compressed air generated in the first car to travel back through the other cars to power the compressed air brakes. When closed, the brakes on all cars behind the valve are disabled. Despite the signs of possible terrorism, the investigators believed that only someone with detailed knowledge of the braking system's workings could have closed the valve.|$|E
5000|$|When {{one or more}} of the {{automatic}} sprinkler heads is triggered, it opens allowing the air in the piping to vent from that sprinkler. Each sprinkler operates independently, as its temperature rises above its triggering threshold. As the air pressure in the piping drops, the pressure differential across the dry <b>pipe</b> <b>valve</b> changes, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flow from sprinklers, needed to control the fire, is delayed until the air is vented from the sprinklers. In regions using NFPA 13 regulations, the time it takes water to reach the hydraulically remote sprinkler from the time that sprinkler is activated is limited to a maximum of 60 seconds. In industry practice, this is known as the [...] "Maximum Time of Water Delivery". The maximum time of water delivery may be required to be reduced, depending on the hazard classification of the area protected by the sprinkler system.|$|E

Additionally, they do not allow continuous dynamic differentiation like a piano does, and therefore performers may choose timing as a means to separate voices.

30|$|Design {{principles}} and pipe rehabilitation strategies in WDNs are generally based upon {{assessment of the}} vulnerability (or hydraulic reliability) of a network to specific hazards. The risk assessment is based on probabilistic measures {{of the consequences of}} failure events on the level of service of customers (Ostfeld and Shamir 1993; Xu and Goulter 1999; Deuerlein et al. 2009; Shuang et al. 2014; Diao et al. 2016). Due to the unpredictable nature (and causes) of disruptive events (Gao et al. 2016; Hosseini et al. 2016) and lack of universally accepted probabilistic approach to component (e.g. <b>pipe,</b> <b>valve,</b> pump) failures (Andreou et al. 1987; Goulter and Bouchart 1990), failure predictions in WDNs are highly uncertain. More robust measures for network design and rehabilitation strategies are based on network resilience, i.e. the ability of networks to anticipate, absorb, adapt to and/or rapidly recover from a disruptive event (Laprie 2005; Strigini 2012; Gao et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. Experimental measurements of the wall shear stress combined {{to those of the}} velocity profiles via the electrochemical technique and Ultrasonic pulsed Doppler Velocimetry, are used to analyse the flow behaviour in transient flow caused by a downstream short <b>pipe</b> <b>valve</b> closure. The Reynolds number of the steady flow based on the pipe diameter is Re = 121700. The results show that the quasi-steady approach of representing unsteady friction is valid during the initial phase for relatively large decelerations. For higher decelerations, the unsteady wall shear stress is consistently higher than the quasi-steady values obtained from the velocity profiles. An examination of the range of applicability of the instantaneous-acceleration model shows that the empirical coefficient of unsteady friction is closely linked to the deceleration intensity. This study is made possible owing to the repeatability of different valve closures allowing data to be averaged over numerous tests. vk 201...|$|E

40|$|Transient {{simulations}} of hydraulic piping systems consists of simultaneous {{solution of the}} 1 D wave equations that relates flow to pressure in a pipe, and solutions of all other non-pipe components constituting the total system. The method of characteristics (MOC) is {{the most widely used}} method due to its analytic accuracy and speed. This paper presents an implementation of MOC as a so-called toolkit or library in LabVIEW. Each type of physical component (<b>pipe,</b> <b>valve</b> etc) is programmed as a component sub-vi (component sub virtual instrument). A component sub-vi can best be described as a lightweight variation of an object in an object oriented programming language, because data and procedures are encapsulated within each component. Hydraulic systems, with virtually limitless complexity, are then constructed intuitively using point and click methods in the standard LabVIEW interface, and later run, without needing any prior knowledge of LabVIEW. The modularity means that new components and upgraded components are easy to incorporate, while the LabVIEW interface provides all interactive graphical representation, both in batch mode and in real-time simulations. This toolkit is implemented in a package called LVTrans (LabVIEW Transient Simulations). This package is actively used and under continuous development at SINTEF Energy Research, and is also licensed to Statkraft ASA...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{damage that}} caused by impact of solid {{particles}} is called erosive wear. The phenomenon becomes {{a serious problem}} for bended section of pneumatic transportation <b>pipe,</b> <b>valve,</b> turbine blade and fun, and so on. In order to reach an aim of high safety and low cost, it’s important to develop wear resistant material and to estimate of life service during erosion. Recently, many researches have studied on the variety of alloys, and tempt to develop wear resistant materials. In this study, the multi-component cast irons, which are excellent war resistant materials due to containing strong carbides forming elements, Crystallization of hard eutectic carbides at the solidification and occurring secondary hardening in matrix by heat treatment was paid attention. Therefore, multi-component cast irons with about 3 %C, 10 %, 7. 5 % and 5 %V cast irons with nill, 5 and 9 %Cr and 2 %C and Cr, Mo, W and V, (As an alternative to Nb) of about 5 % with 0, 5 and 10 %Co were prepared as the test materials in this study. This study investigates erosive wear characteristics of multi-component cast irons. In 1 st chapter, I described the research background, previous research and the purpose and significance of this study.

40|$|The {{importance}} of sustainable financial management {{of water and}} wastewater pipeline infrastructure has grown in recent years due to the increasing backlog of maintenance, renewal and replacement of aging water and wastewater infrastructure. As the water and wastewater infrastructure age, {{the condition of the}} water and wastewater infrastructure will continue to deteriorate increasing the cost for renewal and replacement. In response to the aging and deteriorating potable water and wastewater infrastructure Public Sector Accounting Board PS 3150 and Regulation 453 / 07 under the Ontario Safe Drinking Water Act were established. PS 3150 requires local governments to report their tangible capital assets along with their depreciation on financial statements. One key component of this reporting is determining the need for and cost of the replacement of these assets. Ontario Regulation 453 / 07 requires public utilities to prepare and submit long term financial plans for water systems. One key principle of the financial plans is that the expenses of operating water systems should be paid by revenues generated from providing the water systems. A crucial aspect of PS 3150, Ontario regulation 453 / 07 and the financial management of water and wastewater infrastructure are accurate estimates of future capital works construction prices. Historically, construction indices are used to forecast construction prices. Engineering New Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index (CCI), Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) composite National Highway Construction Cost Index (NHCCI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) have been used to estimate future construction prices of water and wastewater infrastructure in Canada. However, these indices do not accurately represent the circumstance of the water and wastewater infrastructure construction sector, which can lead to errors and inaccuracies in construction price forecasts. It is recommended sector specific construction indices be used to forecast construction prices. However, there are few construction indices available for the water and wastewater infrastructure sector and available indices are not based on actual construction data. This thesis presents a methodology to accurately estimate future construction prices for water and wastewater pipeline capital works based on actual construction price data. The methodology contains three components: construction data processing, development of unit price indices for watermain and sanitary sewer construction, and estimation of inflation in watermain and sanitary sewer construction. The data processing component cleans and transforms actual construction price data from the City of Niagara Falls from 1981 to 2014 into a centralized, organized and auditable construction price dataset. Based on the construction price dataset, unit price indices specific to the watermain and sanitary sewer construction sector were developed. Unit price indices were developed and calculated for watermain projects, pipes, valves, and hydrants, and sanitary sewer projects, pipes, and maintenance holes. Geometric Brownian Motion was used to estimate inflation in and forecast future construction prices for watermain and sanitary sewer capital works construction based on the developed unit price indices. A Microsoft Access relational database containing the data processing function, calculation of watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices, and estimation of inflation was developed to improve the accuracy, efficiency and consistency of the methodology. Additionally, the methodology allows contractor markup in watermain and sanitary sewer construction and factors influencing watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices to be examined. The inflation of watermain reference project construction is 5. 79 % per annum from 1982 - 2014, while the inflation of sanitary sewer reference project capital works construction is 4. 66 % per annum from 1981 - 2014. The inflation rates of watermain <b>pipe,</b> <b>valve</b> and hydrant construction from 1982 - 2014 are 6. 36 %, 5. 09 %, and 2. 81 % per annum, respectively. The inflation rates of sanitary sewer pipe and maintenance hole construction from 1981 - 2014 are 7. 41 % and 5. 25 % per annum, respectively. Inflation of watermain and sanitary sewer reference projects is above inflation of CPI, NRBCPI and LDCCT at 2. 25 %, 3. 17 % and 3. 77 % per annum, respectively, but below inflation of S&P/TSX composite index at 6. 90 % per annum. This indicates when forecasting future prices within a construction sector, the use of a proxy index will result in inaccurate estimates of future construction prices. In the water and wastewater pipeline construction sector the use of CPI, NRBCPI or LDCCT will result in significant underestimation of future construction prices. To obtain accurate estimates of future construction prices it is important to use sector specific indices which the developed unit price indices represent for the water and wastewater pipeline construction sector. In this thesis contractor markup is defined as a financial premium in excess of market inflation {{in the form of a}} per annum interest rate surcharge. Contractor markup includes risk premiums, overhead and profit. The contractor markups for watermain and sanitary sewer projects are 3. 54 % and 2. 41 %, respectively. As the number of tender bids submitted for a project increase, the unit price of reference projects generally decreases. This is caused by an increase in the competition among contractors resulting in a decrease in the unit prices of the reference projects as bidders attempt to win the project. The Infrastructure Stimulus Fund increased the total number of projects and the total value of projects in 2009 and 2010 but did not significantly alter the watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices...|$|E
