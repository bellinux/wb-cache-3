50|$|Park (P): This {{selection}} mechanically {{locks the}} output shaft of transmission, restricting the vehicle from moving in any direction. A parking pawl prevents the transmission from rotating, {{and therefore the}} vehicle from moving. However, the vehicle's non-driven wheels are still free to rotate, and the driven wheels may still rotate individually (because of the differential). For this reason, it is recommended to use the hand brake (parking brake) because this actually locks (in most cases) the wheels and prevents them from moving. It is typical of front-wheel-drive vehicles for the parking brake to lock the rear (non-driving) wheels, so use of both the parking brake and the transmission <b>park</b> <b>lock</b> provides the greatest security against unintended movement on slopes. This also increases {{the life of the}} transmission and the park pin mechanism, because parking on an incline with the transmission in park without the parking brake engaged will cause undue stress on the parking pin, and may even prevent the pin from releasing. A hand brake should also prevent the car from moving if a worn selector accidentally drops into reverse gear while idling.|$|E
50|$|The Trench branch rose through 9 locks {{from the}} junction, which were called Wappenshall, Britton, Wheat Leasowes, Shucks, Peaty, Hadley Park, Turnip, Baker's and Trench lock. Wappenshall Lock was {{demolished}} {{to make way}} for a weir which is part of a storm drain. Hadley Park and Turnip locks are Grade II listed structures, as is the bridge immediately downstream of Hadley <b>Park</b> <b>lock,</b> and both locks still have their original guillotine mechanism in situ. Beyond Trench lock, which was demolished in 1977 as part of a roadworks scheme, the Trench Pool was the main water supply for the canal, after which the Trench incline carried boats another 75 ft upwards. The building of an incline, rather than a flight of locks was dictated by the lack of an adequate water supply at the higher level. The locks on the Trench Branch, and the two Eyton locks, had guillotine gates at the lower end. They were 81 ft long, and although Thomas Telford wrote in 1797 that they had a third set of gates, so that they could be used by a single 20 ft tub-boat in the short section, a train of three tub-boats in the longer section, or a train of four boats if the outer gates were used, there is no evidence that the middle gates were ever fitted.|$|E
40|$|A <b>park</b> <b>lock</b> {{mechanism}} is {{a device that}} is fitted to an automatic transmission on a vehicle. The mechanism lock up the transmission so that no rolling of the vehicle can be done when the vehicle is put in the park position. The aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} method in order the evaluate designs on a <b>Park</b> <b>Lock</b> Mechanism (PLM) that {{can be found in a}} dual clutch transmission (DCT). A Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) tool to calculate the output that is required for an evaluation of a <b>park</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism design will be created. The CAE tool shall calculate static, dynamic, and snap torque on a ratchet wheel in a gradient, with or without a trailer, also the minimum and maximum coefficient of friction between the pawl and cone, pull out force, the maximum amount of rollback, torque needed from the return spring, preload force from actuator spring, and engagement speed. The CAE tool created uses an Excel Visual Basics for Applications (VBA) workbook for all calculations. The tool allows the user to choose different vehicles with the required specification to evaluate the values for that PLM. The CAE tool will save time and cost if lots of different PLM’s are going to be designed. The CAE tool has potential for future work when more calculations can be added that can be in use for the evaluation the PLM. The CAE tool developed by the master thesis student calculates all the required values for evaluation of a PLM design, executed in a fast, efficient, and easy to use program. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In most {{of current}} {{implementation}} scheme of remote control <b>parking</b> <b>lock,</b> fixed encoding chips are widely used. Due to its poor security and limited encoding length, {{it is easy}} to invade the system by “copying and retransmitting ” “scanning and tracking”. In this paper, a hopping code technology based on non-linear shift register technology is utilized. This scheme ensures that the code sent by the transmitter each time is random, non-repeated and irregular, improving the security and immunity of the <b>parking</b> <b>lock</b> effectively. When the software and hardware of <b>parking</b> <b>lock</b> are designed based on PIC 16 F 690 microcontroller, the security of the whole system has been well verified...|$|R

30|$|As cities grow larger, {{the issue}} of parking becomes more evident. A few leading local and {{regional}} governments {{around the world have}} started to make significant changes in their parking policies, which have impacted the cities’ economic growth, while benefiting the environment and the communities’ quality of life. These parking policies range from parking law enforcement (restricted areas, time restrictions, and limited number of spaces available) to more innovative actions (parking guidance systems). The current state of parking policies in most cities in the United States has been discussed by the Institute of Transportation and Development Policy [34]. In other parts of the world, these and other innovative measures have been applied to parking in urban areas, such as on-street <b>parking</b> <b>locking</b> devices (Charleroi), “park and ride” (P&R) facilities (Cologne, Oxford, Utrecht and München), parking guidance systems (Gothenburg, Zurich, Charleroi), no-square parking (Gothenburg), user rights parking in form of badges (Zurich), among others [35].|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{any other}} type of transmission, {{non-synchronous}} transmissions often have a mechanism for slowing down, or stopping an idle gear. In commercial motor vehicles, this mechanism is called the clutch brake, and is used by depressing the clutch {{all the way to the}} floor, or pressing a button on the top of the gear lever. This is useful in 18-wheelers that have just started their diesel engines, and are releasing <b>parking</b> <b>locks,</b> and engaging the transmission from a stop. The clutch brake not only slows or stops the idle gear axis, but can also prevent shifting into gear until the clutch pedal is released a few inches off the floor. In order to shift into gear, the clutch must be half way off the floor, otherwise the clutch brake will prevent the transmission from being shifted into or out of gear. Mechanics must often repair or replace the clutch brake in a non-synchronous transmission when an inexperienced operator wears it out, it becomes inoperable, or has lost its function.|$|R
