5|$|Domestically, {{air travel}} between Paris {{and some of}} France's largest cities such as Lyon, Marseille, or Strasbourg {{has been in a}} large measure {{replaced}} by high-speed rail due to the opening of several high-speed TGV rail lines from the 1980s. For example, after the LGV Méditerranée opened in 2001, air traffic between Paris and Marseille declined from 2,976,793 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2000 to 1,502,196 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2014. After the LGV Est opened in 2007, air traffic between Paris and Strasbourg declined from 1,006,327 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2006 to 157,207 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2014.|$|E
5|$|The airport has daily {{scheduled}} {{flights to}} nine destinations in Canada operated by Air Canada Express, Central Mountain Air and WestJet. The terminal handled 312,895 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2014, {{an increase of}} 7.2% over the 290,394 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2013.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{operators}} of Amtrak's Thruway Motorcoach service even though the two companies are competitors in some markets. Amtrak issues rail passengers a ticket for a regularly scheduled Greyhound route that connects with their train, often with buses making a stop at the train station. These Thruway Motorcoach routes allow Amtrak to serve <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> areas without rail service and offer <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> areas with rail service a wider selection of destinations.|$|E

5|$|In November 2007, Airbus top sales {{executive}} {{and chief operating}} officer John Leahy confirmed plans for an enlarged variant, the A380-900, with more seating space than the A380-800. This would have a seating capacity for 650 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> standard configuration, and approximately 900 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> an economy-only configuration. Airlines that had expressed an interest in the −900 included Emirates, Virgin Atlantic, Cathay Pacific, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Kingfisher Airlines, and leasing company ILFC. In May 2010, Airbus announced that A380-900 development was postponed, until production of the A380-800 stabilises.|$|E

5|$|The {{city is a}} major rail, highway, and air-transport hub {{served by}} two {{international}} airports: Paris-Charles de Gaulle (the second busiest airport in Europe after London Heathrow Airport with 63.8 million <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2014) and Paris-Orly. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily, and is the second busiest metro system in Europe after Moscow Metro. Paris' Gare du Nord {{is one of the}} ten busiest railway stations in the world, with 262 million <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2015.|$|E

5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 1996 and 216,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2000.|$|E
5|$|Competition from {{road traffic}} {{starting}} {{in the early twentieth}} century put pressure on the railway, and it was later a victim of the Beeching cuts. The line was seen as unprofitable, and it closed to <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 1964, and to goods traffic in 1967. Part of the trackbed today provides a section of the Milton Keynes redway system.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it mainly serves Aqueduct Racetrack, the station is not well-used {{compared}} to other stations in the system. During the 1970s ridership at the station declined, from 1.1 million <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 1975 to 573,000 in 1979.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the British airport {{operator}} TBI {{announced it was}} in negotiations to purchase an airport close to Oslo, and Dagens Næringsliv speculated {{that it could be}} Notodden. The municipality confirmed that they were in negotiations to establish a limited company to operate the airport, which would be jointly owned by Air Team and the municipality. In 2000, Bergen Air Transport started flying between Notodden and Bergen, using a Cessna 421B. It transported 1,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>in</b> 2000, and 1,500 the following year. During the summer of 2002, the company also attempted to fly from Notodden to Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, but was forced to give up due to lack of <b>passengers.</b> <b>In</b> 1995, the airport saw 770 arriving and departing passengers. It increased to 2,467 the following year but fell to 986 in 1998 before increasing to 3,682 in 1999. The patronage has since varied significantly from year to year, but has stayed in the range between 1,500 and 3,500 passengers per year.|$|E
