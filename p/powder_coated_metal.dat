5000|$|The {{most common}} way of {{applying}} the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> to <b>metal</b> objects is to spray the powder using an electrostatic gun, or corona gun. The gun imparts a positive electric charge to the powder, {{which is then}} sprayed towards the grounded object by mechanical or compressed air spraying and then accelerated toward the workpiece by the powerful electrostatic charge. There are {{a wide variety of}} spray nozzles available for use in electrostatic coating. The type of nozzle used will depend on the shape of the workpiece to be painted and the consistency of the paint. The object is then heated, and the powder melts into a uniform film, and is then cooled to form a hard coating. It is also common to heat the metal first and then spray the powder onto the hot substrate. Preheating can help to achieve a more uniform finish but can also create other problems, such as runs caused by excess powder. See the article [...] "Fusion Bonded Epoxy Coatings" ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Powder</b> <b>Coating</b> {{is a type}} of coating that {{is applied}} as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main {{difference}} between a conventional liquid paint and a <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> is that the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. The coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under heat to allow it to flow and form a [...] "skin". The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. <b>Powder</b> <b>coating</b> is mainly used for <b>coating</b> of <b>metals,</b> such as household appliances, aluminum extrusions, drum hardware, and automobile and bicycle parts. Newer technologies allow other materials, such as MDF (medium-density fibreboard), to be <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> using different methods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The present {{paper is}} focused on ceramic–metal {{composites}} obtained via different technologies which leads to different microstructures in terms of size and distribution of metal phase. Composites analysed in paper were produced by the following methods:(a) infiltration of porous ceramics by metal, (b) consolidation under high pressure and (c) sintering of ceramic <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> by <b>metal.</b> Their microstructures were investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy methods. The three methods of composite fabrication employed {{in the present study}} result in specific spatial distribution and dispersion of metal phase. Presureless infiltration of porous ceramics by liquid metal is driven by capillary force and make it possible to produce microstructure with percolation of metal phase in ceramic matrix. The volume fraction of metal phase in this case depends on the size of pores. The size of pores influence also the kinetics and extent of infiltration. Ceramic preforms with small size of pore are not fully infiltrated. This method is useful for composite with size of metal phase in the range of micrometers. Hot pressing under high pressure produces microstructures of composites with metal phase grain size in the range from nano to micrometers. Moreover, it allows to achieve the nanometric size of ceramic grains. In the case of ceramic powders covered by metal, compression and hot pressing preserves nanometric size of metal. The grain growth of ceramic grains is suppressed...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the shaping}} and {{assembly}} behavior of adhesive polymer-metal-composites {{was investigated in}} an international cooperation using two step curable uretdione-polyester-based powder coatings (IPF development [1, 2]) which acts simultaneously as a reactive adhesive agent and as a high quality surface finish. To create the composite, a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) layer with good compatibility to the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> was over-molded onto a <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> aluminum substrate. A polyamide (PA 6) layer was over-molded on to the TPU layer to create a stiff composite structure with possibilities for further functionalization. The TPU-layer in between the metal substrate and the polymer top layer acts as a stress and strain compensation layer. These loads are caused by thermal expansion (under fluctuating temperatures) and external forces/deformation. Another key feature of the composite is the innovative process chain. The <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> can resist high deformation and therefore the coating is suitable for a future application on to a metal substrate using a coil coating procedure. In addition, the coil could be easily implemented into a production line as a semi-finished product. The prefinished <b>coated</b> <b>metal</b> substrate could be formed (e. g. incremental forming, deep drawing) and inserted in the over-molding procedure. This overall shortened process chain allows not only an effective fabrication of pre-coated semi-finished materials and polymer-metal-joints in high quantities by saving process steps (e. g. cleaning steps, glue application) but also a higher versatility in the following composite production...|$|R

40|$|Powder {{coatings}} provide {{several advantages}} over traditional coatings: environmental friendliness, freedom of design, robustness and resistance of surfaces, possibility to seamlessly all-around coating, fast production process, cost-effectiveness. In {{the last years}} these benefits of the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> technology have been adopted from metal to heat-sensitive natural fibre/ wood based substrates (especially medium density fibre boards- MDF) used for interior furniture applications. <b>Powder</b> <b>coated</b> MDF furniture parts are gaining market share already in the classic furniture applications kitchen, bathroom, living and offices.

Current efforts of the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> industry to develop new powders with higher reactivity (i. e. lower curing temperatures and shorter curing times; e. g. 120 °C/ 5 min) will enable the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> of other heat-sensitive substrates like natural fibre composites, wood plastic composites, light weight panels and different plastics in the future.

40|$|The <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> of wood {{products}} as an emerging environmentally sustainable coating technology holds promise {{in terms of}} novel product quality features for engineered wood like medium-density fiberboards (MDFs).
