40|$|Abstract—Video {{is a major}} {{challenge}} for the future mobile Internet as it is foreseen to account for close to 64 % percent of consumer mobile traffic by 2013. However, the current Internet, {{and in particular the}} mobile Internet, was not designed with video requirements in mind and, as a consequence, its architecture is very inefficient when handling this type of traffic. This paper presents a novel mobility architecture inspired by the Distributed Mobility Management paradigm, capable of coping with the future video traffic demands, in a distributed and more scalable way. In the proposed solution, mobility support services are spread among several nodes {{at the edge of the}} network, thus realizing a flatter architecture and <b>pushing</b> <b>services</b> closer to the terminals. Our approach overcomes some of the major limitations of centralized IP mobility management solutions, by extending existing standard protocols. I...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} some {{reflections on the}} development of <b>push</b> <b>services</b> and technologies over the Internet, based on work done by the authors in the Swisscast research project from 1997 to 2000 (www. swisscast. net 1). About five years ago <b>push</b> <b>services</b> were seen as a major trend in Internet communication. Users-so it seemed- would simply have to subscribe to a series of these services; then, they would receive all new information &quot;just in time &quot; on their computer in a suitable format. However, the actual development has been quite disappointing: despite some initial success, almost all of these services and software tools have been discontinued (see section 1). While one could simply dismiss push as a short-lived fashion, our experience in developing a <b>push</b> <b>service</b> (see section 2) and theoretical reflections (see section 3) show that services that organise contents and deliver them to subscribers may correspond to a real need of communication on the Internet and, thus, may have a real market opportunity...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the theory}} of {{efficient}} markets, prices of individual securities reflect all information available to the capital market. Therefore, new information such as ad hoc disclosures should be priced into stock quotations very quickly. If such significant price effects and enough effect delays can be observed, investors should be informed about relevant market events very quickly. Therefore, this paper analyzes prompt short-run stock market reactions caused by company announcements. Our study shows that the observed intraday price effects and effect delays ask for appropriate mobile notification services. After identifying relevant characteristics of suitable notification services we evaluate different mobile <b>push</b> <b>service</b> technologies.

40|$|Scalable push fi le {{delivery}} with MBMS MBMS <b>push</b> <b>services</b> give operators {{the ability}} to deliver multimedia content, simultaneously, to all users in a specifi c location, without overloading a mobile network. tent increase proportionally {{with the number of}} subscribers {{and the size of the}} transferred content. The scalability problem can be solved by using broadcast technologies for pushing content in the form of fi les. Popular <b>push</b> <b>services</b> can use broad-cast distribution technology to com-plement existing unicast schemes. The resources needed to distribute a fi le are independent of the number of subscrib-ers, and the time needed to reach all subscribers depends only on fi le size. By defi ning separate broadcast chan-nels for different services, it is possi-ble to let users opt-in to the content of their choice. This provides a degree of personalization. Multimedia broadcast/multicast ser-vice (MBMS) is the native broadcast tech-nology of third-generation mobile sys-tem (3 G) networks. 1 It offers two deliv-ery methods: streaming and download. Streaming is typically used for mobile TV services, while download (here called MBMS push fi le delivery service) is used for distributing content in fi les of any size and arbitrary format. The use of MBMS for mobile TV has been described in a previous article. 2 For the purpose of this article, we note that the MBMS push fi le delivery ser-vice is not orthogonal to mobile TV but rather it is a key enabler for the mass-market distribution of podcast TV as part of a rich mobile TV offering. What makes MBMS particularly well suited for <b>push</b> <b>services</b> is an effective paging mechanism that can selectively wake up terminals when a transmission is about to start. This allows terminals to remain in standby mode (preserv-ing battery capacity) while waiting for a transmission. As well, MBMS allows precise control of the broadcast area of any transmission, from one cell up to the entire network...|$|R
