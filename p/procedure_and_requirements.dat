40|$|AbstractThe {{expiration}} {{of patents}} on many biological medicinal products has prompted {{the development of}} these products as similar biological (biosimilar) products. The standard approach of demonstration of bioequivalence for chemical generic products is scientifically not applicable for biosimilar products. The biosimilar product approach, based on comparability (demonstration of similarity), should be adopted. In view of the impending submissions and to facilitate access of such products at a more affordable price in Singapore, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) formalised the procedures and requirements for registration of biosimilar products in 2009. HSA has published the “Guideline on Registration of Similar Biological Products in Singapore” which describes the basic principles, submission <b>procedure,</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> pertaining to documentation, pharmacovigilance, and post-approval batch release for the registration of biosimilar products. This article provides a brief overview as well as key points on the registration of medicinal products and biosimilar products in Singapore...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} put this {{principle}} of a family-centered approach in practice, a legislative effort {{was made in the}} US: the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP). The IFSP ‘theoretically (a) shows that early intervention is concerned with the whole family and (b) results from a family-centered process of identifying child and family strengths and needs and deciding on intervention priorities’ (McWilliam et al., 1998, p. 69). Thus, the completion of IFSP requirements provides a foundation for family-centered early intervention services to children and families within the unit of family. This definition of family-centered early intervention includes an enforcement of parent participation in all aspects of early intervention practices grounded in the law (Wehman and Gilkerson, 1999). More explicitly, ‘parents’ active participation in the IFSP process [became] a goal of family-centered approaches’ (Minke and Scott, 1995, p. 344), and in effect, the completion of the IFSP requirements denotes that the family actively participated in the process of early intervention service planning and delivery. Legitimately, therefore, family-centered early intervention has also been accomplished via the family’s active participation in the IFSP <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Companies Act, 71 of 2008 {{repealed}} the Companies Act, of 61 of 1973, {{the former}} Act came into operation on the 1 st May 2011. The repealing of the 1973 Act meant {{that a new}} legal dispensation was ushered in, these changes obviously affected {{the manner in which}} the law worked prior to the 1 st May 2011. The repurchase of shares by the company is just but one of the many aspects which were affected by the new act. In order to understand the thought process of the legislature when enacting the current law, the history and evolution of section 48 is imperative. Section 80 - 90 and 46 together with 48 of the old and the new act respectively are the legislative framework behind the South African share repurchases rule. This research investigates the genesis of share repurchases in South Africa and thereafter observes the exodus from the original principle to the status quo. Prior to 1999, share repurchases were governed through the capital maintenance rule which was imported from England and other foreign jurisdictions. In terms of the capital maintenance rule the reduction of contributed share capital in any manner was prohibited. The issued share capital of the company was perceived as a guarantee fund intended for the payment of the claims of the creditors of the company in the event that the company defaults on its payments or is liquidated. In 1999, the Companies Amendment Act introduced sections 85 to 90 which was a paradigm shift from the out dated and superfluous share capital maintenance rule, this paradigm shift spared no sub rule within the capital maintenance rule and it is from these legal developments where we saw share repurchase rules including other sub-rules (which are beyond the scope this work) emerging. Section 48 of the new companies act read with other relevant sections the Act thereof prescribes the <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> for share repurchases, these sections further prescribe the consequences and remedies for non-compliance with the prescribed <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements.</b> It is against this background that section 48 effects, impact as well as the interpretation thereof are investigated. In terms of section 48, the company may purchase shares issued by it under certain circumstances provided that it complies with the requirements laid down in the Act, furthermore section 48 transactions may under certain circumstances trigger tax liability for the parties involved.

40|$|The {{floors of}} the K Basins at the Hanford Site are refinished to make {{decontamination}} easier if spills occur as the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is being unloaded from the basins for shipment to dry storage. Without removing the contaminated existing coating, the basin floors are to be coated with an epoxy coating material {{selected on the basis}} of the results of field tests of several paint products. The floor refinishing activities must be reviewed by a management review board to ensure that work can be performed in a controlled manner. Major documents prepared for management board review include a report on maintaining radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable, a waste management plan, and reports on hazard classification and unreviewed safety questions. To protect personnel working in the radiation zone, Operational Health Physics prescribed the required minimum protective methods and devices in the radiological work permit. Also, industrial hygiene safety must be analyzed to establish respirator requirements for persons working in the basins. The <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> for the refinishing work are detailed in a work package approved by all safety engineers.

40|$|For {{quantitative}} {{bioanalytical method}} validation <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{there was a}} relatively good agreement between chromatographic assays and ligand-binding assays. It was realized that the quantitative and qualitative aspects of bioanalytical method validation should be reviewed and applied appropriately. Some of the major concerns between the 2 methodologies related to the acceptable total error for precision and accuracy determination and acceptance criteria for an analytical run. The acceptable total error for precision and accuracy for both the methodologies is less than 30. The 4 – 6 – 15 rule for accepting an analytical run by a chromatographic method remained acceptable while a 4 – 6 – 20 rule was recommended for ligand-binding methodology. The 3 rd AAPS/FDA Bioanalytical Workshop clarified the issues related to placement of QC samples, determination of matrix effect, stability considerations, use of internal standards, and system suitability tests. There was a major concern and issues raised with respect to stability and reproducibility of incurred samples. This should be addressed for all analytical methods employed. It was left to the investigators to use their scientific judgment to address the issue. In general, the 3 rd AAPS/FDA Bioanalytical Workshop provided a forum to discuss and clarify regulatory concerns regarding bioanalytical method validation issues...|$|E
