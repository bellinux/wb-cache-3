5|$|Doom is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by id Software {{and published by}} Bethesda Softworks. A reboot of the Doom franchise, it is the fourth title in the main series and the first major installment since Doom 3 in 2004. It was released worldwide on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 13, 2016 and is powered by id Tech 6. A port for Nintendo Switch, co-developed with <b>Panic</b> <b>Button,</b> is scheduled for release on November 10, 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Mansfield {{signed on}} for an above-the-title billing minor role in The George Raft Story. Starring Ray Danton as Raft, the film showcased Mansfield as a glamorous film {{star in a}} small part. Soon {{after the release of}} The George Raft Story, Mansfield {{returned}} to European films. Over the next few years she appeared primarily in low-budget foreign films such as Heimweh nach St. Pauli (1963, Germany), L'Amore Primitivo (1964, Italy), <b>Panic</b> <b>Button</b> (1964, Italy), and Einer frisst den anderen (1964, Germany).|$|E
25|$|It {{is not a}} {{tracking}} application, neither <b>panic</b> <b>button</b> application. The user doesn’t have {{to press}} any <b>panic</b> <b>button,</b> the process of help call is fully automated.|$|E
50|$|Programming was {{broadcast}} to the buses via a proprietary radio unit, which downloads BusRadio programming. Other {{features on the}} radio unit include GPS, driver <b>panic</b> <b>buttons</b> connected to local emergency services, and internal and external PA systems.|$|R
50|$|Fire alarms {{and other}} {{emergency}} switches are typically non-reversible, using {{a piece of}} glass which must be broken to activate the alarm. For example, <b>Panic</b> <b>buttons</b> in burglar alarm systems might require a plastic key to reset the switch.|$|R
5000|$|An after-action report {{evaluating}} {{the events of}} the 2013 LAX shooting found that [...] "there was a lack of communication among airport officials, police, EMS and federal authorities" [...] and that some of the airport's emergency equipment (such as <b>panic</b> <b>buttons)</b> did not work.|$|R
25|$|Austin, Texas based studio <b>Panic</b> <b>Button</b> Games {{assisted}} Psyonix {{with the}} Xbox One and Nintendo Switch ports, and graphical updates {{to support the}} PlayStation 4 Pro. In April 2017, Psyonix announced that they had partnered with Tencent to bring a free-to-play version of Rocket League to the Chinese gaming market, with users able to purchase cosmetic items through microtransactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{house rules}} forbade anal sex and kissing on the mouth. Many major-league sports figures and entertainment-industry types would visit the Mustang Ranch. After 1985, due to HIV/AIDS, Nevada state law {{required}} customers to wear condoms for both intercourse and oral sex. The {{women were not}} allowed to reject a customer who was willing to pay the house minimum and abide by the rules. For the safety of the women, every room had a hidden <b>panic</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} room floor, shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar alarm's <b>panic</b> <b>button,</b> and a toppled credenza. It appeared that someone had bound her wrists, or tried to, at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on her face that appeared to have been inflicted by the muzzle of a gun. The gun had been fired through a quilt, apparently to muffle the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the changes}} after 7/7, the LAS was criticised in 2010 for {{failures}} to provide fully working radios to its frontline staff. Health and safety inspections {{found that some}} radios failed during heavy rain and staff sometimes had to do without. Crews also raised concerns that the <b>panic</b> <b>buttons</b> on their radios did not work properly.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the campus}} is a {{relatively}} safe campus for students to study at, security on campus was called into question when a student was murdered on campus in October 2010. [...] The campus murder prompted administrators to re-evaluate campus security planning, which looked at adequacy of lighting, the availability of <b>panic</b> <b>buttons,</b> and other security measures.|$|R
50|$|The latest {{technology}} in wireless spill containment eliminates any infrastructure changes using a wireless network (ZigBee) which inflates bladders that employ disposable gas cylinders. The wireless plugs enable spill containment in virtually any location. Using the ZigBee network enables {{the user to}} connect any type of component to the wireless system such as sensors, fire alarms, <b>panic</b> <b>buttons,</b> remote controls etc.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, the group's new line-up {{recorded}} the Major Label Debut EP; the first release on <b>Panic</b> <b>Button</b> Records, a label Ben and John had formed {{that year and}} quickly followed it with Television City Dream. Their next release, 1999's Emo, featured the same line-up minus Zac Damon, who was unable to record due to school commitments at the time. In 2000 the band brought in Phillip Hill as a second guitarist and recorded what {{was intended to be}} their final album, Teen Punks in Heat. After the album, Screeching Weasel made their first live appearances since 1993, playing 30 minute matinees at Chicago's House of Blues. The band broke up for the third—and allegedly final—time on July 6, 2001, due to Jughead's frustration of a lack of touring.|$|E
500|$|Penelope Wilton as pessimist Jean Ainslie. After Douglas invested—and {{seemingly}} lost—all {{their savings}} in their daughter's internet business, {{they can afford}} only a [...] "beige bungalow" [...] installed with a <b>panic</b> <b>button</b> and hand rails [...] "for the future". She hates everything about India; the perceived noise, poverty, and smells. It {{is for this reason}} that she stays indoors often, and wishes to return to the UK.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{she had a}} well-publicized {{affair with}} Enrico Bomba, the Italian {{producer}} and production manager of her film <b>Panic</b> <b>Button.</b> Hargitay accused Bomba of sabotaging their marriage. In 1963, she had another well-publicized relationship with singer Nelson Sardelli, whom she said she planned to marry when her divorce from Mickey Hargitay was finalized. The couple divorced in Juarez, Mexico, in May 1963, where Nelson Sardelli accompanied Mansfield in her legal preparations. She had previously filed for divorce on May 4, 1962, but told reporters [...] "I'm sure we will make it up." [...] During the acrimonious divorce proceedings, the actress attempted to force a more favorable financial settlement by accusing Hargitay of kidnapping one of her children.|$|E

50|$|The {{complex is}} earthquake- and fire-resistant. Security {{is based on}} the concept of risk mitigation. Safety is managed by a {{monitoring}} and control center, Cecom, which maintains communications with the staff. The complex has a closed circuit television (CCTV) system, a staff of 74 officers for the shopping area, and parking, <b>panic</b> <b>buttons</b> and metal detectors and motions detectors in the office towers and some shopping areas. The security staff works with national and municipal authorities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{district}} {{chose the}} 60 acre {{site for the}} new high school on {{the southeast corner of}} Willis and Emmett Roads and purchased it at $10,000 per acre, thus making the entire purchase cost $600,000. In fall of 2011 classes began at the newly constructed 254,000 sq. ft., 2 story high school. Located approximately 2.5 miles from the old high school, the new facility is nearly 5 {{times the size of the}} old building. The new facility includes many tech, safety, and athletic additions to improve functionality. The new facility includes 34 classrooms(14 of which are unused), each with its own dedicated smart board, projector, and <b>panic</b> <b>buttons.</b> 110 security cameras adorn the 60-acre campus inside and out. The main entrance to the building features a [...] "safety door" [...] which makes guests check in through a window before being buzzed into the building.|$|R

A 2003 XR started at [...] and , but when equipped with AWD cost at least $18,445 (only $305 less than an XRS) and weighed in at [...] Like the base model, the XR's AWD engine was detuned. Again, the car's price for its sophomore year stayed the same, but {{in the four years}} after that, it rose to $16,990.|$|E
2500|$|Grandmaster (GM) John Nunn adds a caveat: when {{in a bad}} position, {{one must}} decide between two strategies, which he calls [...] "grim [...] " [...] and [...] "create confusion." [...] "Grim defence" [...] {{involves}} finding some way to hang on, often by liquidating to an ending. [...] "Create confusion" [...] entails trying to [...] "gain the initiative, even at material cost, hoping to stir up complications and cause the opponent to go wrong." [...] Nunn cautions that, [...] "If you decide to go for 'create confusion' then you should press the <b>panic</b> <b>button</b> sufficiently early to give yourself a reasonable chance of success. However, you should be sure that your position is really bad enough to warrant such drastic measures. In my experience, {{it is far more}} common to panic too early than too late." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{panic alarm}} is {{frequently}} {{but not always}} controlled by a concealed <b>panic</b> alarm <b>button.</b> These buttons can be connected to a monitoring center or locally via a silent alarm or an audible bell/siren. The alarm {{can be used to}} request emergency assistance from local security, police or emergency services. Some systems can also activate closed-circuit television to record or assess the event.|$|R
5000|$|Critics who favour a {{physical}} aetiology for CFS, including Prof. Malcolm Hooper, and the Countess of Mar have strongly criticised Wessely. In {{an article on}} chronic fatigue syndrome, The Guardian calls this criticism a [...] "vendetta". Wessely has repeatedly stated {{he has been the}} subject of numerous threats and personal attacks, and that [...] "militants" [...] have even made threats to his life. [...] "It is a relentless, vicious, vile campaign designed to hurt and intimidate...For some years now all my mail has been x rayed. I have speed dial phones and <b>panic</b> <b>buttons</b> at police request and receive a regular briefing on my safety and specific threats." [...] Wessely claims to have given up research into CFS 10 years ago although he continues his clinical work with sufferers but his main research interests are now in the health of serving and ex-serving member of the armed forces. [...] "I now go to Iraq and Afghanistan, where I feel a lot safer".|$|R
50|$|Prostitution abolitionists also {{object to}} the high rates of {{violence}} against women in the sex industry. Studies of women in prostitution show an extremely high level of violence is perpetrated against women in prostitution. Figures vary across studies. One representative study showed 82% of respondents had been physically assaulted since entering prostitution, 55% of those by johns. Additionally, 80% had been physically threatened while in prostitution, 83% of those with a weapon. 8% reported physical attacks by pimps and johns of a nature that resulted in serious injury, for example gunshot wounds and knife wounds. 68% reported having been raped since entering prostitution, 48% {{more than five times}} and 46% reporting rapes committed by johns. Finally, 49% reported pornography was made of them while they were in prostitution and 32% had been upset by an attempt to make them do what johns had seen in pornography. Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear. Many brothels have installed <b>panic</b> <b>buttons</b> because of the ongoing threat of violence indoors.|$|R
2500|$|Phil has a <b>panic</b> <b>button</b> {{installed}} and Kathy {{helps the}} police trace Gavin via his mobile phone. Ben tells Gavin to leave or be arrested, {{as the police}} have arrived. Ben tells his family that Gavin has left, but Gavin returns, where Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) apparently recognises him and appears fearful. On Halloween, Kathy is on edge, and she fears Gavin has gone into Ian's house. Ben and Kathy then see Gavin, but are unsure it was him. They go to Phil's house, where Gavin locks Phil and Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau) in a bedroom. When Kathy attempts to call the police, Gavin appears. He threatens to light fireworks inside the house, hoping to kill himself, Kathy, Ben, Phil and Dennis. Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), Phil's wife and Dennis's mother, arrives and Gavin reveals he knows that Sharon is the adopted daughter of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Gavin surprises Kathy by saying that Walford was once his home {{and he had a}} child. Sharon realises Gavin could be her birth father, and he confirms it when he says, [...] "Hello, princess", which Den used to say to her. Kathy pleads with Gavin not to light the fireworks and promises to leave with him again. Phil escapes, knocks Gavin unconscious and ties him up. While Sharon talks to Kathy, she realises that Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey), the solicitor who arranged her adoption and who she has been visiting to track her father, is Gavin's sister. When Gavin wakes up, Sharon asks about her adoption; Gavin says he had a fling with Carol Hanley (Sheila White), who had a breakdown after Sharon's birth, and Gavin was not paternal but Den was, so he traded Sharon for part in a bank raid that Den was working on. Phil then tells Sharon that Gavin previously had him locked in a room with no windows and just a bottle of whisky, meaning Phil turned to alcohol. Sharon decides to call the police so presses Phil's <b>panic</b> <b>button.</b> Sharon then confronts Gavin, who tells her that he asked Den to greet Sharon for him occasionally by calling her [...] "princess". When the police arrive, Gavin has gone. Sharon reveals she took money from Phil's safe to let Gavin go, and when she meets Margaret again, she confirms she helped Gavin fake his death and gives Sharon his phone number. Sharon calls and leaves a message, and later receives a text message, saying they will see each other soon.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} verbal abuse and physical violence in accident and emergency (A&E) departments and to discover the extent of provision of security measures and instructions for staff {{on how to deal}} with these problems. DESIGN: A postal questionnaire. SETTING: A&E departments in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. SUBJECTS: Two hundred and seventy three consultants named in charge of 310 departments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of physical violence and verbal abuse, injuries sustained, perceived precipitating factors, security measures instituted, and legal action taken. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty three replies were received. Alcohol, waiting times, recreational drug usage, and patients' expectations were perceived as the chief causes. Patients were the chief perpetrators with nurses being the commonest victims. Staff sustained 10 fractures, 42 lacerations, and 505 soft tissue injuries. There were 298 arrests and 101 court appearances that resulted in 76 convictions. <b>Panic</b> <b>buttons</b> and video cameras were the most common security measures. CONCLUSIONS: Staff within A&E departments are regularly abused, both verbally and physically. Inner city departments appear to be most affected. Documentation is poor. Perpetrators are seldom convicted. There do appear to be actions which hospitals could undertake that might help to ameliorate these problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to record changes made by a wide body of general practices due to experience of, or concerns over, aggression. The study involved a retrospective survey of all general practitioners (GPs) in the West Midlands Health Authority region using a piloted postal questionnaire. A total of 1093 (40. 6 %) doctors responded out of a potential 2694. Seven-hundred and ninety-four (72. 7 %) of doctors had not made changes due to fears over aggression. The other 299 doctors listed 68 different types of change to practice (premises, process) or to motivation because of fears of abuse. These changes included striking off more patients, recorded by 128 (11. 7 %); discussing the problem at practice meetings, by 122 (11. 2 %); installing <b>panic</b> <b>buttons,</b> by 94 (8. 6 %) and increasing the use of deputizing service, by 76 (7 %). Seventy-three (6. 7 %) doctors felt less committed to medicine and 40 (3. 7 %) felt less confident as doctors, feelings that were significantly more likely to be volunteered by women and Asian trained practitioners. Unfortunately, most of the changes, such as putting up security screens or prescribing on demand, were potentially likely to be counterproductive. This study therefore illustrates the need for more support and advice to practices on how to avoid and respond to aggression at work...|$|R
40|$|The {{demographic}} change and ageing in Europe {{will lead to}} {{a growing number of people}} suffering from dementia. Consequently, costs for public health will increase because people become more and more reliant on care and gradually lose their independence and mobility. In the case of dementia, remedial measures could be provided by assistive technology to support independent living at home for as long as possible. Current assistance systems are often limited to actively raising an alert (i. e., electronic <b>panic</b> <b>buttons)</b> or location tracking. Due to this small range of functions these systems are poorly accepted by the target group. Thus, this paper reports on a selection process for a spatial data collection device allowing the development of a new so-called mobility safeguarding assistance system for people with dementia which combines features of different systems. In particular, the wearability as an everyday object is a key issue when it comes to identifying an adequate gadget for elderly people. The proposed methodology considers user requirements as well as technical requirements when it comes to finding a suitable device. Based on these requirements, several different devices were reviewed and tested in order to find most suitable potential device as part of the selection process. The device selected shows that the proposed process on how to choose the right device performed well...|$|R

40|$|Background: Aggression against doctors {{involved}} in after-hours house calls (AHHC) is widely {{perceived to be}} high. It is, however, unclear how doctors who perform this service manage the risk of aggressive patients during home visits. Aims: The aim {{of this paper is}} to explore if and how doctors manage the risk of violence against them during AHHC. Methods: A survey was designed and administered to all 300 Australian-based doctors engaged in AHHC under the National Home Doctor Service (NHDS). The survey was conducted from September 2014 to November 2014. Results: There were 172 responses (57. 3 per cent). Only 43 per cent of respondents adopted personal protective measures. The remaining 57 per cent had none; of those 6 per cent had never considered protective measures, and 31. 8 per cent were aware of the risk of violence, but were unsure of what to do. Measures adopted include the use of chaperones/security personnel (34. 1 per cent), dependence on surgery policies (31. 2 per cent), de-escalation techniques (15. 2 per cent), <b>panic</b> <b>buttons</b> (7. 2 per cent), personal alarms (6. 1 per cent), and others (6. 5 per cent). Females were more likely to adopt personal protective measures than males (OR 4. 94; p< 0. 01; CI 1. 70 – 14. 34), and Australian-trained doctors were less likely to do so relative to overseas-trained doctors (OR 0. 35; p= 0. 04; CI 0. 12 – 0. 99). Conclusion: Just over half of the doctors {{involved in}} AHHC took no precautions against aggressive attacks while on duty, and nearly one-third relied on the policies of their employing surgeries.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} years we have {{witnessed}} to a substantial increase {{on the number of}} people in need of care services, espe-cially among the elderly, a phenomenon related to population ageing. However, this is becoming not exclusive of the elderly, as diseases like obesity, diabetes, and blood pressure have been increasing amongst young adults. This is a new reality which needs to be dealt by the healthcare sector, specifically the public one. Given these new scenarios, the importance of finding new and cost-effective ways for health care delivery are of particular relevance, especially when it is believed that these new patients should not be removed from their natural, day-to-day life, environment. The evolution of the, so called, new technolo-gies may pay here a very important role as they may become part of the solution for this new problematic. Actually, they are already been used as, in recent years, several projects have raised in this relatively new area of work. These projects, although legitimate ones, were essential for delineating a path to pursue for others to come, as they were in some case, very simple ones (e. g. <b>panic</b> <b>buttons),</b> and, especially, reactive ones. In this paper, we are going to present how we are trying to evolve these projects a step further, through the introduction of proactiveness as a key factor, taking advantage of “new”, as in applied to this areas, techniques of decision making, idea generation, argumentation and data quality, applied, not only to the in transit information, but also to the one provided by the several intervenient as well as themselves.

To achieve these goals, the VirtualECare environment is presented, together with its sustaining infrastructure and architecture...|$|R
