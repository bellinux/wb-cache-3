5|$|During the 18th century botany {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than <b>plant</b> <b>reproduction</b> which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E
25|$|Although women {{excelled in}} many {{scientific}} areas during the eighteenth century, they were discouraged from learning about <b>plant</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Carl Linnaeus' system of plant classification based on sexual characteristics {{drew attention to}} botanical licentiousness, and people feared that women would learn immoral lessons from nature's example. Women were often depicted as both innately emotional and incapable of objective reasoning, or as natural mothers reproducing a natural, moral society.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} by animals of items involved in <b>plant</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{is usually a}} mutualistic association. Pollinators may increase plant reproductive success by reducing pollen waste, increasing dispersal of pollen, and increasing the probability of sexual reproduction at low population density. In return, the pollinator receives nourishment {{in the form of}} nectar or pollen. Animals may also disperse the seed or fruit of plants, either by eating it (in which case they receive the benefit of nourishment) or by passive transport, such as seeds sticking to fur or feathers.|$|E

50|$|This plant {{grows in}} Florida scrub habitat on the Lake Wales Ridge of Central Florida. It grows on {{rosemary}} balds {{in areas of}} sand pine scrub, open areas where sunlight reaches through the canopy of taller vegetation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Male {{reproduction}} {{is an essential}} biological event in the plant life cycle separating the diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte generations, which involves expression of approximately 20, 000 genes. The control of male {{reproduction is}} also of economic importance for plant breeding and hybrid seed production. With the advent of forward and reverse genetics and genomic technologies, {{a large number of}} male reproduction-related genes have been identified. Thus it is extremely challenging for individual researchers to systematically collect, and continually update, all the available information on genes and mutants related to <b>plant</b> male <b>reproduction.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} manually curate such gene and mutant information and provide a web-accessible resource to facilitate the effective study of <b>plant</b> male <b>reproduction.</b> DESCRIPTION: <b>Plant</b> Male <b>Reproduction</b> Database (PMRD) is a comprehensive resource for browsing and retrieving knowledge on genes and mutants related to <b>plant</b> male <b>reproduction.</b> It is based upon literature and biological databases and includes 506 male sterile genes and 484 mutants with defects of male reproduction from a variety of plant species. Based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and literature, information relating to a further 3697 male reproduction related genes were systematically collected and included, and using in text curation, gene expression and phenotypic information were captured from the literature. PMRD provides a web interface which allows users to easily access the curated annotations and genomic information, including full names, symbols, locations, sequences, expression patterns, functions of genes, mutant phenotypes, male sterile categories, and corresponding publications. PMRD also provides mini tools to search and browse expression patterns of genes in microarray datasets, run BLAST searches, convert gene ID and generate gene networks. In addition, a Mediawiki engine and a forum have been integrated within the database, allowing users to share their knowledge, make comments and discuss topics. CONCLUSION: PMRD provides an integrated link between genetic studies and the rapidly growing genomic information. As such this database provides a global view of <b>plant</b> male <b>reproduction</b> and thus aids advances in this important area.

50|$|This light {{limitation}} often restricts a <b>plant’s</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{and growing}} ability. When a treefall gap forms, {{there is a}} distinguishable difference {{in the amount of}} light that penetrates through to the lower levels of the forest; however, the amount of light that is now able to penetrate depends on how big the gap actually is. A treefall gap that is only 5 meters in diameter will allow less light to reach the understory than a larger gap that is 10 meters wide. In addition, a smaller gap will receive more direct radiation from the sun, whereas a larger gap will receive high amounts of diffuse radiation. The increased amount of light that is now available to the understory community will release them from their previous light limitation.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} how Pacific Northwest prairies {{are influenced by}} local site factors versus. regional climate, we studied the <b>reproduction,</b> <b>plant</b> size, and density of sixteen natural populations of four perennial forb species native to Pacific Northwest prairies: Ranunculus austro-oreganus, Sidalcea malviflora spp. virgata, Microseris laciniata, and Eriophyllum lanatum.

We found significant differences in <b>plant</b> size and <b>reproduction</b> among populations for all species, but correlations among edaphic and climate variables and <b>plant</b> size and <b>reproduction</b> were weak.

40|$|Myrmecophytism {{occurs in}} plants that offer ants a nesting space and, often, food rewards in {{exchange}} for protection from predators and competitors. Such biotic protection by ants can, however, interfere with the activity of pollinators leading to potential negative consequences for the <b>plant's</b> <b>reproduction.</b> In this study, we focused on the association between the understory myrmecophyte, Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae), and its obligate ant partner, Allomerus decemarticulatus (Myrmicinae). We investigated the reproductive biology of H. physophora and the putative mechanisms that may limit ant-pollinator conflict. Our results show that H. physophora is an obligate outcrosser, self-incompatible, and potentially insect-pollinated species. The reproduction of H. physophora relies entirely on pollen transfer by pollinators that are likely quite specific. Potential interference between flower-visiting insects during pollination may also be lessened by a spatial and temporal segregation of ant and pollinator activities, thus enabling pollen transfer and fruit production...|$|R
