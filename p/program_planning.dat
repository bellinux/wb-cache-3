As Chief of the Planning and Control Division in 1949, Richmond was responsible for the response to the recommendations of the Hoover Commission to transfer control of the Coast Guard from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Commerce. He successfully demonstrated to the commission that there were no gains in economy or efficiency by such an action. On 9 March 1950, President Harry S.

40|$|Program {{views are}} useful aids {{that can help}} programmers in {{understanding}} aspects of existing programs that they may need to extend or modify. Most views describe detailed information about program components or provide abstractions of relationships between components. Programmers, however, often need abstracted views of delocalized <b>programming</b> <b>plans</b> to understand how various components throughout a program can be interrelated in different ways to achieve specific goals or program effects. This requires the 2 ̆ 2 weaving 2 ̆ 2 together of diverse information sources that current tools do not adequately support. This paper presents a new methodology for automatically abstracting delocalized <b>programming</b> <b>plans</b> from <b>programs,</b> and describes automatic abstractors for three specific plans: the calling pattern {{of a set of}} functions in a program, the program-wide occurrence of a global variable and the modification effects of a call site. We show how these abstractors can extract instances of <b>programming</b> <b>plans,</b> present them as an integrated set of abstract program views, and support programmer interaction with these views. A framework for constructing automatic abstractors is described, that allows abstractors for a class of delocalized <b>programming</b> <b>plans</b> to be easily constructed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the nine month <b>program</b> <b>plan</b> is to {{document}} all the activities that are scheduled for January-September, 1986 at FMPC. The intent of preparing the nine month <b>program</b> <b>plan</b> was to prepare a description of authorized work, budget the work on a month-to-month basis and schedule the completion of work. The milestones in the WMCO Transition Plan that included the gathering of FY 86 work scope and budget information in addition to issuing the 9 -month <b>Program</b> <b>Plan</b> assumed {{the existence of an}} existing budget program that priced and budgeted work monthly. In the absence of a budget computer program, an IBM P. C, with extended memory was leased to handle the volume of budget data. The planning concept in the nine month program was based on defining manageable work, scheduling small increments of work, and estimating the resources in labor, material and services required to accomplish the work. Then, as the work plan is implemented, the accomplishments and actual costs are reported against the plan and significant variances are identified for management action, if required. The two work tasks which were scheduled in the Transition Plan for preparing the Nine Month <b>Program</b> <b>Plan</b> were: (1) collect FY 86 - 88 financial data, production levels and capital construction schedules for FMPC, and (2) coordinate the preparation of the <b>program</b> <b>plan</b> consistent with C/SCSC where practical...|$|R
