25|$|The Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident—also {{known as}} the Rogers Commission—was formed to {{investigate}} the disaster. It determined that the accident was due to a failure of rubber O-rings made by Morton-Thiokol that provided a <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> in the aft field joint of the shuttle's right Solid Rocket Booster. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a design flaw, as their performance could be too easily compromised by factors that included the low temperature {{on the day of}} launch. The Commission found that O-ring resiliency is directly related to temperature and due to the low temperature at launch—36 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 degrees lower than the next coldest previous launch—it was probable the O-rings had not provided a proper seal.|$|E

This was a big improvement on the clamp down cockpit of the Mk VI. The canopy was double-glazed and used rubber tubing to create a proper <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> against the fuselage. The canopy rails were bulkier than the standard Spitfire type.|$|E

50|$|Car washes {{often use}} these triplex-style plunger pumps (perhaps without {{pulsation}} dampeners). In 1968, William Bruggeman significantly reduced {{the size of}} the triplex pump and increased the lifespan so that car washes could use equipment with smaller footprints. Durable high <b>pressure</b> <b>seals,</b> low <b>pressure</b> <b>seals</b> and oil seals, hardened crankshafts, hardened connecting rods, thick ceramic plungers and heavier duty ball and roller bearings improve reliability in triplex pumps. Triplex pumps now are in a myriad of markets across the world.|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{effects in}} a flat seal having an angular {{misalignment}} are analyzed, {{taking into account the}} radial variation in seal clearance. An analytical solution for axial force, restoring moment, and transverse moment is presented that covers the whole range from zero to full angular misalignment. Both low <b>pressure</b> <b>seals</b> with cavitating flow and high <b>pressure</b> <b>seals</b> with full fluid film are considered. Strong coupling is demonstrated between angular misalignment and transverse moment which leads the misalignment vector by 90 degrees. This transverse moment, which is entirely due to hydrodynamic effects, is a significant factor in the seal operating mechanism...|$|R
50|$|Another type of bonnet {{construction}} in a gate valve is <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> bonnet. This construction is adopted for valves for high pressure service, typically {{in excess of}} 2250 psi (15 MPa). The unique feature of the <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> bonnet is that the bonnet ends in a downward-facing cup which fits inside {{the body of the}} valve. As the internal pressure in the valve increases, the sides of the cup are forced outward. improving the body-bonnet seal. Other constructions where the seal is provided by external clamping pressure tend to create leaks in the body-bonnet joint.|$|E

5000|$|An obturating ring is {{a ring of}} {{relatively}} soft material designed to obturate under pressure to form a seal. Obturating rings are often found in artillery and other ballistics applications, and similar devices are also used in other applications such as plumbing, like the olive in a compression fitting. The term [...] "O-ring" [...] is sometimes used to describe this kind of <b>pressure</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A liner is {{a casing}} string {{that does not}} extend to the surface, being hung instead from a liner hanger set inside of the {{previous}} casing string but usually within about 300 ft of its bottom. Other than the obvious cost savings, the liner installation allows larger drill pipe or production tubing {{to be used in}} the upper portions of the well. (A disadvantage is the occasional difficulty in effecting a <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> by squeeze cementing the casing-liner overlap zone.) ...|$|E

50|$|A dustcap {{is a small}} cover used on {{the valve}} stem of a bicycle or car tire to prevent dust or other small {{particles}} from entering the valve and damaging it. The dustcap also forms a <b>pressure</b> <b>seal,</b> helping to prevent deflation of the tire due to slight gas seepage past the tire valve. Dustcaps are usually made from plastic but may occasionally be made of metal. The dustcap is internally threaded and is secured by screwing it onto {{the end of the}} stem. To prevent corrosion due to electrolysis and malfunction of the electronics in a direct TPMS and avoid costly repairs, metal valve caps without insulating plastic linings should not be used on direct-TPMS-equipped tire valve stems.|$|E

50|$|A reactor {{building}} is a general term for a building that houses a reactor of some type. In particular, it often refers to a building containing a nuclear reactor.

5000|$|Rimless glasses lenses {{are held}} in place (or [...] "mounted") {{by way of a}} series of screws, or hollow plastic double rivets (called [...] "{{bushings}}" [...] or [...] "compression plugs") that fit into two holes in the lens. When bushings are used, the temples and bridge have barbed metal pins that lock into the bushings, creating a <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> that holds the lenses in place. Although they are more cosmetically appealing, the bushing method is more fragile than the screw and nut method, and more difficult for laypersons to repair themselves in the event of loosening or breakage. Bushing based rimless mounts are, however, designed so that the pins can pull out of the lenses without causing damage, which reduces repair cost and duration.|$|E
5000|$|When pipe snaps or {{a part of}} the bit breaks off, {{the crew}} has to recover all of the {{separated}} items from the wellbore. Recovering snapped pipe usually involves placing a specialized tool (an [...] "overshot") with grips set inside of it over the broken pipe in an attempt to capture it. The grip works {{in a manner similar to}} Chinese fingercuffs. Sometimes the jagged top of the fish must be milled back to a round outside shape before the overshot can slip over it. The overshot contains a packoff device to make a <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> so circulation can be reestablished through the bit to facilitate recovery of the fish. For a broken bit, a magnet is commonly used to remove all of the broken parts.|$|E
50|$|The {{third and}} final test, Excelsior III, was made on August 16, 1960. During the ascent, the <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> in Kittinger's right glove failed, {{and he began to}} {{experience}} severe pain in his right hand from the exposure of his hand to the extreme low pressure. (See Space exposure.) He decided not to inform the ground crew about this, in case they should decide to abort the test. Despite temporarily losing the use of his right hand, he continued with the ascent, climbing to an altitude of 102800 ft. The ascent took one hour and 31 minutes and broke the previous manned balloon altitude record of 101516 ft, which was set by Major David Simons as part of Project Manhigh in 1957. Kittinger stayed at peak altitude for 12 minutes, waiting for the balloon to drift over the landing target area. He then stepped out of the gondola to begin his descent.|$|E
50|$|A chance {{discovery}} showed Holter, after {{a failed}} attempt {{in which a}} young boy died, that he could use a silicone one-way valve (<b>pressure</b> <b>sealing).</b> After a medically suitable grade of Silastic (silicone and rubber) was found, the device was patented, and John Holter set up a company, Holter-Hausner International, to manufacture the cerebral shunts.|$|R
50|$|Grissom's cabin <b>pressure</b> <b>sealed</b> off at {{the proper}} altitude, about 27000 ft, and he felt elated that the {{environmental}} control system was in good working order. The suit and cabin temperatures, respectively about 57.5 and 97 F were quite comfortable. Watching his instruments for the pitch rate of the Redstone, Grissom saw it follow directions as programmed, tilting over at about 1 deg/s.|$|R

5000|$|Momsen {{returned}} to his diving bell idea in 1930. He built a prototype, constructed from a water-tight aircraft hangar pirated from S-1 and tested it off Key West, Florida. Momsen stated the bell was unstable, tipped, and leaked, and had several changes in mind for the diving bell, but {{was sent to the}} Bureau of Construction and Repair to teach submariners how to use the Momsen lung before he could make the changes. He charged Lieutenant Commander Al McCann to make the changes he wanted and McCann was put in charge of the final revisions on the Momsen / McCann diving bell. When the redesigned diving bell was completed in late 1930, it was introduced as the McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber. The final bell, with the revisions and changes that Momsen authorized, included a floor bulkhead, pneumatic winch and a <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> allowing direct transfer of survivors to the diving bell in a dry environment.|$|E
50|$|Gerry and {{the others}} manage to seal {{themselves}} in the aquarium's control room before the rotunda above floods completely, {{only to find that}} the damaged <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> on the door is causing the moon pool to slowly flood their room as well. Nima notices that the only way out is through a sea cave in the wall of the lagoon, which she remembers from her childhood, that will take them directly to the surface. Donning scuba gear, the three make their way through the water and into the cave, narrowly avoiding the mosasaur in the process while following some pipes. They eventually reach the surface and head for the docks, where Nima's contacts left a boat waiting after Nedry's failed delivery, but are attacked by Yoder as soon as they arrive. As Nima and Yoder fight, the T. rex arrives, and they all freeze in place to keep the dinosaur from seeing them. Gerry kicks the embryo canister to distract the T. rex, but Yoder rushes for it, giving himself away and getting himself devoured. Nima manages to grab the canister as the three remaining survivors run for the boat. Gerry distracts the T. rex so the others can escape, but the T. rex damages the skywalk Nima and Jess are on. As Jess clings to the railing, the canister falls to the ground below.|$|E
