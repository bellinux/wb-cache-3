25|$|Spain is {{de facto}} a <b>plurinational</b> state. The idendity of Spain rather accrues of an overlap of {{different}} territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole Spanish identity. In some cases {{some of the}} territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture. Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques, Catalans, Galicians, Andalusians and Valencians, although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity.|$|E

Similarly to Catalonia and the Basque Country, the Galician Football Federation also periodically fields a national team against international opposition. This fact causes some political controversy because matches involving other national football teams different from the Spanish official national team threaten its status as {{the one and only}} national football team of the State. The policy of centralization in sport is very strong as it is systematically used as a patriotic device with which to build a symbol of the supposed unity of Spain which is actually a <b>plurinational</b> State.|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, an {{election}} {{to form a}} Constitutional Assembly was held, which saw the highest ever electoral turnout in the nation's history. MAS won 137 of its 255 seats, after which the Assembly was inaugurated in August. In November, the Assembly approved a new constitution, which converted the Republic of Bolivia into the <b>Plurinational</b> State of Bolivia, describing it as a [...] "plurinational communal and social unified state". The constitution emphasized Bolivian sovereignty of natural resources, separated church and state, forbade foreign military bases in the country, implemented a two-term limit for the presidency, and permitted limited regional autonomy. It also enshrined every Bolivians' right to water, food, free health care, education, and housing. In enshrining the concept of plurinationalism, one commentator noted that it suggested [...] "a profound reconfiguration of the state itself" [...] by recognising the rights to self-determination of various nations within a single state.|$|E
500|$|Once {{elected in}} 2005, Morales {{increased}} taxation on the hydrocarbon industry to bolster social spending, emphasising projects to combat illiteracy, poverty, racism, and sexism. Vocally criticizing neoliberalism and reducing Bolivia's {{dependence on the}} World Bank and International Monetary Fund, his administration oversaw strong economic growth while following a policy termed [...] "Evonomics" [...] which sought to move from a liberal economic approach to a mixed economy. Scaling back U.S. influence in the country, he built relationships with leftist governments in the Latin American pink tide and signed Bolivia into the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. Attempting to moderate the left-indigenous activist community, his administration also opposed the right-wing autonomist demands of Bolivia's eastern provinces. Winning a recall referendum in 2008, he instituted a new constitution that established Bolivia as a <b>plurinational</b> state and was re-elected in 2009. His second term witnessed the continuation of leftist policies and Bolivia's joining of the Bank of the South and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. After becoming the world's oldest professional footballer by signing to a Bolivian team, he was again reelected in the 2014 general election.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{there is}} no single Castilian–Spanish {{identity}} for the whole country. Spain is a de facto <b>plurinational</b> state. Many Spanish citizens feel no conflict in recognising their multiple ethnic identities at the same time. Spain is a culturally heterogeneous country, home {{to a wide range of}} cultures, each one with its own customs and traditions. Some such cultures have their own language. Since the beginning of the transition to democracy in Spain and the creation of the Spanish autonomous communities, after the Francisco Franco dictatorship, there have been many movements towards more autonomy (delegation of powers) in certain territories of the country, some with the aim of achieving full independence and others with the goal of improving the system of devolution and the state of the autonomies (or self-government entities) [...]|$|E

5000|$|Plurinationality, <b>plurinational,</b> or plurinationalism {{is defined}} as the {{coexistence}} of two or more sealed or preserved national groups within a polity (an organized community or body of peoples). Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa defined plurinationalism as the coexistence of several different nationalities within a larger state where different peoples, cultures and worldviews exist and are recognized. [...] In plurinationalism, the idea of nationality is plural, meaning there are many nationals within an organized community or body of peoples. Derived from this concept, a <b>plurinational</b> state is the existence of multiple political communities and constitutional asymmetry. The usage of plurinationality assists in avoiding the division of societies within a state or country. Furthermore, a <b>plurinational</b> democracy recognizes the multiple demoi (common people or populace) within a polity.|$|E
