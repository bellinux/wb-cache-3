25|$|Regarding {{production}} planning, {{there is}} a basic distinction between the push approach and the pull approach, with the later including the singular approach of just in time. <b>Pull</b> <b>means</b> that the production system authorizes production based on inventory level; push means that production occurs based on demand (forecasted or present, that is purchase orders). An individual production system can be both push and pull; for example activities before the CODP may work under a pull system, while activities after the CODP may work under a push system.|$|R

40|$|Sensor {{networks}} {{provide new}} opportunities for data collection. This in turn creates opportunities to apply database techniques for analyzing this data. Such efforts are complicated because data is spread over wireless nodes that transmit messages via radio. Nodes have limited battery life, and using the radio is expensive. Therefore, rather than gathering all data at a base station, it is more efficient to construct query plans that transmit as little data as necessary to produce a solution. In this paper, we present an overview of our work on sensor network query processing and characterize {{it in the context}} of push versus pull techniques for data extraction. Push means to install conditions within the network which, when met, trigger data transmission. <b>Pull</b> <b>means</b> to have the base station request particular data. We believe this is promising approach to generalizing processing techniques for the purpose of developing a methodology for designing query algorithms. ...|$|R

The dual wheels also allow two anchors on double rollers to be serviced. Vertical capstans, for their part, allow the machinery to be placed below decks, thus lowering the center of gravity (important on boats), and also allow a flexible angle of <b>pull</b> (which <b>means</b> rope or chain can be run out to different fair leads).|$|R

30|$|Drawing a {{parallel}} between fracture and friction, we thus propose {{to consider the}} trajectory of a solid body (a slider) pulled across a solid surface exhibiting anisotropic frictional properties. Interestingly, when the slider is <b>pulled</b> by <b>means</b> of an inextensible thread, the sliding is in continuous motion, which {{makes it possible to}} focus on the effects of the anisotropy of the dynamical frictional coefficient alone. The equivalent in fracture would be to consider the path of a crack that propagates, in absence of fits and starts, in a material exhibiting anisotropy of the fracturing energy.|$|R

40|$|Response surface {{methodology}} (RSM) is {{a methodology}} that combines experimental designs and statistical techniques, for empirical model building and optimisation. By conducting experiments and applying regression analysis, RSM seeks to relate {{a response to}} some input variables. This work aims at integrating response surface methodology with genetic algor-ithms (GAs) to realise a GA-based prototype system for the determination of near optimal values in response surface designs. A framework of the prototype system is presented. The prototype system was validated using three case studies of a bonding process that involve solving the Himmelblau function, optimising the <b>mean</b> <b>pull</b> strength, and maximising both the <b>mean</b> <b>pull</b> strength and the minimum strength simul-taneously. The results were compared with those obtained by the Design Expert, which is a commercial software package. Details of the case studies {{as well as the}} comparative studies are presented...|$|R
30|$|We remind {{that the}} slider is <b>pulled</b> by <b>means</b> of a thread having the length a {{attached}} to a fixed point P such that OP ≡R (Fig. 1). From now on, we denote ρ≡ OM, {{the distance between the}} slider M and the center of rotation O which might depend on Ω. However, for an isotropic surface, by symmetry, the asymptotic trajectory is a circle. The additional condition that the velocity of the slider, relative to the table surface, is aligned with the pulling force, thus with PM, imposes the asymptotic radius ρ _ 0 = √(R^ 2 - a^ 2).|$|R

50|$|Lace Sensors {{are true}} single-coil pickups; however, {{internally}} {{they are different}} from classic single coils. The chief difference is that, like the pickups used on the Fender Jaguar, the coil is surrounded by metal barriers which are designed to reduce electro-magnetic interference such as power line hum. According to the manufacturer, these barriers also help concentrate the magnetic field, allowing weaker magnets to be used, which results in less string pull. Less string <b>pull,</b> in turn, <b>means</b> truer pitch and intonation, and superior sustain.|$|R
50|$|The {{demand for}} {{increasing}} power ratings could first be answered with larger rudderpropellers. Limits {{were set to}} this trend by mechanical stress {{and the fact that}} with an increasing propeller diameter, the draft of the vessel inevitably increases. Schottel therefore developed a thruster where the required power is divided between two counter-rotating thrusters that share a single shaft. The Twin Propeller is equipped with a pull propeller and a push propeller. The vortex street of the front pull propeller passes between the blades of the rear push propeller without impeding it. Contraction of the slip stream in the <b>pull</b> propeller <b>means</b> that more water reaches the push propeller from the sides. The strut is equipped with a fin, thus the swirl energy generated in the propeller stream is recovered. Additionally, the flow around the fins creates a lift component in the thrust direction, which has a thrust-enhancing effect.|$|R

30|$|When {{anisotropic}} {{materials are}} considered, {{it is interesting}} to distringuish the role played by the physical properties, considered independently from one another. For instance, both the elastic properties and the energy release associated to the opening of the fracture can be anisotropic. In order to consider the effect of the anisotropy of the energy release only, we propose to consider the analogy between fracture and friction. Indeed, the propagation of a fracture leads to the creation of two new surfaces and the associated energy release increases linearly with the fracture length, whereas elastic energy loaded in the material is released [2, 3, 8]. Similarly, when a slider is <b>pulled</b> by <b>means</b> of a spring across a flat substrate, the energy dissipated by friction increases linearly with the sliding distance, whereas elastic energy loaded in the spring is released [9]. Beyond a simple analogy, the study of the transition to sliding motion in friction shows that the phenomenon can be regarded as a fracturing process [10].|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} methods of making cane. In each, the fundamental technique is the same: {{a lump of}} glass, often containing some pattern of colored and clear glass, is heated in a furnace (glory hole) and then <b>pulled,</b> by <b>means</b> of a long metal rod (punty) attached at each end. As the glass is stretched out, it retains whatever cross-sectional pattern was in the original lump, but narrows quite uniformly along its length (due to the skill of the glassblowers doing the pulling, aided {{by the fact that}} if the glass becomes narrower at some point along the length, it cools more there and thus becomes stiffer). Cane is usually pulled until it reaches roughly the diameter of a pencil, [...] when, {{depending on the size of}} the original lump, it may be anywhere from one to fifty feet in length. After cooling, it is broken into sections usually from four to six inches long, which can then be used in making more complex canes or in other glassblowing techniques.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the domain}} of MOSFET circuits, [...] "bootstrapping" [...] is {{commonly}} used to <b>mean</b> <b>pulling</b> up the operating point of a transistor above the power supply rail.

In the sense used in this paragraph, bootstrapping an operational amplifier means [...] "using a signal to drive the reference point of the op-amp's power supplies". A more sophisticated use of this rail bootstrapping technique is to alter the non-linear C/V characteristic of the inputs of a JFET op-amp in order to decrease its distortion.|$|R
