This laboratory study aimed to compare different control strategies for G. spegazziniana, utilizing a commercial neem seed oil product. <b>Paraguay</b> <b>tea</b> seedlings were treated with neem oil solution both pre- and post-infestation with 5 th instar nymphs. The systemic action of neem oil was also evaluated by treating plant soil with the neem oil solution, followed by transfer of the insects to plants 24 h post-treatment. Spray treatments were effective against the pest, especially post-infestation (80 % mortality), demonstrating the potential of neem oil for control of the <b>Paraguay</b> <b>tea</b> ampul.

40|$|<b>Paraguay</b> <b>tea</b> is {{a native}} crop of {{southern}} Brazil and is also socioeconomically important in Paraguay and Argentina. One of the main pests of this crop is Gyropsylla spegazziniana (Hemiptera: Psyllidae). As there are no registered insecticides for this pest in Brazil, the use of entomopathogenic fungi is an alternative method for its control. This study aimed to evaluate and characterize isolates of the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria spp., Metarhizium anisopliae, Isaria spp. and Lecanicillium spp. on G. spegazziniana. For this purpose, 5 th instar nymphs were transferred to <b>Paraguay</b> <b>tea</b> seedlings, followed by spraying of conidial suspensions (1 × 109 conidia mL- 1) and then placing the seedlings in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cages and maintaining them in a temperature-controlled room (26 ± 1 °C, 12 h 00 photophase, 60 ± 10 % R. H.). Insect mortality was evaluated daily for 10 days, and the selected isolates were characterized according to their vegetative growth, conidial production in synthetic culture medium and rice and insecticidal activity {{as well as through}} molecular analyses, including sequencing the rDNA-ITS region and RAPD analysis. The genus Beauveria spp. was the most efficient, particularly the Unioeste 44 isolate, which caused the greatest total mortality of G. spegazziniana (81. 7 %) and showed among the highest conidial production levels on rice, indicating a significant potential to be used in an integrated management program for this pest. Molecular analysis of the rDNA-ITS region allowed the isolates to be identified as B. bassiana and B. brongniartii, and RAPD markers were found to be associated with virulence. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{oviposition}} {{preference of}} the red mite Oligonychus yothersi McGregor was evaluated under laboratory in 52 <b>Paraguay</b> <b>tea</b> progenies and one control collected in a local farm. The experiments were conducted on <b>Paraguay</b> <b>tea</b> leaf discs infested with one adult female mite/disc, incubated in a climate chamber (25 ± 1 ºC, 14 h photophase) for five days. Evaluations were performed daily, by {{counting the number of}} eggs laid in the period, the number of female escapes in the first 48 hours, as well as the number of eggs laid before the escaping. It was verified that discrimination by the mite occurred on two groups of progenies, in relation to the number of eggs: one group was different from the control (53. 8 % of the progenies) and the other was identical to it (46. 2 % of the progenies). In the first group, 60. 7 % of progenies were less oviposited while a higher number of eggs/female than the control was verified in 39. 3 % of them. In 57. 7 % of progenies there was escape of some mites (10 to 40 %), and in 10 of these progenies no eggs were laid. The data provide evidences that in some of the progenies evaluated there is resistance by non-preference to oviposition of the <b>Paraguay</b> <b>tea</b> red mite. A preferência para oviposição do ácaro-vermelho, Oligonychus yothersi McGregor, foi avaliada em condições de laboratório em 52 progênies de erva-mate e uma testemunha coletada em uma propriedade da região. Os experimentos foram realizados em discos foliares de erva-mate (2 cm de diâmetro), infestados com uma fêmea adulta do ácaro, e incubados a 25 ± 1 ºC e 14 h de fotofase, durante cinco dias. As avaliações foram realizadas diariamente, contando-se o número de ovos depositados no período, número de fêmeas que fugiram nas primeiras 48 horas e número de ovos depositados antes da fuga. Verificou-se que houve discriminação do ácaro em dois grupos de progênies, em relação ao número de ovos, um que diferiu em relação à testemunha (53, 8 % de progênies) e outro que se igualou à mesma (46, 2 % das progênies). No primeiro grupo, houve menor oviposição em 60, 7 % das progênies, enquanto que em cerca de 39, 3 % ocorreu maior oviposição (média de 3, 1 ovos/fêmea). Em 57, 7 % das progênies houve fuga das fêmeas (10 a 40 %), sendo que em 10 dessas progênies não ocorreu oviposição antes da fuga.
