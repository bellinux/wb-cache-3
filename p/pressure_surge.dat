[...] According to {{the former director of}} Irkutskenergo, Viktor Bobrovski, the accident could have been caused by an incorrect start-up process of the turbine which resulted in a hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>surge,</b> or excess load of the turbine caused by peak consumption of electricity. According to Bobrovski, it is common practice in the region to compensate for a peak load by overloading hydroelectric power plants, and the energy system of the region is near collapse, as the main goal of its owners is to take out as much profit as possible, typically by cutting down on maintenance, investment, safety, and educational costs. [...] Since the load for other turbines ceased {{after the collapse of the}} turbine2, they probably started to spin without load at increasing speed until they failed.

The B-1 engine suffered combustion instability which caused loss of thrust within two seconds of liftoff. At T+3 seconds, the thrust section exploded, followed by structural failure of the propellant tanks, causing the Atlas to fall back onto LC-13 in an enormous fireball. The Atlas went in for a repeat performance on April 8 when Missile 48D, launched from LC-11 and intended as the first closed-loop test of the AIG (All Inertial Guidance System), experienced combustion instability again, this time in the B-2 engine. The first indication of trouble was a <b>pressure</b> <b>surge</b> in the B-2 combustion chamber, followed by unstable thrust, engine shutdown, and an explosion that started a thrust section fire. The B-1 engine then shut down, followed by the sustainer and verniers. Since the propulsion system had not attained sufficient thrust, the launcher hold-down mechanism did not release the missile, which stayed in place and burned on the pad. The thrust section fire slowed down 15 seconds after the attempted launch, then resumed around 45 seconds. At 60 seconds, the Atlas was completely destroyed when the propellant tanks exploded.|$|E

During fuel transfer between the tanks, when controlling the aircraft centre of gravity or engine feed and refuel operations, a number of pumps and valves are involved resulting in complex pressure and flow interactions. In order to minimise the <b>pressure</b> <b>surges</b> during sudden system changes and flow overshoot during fuel transfer and refuelling, different motor drive system control strategies have been investigated. It is proposed that the current control method of electrically driven centrifugal-type pumps could be replaced by improved open and closed loop strategies where the flow overshoot can be minimised and <b>pressure</b> <b>surges</b> reduced. Steady-state and dynamic models of an AC induction motor drive and typical aircraft fuel system pipework components have been developed. The validation of these models has been performed using experimental data obtained from a fuel test rig constructed at the University of Bath using water as the working fluid. The simulation results have been shown to agree well with those from experimentation. In addition, the induction motor has been modelled based on its physical properties using the Finite Element Method software MEGA. The investigated fuel system has been described in linear terms and its behaviour has been identified. It is shown that the system dynamic behaviour can be controlled/improved using well established closed loop proportional-integral control. An open loop technique of simultaneous pump and valve control has been proposed and validated using experimental results, resulting in a reduction of both the transient <b>pressure</b> <b>surges</b> and flow overshoot during sudden valve closures, showing significant performance improvements.

50|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a pressure increase of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15-1.6) at design conditions with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90-95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb we can assume that each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (Delta T). Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage pressure ratio through the unit. Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.Higher stage pressure ratios are also possible if the relative velocity between fluid and rotors is supersonic, but this is achieved at the expense of efficiency and operability. Such compressors, with stage pressure ratios of over 2, are only used where minimizing the compressor size, weight or complexity is critical, such as in military jets.The airfoil profiles are optimized and matched for specific velocities and turning. Although compressors can be run at other conditions with different flows, speeds, or pressure ratios, this can result in an efficiency penalty or even a partial or complete breakdown in flow (known as compressor stall and <b>pressure</b> <b>surge</b> respectively). Thus, a practical limit on the number of stages, and the overall pressure ratio, comes from the interaction of the different stages when required to work away from the design conditions. These “off-design” conditions can be mitigated to a certain extent by providing some flexibility in the compressor. This is achieved normally through the use of adjustable stators or with valves that can bleed fluid from the main flow between stages (inter-stage bleed).Modern jet engines use a series of compressors, running at different speeds; to supply air at around 40:1 pressure ratio for combustion with sufficient flexibility for all flight conditions.|$|E
