40|$|BackgroundMotor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are {{a leading}} cause of unintentional death and {{disability}} among children ages 4 - 12 in the United States. Despite this high risk of injury from MVCs in this age group, parental awareness, and child passenger safety programs in particular may lack focus on this age group. MethodsRetrospective cross-sectional analysis of child passenger safety seat checklist forms from two Safe Kids coalitions in Michigan (2013) to identify restraint type upon arrival to car seat inspections. Other variables included, if the coalition provided a new child safety seat and if the child had a sibling who underwent a car seat inspection. Chi-square statistics were used to compare change in restraint use upon arrival and at departure, the proportion of children attending a car seat inspection event by age, the age category of children by site, the proportion of children with siblings also undergoing a car seat inspection by age, and the distribution of a new child safety seat by age. ResultsData were available from 1, 316 Safe Kids Huron Valley and 3, 215 Safe Kids Greater Grand Rapids car seat inspections. Just 10. 8 % of total seats inspected were booster seats. Child safety seats for infant and young children were more commonly inspected [rear-facing carrier (40. 3 %), rear-facing convertible (10. 2 %), and forward-facing (19. 3 %) car seats]. Few children at inspections used a seat belt only (5. 4 %) or had no restraint (13. 8 %). Children age 4 and above were found to be in a sub-optimal restraint at least 30 % of the time. ConclusionLow proportions of parents use car seat inspections for children in the booster seat age group. The proportion of children departing the inspection in a more <b>protective</b> <b>restraint</b> increased with increasing age. This highlights an area of weakness in child passenger safety programs and signals an opportunity to strengthen efforts on The Forgotten Child.

40|$|Abstract In many {{institutional}} settings, blocking, response restriction (e. g., <b>restraint,</b> <b>protective</b> equipment), and re-direction {{procedures are}} used extensively as intervention for self-injurious behavior (SIB) {{and other forms}} of problem behavior. In the current study, a three component, multiple-schedule analysis was used to examine the immediate and subsequent effects of blocking on SIB that persisted in the absence of social reinforcement contingencies. During the first and third components the participant was in the room, alone, with no social consequences for SIB. During the second component (response restriction) the therapist sat in the room with the participant and blocked occurrences of SIB. Results indicated that, although blocking was effective in decreasing SIB while it was being implemented, subsequent effects were idiosyncratic across participants. Evidence of increased levels of SIB following blocking was observed for some participants...|$|R
40|$|One {{contributing}} factor to head injury in restrained child occupants is pre‐crash maneuvers and active child human body models (HBMs) {{can be useful}} tools to design pre‐crash interventions with child safety in focus. This paper implemented postural control in the MADYMO human facet occupant model of a 6 ‐year‐old child using feedback controlled torque actuators. Control parameters were tuned and the active HBM was compared to experimental data from braking and steering events with child volunteers. The head and sternum displacements of the active HBM were within one standard deviation of the experimental data, while the original HBM did not capture the volunteer kinematics at all. By predicting biofidelic child kinematics, the developed model shows potential as {{a useful tool for}} the automotive industry to study the <b>protective</b> properties of <b>restraint</b> systems in pre‐crash scenarios. For autonomous steering events, it was illustrated that the shape of the acceleration pulse highly influences the peak head displacements of child occupants. This is an aspect that needs to be considered when autonomous interventions are designed, {{to ensure the safety of}} short forward facing child occupants...|$|R

Methods: In the present study we investigated the effect of H. perforatum gold nanoparticles (Nanohypericum-HPGNPs) <b>protective</b> role against <b>restraint</b> stress-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations in mice. Animals were immobilized for a period of 6 hrs/day. HPE (200 mg/kg) and nanohypericum (20 mg/kg) were administered 30 minutes before the animals were subjected to acute immobilized stress. Behavioral test parameters for anxiety and spatial memory were assessed followed by biochemical parmeters (lipid peroxidation, super oxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, etc.) subsequently. Results: The behavior study showed severe anxiety and memory loss compared to unstressed animals. Biochemical analyses revealed an increase in lipid per oxidation, depletion of super oxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, catalase activity and glutathione per oxidase as compared to unstressed animal. Twenty one days of H. perforatum and nanohypericum treatment in a dose of 200 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively, significantly attenuated restraint stress-induced behavioral and oxidative damage. Conclusion: In conclusion nanohypericum prove the modest activity than the HPE...|$|R
