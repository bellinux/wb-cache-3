2500|$|Gladstone {{was born}} in Liverpool to Scottish parents. He first entered the House of Commons in 1832, {{beginning}} his political career in the Conservative Party as a High Tory. Gladstone served as a minister in both of Robert Peel's governments, and in 1846 joined the breakaway Peelite faction, which eventually merged into the new Liberal Party in 1859. He was Chancellor under Lord Aberdeen (1852–55), Lord Palmerston (1859–65), and Lord Russell (1865–66). Gladstone's own <b>political</b> <b>doctrine</b> – which emphasised equality of opportunity, free trade, and laissez-faire economic policies – {{came to be known}} as Gladstonian liberalism.

In the Ottoman society [...] "the people" [...] (the correct term for the period was [...] "subjects") side (submits) to autocracy (Ottoman dynasty), theocracy (Caliphate) and feudalism (tribal leaders).

2500|$|Hudal {{was most}} {{concerned}} {{with the rise of}} the international Communist movement and worker parties in Austria. Fear of [...] "Bolshevism" [...] was his starting point, but this feeling turned into an aggressive <b>political</b> <b>doctrine</b> towards Russia: [...] "Essential to understanding Hudal's politics is his fear that Bolshevist military forces would invade Italy through Eastern Europe or the Balkans and would be unstoppable until they destroyed the Church. Like many within the Church, he embraced the bulwark theory, which placed hope in a strong German-Austrian military shield to protect Rome. This protection involved a pre-emptive attack on communism, Hudal believed, and so he felt an urgent need for a Christian army from Central Europe to invade Russia and eliminate the Bolshevist threat to Rome".|$|E

2500|$|In 1831 Heine left Germany for France, {{settling}} in Paris for his remaining 25 years of life. His move {{was prompted by}} the July Revolution of 1830 which had made Louis-Philippe the [...] "Citizen King" [...] of the French. Heine shared liberal enthusiasm for the revolution, which he felt {{had the potential to}} overturn the conservative political order in Europe. Heine was also attracted by the prospect of freedom from German censorship and was interested in the new French utopian <b>political</b> <b>doctrine</b> of Saint-Simonianism. Saint-Simonianism preached a new social order in which meritocracy would replace hereditary distinctions in rank and wealth. There would also be female emancipation and an important role for artists and scientists. Heine frequented some Saint-Simonian meetings after his arrival in Paris but within a few years his enthusiasm for the ideology – and other forms of utopianism- had waned.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, a new {{organization}} was instituted {{under the name}} of Front of Socialist Unity (eventually renamed the Front of Socialist Unity and Democracy). [...] Ostensibly a popular front affiliating virtually all non-party members, it was actually tightly controlled by party activists. [...] It was intended to consolidate the impression that the entire population was backing Ceaușescu's policies. As a result of these new policies, the Central Committee, which acted as the main PCR body between Congresses, had increased to 265 full members and 181 candidate members (supposed to meet at least four times a year). By then, the general secretary also called for women to be enrolled in greater numbers in all party structures. In parallel, the <b>political</b> <b>doctrine</b> in respect to minorities claimed interest in obtaining allegiance from both Hungarians and Germans, and set up separate workers' councils for both communities.|$|E
2500|$|Hirsi Ali, {{a former}} devout Muslim who {{abandoned}} her faith {{and became an}} atheist, has been a vocal critic of Islam. In 2004, she collaborated on a short movie with Theo van Gogh, entitled Submission, a film depicting oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law, critical of the Islamic canon itself. The film sparked controversy and death threats. Van Gogh was murdered later that year by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Moroccan-Dutch Islamic terrorist. Hirsi Ali maintains that [...] "Islam is part religion, and part a political-military doctrine, the part that is a <b>political</b> <b>doctrine</b> contains a world view, a system of laws and a moral code that is totally incompatible with our constitution, our laws, and our way of life." [...] Having previously argued that Islam was beyond reform, in her latest book Heretic (2015) she calls for a reformation of Islam by defeating the Islamists and supporting reformist Muslims.|$|E

2500|$|When Salazar was {{replaced}} in office by Marcello Caetano, some liberalization was promised. In an interview {{given to the}} O Estado de S. Paulo, a Brazilian newspaper, Caetano himself promised to enact a new Press law shortly thereafter. However, little did change. According to [...] "Evolution in Continuity", Caetano's <b>political</b> <b>doctrine,</b> [...] "Prior Censorship" [...] was now termed [...] "Prior Exam". The State Secretary for Information and Tourism would say that: [...] "Nothing has changed in this house, not the spirit, nor the devotion to essential values, nor the course of action", maintaining what was Salazar's stated purpose for the institution: [...] "To maintain the truth". As {{an example of the}} [...] "new" [...] state of things, on October 26, 1972, for an article about the prohibition of a play (an adaptation of [...] "O Arco de Sant’Ana" [...] by Almeida Garrett), the Prior Exam Services from Oporto rejected a version that referred to the prohibition: [...] "Don't mention it was forbidden. It can be said, however, that it won't come to stage".|$|E
2500|$|His {{transition}} from anarchism {{to a more}} moderate platform was also shown by his treatment of the Bessarabian issue. In 1905, his Basarabia newspaper tied together demands of social reform with political and cultural goals, endorsing the planned land reform and demanding the official use of Romanian ("Moldavian") in the administrative apparatus and the Bessarabian Orthodox Church. Its demand for self-governance around an enlarged Sfat ("Assembly") referred back to promises made upon {{the creation of a}} Bessarabian Governorate. The entire program, scholar Marcel Mitrașcă notes, {{was one of the first}} manifestations of [...] "Bessarabian [...] nationalism", the prototype for an agenda later espoused by the National Moldavian Party. Political analysts Mihai Cernencu and Igor Boțan suggest that the <b>political</b> <b>doctrine</b> supported by Basarabia was at once an early instance of Bessarabian liberalism and a regional affiliation to the Constitutional Democratic Party, somewhat permeated by the doctrines of social democracy. More intimately, Arbore was contemplating the possibility of an independent Bessarabia, free from what he considered to be the excesses of Romanian nationalism.|$|E
2500|$|Liberalism, {{the belief}} in freedom and human rights, is {{historically}} associated with such thinkers as John Locke and Montesquieu. [...] It is a political movement which spans {{the better part of}} the last four centuries, though the use of the word liberalism to refer to a specific <b>political</b> <b>doctrine</b> did not occur until the 19th century. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England laid the foundations for the development of the modern liberal state by constitutionally limiting the power of the monarch, affirming parliamentary supremacy, passing the Bill of Rights and establishing the principle of 'consent of the governed'. The 1776 Declaration of Independence of the United States of America founded the nascent republic on liberal principles without the encumbrance of hereditary aristocracy; the declaration stated that [...] "all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," [...] echoing John Locke's phrase [...] "life, liberty, and property". A few years later, the French Revolution overthrew the hereditary aristocracy, with the slogan [...] "liberty, equality, fraternity", and was the first state in history to grant universal male suffrage. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, first codified in 1789 in France, is a foundational document of both liberalism and human rights.|$|E
6000|$|This view of {{the case}} had been surely {{overlooked}} by M. de Tocqueville, {{when he tried to}} explain by the fear of revolutions, the fact that both in America and in England, [...] "while the boldest <b>political</b> <b>doctrines</b> of the eighteenth-century philosophers have been adopted, their anti-religious doctrines have made no way." ...|$|R

50|$|Taoist {{influences}} {{made their}} way even to Shinto, specifically Ise and Yoshida Shintō, both of which developed in Kamakura in 1281.

It is in fact a critical perspective which is a rethinking of some traditional classifications, such as those of realism and idealism, that centres around the worth of the historical process and the lead of an ethical approach to politics, which always relies on the mediation of multiple forms and manifestations of culture...|$|R
