40|$|Some of the {{processing}} of fresh ginger ginger market, dried ginger, preserved ginger, ginger powder, ginger oil and ginger Oleoresin. Of all {{the processing}} of ginger in the market is consumed by many people is the ginger powder, ginger powder is easier because it is processed for consumption. Currently ginger powder in the market can only produce ginger powder with a size of 50 to 60 mesh. (IPTEKnet). Therefore necessary to design a tool to grind ginger powder with a softer result with 80 to 100 mesh size, which according to the wishes of consumers. Results are expected {{in the design of}} ginger <b>powder</b> <b>maker</b> is a simple design, but can produce a fine powder. In addition ginger <b>powder</b> <b>maker</b> can help increase the productivity of small and medium industries. In carrying out this design we use is the basis of production capacity 20 kg/jam. Then determine the distance between the disc grinder. With distance is then obtained and the rpm of the motor power is needed to rotate the second disk. With these problems be knew then obtained a large diameter shaft, bearing types, and type of transmission to be used. With the method above then get in the following dimensions: height hopper max max length of 300 mm and 330 mm width 200 mm max. dynamic surface area of 11559. 1 mm 2 dish. static disc surface area 1160. 1 mm 2. primary pulley diameter 77 mm 217 mm diameter secondary Puli. -V belt length 1291 mm. 300 mm long shaft.

After losing Game One, 78-91, the 400s came back {{to take the next}} three games and clinch the crown. In a riotous second game which Crispa won, 99-95, the <b>Powder</b> <b>Makers</b> rallied from 21 points down to within two points with 24 seconds left but a bad call from the referee prompted fans from Cebu-based squad to react furiously and started pelting the court and in the process halting play for nearly 20 minutes.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the logical}} follow through is sound, the corning {{hypothesis}} has been refuted for two reasons. One, the <b>powder</b> <b>makers</b> were probably {{more worried about}} spoilage than the effect of corned gunpowder on guns, and two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s. In Europe corning arose {{as a response to}} the difficulty of obtaining pure saltpeter, specifically saltpeter consisting of potassium nitrate, rather than sodium nitrate or calcium nitrate, the latter two of which absorb water vapor more readily than potassium nitrate. Thus corning was an imperative to producing reliable weaponized gunpowder. Supposedly this was much less problematic in Asia, where pure saltpeter was more readily available and easily manufactured. In China gunpowder corning had been practiced since the 1370s for the purpose of strengthening the explosive power of mines, since gunpowder corns provided more space required for a rapid combustion. Corned powder might also have been used in guns based on a record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, a feet probably only possible with the aid of corned powder at the time.|$|R

Specific recommendations were listed for medical surveillance of workers, labeling and posting of hazards, requirements for personal protective equipment and clothing, respirator selection criteria, training of workers in the safe handling of these materials, suggested work practices, ignition sources and detonation hazards, entry requirements for confined spaces, storage and handling rules, cleanup and waste disposal methods, emergency procedures, sanitation, monitoring, and record keeping. Occupations with potential exposure to NG and EGDN include chemical and explosives workers, drug makers, dynamite makers, miners, missile technicians, munitions loaders, munitions workers, nitroglycerin workers, rocket fuel makers, shell fillers, and smokeless <b>powder</b> <b>makers.</b> Documented effects of workplace exposures include headache, blood pressure changes, rash, chest pain, changes in electroencephalogram readings, pulse rate changes, palpitations, nausea, altered sensation in extremities, alcohol intolerance, dizziness, and fainting.

2500|$|The {{two primary}} {{theories}} for {{the appearance of}} the classic gun involve the development of gunpowder corning and a new method for casting guns. The corning hypothesis stipulates that the longer barrels came about as a reaction to the development of corned gunpowder. Around the late 14th century European powdermakers began adding liquid to the constituents of gunpowder, which reduced dust, and with it the risk of explosion during manufacture. The <b>powder</b> <b>makers</b> would then shape the resulting paste of moistened gunpowder—known as mill cake—into [...] "corns" [...] or granules to allow it to dry. Not only did [...] "corned" [...] powder keep better, because of its reduced surface area, but gunners also found that it was more powerful and easier to load into guns. The main advantage of corning is that the flame lights all the granules when the gunpowder is lit, spreading between them before significant gas expansion has occurred. Without corning, much of the powder away from the initial flame would be blown out of the barrel before it burnt. The size of the granules varied for different types of gun. Prior to corning, gunpowder would frequently demix into its constitutive components and was an unreliable substance for use in guns. The same granulation process is used nowadays in the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that each tablet contains the same proportion of active ingredient. Before long, powdermakers standardized the process by forcing mill cake through sieves instead of corning powder by hand. The faster gunpowder reaction was suitable for smaller guns, since large ones had a tendency to crack, and the more controlled reaction allowed large guns to have longer, thinner walls.|$|R
