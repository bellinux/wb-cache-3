50|$|Kobayashi {{was born}} in the Kanda {{district}} of Tokyo, where his father was a noted engineer who introduced European diamond <b>polishing</b> <b>technology</b> to Japan, and who invented a ruby-based phonograph needle. Kobayahsi studied French literature at Tokyo Imperial University, where his classmates included Hidemi Kon and Tatsuji Miyoshi. He met Chūya Nakahara in April 1925, with whom he quickly became close friends, but in November of the same year, began living together with Nakahara's former mistress, the actress Yasuko Hasegawa. Kobayashi graduated in March 1928, and soon after moved to Osaka for a few months before moving to Nara, where he stayed at the home of Naoya Shiga from May 1928. His relationship with Yasuko Hasegawa ended around this time. In September 1929, he submitted an article to a contest hed by the literary journal Kaizō, and won second place.|$|E
30|$|Computer-controlled {{deterministic}} polishing is {{the main}} method used to improve the accuracy of a complex curved surface shape [8, 9]. This type of polishing mainly applies CNC <b>polishing</b> <b>technology</b> with a small grinding head [10, 11], balloon <b>polishing</b> <b>technology</b> [12 – 14], magneto-rheological <b>polishing</b> <b>technology</b> [15, 16], ion beam <b>polishing</b> <b>technology</b> [17, 18], and jet <b>polishing</b> <b>technology</b> [19]. Because computer-controlled deterministic polishing is accomplished by controlling the amount of material removed through control of the tool’s residence time (or feed rate) at different points on the surface [20 – 23], surface errors need to be calculated based on the actual surface measurements prior to polishing. Moreover, a quantitative modeling and analysis should be conducted on the material removal when polishing {{with the aim of}} controlling the amount of materials removed in an accurate manner. The material removal rates of different points on a work piece surface vary owing to the complexity of the free-form surface, and coupled with the influence of other factors, it is difficult to establish a precise mathematical model. Meanwhile, difficulty also exists in further improving the surface detection precision of the components owing to a limitation of the current detection conditions. After generating a dwell function, a 4 - or 5 -axis numerical control system is generally applied when processing a complex surface. Therefore, <b>polishing</b> <b>technology</b> based on this principle cannot presently be applied to a commercial process [24].|$|E
