40|$|Abstract: The {{protocol}} implementation {{was tested}} as black box before. Due {{to the complexity}} of routing protocols, the black box model can not fulfil the requirements to test them. Based on the analysis and perception of routing protocols, the windowed black box model is raised. The controllability and the observability are enhanced through other modules that interact with the module under test using standard interfaces. The multiple channels test method is put forward accordingly with more channels such as configuration channel and auxiliary information channel. The coverage and the efficiency of the test are increased considerably. With techniques like packet extension, the test suite is organized and described uniformly and integrally, which guarantees the flexibility and the universality and paves the way for the transition from single centered test suite to a distributed one. This model and this test method have achieved desirable results from routing <b>protocol</b> <b>test</b> and also give valuable references for the test of other protocols...|$|E

40|$|Smartphones are {{becoming}} the dominant devices peo-ple use {{to access the}} Internet. Following this trend, a deep investigation of network protocol performance on cellular networks is becoming increasingly important. However, most of the current <b>protocol</b> <b>testing</b> on smart-phones are based on laboratory scope testbeds which require root privileges or even customized firmwares. These constraints limit such tests within a laboratory scope. Unfortunately, small scale testing cannot provide results with high confidence due to the high spatial and temporal variability of cellular networks. To address this challenge of <b>testing</b> network <b>protocols</b> at scale, we design and implement MobiBed, an open network <b>protocol</b> <b>testbed</b> for mobile phones in the wild. Each phone participating in MobiBed runs a network protocol emulator in user space that implements sand-boxed network stacks. Protocol packets are encapsulated in UDP tunnels that require no kernel changes or super-user privileges. The paper evaluates the performance of MobiBedâ€™s <b>protocol</b> <b>testing</b> environment and shows that a MobiBed TCP implementation is comparable with the kernel based equivalent up to link speeds of 10 Mbit/sec, and shows only a 3 % overhead at speeds up to 4 Mbit/s.

TUGEN {{is based on a}} formal model called EBE (External Behaviour Expression) which can be obtained from formal protocol specification in either Estelle or LOTOS. This model specifies only the external behaviour of a protocol in terms of the input/output sequences and their logical (function and predicate) relations.

Comparison of test cases generated from this tool and those in ISO/IEC DIS 8882 part 2 for X. 25 LAPB protocol shows that the resulting set of test cases of TUGEN is concise and effective.

40|$|The {{objective}} of protocol testing is {{to confirm that}} a protocol implementation under test conforms to its specification. However, in <b>protocol</b> <b>test</b> architectures that utilize multiple remote testers in a distributed environment, this objective can be {{complicated by the fact}} that testers may encounter problems relating to controllability and observability during the application of a test sequence. Solutions in literature to these problems usually involve first generating a test sequence from the specification of an implementation under test, then inserting coordination messages or appending selected test subsequences that will allow the testers to solve the controllability and observability problems. This thesis proposes a method that uses a set of transformation rules to construct a directed graph from a given specification. A transition tour of this directed graph based on a rural Chinese postman tour will result in a test sequence with no potential for controllability or observability problems, and where the use of coordination messages is either minimized or, if possible, avoided altogether...|$|E
