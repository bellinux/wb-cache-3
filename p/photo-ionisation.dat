40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} the possibility of significantly obscuring super-soft X-ray sources in relatively modest amounts of local matter lost from the binaries themselves. If correct, then this would have explained the paucity of observed super-soft X-ray sources and would have significance for the search for single-degenerate type Ia supernova progenitors. We point out that earlier studies of circumbinary obscuration ignored <b>photo-ionisations</b> of the gas by the emission from the super-soft X-ray source. We revisit the problem using a full, self-consistent calculation of the ionisation state of the circumbinary material photo-ionised by the radiation of the central source. Our {{results show that the}} circumstellar mass-loss rates required for obcuration of super-soft X-ray sources is about an order of magnitude larger than those reported in earlier studies, for comparable model parameters. While this does not entrirely rule out the possibility of circumstellar material obscuring super-soft X-ray sources, it makes it unlikely that this effect alone can account {{for the majority of the}} missing super-soft X-ray sources. We discuss the observational appearance of hypothetical obscured nuclear burning white dwarfs and show that they have signatures making them distinct from photo-ionised nebulae around super-soft X-ray sources imbedded in the low density ISM.

50|$|The sun's rays {{can be used}} {{to produce}} {{electrical}} energy. The direct user of sunlight is the solar cell or photovoltaic cell, which converts sunlight directly into electrical energy without the incorporation of a mechanical device. This technology is simpler than the fossil-fuel-driven systems of producing electrical energy. A solar cell is formed by a light-sensitive p-n junction semiconductor, which when exposed to sunlight is excited to conduction by the photons in light. When light, in the form of photons, hits the cell and strikes an atom, <b>photo-ionisation</b> creates electron-hole pairs. The electrostatic field causes separation of these pairs, establishing an electromotive force in the process. The electric field sends the electron to the p-type material, and the hole to the n-type material. If an external current path is provided, electrical energy will be available to do work. The electron flow provides the current, and the cell's electric field creates the voltage. With both current and voltage the silicon cell has power. The greater the amount of light falling on the cell's surface, the greater is the probability of photons releasing electrons, and hence more electric energy is produced.|$|E

40|$|We use a {{combination}} of analytic and numerical arguments to consider the impact of quasar photo-heating during HeII reionisation on the thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We demonstrate that rapid (Δ z 10 ^ 4 K) photo-heating is difficult to achieve across the entire IGM unless quasar spectra are significantly harder than implied by current observational constraints. Although filtering of intrinsic quasar radiation through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess energy per HeII <b>photo-ionisation,</b> it also weakens the radiation intensity and lowers the <b>photo-ionisation</b> rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals shorter than the local <b>photo-ionisation</b> timescale.

The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and model-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heating rates. Nevertheless, although some of the IGM may be exposed to a hardened and weakened ionising background for long periods, most of the IGM must instead be reionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modest heating rates (Δ T < 10 ^ 4 K). The repeated ionisation of fossil quasar HeIII regions does not increase the net heating because the recombination times in these regions typically exceed the IGM cooling times and the average time lag between successive rounds of quasar activity. Detailed line-of-sight radiative transfer simulations confirm these expectations and predict a rich thermal structure in the IGM during HeII reionisation.

40|$|Simulations of the {{formation}} of galaxies, as well as ionisation models used to interpret observations of quasar absorption lines, generally either assume ionisation equilibrium or ignore the presence of the extra-galactic background (EGB) radiation. We introduce a method to compute the non-equilibrium ionisation and cooling of diffuse gas exposed to the EGB. Our method iterates the ionisation states of the 11 elements that dominate the cooling and uses tabulated ion-by-ion cooling and photo-heating efficiencies to update the temperature of the gas. Our reaction network includes radiative and di-electric recombination, collisional ionisation, <b>photo-ionisation,</b> Auger ionisation, and charge transfer. We verify that our method reproduces published results for collisional equilibrium, collisional non-equilibrium, and photo-ionised equilibrium. Non-equilibrium effects can become very important in cooling gas, particularly below 10 ^ 6 K. <b>Photo-ionisation</b> and non-equilibrium effects both tend to boost the degree of ionisation and to reduce cooling efficiencies. The effect of the EGB is larger for lower densities. Hence, <b>photo-ionisation</b> affects cooling more under isochoric than under isobaric conditions. Non-equilibrium effects are smaller {{in the presence of the}} EGB and are thus overestimated when using collisional-only processes. The inclusion of the EGB alters the observational diagnostics of diffuse, metal-enriched gas (e. g. metal absorption lines) even more significantly than the cooling efficiencies. We argue that the cooling efficiency should be considered if ionisation models are used to infer physical conditions from observed line ratios, as the a priori probability of observing gas is lower if its cooling time is shorter. We provide on-line tables of ionisation fractions and cooling efficiencies for equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios.

40|$|Measurements of the intergalactic medium (IGM) {{temperature}} {{provide a}} potentially powerful constraint on the reionisation history {{due to the}} thermal imprint left by the <b>photo-ionisation</b> of neutral hydrogen. However, until recently IGM temperature measurements were limited to redshifts 2 6. In this work, we use recent measurements of the IGM temperature in the near-zones of seven quasars at z ~ 5. 8 - 6. 4, combined with a semi-numerical model for inhomogeneous reionisation, to establish new constraints on the redshift at which hydrogen reionisation completed. We calibrate the model to reproduce observational constraints on the electron scattering optical depth and the HI <b>photo-ionisation</b> rate, and compute the resulting spatially inhomogeneous temperature distribution at z ~ 6 {{for a variety of}} reionisation scenarios. Under standard assumptions for the ionising spectra of population-II sources, the near-zone temperature measurements constrain the redshift by which hydrogen reionisation was complete to be z > 7. 9 (6. 5) at 68 (95) per cent confidence.

40|$|We {{report on}} a survey for {{associated}} HI 21 -cm and OH 18 -cm absorption with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at redshifts z = 0. 2 - 0. 4. Although the low redshift selection ensures that our targets are below the critical ultra-violet luminosity, which is hypothesised to ionise all of the neutral gas in the host galaxy, we do not obtain any detections in the six sources searched. Analysing these in context of the previous surveys, {{in addition to the}} anti-correlation with the ultra-violet luminosity (ionising photon rate), we find a correlation between the strength of the absorption and the blue [...] near-infrared colour, as well as the radio-band turnover frequency. We believe that these are due to the <b>photo-ionisation</b> of the neutral gas, an obscured sight-line being more conducive to the presence of cold gas and the compact radio emission being better intercepted by the absorbing gas, maximising the flux coverage, respectively. Regarding the <b>photo-ionisation,</b> the compilation of the previous surveys increases the significance of the critical ionising photon rate, above which all of the gas in the host galaxy is hypothesised to be ionised, to > 5 sigma.

The colours of the PNe we are determined for H-Ks, J-H, Z-Y, and Y-J, and compared to stars and to other types of emission line objects. Cloudy <b>photo-ionisation</b> models were used to predict colours for typical PNe. We present near-infrared photometry for 353 known PNe. The best separation from other objects is obtained in the H-Ks vs. J-H diagram.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{star formation}} rate density {{required to keep}} the intergalactic hydrogen ionised depends crucially on the average rate of recombinations in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This rate {{is proportional to the}} clumping factor C = / avg(rho_b) ^ 2, where rho_b and avg(rho_b) are the local and cosmic mean baryon density, respectively, and the brackets indicate spatial averaging over the recombining gas in the IGM. We perform a suite of cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations that include radiative cooling to calculate the volume-weighted clumping factor of the IGM at redshifts z >= 6. We focus on the effect of <b>photo-ionisation</b> heating by a uniform ultra-violet background and find that photo-heating strongly reduces the clumping factor because the increased pressure support smoothes out small-scale density fluctuations. <b>Photo-ionisation</b> heating is often said to provide a negative feedback on the reionisation of the IGM because it suppresses the cosmic star formation rate by boiling the gas out of low-mass halos. However, because of the reduction of the clumping factor it also makes it easier to keep the IGM ionised. Photo-heating therefore also provides a positive feedback which, while known to exist, has received much less attention. We demonstrate that this positive feedback is in fact very strong. Using conservative assumptions, we find that if the IGM was reheated at z >~ 9, the observed population of star-forming galaxies at z = 6 may be sufficient to keep the IGM ionised, provided that the fraction of ionising photons that escape the star-forming regions to ionise the IGM is larger than 0. 2.

We estimate the total amount of diffuse ionised gas to be of the order of (5 +- 3) x 10 ^ 10 Msun and explore its physical properties to understand its origin and the source(s) of the ionisation. The MUSE data allow the identification of a dozen of group members embedded in this structure from emission and absorption lines. We extracted spectra from small apertures defined for both the diffuse ionised gas and the galaxies. We investigated the kinematics and ionisation properties of the various galaxies and extended gas regions thanks to line diagnostics (R 23, O 32 and [OIII]/Hβ) available within the MUSE wavelength range. We compared these diagnostics to <b>photo-ionisation</b> models and shock models. The structure is divided in two kinematically distinct sub-structures. The most extended sub-structure of ionised gas is likely rotating around a massive galaxy and displays filamentary patterns linking some galaxies. The second sub-structure links another massive galaxy hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus to a low mass galaxy but also extends orthogonally to the AGN host disk over 35 kpc. This extent is likely ionised by the AGN itself. The location of small diffuse regions in the R 23 vs. O 32 diagram is compatible with <b>photo-ionisation.</b> However, the location of three of these regions in this diagram (low O 32, high R 23) can also be explained by shocks, which is supported by their large velocity dispersions. One edge-on galaxy shares the same properties and may be a source of shocks. Whatever the hypothesis, the extended gas seems to be non primordial.

Although this is usually explained by assuming that the covering factor of the central engine is much smaller at luminous QSOs, the exact origin of this effect remains unknown. We perform toy simulations to test whether <b>photo-ionisation</b> of the obscuring screen {{in the presence of}} a strong radiation field can reproduce this effect. In particular, we create X-ray spectral simulations using a warm absorber model assuming a range of input column densities and ionization parameters. We fit instead the simulated spectra with a simple cold absorption power-law model that is the standard practice in X-ray surveys. We find that the fraction of absorbed AGN should fall with luminosity as L^- 0. 16 ± 0. 03 in rough agreement with the observations. Furthermore, this apparent decrease in the obscuring material is consistent with the dependence of the FeKα narrow-line equivalent width on luminosity, ie. the X-ray Baldwin effect.

40|$|Summary. Radio {{continuum}} emission has been detected from a planetary nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud: {{this is the}} first radio continuum detection for any planetary nebula outside our galaxy. The radio flux density is a factor of two lower than predicted from the Hβ flux. This could be due either to a two-component morphology or to a stellar contribution to the Hβ emission. We have modeled the optical and infrared spectrum using the <b>photo-ionisation</b> code Cloudy: a very good fit is obtained if we assume the nebula is carbon rich. The derived diameter implies an evolutionary age of the nebula of < 1000 yr, similar to what is derived from the IRAS colours alone. The central star, which is of [WC] type, has a much higher stellar temperature than Galactic [WC] stars showing similar circumstellar IRAS colours. An explanation could be that the expansion velocity of the nebula is lower than those of its galactic counterparts. This radio detection indicates that accurate nebular luminosities could be determined from their radio emission for many LMC planetary nebulae...|$|E
40|$|We present {{simulations}} of initially stable isothermal clouds exposed to ionising radiation from a discrete external source, {{and identify the}} conditions that lead to radiatively driven implosion and star formation. We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN and an HEALPix-based <b>photo-ionisation</b> algorithm to simulate the propagation of the ionising radiation and the resulting dynamical evolution of the cloud. We find that the incident ionising flux, Φ__ LyC, is the critical parameter determining the cloud evolution. At moderate fluxes, a large fraction of the cloud mass is converted into stars. As the flux is increased, the fraction of the cloud mass that is converted into stars and the mean masses of the individual stars both decrease. Very high fluxes simply disperse the cloud. Newly-formed stars tend to be concentrated along the central axis of the cloud (i. e. the axis pointing {{in the direction of}} the incident flux). For given cloud parameters, the time, t__, at which star formation starts is proportional to Φ__ LyC^- 1 / 3. The pattern of star formation found in the simulations is similar to that observed in bright-rimmed clouds. Comment: 36 pages, 13 figures, accepted in Ap...|$|E
40|$|NGC 7009 is a {{fascinating}} example of a high excitation, elliptical planetary nebula (PN) containing circum-nebular rings, and FLIERs and jets along the major axis. We present visual spectroscopy along multiple position angles through the nucleus, taken with the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional (Mexico); mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy and imaging acquired using the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), and narrow band imaging obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The data show that the mid-infrared (MIR) continuum is dominated by a broad ~ 100 K continuum, and a strong excess attributable to crystalline silicate emission. The primary peaks in this excess {{are similar to those}} observed in Forsterite and clino- and ortho-enstatite. We use the ground-based spectroscopy, and ratioing of HST images to investigate the presence of shocks in the ansae and interior envelope. It is concluded that line ratios in the ansae may be partially consistent with shock excitation, although these features are primarily dominated by <b>photo-ionisation.</b> We also note evidence for shock excitation at the limits of the interior elliptical shell, and for multiple bow-shock structures centered upon the ansae.

40|$|Abstract. The {{discovery}} is reported {{of the second}} strongest source of mm and submm wavelength CO line emission, towards M 8, the Lagoon Nebula in Sagittarius. The ∼ 31 M ⊙ molecular core has dimensions ∼ 0. 2 × 0. 3 pc and is centred on the O 7 V star Herschel 36 (H 36), near the Hourglass Nebula {{in the core of}} M 8. Emission from the CO line wings extends to the north and south of the Hourglass, although a lack of near-IR H 2 emission indicates that outflow activity is much less prominent than in many active star-formation regions, and suggests that the CO line wings may trace the expanding edge of a cavity around H 36. The molecular line data are compared with new near-IR narrow-band, continuum-subtracted images in He I,H 2, and H + (Brγ) lines and archival HST emission-line images in Hα, [O III], and [S II]. The optical and near-IR data are found to be broadly consistent with previous <b>photo-ionisation</b> models of the Hourglass, which is excited by H 36. However, there are variations in the He I/Brγ line ratio which are difficult to explain...|$|E
