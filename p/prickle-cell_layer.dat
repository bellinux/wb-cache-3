40|$|THE {{case to be}} {{presented}} possesses several unusual features and even tends to discount the idea, still held by many, that mycosis fungoides is a disease that, with little reservation, is largely confined to the skin throughout its course. As is well known and taught, mycosis fungoides is a relatively rare but chronic and usually fatal disease of the skin, running a rather progressive course with in-frequent remissions, and characterized by four well known stages, {{any or all of}} which the patient may pass through. The first stage is characterized by generalized pruritus which may persist in-definitely and which may defy diagnosis until the better known and recognized lesions of the skin become manifest. The second stage manifests itself by varied forms of dermatitides such as eczema, psoriasis, erythema multiforme, etc., expressed as macular, papular, urticarial, and bullous lesions. These varied forms may persist without dis-tinctive clinical features or later assume suggestively diagnostic configuration, such as polymorphism and striking coloration. These eruptions may even be com-posed of a multiformity of lesions and may pass quickly into the third or in-filtrative stage, which has as its striking and diagnostic feature progressive in-filtration of the skin. As this stage progresses, extensive patches with varied configuration associated with superficial ulceration become apparent. The fourth, or last, stage is represented by large tumor-like formations that arise from the areas of infiltration. This stage may lead to chronic inanition, exhaustion, intercurrent infection and, finally, death. The histopathologic changes described in mycosis fungoides include, briefly, thickening of the <b>prickle-cell</b> <b>layer</b> and micro-abscesses filled with lymphocytes. * Received for publication April 20, 1948...|$|E
