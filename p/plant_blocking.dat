Examination of telemetry also showed that the Titan had actually began experiencing thrust decay before the plug dropped out. Engine No. 1 was unaffected and nearly reached 100% thrust at shutdown, while Engine No. 2 never transitioned to in-flight performance levels. Engineers spent all night combing through the first stage, but failed to find any cause for the thrust decay. Eventually however, one technician identified the problem, which was a plastic dust cover inside the gas generator that had been carelessly left inside when the booster was assembled months earlier at the Martin-Marietta <b>plant,</b> <b>blocking</b> the flow of oxidizer. The cover was removed and the Titan II cleared for another launch attempt.|$|E

The features of reliability evaluation of electric power <b>plants</b> <b>block</b> schemes were considered in terms of functioning of the electricity market. Objective: to increase the operational reliability of electric power <b>plants</b> <b>block</b> schemes and to reduce the probability of electricity undersupply. Technique of realization: the implementation of modern algorithms and programs for evaluation of the reliability of block schemes. Results: The main methods of analysis of the reliability of electric power <b>plants</b> <b>block</b> schemes were analyzed, numerical values of integral reliability index were obtained according to the number of failures in the circuit. Conclusions: It was shown that the Markov processes method applied for the analysis of reliability of the block schemes of electric power plants is advantageous both at the design stage and in operation or reconstruction. ???????? ????????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ??????????????. ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ?????????????? ? ?????? ???????????????? ????? ????????????? ???????. ???? ????????????: ????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ?????????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ???????. ???????? ??????????: ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ??????????? ????. ?????????? ????????????: ???????????????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ??????????????, ???????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????. ??????: ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ??????????????, ??? ?? ????? ??????????????, ??? ? ? ???????? ???????????? ??? ?????????????...|$|R

[...] "But the trouble is they tend to be monoculture plantations. They are not places where birds want to live."

30|$|Meanwhile, {{interest}} in environment <b>blocks</b> and <b>planting</b> <b>blocks</b> that use porous concrete with environment-friendly functions including permeation, ventilation, vegetation, water quality improvement, and sound absorption, which reduce the {{load on the}} surrounding natural environment, has increased in recent years such that these blocks have been used considerably {{in the construction of}} river revetments and levees (Lee et al. 2012). However, existing concrete is strongly alkaline due to hydrates generated by the hydration reaction of cement and water; this alkalinity has adverse effects on the environment. In particular, secondary damage has continued to emerge due to the environmental destruction of waterfront environments along rivers and the continuous elution caused by strong alkalinity.|$|R
