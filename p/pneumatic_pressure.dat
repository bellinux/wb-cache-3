2500|$|The {{tailhook}} is {{a strong}} metal bar, with its free end flattened out, thickened somewhat, and fashioned into a claw-like hook. [...] The hook is mounted on a swivel on the keel of the aircraft, and is normally mechanically and hydraulically held in the stowed/up position. [...] Upon actuation by the pilot, hydraulic or <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pressure</b> lowers the hook to the down position. [...] The presence of a tailhook is not evidence of an aircraft's aircraft carrier suitability. [...] Carrier aircraft hooks {{are designed to be}} quickly raised by the pilot after use. [...] Many land-based fighters also have tailhooks for use in case of a brake/tire malfunctions, aborted takeoffs, or other emergencies. [...] Land-based aircraft landing gear and tailhooks are typically not strong enough to absorb the impact of a carrier landing, and some land-based tailhooks are held down with nitrogen pressure systems that must be recharged by ground personnel after actuation.|$|E

The micropumps consist of three pneumatic PDMS membranes, one pump chamber, and two check valves.

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a new method for synthesizing kinematic relationships for a general class of continuous backbone, or continuum, robots. The resulting kinematics enable real-time task and shape control by relating workspace (Cartesian) coordinates to actuator inputs, such as tendon lengths or <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pressures,</b> via robot shape coordinates. This novel approach, which carefully considers physical manipulator constraints, avoids artifacts of simplifying assumptions associated with previous approaches, such as the need to fit the resulting solutions to the physical robot. It is applicable to a wide class of existing continuum robots and models extension, as well as bending, of individual sections. In addition, this approach produces correct results for orientation, in contrast to some previously published approaches. Results of real-time implementations on two types of spatial multi-section continuum manipulators are reported.

40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure {{has been applied}} for investigating the temperature distribution in a smooth tread bias tire of a light truck, operated under different speeds, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pressures,</b> and loading conditions. Prior to simulation by the finite element analysis, two separate sets of testing, namely dynamic mechanical testing and material testing, have been conducted {{in relation to the}} evaluation of hysteresis (H) and total strain energy (Used), respectively. Hysteresis loss energy is given as (H × Used) and considered to relate directly to heat generation rate. Temperature rise is assumed to be due to the energy dissipation from periodic deformation. This dissipation of energy may be equated to be the primary heat generation source. Hysteresis energy loss is used as a bridge to link the strain energy density to the heat source in rolling tires; temperature distribution of rolling tires may be obtained by the steady-state thermal analysis. The above procedure has been shown to facilitate the simulation of the temperature distribution in the rolling tire. An efficient computational process is being introduced to decrease the time for coupled 3 D dynamic rolling simulation of tire. Temperature rise under different conditions is discussed with reference to the results of other published studies. © 2004 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
