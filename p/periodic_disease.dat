An isolated habitat patch shows <b>periodic</b> <b>disease</b> outbreaks in the host population, arising from cyclic consumer-pathogen dynamics. On the other hand, consumer dispersal between the patches generate asymmetric disease prevalence, such that the host population in one patch stays disease-free, while disease outbreaks occur in the other patch. Such asymmetry can also arise with host dispersal, where infected hosts carry pathogens to the other patch. This indirect movement of pathogens causes also a counter-intuitive effect: decreasing morbidity in a focal patch under increasing pathogen immigration. Our results underline that community-level interactions influence disease dynamics and consistent spatial asymmetry can arise also in spatially homogeneous systems...|$|E

Methods: This multicentric study was conducted between 2009 and 2014 in 14 hospitals in which patients with Schnitzler syndrome or controls with related disorders were followed up. We compared the sensitivities and specificities and calculated the positive and negative predictive values of the Lipsker and of the Strasbourg criteria for the patients with Schnitzler syndrome and for the controls. We included 42 patients with Schnitzler syndrome, 12 with adult-onset Still's disease, 7 with cryopyrin-associated <b>periodic</b> <b>disease,</b> 9 with Waldenström disease, and 10 with chronic spontaneous urticaria. Results: All patients with Schnitzler syndrome met the Lipsker criteria.

One control met the Lipsker criteria and had probable Schnitzler syndrome according to the Strasbourg criteria. Sensitivity and specificity of the Lipsker criteria were 100 % and 97 %, respectively.

Its genetic defect – pirin mutation – gives rise to an alternative innate immune response (phagocytic cell activation) to secrete IL- 1 by macrophages and to activate T-helper cells. This causes imbalance in the synthesis of proinflammatory (IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-α)  and anti-inflammatory (IL- 4, IL- 10, and IL- 1 receptor antagonist) cytokines. Moreover, the uncontrolled macrophage (monocyte) secretion of {{a great deal of}} IL- 6 that together with IL- 1 is a mediator of the synthesis of the serum amyloid fibril protein precursor SAA by hepatocytes, neutrophils, and fibroblasts plays one of the key roles in the pathogenesis of PD through amyloidosis. With this, IL- 6 stimulates the inflammatory process, by enhancing the release of lysosomal enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxane) from the polymorphic nuclear leukocytes, macrophages, endotheliocytes, and fibroblasts and by augmenting the chemotaxis of macrophages and neutrophils, and the degranulation of the latter, i. e. through its action on the effector cells of inflammation, and prepares the tissue basis for amyloid deposits in this fashion. Thus, the analysis of literary and own materials gives grounds to suggest that pirin mutation is a trigger of the synthesis of IL- 1 and IL- 6 in PD and their hypersecretion is an initial link of the synthesis of SAA. </p...|$|E

Biol. Chem. 259 : 10539 - 10544, 1984; Payne et al., J. Gen. Virol. 65 : 1395 - 1399, 1984). The present study was undertaken to obtain an antigenic and biochemical characterization of equine infectious anemia virus isolates recovered from an experimentally infected pony during sequential disease episodes, each separated by intervals of only 4 to 8 weeks. The virus isolates could be distinguished antigenically by neutralization assays with serum from the infected pony and by Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against the major surface glycoprotein gp 90, thus demonstrating that novel antigenic variants of equine infectious anemia virus predominate during each clinical episode. The respective virion glycoproteins displayed different electrophoretic mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, indicating structural variation. Tryptic peptide and glycopeptide maps of the viral proteins of each virus isolate revealed biochemical alterations involving amino acid sequence and glycosylation patterns in the virion surface glycoproteins gp 90 and gp 45. In contrast, no structural variation was observed in the internal viral proteins pp 15, p 26, and p 9 {{from any of the}} four virus isolates. Oligonucleotide mapping experiments revealed similar but unique RNase T 1 -resistant oligonucleotide fingerprints of the RNA genomes of each of the virus isolates. Localization of altered oligonucleotides for one virus isolate placed two of three unique oligonucleotides within the predicted env gene region of the genome, perhaps correlating with the structural variation observed in the envelope glycoproteins. Thus these results support the concept that equine infectious anemia virus is indeed capable of relatively rapid genomic variations during replication, some of which result in altered glycoprotein structures and antigenic variants which are responsible for the unique <b>periodic</b> <b>disease</b> nature observed in persistently infected animals. The findings of envelope specific differences in isolates of visna virus and of human T-cell lymphotropic virus III (acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related virus) suggest that this variation may be a common characteristic of the subfamily Lentivirinae...|$|E
