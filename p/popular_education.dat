5|$|In the Scottish Highlands, <b>popular</b> <b>education</b> was {{challenged}} by problems of distance and physical isolation, {{as well as}} teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim in the Highlands was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture. Literacy rates were lower in the Highlands than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{nationalism}} gradually {{emerged during}} the mid-19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen, the development of Bulgarian-funded <b>popular</b> <b>education,</b> the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards {{the formation of a}} separate Bulgarian state. The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s, and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832, {{in the wake of the}} Greek War of Independence. However, support for gaining independence through an armed struggle against the Ottomans was not universal. Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace. There was less support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and the wealthier merchants and traders, who feared that Ottoman reprisals would jeopardize economic stability and widespread rural land ownership.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam {{gathered}} {{delegates from}} 14 different countries, among which important {{figures of the}} anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, <b>popular</b> <b>education</b> issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.|$|E
40|$|<b>Popular</b> adult <b>education</b> is {{an action}} of various {{meanings}} and activities. As a pedagogical and didactical practice, questions regarding ‘‘the unique study methods” are dealt with. Further, one touches on study content {{as well as}} educational ideals and philosophies. The ambiguity of <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> is illustrated by emphasising four educational philosophies. In a perennialistic philosophy, <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> is about communicating a cultural heritage {{from one generation to}} another, which unites to a neo-humanistic <b>education.</b> If <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> emanates from scientific knowledge, which is communicated by ‘‘experts”, essentialistic philosophy and civic education are touched upon. A representative democracy is given the force of an ideal. A progressivistic philosophy puts the participant and its experiences in focus. This touches on self-education, which often is stressed in the rhetoric. Reconstructivity is made up of an education-philosophical perspective, which has deliberative discourses as a basis for a critical education and radical democracy. In the every day life of <b>popular</b> adult <b>education,</b> all of these perspectives are manifested...|$|R
40|$|Abstract - Conceptions of <b>popular</b> adult <b>education.</b> Educational ideals from an {{organizational}} and philosophical point of view. <b>Popular</b> adult <b>education</b> {{is in this}} study seen as an institution for adult learning. In particular, light is shed on organizations such as folk high schools and study associations, which in a legal sense are independent of the state. By examining the organizational and educational aspects of <b>popular</b> adult <b>education,</b> the study creates an area of knowledge relating to how education is organized. This perspective sheds light on how <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> is talked about in everyday settings and how the study process can be problematized. In addition, <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> is explored by making a number of educational philosophies {{the basis for a}} discourse analysis. These philosophies of education thus become discourses and tools for interpretation. On the basis of an interpretation of <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> texts, the study seeks to identify different ideals of education (Bildung) and how these relate to the educational philosophies of perennialism, essentialism, progressivism and reconstructivism. Attention is thus drawn to different views of knowledge, organizations, leadership, creation of meaning and so on. The study constitutes a search for ideal-typical differences. By relating the ideal types to one another, it creates a kind of screen – a typology in terms of the organization of education. This typology is based on educational philosophies, ideals of education, key symbolic concepts, organizational aspects and educational consequences. How <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> is transformed into a language depends on which discourse or discourses is or are dominant. Applying a sociology of knowledge perspective, the study also searches for a collective understanding. The various discourses shaped by different approaches to the organization of education result in different forms of meaning creation. As a consequence, the discussion about <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> varies between different folk high schools and study associations...|$|R

5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on <b>Popular</b> <b>Education</b> that stipulated {{that the government would}} guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed {{the separation of church and}} state and prohibited religious instruction in schools.|$|E

25|$|The need {{to create}} a working-class culture and a counter-hegemony relates to Gramsci's call for a kind of {{education}} that could develop working-class intellectuals, whose task was not to introduce Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat as a set of foreign notions, but to renovate the existing intellectual activity of the masses and make it natively critical of the status quo. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of critical pedagogy and <b>popular</b> <b>education</b> as theorized and practised in later decades by Paulo Freire in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of Frantz Fanon. For this reason, partisans of adult and <b>popular</b> <b>education</b> consider Gramsci an important voice to this day.|$|E

40|$|The Swedish {{concept of}} folkbildning (the ‘bildung’ of the people) and its {{introduction}} in the mid- 1900 th century {{was connected to}} the advent of Folkhögskolan (the <b>popular</b> adult <b>education)</b> with explicit as well as implicit references to the Danish philosopher Gruntvig’s ideals of <b>education.</b> The broad <b>popular</b> movement which the adult education ideals was incorporated into during the beginning of the 20 th century, was setting values on the political agenda independent of the prevailing national state church. Within these movements, which were formed through and sustained by their resistance towards the state, democracy became a key concept. This paper studies the ideals of the <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> and the state through their relation to democracy inside and outside the established school system, based on political steering documents and curriculums from the elementary school as well as policy documents of the <b>popular</b> adult <b>education.</b> In accordance with Koselleck’s theory of conceptual history, a concept is, compared to an ordinary word, ambiguous in its essence. It is impossible to differentiate the social and political world from its linguistics; concepts could therefore be regarded as keys to historical insights. On the basis of Koselleck’s theory and the key concepts experience and expectation the use of the concept democracy in the above mentioned documents is discussed and analyzed. The study shows that the <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> and the established educational system in the beginning had different spaces of experience, with references to separate traditions, but they gradually converged into what could be seen as a common horizon of expectation about the meaning of democracy. At the same time, when this convergence appeared, an administrative shift could be identified where the <b>popular</b> adult <b>education</b> was incorporated into the established school system...|$|R
