WEAK SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS: A <b>PRODUCT</b> MARKET <b>RATIONALE</b> In <b>product</b> markets where customers care about firm survival, strong shareholder power can have detrimental implications on firm performance by affecting {{the likelihood that}} the firm is acquired. We use a framework where firms choose their level of shareholder rights after comparing the costs of takeover vulnerability, i. e., the loss of customers, with the synergistic benefits of an acquisition. This generates two testable implications. First, it is optimal to have weaker shareholder rights in competitive markets. Second, this link between competition and shareholder rights is stronger in industries characterized by long-term customer relationships. Using data on shareholder rights in the corporate charter, we empirically find that indeed firms have stronger shareholder rights in concentrated industries and especially relationship based industries where customers tend to have a long-term relationship with the firm. We also document that weak shareholder rights are associated with worse performance only in non-competitive industries. Finally, we discuss the implications of this framework for the design of various governance mechanisms. In conclusion, the paper provides a rationale for why shareholders themselves might not want strong shareholder rights. 1 I...|$|R
40|$|Lymphomas are {{aggressive}} hematologi-cal malignancies and a {{high number}} of patients relapse and die following treat-ment.

The processes involved in production and point of care thawing are sufficiently well developed and achievable to make this technology a viable option. The potential limitations of cryopreservation and subsequent product thawing need to be considered if such a strategy is to be developed. A substantial body of international experience using cryopreserved products in remote settings has already been accrued. This experience provides a template for the possible creation of an Australian integrated fresh–frozen blood bank inventory that could conceivably enhance the care of patients in both regional Australia and in the military setting...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: According to the CDC (2008), tobacco-related deaths out number {{deaths from}} alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries, suicides, murders, human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV), and illegal drug use. One {{out of every five}} deaths in the United States can be attributed to tobacco, culminating in a staggering 443, 000 deaths in the US every year. Smoking is also the leading preventable cause of death in America (CDC, 2008). In 2006, the Surgeon General’s Report speaks to not only the detrimental effects of smoking, but also the harmful effects second hand smoke can have on an individual’s health. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control’s Office of Smoking and Health reported that 49, 400 deaths every year in the US are the result of second hand smoke exposure, of which 46, 000 will have died from heart disease attributable to second hand smoke in the environment in which they live, work, play, and learn (CDC, 2008). While the negative health outcomes with tobacco use have inundated mainstream media and literature, tobacco use has another large and devastating effect on communities around the world. That effect is the result of Tobacco Product Litter (TPL). Beyond the unsightliness of TPL, several other unwanted complications to society result from the disregarded refuse, such as harm to the environment and damages incurred by other businesses not associated at all with tobacco <b>products.</b> <b>Rationale</b> for Intervention: First and foremost the Tobacco-Free GSU Initiative was intended to promote the health of the Georgia State University community consisting of students, faculty, and staff. The American College Health Association (2009) recommends 100 % tobacco-free campuses, indoors and outdoors. Studies have shown that non-smokers and smokers attending college are in favor of campus policies that control the use of tobacco on campus (Rigotti, Regan, Moran, et al., 2003; Thompson B, Coronado GD, Chen L, et al., 2006). Sawdey et al. (2011) cites the need for the implementation of smoke-free policies by campuses in order to utilize the opportunity to create an atmosphere conducive to tobacco cessation. Considering that one third of young Americans attend a college or university (Rigotti et al., 2003), exposing one third of the youth population of the United States to a tobacco-free environment could potentially change the socially acceptable norms of using tobacco, whist simultaneously creating an environment free of TPL. Intervention Strategy Analysis: Tobacco-Free GSU utilized a methodology similar to the strategies Glassman, Reindel and Whewell outlined in their 2011 study Strategies for Implementing a Tobacco-Free Campus. The Glassman et al. (2011) strategy included: Creating a Committee, Utilizing a Student Debate, Publicity, Drafting of a Potential Policy, Targeting the College or University Board of Trustees, Addressing Barriers to Becoming Tobacco-Free, Student Involvement, Administrative and Staff Support, Resources, and Enforcement Conclusion: In order to facilitate the best possible outcome, this author recommends those seeking to create a tobacco-free campus utilize the strategies outlined throughout this document, whilst creating strategies specific to their location, population, and situation...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a framework for}} representing products based on the NIST Core Product Model (CPM) and its extensions, the Open Assembly Model (OAM), the Design-Analysis Integration model (DAIM), and the Product Family Evolution Model (PFEM). These are abstract models with general semantics, with the specific semantics about a particular domain to be embedded within the usage of the models for that domain. CPM represents the product’s function, form and behavior, its physical and functional decompositions, and the relationships among these concepts. An extension of CPM provides a way to associate design <b>rationale</b> with the <b>product.</b> OAM defines a system level conceptual model and the associated hierarchical assembly relationships. DAIM defines a Master Model of the product {{and a series of}} abstractions called Functional Models- one for each domain-specific aspect of the product – and two transformations, called idealization and mapping, between the master model and each functional model. PFEM extends the representation to families of products and their components; it also extends design rationale to the capture of the rationale for the evolution of the families. The framework is intended to: (1) capture <b>product,</b> design <b>rationale,</b> assembly, and tolerance information from the earliest conceptual design stage- where designers deal with the function and performance of products – to the full lifecycle; (2) facilitate the semantic interoperability of next-generation CAD/CAE/CAM systems; and (3) capture the evolution of product families. The relevance of our framework to Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is that any data component in the framework can be accessed directly by a PLM system, providing fine-grained access to the product’s description and design rationale. ...|$|R

The lack of a rapid and accurate detection method, suitable for a simple routine analysis, is currently the main hurdle for the control of these populations in the sector of egg <b>product</b> manufacturing. <b>Rationale</b> : The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the performances of two PCR methods for the detection of B. cereus group bacteria. Whole liquid egg products (174 samples) provided by different companies were enriched in 5 g/L lithium chloride in peptone water. After DNA extraction, the detection of B. cereus group bacteria was assayed by a classical PCR method targeting a cspF gene sequence, as described by Francis et al. (1998) and by a real-time PCR method targeting a sspE gene sequence, as described by Kim et al. (2005). Results : Our results show good correlation between both methods for 86 % of the analyzed samples. Ten percent of positive samples assayed by real-time PCR, targeting the sspE gene sequence, were found negative under classical PCR detection, targeting the cspF gene sequence. Only 4 % of the analyzed samples were negative under real-time PCR detection and positive under classical PCR. Conclusion : Our results show good correlation between both the PCR methods described in the literature for the detection of B. cereus group bacteria in liquid whole egg and probably in other food, by targeting two different specific gene sequences. The method using real-time PCR seems to be more sensible and presents the advantage to be faster than the classical PCR method.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{structure of the}} ATP phosphoribosyl transferase from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima is composed of a 220 kDa hetero-octameric complex comprising four catalytic subunits (HisGS) and four regulatory subunits (HisZ). Steady-state kinetics indicate that only the complete octameric complex is active and non-competitively inhibited by the pathway <b>product</b> histidine. The <b>rationale</b> for these findings {{is provided by the}} crystal structure revealing a total of eight histidine binding sites that are located within each of the four HisGS-HisZ subunit interfaces formed by the ATP phosphoribosyl transferase complex. While the structure of the catalytic HisGS subunit is related to the catalytic domain of another family of (HisGL) 2 ATP phosphoribosyl transferases that is functional in the absence of additional regulatory subunits, the structure of the regulatory HisZ subunit is distantly related to class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. However, neither the mode of the oligomeric subunit arrangement nor the type of histidine binding pockets is found in these structural relatives.

Are Slotting Allowances Efficiency-Enhancing or Anti-Competitive? Slotting allowances are lump-sum payments by manufacturers to retailers for stocking new <b>products.</b> The economic <b>rationale</b> for slotting allowances is controversial. Some argue that slotting allowances are efficiency-enhancing; others argue that they are anti-competitive. However, there is no empirical research on this issue due to the difficulty in obtaining data about these transactions. Using data on all new products that were offered to one retailer {{for a period of}} six months, we empirically investigate support for the alternative rationales for slotting allowances. Our analysis indicates that broadly there is more support for the efficiency theories than for the anti-competitive theories. We find that slotting allowances (1) serve to efficiently allocate scarce retail shelf space; (2) help balance the risk of new product failure between manufacturers and retailers; (3) help manufacturers signal private information about potential success of new products; and (4) serve to widen retail distribution for manufacturers by mitigating retail competition.

But is Australia seen as clean and green? Is it really why people buy Australian products? And how effective is it as a marketing tool? This paper attempts to answer some of these questions. The study found that Australia may have a clean green image at present in some of her overseas markets, but to maintain such an image over time, concrete proof of environmental and quality credentials need to be provided to satisfy increasingly more educated and better-informed consumers. Wide adoption of integrated EMS and QA systems by Australian producers and food companies appears to be a means to establish such credentials and substantiate any 'clean and green' claim. Therefore, government policies should focus more on developing a range of tools to encourage good environmental and quality management practices, rather than on promoting the 'clean and green' image. Such campaigns may be counter-productive in the long run as it leads to complacency, rather than raising environmental and quality awareness. export marketing, clean and green, EMS, QA, Environmental Economics and Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|The collaborators, a {{trout farming}} and {{processing}} company, experienced poor utilisation of non-retail grades of rainbow trout. New products {{were required to}} utilise this resource and realise the growth opportunities in the multiple retail market. Factors influencing the subsequent developments were: 1 {{the needs of a}} major customer in the retail sector, and 2 the availability of new processing and packaging technology. In response to retailer demand the modified atmosphere packaging technique was applied to chilled fresh trout and smoked trout products. These products utilise weight grades of fish which were previously sold unprofitably to the catering and wholesale markets. A third product was developed to utilise trout which were physically damaged during processing. A boneless skin­ less mince was mechanically reclaimed from this material. New product concepts were generated and tested, and smoked trout pate subsequently developed. This product can utilise trout of any weight or quality, and may therefore act as a buffer against the fluctuating grade denands of other portion-concept trout products. Other benefits to the company are the introduction of new processing methods, applicable to an extended range of fish products, and the provision of a new <b>product</b> development <b>rationale.</b> The importance of new retail products for the UK trout industry is shown. However, only operators with diversified processing and marketing functions can respond effectively to the present opportunities, and this influence is stratifying the structure of the industry. General implications for the food industry are considered. Increasing retailer power, the trend to fresh foods and the attention paid to quality can result in strict specifications for agricultural produce, which may exclude a proportion of the crop from premium markets. New products can be developed to utilise this material, so improving profitability. The action research approach is used to elicit precepts relating to the management of new product development; the formulation of clear objectives, accounting for the company's needs and capabilities, helps focus creative marketing and financial resources on central issues.

These enzymes, NaMN adenylyltransferase (gene nadD) and NAD synthetase (gene nadE), respectively, are indispensable and conserved in nearly all bacterial pathogens. However, a comparative genome analysis of Francisella tularensis allowed us to predict the existence of an alternative route of NAD synthesis in this category A priority pathogen, the causative agent of tularaemia. In this route, the amidation of NaMN to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) occurs before the adenylylation reaction, which converts this alternative intermediate to the NAD cofactor.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{multimodal}} ethnosemiotic {{conceptual framework for}} culturally themed selective Web archiving, taking as a practical example the curation of the London French Special Collection (LFSC) in the UK Web Archive. Its focus on a particular ‘community’ is presented as advantageous in overcoming the sheer scale of data available on the Web; yet, {{it is argued that}} these ethnographic boundaries may be flawed if they do not map onto the collective self-perception of the London French. The approach establishes several theoretical meeting points between Pierre Bourdieu’s ethnography and Gunther Kress’s multimodal social semiotics, notably, the foregrounding of practice and the meaning-making potentialities of the everyday; the implications of language and categorisation; the interplay between (curating/researcher) subject and (curated/research) object; evolving notions of agency, authorship and audience; together with social engagement, and the archive as dynamic process and <b>product.</b> The curation <b>rationale</b> proposed stems from Bourdieu’s three-stage field analysis model, which places a strong emphasis on habitus, considered to be most accurately (re) presented through blogs, yet necessitates its contextualisation within the broader (diasporic) field(s), through institutional websites, for example, whilst advocating a reflexive awareness of the researcher/curator’s (subjective) role. This, alongside the Kressian acknowledgement of the inherent multimodality of on-line resources, lends itself convincingly to selection and valuation strategies, whilst the discussion of language, genre, authorship and audience is relevant to the potential cataloguing of Web objects. By conceptualising the culturally themed selective Web-archiving process within the ethnosemiotic framework constructed, concrete recommendations emerge regarding curation, classification and crowd-sourcing...|$|R

Practitioners, not surprisingly, have a different perspective and view returns as a cost of doing business. In this paper, we study the strategic effect of returns policies on retail competition and highlight its profitability implications for a manufacturer. The setting for our research is the distribution of products with uncertain demand, limited shelf lives, and retail competition. Our objective is to provide a better understanding of when manufacturers should adopt returns policies. The insights are obtained with a model based on the economics of strategy and decision making under uncertainty. We show that when retailing is competitive and there is no uncertainty in demand, a returns policy subtly induces retailers to compete more intensely. The provision of a returns policy reduces retail prices without affecting wholesale prices, thereby reducing retailer margins and improving manufacturer profitability. The intuition is that with a returns policy, Cournot-like levels of retail stocks cannot be sustained. Each retailer will order stocks so that it will not be constrained by stocks, and so, intensifying retail competition. When, however, demand is uncertain and there is a single retailer, a returns policy encourages the retailer to over-stock, and so decreases (upstream) manufacturer profits. While the provision of a returns policy leads to lower retail margins, the optimality of returns policy depends on the overall uncertainty and marginal cost. A returns policy reduces the dispersion in retail prices between the high and low states of demand and the range of retail prices in the returns case is contained within the range of retail prices for the no-returns case. In the general setting, when there are competing retailers and demand is uncertain, there is a trade-off for the manufacturer between the benefits (more intense retail competition) and the costs (excessive stocking) of a returns policy. We find that a manufacturer should accept returns when the marginal production cost is sufficiently low and demand uncertainty is not too great. To validate the results of our theory, we conduct an empirical test with data from a major U. S. retailer. The tests confirm our prediction that a returns policy intensifies retail competition and reduces retailer margins. Our theory and empirical test should interest practitioners and researchers in distribution, especially those concerned with managing retail competition. returns policies, retail competition, pricing, perishables, demand uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{our studies}} towards the first total {{synthesis of the}} novel anti- HIV agent lancifodilactone G, which has a highly unusual aliphatic enol. The first chapter provides a survey of architecturally diverse nortriterpenoids that were isolated from the Schisandraceae family. A proposed biosynthetic pathway for lancifodilactone G and closely related natural <b>products</b> provides a <b>rationale</b> {{for the formation of}} the consecutive 7 / 8 / 5 fused carbo cycles that are unique to Schisandra nortriterpenoids. Chapter 1 goes on to outline the reported strategies to access the core of lancifodilactone G and concludes with a retrosynthetic analysis proposed by the Evans group, which includes a biosynthetically inspired single-pot polycyclisation reaction. Chapter 2 describes the highly stereocontrolled synthesis of the eastern fragment (F-G rings) using transition metal-mediated Pauson-Khand reaction. This chapter also reviews the metal-mediated diastereoselective Pauson-Khand reaction directed by the stereogenic centre at C 2, with the ample illustration to total synthesis. Attempted strategies for the assembly of the bicyclic cyclopentanone motif via a dienyl Pauson-Khand reaction of silicon- and oxygen- tethered diene-enes are presented. The failure of these strategies at different stages of the synthesis resulted in the exploration of a classical Pauson-Khand approach, which successfully furnished the eastern fragment. Finally, a second-generation synthesis is described which provided the fully functionalised eastern fragment with improved efficiency and overall yield. Chapter 3 discusses the successful synthesis of the western fragment (B-C rings) using a diastereoselective [4 + 3] cycloaddition strategy. Attempted strategies for the synthesis of the key 2, 3 -disubstituted furan derivative are presented, which was achieved via a hetero Pauson- Khand reaction. This chapter includes a brief account of the classical [4 + 3] cycloaddition reactions of furans using an in situ generated oxyallyl cation and also employing vinyl carbenoids in the metal-catalysed version. The review also highlights the application of the [4 + 3] cycloaddition reaction in the expeditious assembly of functionalised 7 -membered rings that occur in a number of important biologically active natural products. The third chapter goes on to describe the application of these cycloaddition reactions in the synthesis of the fully functionalised western fragment of Lancifodilactone G. Chapter 4 describes a model study aimed at expediting the synthesis of the western fragment using a rhodium-catalysed allylic substitution reaction. A brief mechanistic discussion on unique aspects of the allylic alkylation reaction is illustrated. Chapter 4 concludes by outlining the coupling strategy for eastern and western fragments and the end game studies for the completion of the synthesis of lancifodilactone G.

Because of high monitoring costs and comparatively low technical potential for emission reductions in the agricultural sector, output taxes on emission-intensive agricultural goods may be an efficient policy instrument to deal with agricultural GHG emissions. In this study we assess the emission mitigation potential of GHG weighted consumption taxes on animal food products in the EU. We also estimate the decrease in agricultural land area through the related changes in food production and the additional mitigation potential in devoting this land to bioenergy production. Estimates {{are based on a}} model of food consumption and the related land use and GHG emissions in the EU. Results indicate that agricultural emissions in the EU 27 can be reduced by approximately 32 million tons of CO 2 -eq with a GHG weighted tax on animal food products corresponding to € 60 per ton CO 2 -eq. The effect of the tax is estimated to be six times higher if lignocellulosic crops are grown on the land made available and used to substitute for coal in power generation. Most of the effect of a GHG weighted tax on animal food can be captured by taxing the consumption of ruminant meat alone. Paper II: The Swedish nitrogen tax and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture The Swedish tax on nitrogen in synthetic fertilizers was abolished in 2010, possibly to compensate farmers for planned future increases in the CO 2 tax for the agricultural sector. This study estimates the effect of the nitrogen tax on agricultural emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), another greenhouse gas (GHG) that is more potent than CO 2. Price elasticities of nitrogen fertilizer use are estimated from county-level panel data and combined with the standard GHG accounting approach for international reporting of N 2 O emissions, as well as an alternative emission function suggested in the literature, to estimate the impact of the tax on emissions. The results suggest that annual direct N 2 O emissions from agricultural soils in Sweden would have been on average 160 tons higher without the tax. Results also indicate that higher N 2 O emissions from the removal of the N tax has the potential to fully offset the decreases in GHG emissions that can be expected from the future tax increase on CO 2 from agricultural diesel use. Paper III: On refunding of emission taxes and technology diffusion We analyze diffusion of an abatement technology under a standard emission tax compared to an emission tax which is refunded in proportion to output market share. The results indicate that refunding can speed up diffusion if firms do not strategically influence the size of the refund. If they do, it is ambiguous whether diffusion is slower or faster than under a non-refunded emission tax. Moreover, it is ambiguous whether refunding continues over time to provide larger incentives for technological upgrading than a non-refunded emission tax, since the effects of refunding dissipate as the overall industry becomes cleaner. Paper IV: Diffusion of NOx abatement technologies in Sweden This paper studies how different NOx abatement technologies have diffused under the Swedish system of refunded emissions charges and analyzes the determinants of the time to adoption. The policy, under which the charge revenues are refunded back to the regulated firms in proportion to energy output, was explicitly designed to affect investment in NOx reducing technologies. The results indicate that paying a higher net NOx charge increases the likelihood of adoption, but only for end-of-pipe post-combustion technologies. We also find some indication that market power considerations in the heat and power industry reduce the incentives to abate emissions through investment in post-combustion technologies. Adoption of post-combustion technologies and the efficiency improving technology of flue gas condensation is also more likely in the heat and power and waste incineration sectors, which is possibly explained by a large degree of public ownership in these sectors...|$|R
40|$|The built {{environment}} is a <b>product</b> of man’s <b>rationales</b> and understandings of space. It {{is on the}} basis of these understandings that man builds, to facilitate his ways of life. These “understandings”, are the discourses that each individual is born into and the “ways of life” are the cultural practices resulting from these discourses. Architecture being a product of cultural discourse is intended to facilitate cultural practices. Post 1994 South Africa, has inherited a Johannesburg inner-city {{built environment}}, which is predominantly a product of apartheid and colonial discourse. During this era, black people were marginalised and excluded from the inner city, both physically and through architectural representation. The inner city was built in accordance with western (white) discourse to facilitate western cultural practices. Today the inner city is predominantly inhabited by black people, who were excluded and marginalised in its conception. Post colonial theorists assert that, while black people have embraced “modernity” and “western urbanity”, it has not resulted in a complete acceptance or appropriation of western cultural practices and discourses. Due a process termed “post colonial hybridity” these people merge the two seemingly irreconcilable cultural discourses and practices to form new cultural hybrids. The consequence of hybridity in the inner-city is; while the appropriated western cultural practices and discourses are inherently reflected and catered for, the retained aspects of black cultural practice and discourse remain marginalised. The built environment, which is meant to facilitate and reflect, negates and marginalises aspects of black discourses and cultural practices. “To be truly expressive, a building should grow out of its natural, social, and civilization context. It should reflect not only the personal values, needs and interests of its dwellers but also its relation to its natural and architectural site. Thus the formal organization of a building cannot be imposed on a people from the outside; it should originate from the context of human life in the given region. In this origination the process of spatial articulation results from a thought- full grasp of the dynamic interaction between the material elements of the architectural work and the human vision which guides this activity. ” (Mitias 1994 : 103) In order to make a contribution to the creation of a more inclusive built environment this paper proposes the development of a hybrid building prototype that would facilitate and reflect the hybrid cultural practices and discourses of the city’s black inhabitants. The building prototype named the “Inner City Ritual Centre” aims to facilitate some of the marginalised practices of black people living in the city and to reflect some of the excluded spatial understandings of black people. The paper proposes a method of practice that utilises postcolonial hybridity, to include excluded and marginalised practices and discourses into the architectural representation of the city. This paper uncovers and highlights a few of these discourses and practices and demonstrates how the use of postcolonial hybridity in architecture would result in a more inclusive built environment...|$|R
