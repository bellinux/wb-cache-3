60|$|Far, very far, am I from supposing {{that such}} things {{enter into the}} {{purposes}} of those excellent persons whose zeal has led them {{to this kind of}} measure; but the measure itself will lead them beyond their intention, and what is begun with the best designs bad men will perversely improve to the worst of their purposes. An ill-founded plausibility in great affairs is a real evil. In France we have seen the wickedest and most foolish of men, the constitution-mongers of 1789, pursuing this very course, and ending in this very event. These projectors of deception set on foot two modes of voluntary contribution to the state. The first they called patriotic gifts. These, for the greater part, were not more ridiculous in the mode than contemptible in the project. The other, which they called the patriotic contribution, was expected to amount to a fourth of the fortunes of individuals, but at their own will and on their own estimate; but this contribution threatening to fall infinitely short of their hopes, they soon made it compulsory, both in the rate and in the levy, beginning in fraud, and ending, as all the frauds of <b>power</b> <b>end,</b> in plain violence. All these devices to produce an involuntary will were under the pretext of relieving the more indigent classes; but the principle of voluntary contribution, however delusive, being once established, these lower classes first, and then all classes, were encouraged to throw off the regular, methodical payments to the state, as so many badges of slavery. Thus all regular revenue failing, these impostors, raising the superstructure on the same cheats with which they had laid the foundation of their greatness, and not content with a portion of the possessions of the rich, confiscated the whole, and, to prevent them from reclaiming their rights, murdered the proprietors. The whole of the process has passed before our eyes, and been conducted, indeed, with a greater degree of rapidity than could be expected.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the test-retest reliability of mechanical parameters {{derived from a}} 3 -min isokinetic all-out test, performed at 60 and 100 rpm. Reliability {{and validity of the}} peak oxygen uptake derived from 3 -min isokinetic all-out test were also tested. DESIGN: 14 healthy male subjects completed an incremental ramp testing and four randomized 3 -min isokinetic all-out test (two at 60 rpm and two at 100 rpm). METHODS: The absolute and relative reliability of the following parameters were analyzed: peak power, mean <b>power,</b> <b>end</b> power, fatigue index, work performed above end power and peak oxygen uptake. RESULTS: No difference was found between each two sets of data, although there were between-cadence differences for peak power, mean <b>power,</b> <b>end</b> power, and fatigue index. Higher intra-class correlation (ICC) and lower coefficient of variation (CV) were found for end power (ICC= 0. 91 and 0. 95; CV= 5. 6 and 5. 7 %) and mean power (ICC= 0. 97 and 0. 98; CV= 2. 4 and 3. 1 %), than for peak power (ICC= 0. 81 and 0. 84; CV= 8. 7 and 10 %) and work performed above end power (ICC= 0. 79 and 0. 84; CV= 7. 9 and 10. 6 %; values reported for 60 rpm and 100 rpm, respectively). High reliability scores were also observed for peak oxygen uptake at both cadences (60 rpm, CV= 3. 2 %; 100 rpm, CV= 2. 3 %,) with no difference with the incremental ramp testing peak oxygen uptake. CONCLUSIONS: The power profile and peak oxygen uptake of a 3 -min isokinetic all-out test are both highly reliable, whether the test is performed at 60 or 100 rpm. Besides, peak oxygen uptake and work performed above end power were not affected by the change in cadence while peak power, mean <b>power,</b> <b>end</b> power, and fatigue index were...|$|E
