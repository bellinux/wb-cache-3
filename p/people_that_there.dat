25|$|State Guards were {{reformed}} {{for internal}} security duties {{to replace the}} National Guardsmen who were federalized and sent overseas. The Civil Air Patrol was established, which enrolled civilian spotters in air reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, and transport. Its Coast Guard counterpart, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, used civilian boats and crews in similar rescue roles. Towers were built in coastal and border towns, and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft. Blackouts were practiced in every city, even those far from the coast. All exterior lighting had to be extinguished, and black-out curtains placed over windows. The main purpose was to remind <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a war on and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit {{of millions of people}} not otherwise involved in the war effort. In large part, this effort was successful, sometimes almost to a fault, such as the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their posts night after night watching the skies in an area of the country that no enemy aircraft of that time could possibly hope to reach.|$|E
25|$|With {{the surging}} fears {{haunting}} {{the people of}} Madras, the Congress party of the state would do nothing bigger than a small demonstration and insisted to the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were no grounds for alarm. In contrast, DMK held an Anti-Hindi Conference in Trichirapalli on 17 January 1965. The conference was supported by all major opposition parties and funded by major wealthy industrialists – the industrialists who themselves feared of losing to influence of the North if Hindi were made the official language. The conference decided to hold 26 January (the fifteen anniversary of India’s republic day) as a Day of Mourning. Madras State's Chief Minister Bhakthavatchalam declared a warning that the state government would not tolerate {{the sanctity of the}} Republic day blasphemed. Hence DMK advanced the day of mourning by two days, id est. on 24 January. Although no longer a day of mourning, plans of demonstration on the 26th were still underway. DMK and its then ally, Swatantara Party had asked its members to fly black flags in their homes on that day. Bhakthavatchalam declared that such acts would be considered traitorous.|$|E

[...] "We're all different. Some women will have a certain area within the vagina which will be very sensitive, and some won't— but they won't necessarily be in the area called the G spot," [...] she stated. [...] "If a woman spends all her time worrying about whether she is normal, or has a G spot or not, she will focus on just one area, and ignore everything else.

500|$|The group {{expressed}} its {{belief that}} the faster that they accomplish independence, the faster that they can begin associating with other Latin American nations and consolidate efforts with its counterparts. Believing that the local and federal governments had [...] "extreme repressive and oppressive economic measures against the people" [...] to unprecedented levels, Guasábara warned that privatization of services would bring [...] "a raise in costs" [...] and [...] "meager salaries", also citing that constitutional rights were being violated by the Fortuño administration noting that under Rivera Schatz the general public {{was not allowed to}} openly protest at the Senate of Puerto Rico. The EPB derided the government's raise of the UPR's tuition and the withdrawal of funds for cultural organizations. It also expressed support to those opposing the Via Verde project, stating that it would [...] "destroy the environment [...] endanger human life and property". All of these conditions convinced the Macheteros that the conditions for a public revolt were being formed, citing that they would [...] "do everything in their power to convince the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a need to defend themselves". Guasábara admitted that the organization was receiving information concerning military and political strategies that the United States intended to enact in Puerto Rico and that they employ it to remain elusive and to prepare counter measures, only making a portion of it public, but refused to reveal their sources. When questioned about the possibility of reopening a line of inquiry with the Catholic Church (an initiative abandoned in 2005 after the death of Ojeda Ríos), the officer said that the EPB is open [...] "to chat [...] exchange ideas", but that they would not abandon armed resistance.|$|E

2500|$|Banda was {{the only}} African ruler to {{establish}} diplomatic ties with South Africa during apartheid {{as well as the}} Portuguese regime in Mozambique. After the cabinet crisis in 1964, Banda became increasingly isolated in African politics. On the other hand, his antipathy for Roy Welensky and what he denounced as the [...] "stupid federation" [...] was a smokescreen he used to reject the proposed Bangula Hydro-electric dam – proposed to be bigger than the Gezira Dam in Khartoum – that Welensky's Federation had sought and obtained funding for from the British government. Banda went on to blame everything including snails (likely to cause widespread Bilharzias) to abort the project. In turn, the British denied Banda the funding and budgetary support he needed to build his pet dream of a new capital city at Lilongwe, in his home region. Hence he turned to South Africa – itself playing geo-political games in the region – which gave him a soft loan of 300 million rand. The quid pro quo was that Banda had to support South Africa's apartheid policies among fellow African leaders. Hence, on one occasion he paid a state visit to South Africa where he met his South African counterparts at Stellenbosch. Banda once noted that, [...] "It is only contact like this [...] that can reveal to your <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are civilized people other than white..." [...] Banda's staunch anticommunism also influenced his decision to seek warm relations with South Africa.|$|E

2500|$|Livy {{wrote that}} {{regarding}} {{the demands of}} the Samnites (which in Rome they called the Caudine peace), the consuls said that they were in no position to agree a treaty because this had to be authorised by the vote of the people of Rome and ratified by the fetials (priest-ambassadors) following the proper religious rites. Therefore, instead of a treaty there was a guarantee, the guarantors being the consuls, the officers of the two armies and the quaestors. Six hundred equites (equestrians) were handed over as hostages [...] "whose lives were to be forfeit if the Romans should fail to keep the terms." [...] The dejected Roman soldiers left and were too ashamed to enter Capua, whose inhabitants gave them supplies in commiseration. In Rome people went into mourning, shops were closed and all activities at the Forum were suspended. There was anger towards the soldiers and suggestions to bar them. However, when they arrived people took pity on them. They locked themselves in their homes. Spurius Postumius said to the senate that Rome was not bound to the guarantee at the Caudine Forks because it was given without the authorisation of the <b>people,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no impediment to resuming the war and all that Rome owed to the Samnites were the persons and the lives of the guarantors. An army, the fetials and the guarantors to be surrendered were sent to Samnium. Once there, Postumius jostled the knee of a fetial and claimed that he was a Samnite who had violated diplomatic rules. Gaius Pontius denounced Roman duplicity and declared that he deemed the Roman guarantors not to be surrendered. The peace he had hoped for did not materialise. [...] Meanwhile, Satricum (a town in Latium) defected to the Samnites and the Samnites took Fregellae.|$|E
