[...] Another expansion occurred at the company's Rock Springs, Wyoming SF Phosphates plant, a joint venture with J.R. Simplot Company. [...] Other efforts included a focus on <b>precision</b> <b>farming</b> through programs such as Resource 21, a remote sensing project with Boeing and GDE, AgInfo, a GIS software system offered through Agronomy Services Bureau; and Integrated Crop Management (ICM), a <b>precision</b> <b>farming</b> data management tool. [...] These efforts were designed to stay at the forefront of technologies such as remote sensing, variable rate fertilization, grid sampling, yield mapping and global positioning and geographic information systems. [...] The cooperative built a highly innovative coke-to-nitrogen fertilizer plant adjacent to its petroleum refinery operation in Coffeyville, Kansas. [...] The plant allowed the cooperative to convert petroleum coke—a waste product from the petroleum division—into ammonia {{that could be used for}} fertilizer. [...] This project was lauded for its environmental impact.|$|E

40|$|Take Home Messages 	<b>Precision</b> Dairy <b>Farming</b> {{is the use}} of {{technologies}} to measure physiological, behavioral, and production indicators on individual animals to improve management strategies and <b>farm</b> performance. 	Many <b>Precision</b> Dairy <b>Farming</b> technologies, including daily milk yield recording, milk component monitoring, pedometers, automatic temperature recording devices, milk conductivity indicators, automatic estrus detection monitors, and daily body weight measurements, are already being utilized by dairy producers. 	Other theoretical <b>Precision</b> Dairy <b>Farming</b> technologies have been proposed to measure jaw movements, ruminal pH, reticular contractions, heart rate, animal positioning and activity, vaginal mucus electrical resistance, feeding behavior, lying behavior, odor, glucose, acoustics, progesterone, individual milk components, color (as an indicator of cleanliness), infrared udder surface temperatures, and respiration rates. 	The main objectives of <b>Precision</b> Dairy <b>Farming</b> are maximizing individual animal potential, early detection of disease, and minimizing the use of medication through preventive health measures. 	Perceived benefits of <b>Precision</b> Dairy <b>Farming</b> technologies include increased efficiency, reduced costs, improved product quality, minimized adverse environmental impacts, and improved animal health and well-being. 	Real time data used for monitoring animals may be incorporated into decision support systems designed to facilitate decision making for issues that require compilation of multiple sources of data. 	Technologies for physiological monitoring of dairy cows have great potential to supplement the observational activities of skilled herdspersons, which is especially critical as more cows are managed by fewer skilled workers. 	The economic implications of technology adoption must be explored further to increase adoption rates of <b>Precision</b> Dairy <b>Farming</b> technologies...|$|R

40|$|Key for <b>precision</b> dairy <b>farming</b> is the {{management}} {{of different kinds of}} (sensor) data from multiple sources and its disclosure to users. The data can be used to implement services that support farmers to care for individual animals and work more effectively. Naturally, these services need to provide added value to be successful and adopted. Our results show that added value can be found in services that are fine-tuned to a farmer’s daily business/business processes and that are easily applicable and usable in daily business. The specific design of the front-end and the functionality of these <b>precision</b> dairy <b>farming</b> services is most important in creating the above addressed added value. This paper addresses research in understanding what added value means to farmers in the context of <b>precision</b> dairy <b>farming</b> and how this insight can best be translated into concrete functionalities and front-end designs of <b>precision</b> dairy <b>farming</b> services. Through contextual inquiry insights in a farmer’s values in his/her work and preferences therein are explored based on the User eXperience (UX) framework. This framework focusses on three levels of experiences: 1) The values important to a user that should be supported; 2) the functionality, interactions and behaviors that support and belong to these values in practice; and 3) the aesthetic experience (e. g. form) of the front-end. The results of these contextual inquiries combined with earlier research results were translated into different storyboards expressing different values (meaning) and functionalities (interactics) important to different kinds of farmers. The next step is the validation of these storyboards in workshops and the translation of the results into specific requirements for the development of <b>precision</b> dairy <b>farming</b> services that provide added value for different kinds of farmers...|$|R

40|$|Farmland {{management}} involves several {{planning and}} decision making tasks including seed selection and irrigation management. A farm-level precision farmland management model based on mixed integer linear programming is proposed in this study. Optimal decisions are designed for pre-season planning of crops and irrigation water allocation. The model captures the effect of {{size and shape of}} decision scale as well as special irrigation patterns. The authors illustrate the model with a case study on a farm in the state of California in the U. S. and show the model can capture the impact of <b>precision</b> <b>farm</b> management on profitability. The results show that threefold increase of annual net profit for farmers could be achieved by carefully choosing irrigation and seed selection. Although farmers could increase profits by applying precision management to seed or irrigation alone, profit increase is more significant if farmers apply precision management on seed and irrigation simultaneously. The proposed model can also serve as a risk analysis tool for farmers facing seasonal irrigation water limits as well as a quantitative tool to explore the impact of precision agriculture...|$|R
