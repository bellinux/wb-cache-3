5000|$|In 2004 {{there was}} another notable break in the grand coalition. It {{occurred}} over the nomination of Rocco Buttiglione as European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security. The EPP supported the appointment of Buttiglione, while the PES, who were also critics of the <b>President-designate</b> Jose Manuel Barroso, led the parties seeking Buttiglione's removal following his rejection (the first in EU history) by a Parliamentary committee. Barroso initially stood by his team and offered only small concessions, which were rejected by the PES. The EPP demanded that if Buttiglione were to go, then a PES commissioner must also be sacrificed for balance. In the end, Italy withdrew Buttiglione and put forward Franco Frattini instead.

5000|$|Following {{his hearing}} Dimas {{received}} a sceptical response from most MEPs. Many believed {{him to have}} insufficient experience to fulfill the role.

If Commission <b>President-designate</b> Barroso puts the Lisbon Strategy on top of the agenda, this must not mean that the primacy of economic over environment policy gets cemented." [...] However, he stressed the need to give Dimas time to 'grow into' his role. The Socialists gave him a qualified approval but criticised his plans as too vague. The Greens and the left-wing GUE/NGL opposed his appointment outright, with the Greens naming him as one of the three [...] "incompetent" [...] Commissioners-designate who prompted them to vote against the Commission as a whole. Representatives of industry and the business community welcomed his appointment to the environment post.|$|E
50|$|Before {{ratification}} of the 25th Amendment in 1967, the Constitution contained no provision for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency. As a result, when one occurred (and did 16 times), the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing election and inauguration. Since 1967, the Vice Presidency has been vacant twice, and a successor was nominated each time to fill the vacancy {{in accordance with the}} 25th Amendment. The first instance was in 1973, when Gerald Ford was nominated by President Richard Nixon to succeed Spiro Agnew, who had resigned. The second came in 1974, when Ford, who had succeeded to the presidency following Nixon's resignation, nominated Nelson Rockefeller to succeed him. During both vacancies, the nominee was called Vice <b>President-designate,</b> instead of Vice President-elect, as neither had been elected to the office. As a result of these events, the nation has had two more Vice Presidents than it has had Vice President-elects. While he is currently the 48th U.S. Vice President, Mike Pence was the 46th person to be Vice President-elect.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{announcement}} of the appointment of Fernandes as Gallaudet president, scores of students protested against her appointment. According to The Washington Post, [...] "Students objected to the appointment of Jane Fernandes, who is deaf and is currently the university's provost, because she did not grow up using American Sign Language. Some students also criticized Fernandes for not having warm relations with students." [...] Opponents of Fernandes claim that the Washington Post article (and, in general, much of the media coverage), were unable to figure out the real reasons for their opposition, although a frequently published reason was that she was [...] "not deaf enough." [...] The protesters pointed to her past managerial actions that they felt were questionable and did not reflect qualities of a solid leader. Fernandes also attracted opposition due to a perception that she was insufficiently committed to addressing the problem of audism (discrimination against or persecution of anyone based on hearing status). The student paper took polls {{a few days before the}} selection. Of those faculty members who responded, 36% gave Fernandes an [...] "acceptable" [...] rating, compared to 53% and 64% for the two other finalists. On October 29, 2006, the Board of Trustees of Gallaudet University rescinded her contract to be the ninth President of Gallaudet and terminated her in her position as <b>President-designate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Chinese text {{segmentation}} is {{a well-known}} and difficult problem. On one side, {{there is not a}} simple notion of "word" in Chinese language making really hard to implement rule-based systems to segment written texts, thus lexicons and statistical information are usually employed to achieve such a task. On the other side, any piece of Chinese text usually includes segments present neither in the lexicons nor in the training data. Even worse, such unseen sequences can be segmented into a number of totally unrelated words making later processing phases difficult. For instance, using a lexicon-based system the sequence ???(Baluozuo, Barroso, current <b>president-designate</b> of the European Commission) can be segmented into ?(ba, to hope, to wish) and ??(luozuo, an undefined word) changing completely the meaning of the sentence. A new and extremely simple algorithm specially suited to work over short Chinese documents is introduced. This new algorithm performs text "self-segmentation" producing results comparable to those achieved by native speakers without using either lexicons or any statistical information beyond the obtained from the input text. Furthermore, it is really robust for finding new "words", especially proper nouns, and it is well suited to build lexicons from scratch. Some preliminary results are provided in addition to examples of its employment. Comment: 9 pages 3 figures 2 table...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt from preface: The present {{collection}} of articles follows from a one-day seminar The Biological Weapons Convention, Biosecurity and the Industry organised by the Belgian Foreign Ministry in Brussels on 20 June 2011. Among the attendants were Belgian and European {{representatives from the}} life sciences, the biosafety and -security community, and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as Belgian Government officials involved with disarmament. Ambassador Paul van den IJssel, <b>President-Designate</b> of the 7 th BTWC Review Conference, closed the proceedings. One of the seminar’s central themes was to investigate how the life sciences industry – one core stakeholder remaining wholly {{in the background of}} the discussions {{on the future of the}} BTWC – could become more involved. Speakers from the aforementioned communities zoomed in on industrial standards for biosafety and biosecurity being developed for laboratories in research and industry facilities as a possible point of entry. In follow up to the seminar, the idea arose to explore this lesser-known opportunity in more detail and highlight its possibilities and limitations from three different perspectives: biorisk management, industry practice and government responsibility in formal disarmament. The Belgian Royal Institute for International Relations Egmont agreed to publish the contributions in its Egmont Papers series in collaboration with the European Union Institute for Security Studies...|$|E
40|$|This study {{began by}} asserting that first-year {{performance}} {{has implications for}} the success and longevity (or failure) of a college presidency. More to the point was my view that the time of transition between a president 2 ̆ 7 s appointment and taking office is a unique 2 ̆ 2 window of opportunity 2 ̆ 2 for a new president to establish a leadership style and broader persona which can later be difficult to alter, and to enjoy an unusual degree of executive maneuverability. If that were the case, then how might a <b>president-designate</b> plan most fruitfully for a high-impact first year? Because the research focused on the first year, {{the answer to the}} broader question is unclear. However, the assertion that transition activities have significant impact on the performance of duties in a president 2 ̆ 7 s first year was validated. It became clear that better transition preparation on all sides would have created more effective freshman years. This dissertation was based largely on interpretive research, and is qualitative and anecdotal in nature, reporting on the views and experiences gained through extensive interviews with four new liberal arts college presidents. It also includes the observations of representative trustees and faculty members. Each of four case studies suggested a similar set of lessons: dealing with the exit of the old leader, confirming the key institutional issues posited by the search committee, and the personal impact of the presidency on the new incumbent. While it is clear {{that there is no way}} to fully anticipate what any presidency will mean to the incumbent or campus, it is worth noting new presidents cannot depend on the cooperation and good will of many others alone [...] particularly the departing president and board [...] to give their new presidency more weight than the old one. Transition arrangements should not be left to chance, and should be spelled out in great detail before the job is accepted. This dissertation suggests detailed elements likely to guarantee a successful first year. ...|$|E
40|$|On July 15, 2014 the European Parliament {{confirmed}} the new European Commission President. An absolute majority {{was needed for}} this purpose, and the 422 votes “For” cleared the 376 -vote threshold in the legislative body of 751 members. A Grand Coalition has been formed among the three largest political parties: the European People’s Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliances of Socialists Democrats (S&D), and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). Considering policy decisions going forward, the European Union (EU) faces the pressing question: Will there be more, less, or similar power from the EU? There are a greater number voices from {{across the political spectrum}} contributing to the democratic plurality. European leaders may regain trust by acknowledging that future governance will not be “business as usual” as the reform agenda gets underway. 2014 has been an exciting and important year in European politics. “This time is different” was the motto for the European Parliament’s election campaign. This essay analyzes recent EU political trends with the new Commission leadership and the Parliamentary elections results. The Parliamentary elections, held in late May, and the new European Commission, planned to be in place in the autumn, influence the leadership direction of the 28 -member bloc. Additionally, this year on July 1 Croatia celebrated the first anniversary of joining the EU in 2013. Leading the way for candidate countries, Croatia embraces the democratic politics and capitalist market economics embodied by the EU. The greater number of seats held by newer political parties in the European Parliament demonstrates increasing plurality in the EU democracy. The Parliamentary elections have taken place every 5 years since 1979. In this eighth legislative session, the EPP and the S&D remain the largest parties represented, with 221 and 191 seats respectively. As the EU has evolved, a greater number of voices influence politics. The ongoing point of contention on a host of policies is national sovereignty in relation to pooled sovereignty in the EU. The European Parliament is important for democracy in EU governance since it is the direct link from the national citizens to their elected leaders at the supranational level. The representatives of the European Commission are appointed by the national governments of Member States, and their heads of government are the representatives to the European Council. These three political institutions – the European Parliament, the European Commission, and the European Council – together with other important institutions, including the European Court of Justice Luxembourg, form the EU. The new European Commission President is Jean-Claude Juncker, former Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Luxembourg (1995 - 2013). After being nominated by the European Council on June 27, his candidacy was voted on by the European Parliament on July 15, according to the guidelines of the Lisbon Treaty. The leadership for the President of the European Commission has been an important issue, considering Britain’s deliberations on whether or not to stay in the EU {{in the face of a}} future national referendum. Voting on June 27, among the European Council on the nomination of Commission <b>President-Designate</b> Juncker, was 26 in favor and 2 opposed. Only Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary, joined David Cameron, the prime minister of the United Kingdom (UK), with a negative vote (Spiegel and Parker 2014). The UK had not been supportive, being concerned that Juncker embraces the policies of a federalist, prioritizing an ever-closer union above the interests of individual Member States. Historically, since joining the predecessor institution of the European Economic Community in 1973, the UK has had a relatively independent attitude about participation in the EU...|$|E
