40|$|An {{efficient}} and scalable Balancing Domain Decomposition (BDD) type preconditioner for large scale linear systems arising from 3 -dimensional heat transfer problems is presented.

This paper explores the <b>preconditions,</b> <b>processes</b> and outcomes associated with the collaborative strategies of an Australian retail trade union: the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association. The data were collected from an extensive series of interviews with officials and organisers within the union across all Australian states. We find that despite taking a servicing approach, and indeed never aggressively organising members, the union has managed to achieve a range of outcomes that exceed retail employment conditions in other countries. We argue that this is partly a result of the Australian legislative framework, which is inherently pluralist and supportive of collective bargaining. This environment, whereby unions are not forced to fight to represent members, can be conducive to collaborative employment relations, particularly in industries where the parties do not adopt an adversarialist stance.

He argued that Nazism was radically anti-modernist and archaic in its ideology and policy, and yet paradoxically modernist in political style and in the use of political means. For example, it made very effective and original use of newspapers, films, and mass rallies, demonstrating a firm grasp of the latest propaganda techniques. An unintended result was a greater equalization and leveling of German society, even though Nazism rejected the ideal of equality of man and made no effort to end the traditional hierarchical class structure of German society.|$|R

The method enhances the efficiency of MAS, when the linear system becomes ill-conditioned, due to distancing of the auxiliary surface from the outer boundary. If the cross-sectional boundary is geomet-rically close to a circle, it is proven that the MAS matrix becomes quasi-circulant, as intuition dictates. By exploiting the properties of the exactly circulant matrix, pertaining to the original circular configuration, the perturbed system is trans-formed to a quasi-diagonal one, whose inversion is a numerically stable operation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we develop a robust multigrid preconditioned Krylov {{subspace}} method for {{the solution of}} heterogeneous indefinite Helmholtz problems. The preconditioning operator is constructed by discretizing the original Helmholtz equation on a complex stretched grid. As this preconditioning operator has the same wavenumber as the original problem, and the only difference stems from the complex stretching of the discretization grid, its spectrum closely approximates the spectrum of the original Helmholtz operator, resulting in a fast converging Krylov subspace method. We have analyzed a multigrid cycle based on polynomial smoothers and have found a condition on the parameters used in the complex stretching of the discretization grid such {{that the existence of}} a stable third order polynomial smoother is guaranteed. In practice we use three iterations of GMRES as a smoother, and have found this to be a viable smoother for the multigrid <b>preconditioning</b> <b>process.</b> We apply the method to various test problems and report on the observed convergence rate. 1.
