25|$|Under content codes {{issued by}} the Media Development Authority, <b>political</b> <b>advertising</b> is not {{permitted}} on radio or television.

The number of candidates fielded also determines the order of broadcasts, with the broadcast of the party fielding the smallest number of candidates on first and that of the party fielding the largest number last.|$|E
