50|$|In South Africa, <b>pass</b> <b>laws</b> were {{a form of}} {{internal}} passport system designed to segregate the population, manage urbanisation, and allocate migrant labour. Also known as the natives <b>law,</b> <b>pass</b> <b>laws</b> severely limited the movements of not only black African citizens, but by other minorities as well - by requiring them to carry pass books when outside their homelands or designated areas. Before the 1950s, this legislation largely applied to African men, and attempts to apply it to women in the 1910s and 1950s were met with significant protests. <b>Pass</b> <b>laws</b> {{would be one of}} the dominant features of the country's apartheid system, until it was effectively ended in 1986.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} Eastern Han, Emperor Ming <b>passed</b> <b>laws</b> which {{prohibited}} {{those involved in}} agriculture from simultaneously engaging in mercantile trade.

The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped. The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.|$|E

5|$|After the {{revolution}} in Russia in 1917, the communist movement gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the First Red Scare of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US. In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures <b>passed</b> <b>laws</b> designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.|$|E
5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government <b>passed</b> <b>laws</b> in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E

Congress passed legislation {{that allowed the}} Indiana Territory to elect a bicameral legislature and made the Legislative Council the upper house It also ordered Harrison to dissolve the existing one and created the Illinois Territory. The effect of these actions, was to cut the pro-slavery faction remaining in the Indiana Territory in half. The election resulted in a sweeping victory for the anti-slavery party. The new assembly quickly passed legislation revoking the indentured servitude laws of 1803, and introduced legislation to prevent its reintroduction.

As a result, the government <b>passed</b> <b>laws</b> to restrict musical activities among slaves. At the same time, American and other forms of imported music were brought to Barbados, while many important elements of modern Barbadian music, like tuk bands, also emerged. In the 20th century, many new styles were imported to Barbados, most influentially including jazz, ska, reggae, calypso and soca. Barbados became home to many performers of these new genres, especially soca and calypso, while the island also produced an indigenous style called spouge, which became an important symbol of Barbadian identity.|$|E

The ironically named Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act of 1952, commonly known as the <b>Pass</b> <b>Laws</b> Act, repealed the many regional <b>pass</b> <b>laws</b> and instituted one nationwide <b>pass</b> <b>law,</b> which made it compulsory for all black South Africans {{over the age of}} 16 to carry the [...] "pass book" [...] at all times within white areas.

Emperor Wu targeted both the registered and unregistered merchants with higher taxes. While registered merchants {{were not allowed to}} own land, if they broke this law their land and slaves would be confiscated. However, wealthy unregistered merchants owned large tracts of land. Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the marketplace, where he set up government-managed shops that sold commodities collected from the merchants as property taxes.|$|E

His campaign had focused on land use reform, as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements over the use of public land, especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with water rights and grazing issues.
