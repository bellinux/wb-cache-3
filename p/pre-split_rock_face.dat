50|$|In harder, jointed (and {{therefore}} pervious) rocks, landslips are rarer.

40|$|Snow in <b>rock</b> <b>faces</b> plays a {{key role}} in the alpine {{environment}} for permafrost distribution, snow water storage or run off in spring. However, a detailed assessment of snow depths in steep rock walls has never been attempted. To understand snow distribution in rock walls a high-resolution terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), including a digital camera, was used to obtain snow depth (HS) data with a resolution of one metre. The mean HS, the snow covered area and their evolution in the <b>rock</b> <b>face</b> were compared to a neighbouring smoother catchment and a flat field station at similar elevation. Further we analyzed the patterns of HS distribution in the <b>rock</b> <b>face</b> after different periods and investigated the main factors contributing to them. In a first step we could show that with TLS reliable information on surface data of a steep rocky surface can be obtained. In comparison to the flatter sites in the vicinity, mean HS in the <b>rock</b> <b>face</b> was lower during the entire winter, but trends of snow depth changes were similar. We observed repeating accumulation and ablation patterns in the <b>rock</b> <b>face,</b> while maximum snow depth loss always occurred at those places with maximum snow depth gain. Further analysis of the main factors contributing to the snow depth distribution in the <b>rock</b> <b>face</b> revealed terrain-wind-interaction processes to be dominant. Processes related to slope angle seem to play a role, but no linear function of slope angle and snow depth was found. Further analyses should involve measurements in <b>rock</b> <b>faces</b> with other characteristics and higher temporal resolutions to be able to distinguish individual processes better. Additionally the relation of spatial and temporal distribution of snow depth to terrain-wind interactions should be tested...|$|R
