5000|$|Both {{front and}} rear upper verandahs have a simple two-rail dowel {{balustrade}}, and timber posts support both {{the upper and lower}} verandahs. The front upper verandah's balustrade is a recent (metal) replica. The lower front verandah has a deep valance of corrugated galvanized iron, with a (non-original) shark-tooth pattern along the bottom edge, and the painted lettering [...] "EINASLEIGH HOTEL". Above the balustrade on the upper rear verandah there are <b>pivoting</b> <b>panels</b> of corrugated iron, which can be opened for ventilation.|$|R
25|$|Stone Roof, {{a private}} {{residence}} in Nagano, Japan, built in 2010, {{consists of a}} roof which is meant to spring from the ground, providing a complete enclosure to the home. A local stone was chosen to intimately relate itself to the preexisting natural environment of the mountain side. The exterior stone work is made light and airy by cutting each stone into thin slices and bracing each slice as a <b>pivoting</b> <b>panel.</b> In this way, the heavy quality of stone is diluted and provides the eye with an illusion of lightness, allowing light and air directly into the space within. With this choice of material and construction, {{a new kind of}} transparency emerges; one that not only frames nature the way a glass curtain wall would, but also deeply relates itself to the mountain side.|$|R
50|$|Akaflieg Stuttgart {{wanted to}} build a glider with {{reasonable}} performance that was safe and simple to fly, the result was the FS-16. The design employed a cantilever wing attached {{to the top of the}} fuselage; the rear portion of the fuselage was raised, similar to the Akaflieg Stuttgart F.1. The FS-16 as constructed had no vertical tail, but used <b>pivoting</b> <b>panels</b> on the wingtips for roll and yaw control. It had no tail-skid, using a single large skid under the front fuselage with a spur extending rearwards for support and stability on the ground. Flight characteristics with the rotating wing-tip panels were not as expected so a conventional vertical fin on an extended rear fuselage, and ailerons constructed from fabric-covered Duralumin on the outer wing traling edges, were added after initial flights.|$|R

40|$|The Coastal Plains Soil, Water, and Plant Research Center {{has been}} {{monitoring}} spatial yield {{in a test}} field since 1985, using a conventional corn-wheat-soybean rotation most of that time. Observations of variation in soil and crop response that correlate with yield variation suggest that crop water relations {{may be the key}} feature that causes spatial variability in yield for the Southeastern Coastal Plain. Experience with mechanistic modeling indicates that for normal weather years, the final yield is particularly sensitive to variations in soil water, presumably because the surface soil is sandy and rooting volume is limited. These conclusions, plus difficulties encountered in scheduling irrigation under a center pivot on typically variable soils, led the USDA-ARS to desi~n and build a site-specific center pivot capable of differentially irrigating lOO-m areas. A 3 -tower commercial center pivot was modified by adding 39 9. 2 -m manifolds in 13 sections, 3 to a section. The manifolds and nozzles were sized lx, 2 x, and 4 x, so that octal combinations would provide up to 7 x the minimum application depth for a given outer tower speed. At 50 % speed, the application depths are 0 to 12. 5 mm in 1. 8 -mm increments. A prograrnrnable controller was attached near the pivot end of the boom, so that it was proximal to but avoided the <b>pivot</b> control <b>panel</b> when the system rotated. The individual manifolds were controlled by a program residing in the progranunable controller, which obtained pivot position and other information via radio modem link with the <b>pivot</b> control <b>panel.</b> Water and nitrogen application has been accomplished using this system on a replicated field experiment. Experience gained during this phase will guide modification of a similar pivot for site-specific water, nutrient, and pesticide management on a typically variable Coastal Plain field...|$|R
40|$|A {{deployable}} reflector {{structure is}} presented. The structure {{has a number}} of movable reflector panels pivotably supported on rigid arms. Several such arms are pivotably connected to a central structure. The arm can move in starburst fashion from a packaged stage, where all arms are vertical, to a deployed stage, where all arms are horizontal. All of the movable reflector panels are maintained at a predetermined angle to an axis of the reflector structure when the arms are <b>pivoted.</b> The reflector <b>panels</b> are stacked tightly {{on top of each other}} in the packaged state of the reflector structure. Simple mechanisms are used for avoiding interference between panels on different arms in the packaged stage and for fitting the movable panels together like tiles in the deployed stage...|$|R
5000|$|In third-angle projection, the {{parallel}} projectors originate as if radiated {{from the far}} side of the object and pass through the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane in front of it. The views of the 3D object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object, and the <b>panels</b> <b>pivot</b> as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing. Thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top; and the features closest to the front of the 3D object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing. Third-angle projection is primarily used in the United States and Canada, where it is the default projection system according to ASME standard ASME Y14.3M.|$|R
5000|$|The He 111P {{incorporated}} the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine gun that replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with a roomier and more aerodynamic glazed stepless cockpit {{over the entire}} front of the aircraft. This smooth glazed nose was first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475 km/h (295 mph) at 5,000 m (16,400 ft) and a cruise speed of 370 km/h (230 mph), although a full bomb load reduced this figure to 300 km/h (190 mph). The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.The pilot's seat could actually be elevated, with the pilot's eyes above {{the level of the}} upper glazing, complete with a small <b>pivoted</b> windscreen <b>panel,</b> to get the pilot's head above the level of the top of the [...] "glass tunnel" [...] for a better forward view for takeoffs and landings.

50|$|Current {{and future}} {{use of the}} {{building}}: The building is a Museum and Art Gallery {{and will continue to}} remain as one with expansion in collection through art acquisition programs. Envisaged as a vehicle for transmission of knowledge in the Second Five Year Plan of India and the National Education Policy, it continues to serve as a unique cultural and historical resource for the region and beyond. Being a leading museum of the region with an extremely significant collection of Gandhara sculptures, Pahari miniature painting and contemporary Indian art, it sees visitation by tourists, artists, scholars and students. Researchers, Architects and scholars on Le Corbusier and Modernism are also frequent visitors to the building and its surrounding ensembles to study its architectural and aesthetic values as it represents the series of museums designed by Le Corbusier based on the Unending Spiral and Unlimited Growth. Its majestic proportions, supported on gigantic pilotis give it a floating effect and the building represents the ‘arrival of modern’ in India. The <b>pivoted</b> entrance metal <b>paneled</b> door, built in and fixed furniture and display systems, exposed concrete sculpturesque gargoyles are symbolic of the prevailing style of Chandigarh’s architecture. The mural in the museum reception area executed by one of India’s finest contemporary artists, Satish Gujral is a beautiful ceramic work that adds colour to the otherwise stark exposed concrete building. The museum library is a rich repository of books on subjects of art, architecture and history of art. A special section is dedicated to Dr MS Randhawa, containing archival records of his correspondence on the making of Chandigarh, available to scholars in a digitized version. The adjacent auditorium serves as a lecture hall for extended activities of the museum such as lectures, film screenings and cultural events. The interior detailing of the modest auditorium lives up to the Modernist tradition that was introduced in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier-bold building forms that represent the functional requirements of interiors and efficiency thereof.|$|R
