5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence.

Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño <b>poppers</b> accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been relegated to a regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} {{include the}} Soda <b>Poppers,</b> {{a group of}} three former child stars from the 1970s. The three, each with their own trademark catch-phrase, first appear as victims of hypnosis in the first episode, later acting as the judges on a Pop Idol parody in the second episode. By the fourth episode, they are elected the governors of the Dakotas and plunge the region into civil war over ownership of Mount Rushmore. Also making sporadic appearances is Hugh Bliss, an eccentric magician and leader of the Prismatology cult, a parody of Scientology. He is often seen attempting to promote his self-help guides based on Prismatology. Sam finds Bliss irritating, while Max almost idolizes him. Minor characters include Agent Superball, a US Secret Service agent with a penchant for guarding doors; Chuckles, the pit manager in a mafia-run casino; and the Computer Obsolescence Prevention Society (COPS), a group of outdated computers attempting to find purpose in the technologically advanced world.|$|E

However, at the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science at Bedford College, University of London, July 11-17, 1965, they came into {{conflict}} with each other. Bartley had presented a paper, [...] "Theories of Demarcation Between Science and Metaphysics," [...] in which he accused <b>Popper</b> of displaying a positivist attitude in his early works and proposed that <b>Popper's</b> demarcation criterion was {{not as important as}} <b>Popper</b> thought it was. <b>Popper</b> took this as a personal attack, and Bartley took his reply as indicating that <b>Popper</b> was ignoring his criticism. Their friendship was not restored until 1974, after the publication of The Philosophy of Karl <b>Popper</b> (edited by Paul Schillpp). Bartley changed the tone of his remarks about <b>Popper's</b> criterion of demarcation, making it less aggressive. However, despite the restored friendship, Bartley's view was never accepted by <b>Popper,</b> who criticised it even after Bartley's death.|$|R

Foveal (center-of-gaze) damage has also been described, in six habitual users of <b>poppers.</b> In 2014, optometrists and ophthalmologists reported having noticed an increase in vision loss in chronic popper users in the United Kingdom, associated with the substitution of isopropyl nitrite.|$|E

5000|$|In {{friendly}} spirit, Vienna Circle's Otto Neurath nicknamed Karl <b>Popper,</b> {{a fellow}} philosopher in Vienna, the [...] "Official Opposition". [...] <b>Popper</b> asserted that {{any effort to}} verify a scientific theory, or even to inductively confirm a scientific law, was fundamentally misguided. [...] <b>Popper</b> asserted that although exemplary science not dogmatic, science inevitably relies on [...] "prejudices". <b>Popper</b> accepted Hume's criticism—the problem of induction—as making verification logically impossible. <b>Popper</b> accepted hypotheticodeductivism, sometimes termed it deductivism, but restricted it to denying the consequent, and thereby, refuting verificationism, reframed it as falsificationism. As to law or theory, <b>Popper</b> found confirmation of probable truth untenable, as any number confirmations is finite: empirical evidence approaching 0% probability of truth, as a universal law's predictive run is infinite. In fact, <b>Popper</b> found that a scientific theory is better if its truth is more improbable. [...] <b>Popper</b> asserted that logical positivism [...] "is defeated by its typically inductivist prejudice".|$|R

5000|$|Some other {{philosophers}} were critical. Walter Kaufmann {{believed that}} <b>Popper's</b> work has many virtues, including its attack against totalitarianism, and many suggestive ideas. However, {{he also found}} it to have serious flaws, writing that <b>Popper's</b> interpretations of Plato were flawed and that <b>Popper</b> had provided a [...] "comprehensive statement" [...] of older myths about Hegel. Kaufmann commented that despite <b>Popper's</b> hatred of totalitarianism, <b>Popper's</b> method was [...] "unfortunately {{similar to that of}} totalitarian 'scholars'". The Marxist author Maurice Cornforth defended Marxism against <b>Popper's</b> criticisms in his work The Open Philosophy and the Open Society: A Reply to Dr. Karl <b>Popper's</b> Refutations of Marxism (1968). Though disagreeing with <b>Popper,</b> Cornforth nevertheless called him [...] "perhaps the most eminent" [...] critic of Marxism. The philosopher Robert C. Solomon writes that <b>Popper</b> directs an [...] "almost wholly unjustified polemic" [...] against Hegel, one which has helped to give Hegel a reputation as a [...] "moral and political reactionary". The Marxist economist Ernest Mandel identifies The Open Society and Its Enemies as part of a literature, beginning with German social democrat Eduard Bernstein, that criticizes the dialectical method Marx borrowed from Hegel as [...] "useless", [...] "metaphysical", or [...] "mystifying." [...] He faults <b>Popper</b> and the other critics for their [...] "positivist narrowness".|$|R
