50|$|In {{oil field}} tubing, {{buttress}} thread is a <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> <b>form</b> {{designed to provide}} a tight hydraulic seal.

50|$|Outside the United States, some US <b>pipe</b> <b>threads</b> are found, {{as well as}} many British Standard <b>Pipe</b> <b>threads</b> and ISO 7-1, 7-2, 228-1, and 228-2 threads.|$|R
50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> compound, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process pipe joint is the butt weld. The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> in North America is the National <b>Pipe</b> <b>Thread</b> (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version. Other <b>pipe</b> <b>threads</b> include the British standard <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> (BSPT), the garden hose thread (GHT), and the fire hose coupling (NST).|$|R

5000|$|Thread {{seal tape}} (also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} sealing <b>pipe</b> <b>threads.</b> The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around <b>pipe</b> <b>threads.</b> It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape <b>form.</b> <b>Thread</b> seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|R

Based on {{the analysis of the}} sealing mechanism of <b>pipe</b> <b>thread,</b> the essence of the <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> loosening is caused by fretting damage and fatigue. The following three methods are used to reduce the damage: the processing requirements of internal and external screw thread tooth type and size will be improved；the deformations which are made by a screwing torque to the external thread of the material itself will fill the gap in each part after internal and external screw thread are screwed together;plasticity sealing filler are put between internal and external screw thread...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Failure of {{the drill}} <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> {{is always a}} very serious problem which may result in serious {{accidents}} and rework during the drilling of oil wells. Rupture crack of the drill <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> may result in great economic and labour losses, so they need to be inspected periodically. As the drill <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> is not a smooth surface and is in the end area of drill pipes, {{it is very difficult to}} be inspected by traditional Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods. According to the experiment results and the requirement of the working conditions in the field, a local MFL inspection method, which is the most adaptive inspection method, is determined. Laboratory testing and field experience show that this inspection method can detect the crack as small as 0. 6 mm (depth) in the thread root and thus reduces the risks of drilling failure. This local MFL inspection method can inspect flaws of the drill <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> that occur in practice exactly and quickly, and it has very wide application perspectives...|$|R

50|$|Pipe dope is any thread lubricant, {{thread sealing}} compound, and {{anaerobic}} chemical sealants {{that are used}} to make a <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> joint leak proof and pressure tight. Although common <b>pipe</b> <b>threads</b> are tapered and therefore will achieve an interference fit during proper assembly, machining and finishing variances usually result in a fit that does not result in 100 percent contact between the mating components. The application of pipe dope prior to assembly will fill the minute voids between the threads, thus making the joint pressure tight. Pipe dope also acts as a lubricant and helps prevent seizing of the mating parts, which can later cause difficulty during disassembly.|$|R
50|$|In machinery, the {{buttress}} <b>thread</b> <b>form</b> {{is designed}} to handle extremely high axial thrust in one direction. The load-bearing thread face is perpendicular to the screw axis. or at a slight slant (usually no greater than 7°) The other face is slanted, often at 45°. The resulting <b>thread</b> <b>form</b> has the same low friction properties as a square <b>thread</b> <b>form</b> but at about twice the shear strength due to the long thread base.
