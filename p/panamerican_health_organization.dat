We use secondary data from SABE, a survey on Health, Well-being and Aging administered in 2000 under the sponsorship of the <b>Panamerican</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Organization,</b> and representative of the elderly population in each of the analyzed cities. We construct concentration indices of access to and quality of healthcare services, and decompose them in socioeconomic, need, and non-need contributors. We assess the weight of each contributor to the overall index and compare indices across cities. Our results show high levels of pro-rich socioeconomic inequities in the use of preventive services in all cities, inequities in medical visits in Santiago and Montevideo, and inequities in quality of access to care in all cities but Montevideo. Socioeconomic inequality within private or public health systems explains a higher portion of inequalities in access to care than the fragmented nature of health systems.

40|$|Background: Major {{depression}} {{is one of}} the leading causes of disability worldwide, yet epidemiologic data are not available for many countries, particularly low- to middle-income countries. In this paper, we present data on the prevalence, impairment and demographic correlates of depression from 18 high and low- to middle-income countries in the World Mental Health Survey Initiative. Methods: Major depressive episodes (MDE) as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DMS-IV) were evaluated in face-to-face interviews using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Data from 18 countries were analyzed in this report (n = 89, 037). All countries surveyed representative, population-based samples of adults. Results: The average lifetime and 12 -month prevalence estimates of DSM-IV MDE were 14. 6 % and 5. 5 % in the ten high-income and 11. 1 % and 5. 9 % in the eight low- to middle-income countries. The average age of onset ascertained retrospectively was 25. 7 in the high-income and 24. 0 in low- to middle-income countries. Functional impairment was associated with recency of MDE. The female: male ratio was about 2 : 1. In high-income countries, younger age was associated with higher 12 -month prevalence; by contrast, in several low- to middle-income countries, older age was associated with greater likelihood of MDE. The strongest demographic correlate in high-income countries was being separated from a partner, and in low- to middle-income countries, was being divorced or widowed. Conclusions: MDE is a significant public-health concern across all regions of the world and is strongly linked to social conditions. Future research is needed to investigate the combination of demographic risk factors that are most strongly associated with MDE in the specific countries included in the WMH.

This study addresses to {{the theme}} of humanization in health care, which {{has been part of the}} political agenda of health in Brazil since 2003. The National Humanization Policy (NHP) coincides with the very principles of the public Brazilian Health System (SUS), highlighting the need of securing full attention in health care for the population as well as strategies to increase people???s conditions to rights and citizenship. Such policy is based on the principles of transverseness and indissolubility between the attention and the management, and the leading role, co-responsibility and autonomy of the individuals and the collective involved in the process of producing health. The present study had the objective of debating the practices in the humanization of primary health care in the public Brazilian health system (SUS) under the three principles of the National Humanization Policy (NHP). In order to achieve such a goal, we have done a systematic review of the literature followed by a Meta-Synthesis using the following databases: BDENF- Nursing database, BDTD- Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, BVS- Theme area of Humanization, BVS-Psi-Brasil- Virtual Library in Psychology and Health, CATHEDRA- Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations of UNESP, CINAHL- Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, DEDALUS- Global- S??o Paulo University???s Library Integrated System, LILACS- Latin-American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences, LUME- Digital Repository of Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, MEDLINE- International Literature in Health Sciences, PAHO- <b>Panamerican</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Organization</b> Library, PubMed- U.

Included herein were articles of research, case studies, reports of experiences, dissertations, theses, and book chapters, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, published from the beginning of the policy; hence, from 2003 to 2011. Each study was read, and the main characteristics were arranged in a tool for the collection of data. We included 40 studies form the 4. 127 publications found on the subject. As results of the Meta-Synthesis, three main categories were identified: the first one referring to the organization and infrastructure of primary health care; the second one encompasses the work process in primary health care; and the third one being about the technologies of relations. Meta-Synthesis can be considered an essential tool for one to experience the humanization practices in primary health care, which put in perspective the need for user, professionals, and managers to make even bigger efforts as to the implementation of NHP in Strategies for Family health and Health Centers as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Background: Community and {{clinical}} data have suggested {{there is an}} association between trauma exposure and suicidal behavior (i. e., suicide ideation, plans and attempts). However, few studies have assessed which traumas are uniquely predictive of: the first onset of suicidal behavior, the progression from suicide ideation to plans and attempts, or the persistence of each form of suicidal behavior over time. Moreover, few data are available on such associations in developing countries. The current study addresses each of these issues. Methodology/Principal Findings: Data on trauma exposure and subsequent first onset of suicidal behavior were collected via structured interviews conducted in the households of 102, 245 (age 18 +) respondents from 21 countries participating in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. Bivariate and multivariate survival models tested {{the relationship between the}} type and number of traumatic events and subsequent suicidal behavior. A range of traumatic events are associated with suicidal behavior, with sexual and interpersonal violence consistently showing the strongest effects. There is a dose-response relationship between the number of traumatic events and suicide ideation/attempt; however, there is decay in the strength of the association with more events. Although a range of traumatic events are associated with the onset of suicide ideation, fewer events predict which people with suicide ideation progress to suicide plan and attempt, or the persistence of suicidal behavior over time. Associations generally are consistent across high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides more detailed information than previously available on the relationship between traumatic events and suicidal behavior and indicates that this association is fairly consistent across developed and developing countries. These data reinforce the importance of psychological trauma as a major public health problem, and highlight the significance of screening for the presence and accumulation of traumatic exposures as a risk factor for suicide ideation and attempt.

40|$|Background: Associations between {{lifetime}} {{traumatic event}} (LTE) exposures and subsequent physical ill-health are well established {{but it has}} remained unclear whether these are explained by PTSD or other mental disorders. This study examined this question and investigated whether associations varied by type and number of LTEs, across physical condition outcomes, or across countries. Methods: Cross-sectional, face-to-face household surveys of adults (18 +) were conducted in 14 countries (n = 38, 051). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed lifetime LTEs and DSM-IV mental disorders. Chronic physical conditions were ascertained by self-report of physician's diagnosis and year of diagnosis or onset. Survival analyses estimated associations between the number and type of LTEs with the subsequent onset of 11 physical conditions, with and without adjustment for mental disorders. Findings: A dose-response association was found between increasing number of LTEs and odds of any physical condition onset (OR 1. 5 [95 % CI: 1. 4 – 1. 5] for 1 LTE; 2. 1 [2. 0 – 2. 3] for 5 + LTEs), independent of all mental disorders. Associations did not vary greatly by type of LTE (except for combat and other war experience), nor across countries. A history of 1 LTE was associated with 7 / 11 of the physical conditions (ORs 1. 3 [1. 2 – 1. 5] to 1. 7 [1. 4 – 2. 0]) {{and a history of}} 5 + LTEs was associated with 9 / 11 physical conditions (ORs 1. 8 [1. 3 – 2. 4] to 3. 6 [2. 0 – 6. 5]), the exceptions being cancer and stroke. Conclusions: Traumatic events are associated with adverse downstream effects on physical health, independent of PTSD and other mental disorders. Although the associations are modest they have public health implications due to the high prevalence of traumatic events and the range of common physical conditions affected. The effects of traumatic stress are a concern for all medical professionals and researchers, not just mental health specialists.
