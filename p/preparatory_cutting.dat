50|$|<b>Preparatory</b> <b>cuttings</b> are sometimes, but not always, {{the first}} step in a shelterwood {{regeneration}} system. The purpose of this cut is to remove species that are not desired so that they do not contribute seeds to the establishment cut. If this is not a problem, the preparatory cut is not necessary. When discussing desired and undesired tree species, foresters are combining their knowledge of the landowner's preferences with their education in the ecology of the trees in their area. A landowner may prefer oaks because they produce acorns that feed wildlife, or may prefer one species over another because it has a longer lifespan and tends to occur in mature forests. Most species can be desired in one place and undesired in another depending on the landowner's goals.|$|R
