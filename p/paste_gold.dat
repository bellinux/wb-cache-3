5000|$|The Wat's main {{architectural}} depiction is a 32 m high, 10 m wide standing statue {{referred to}} as Luang Pho To or [...] "Phra Si Ariyamettrai" [...] (Maitreya). Building the Buddha statue was started in 1867 and it took sixty more years to complete it in 1927. The image is made of brick and stucco. Ajon Toh, the then Abbott of the temple was the inspiration to build it. He died {{at the foot of}} the image in 1871 when it was being built. A gilded bust of this abbot is enshrined at the temple entrance. The Buddha image is carrying bowl and stairways at the sides to the back behind the statue provides access for devotees to <b>paste</b> <b>gold</b> leaf on the statue. The image is called Luang Phor To. In 1982 during 200th anniversary of the establishment of Bangkok city the image was refurbished and fitted with Italian golden mosaic tile. The statue which is decorated in glass mosaics tiles is gilded with 24-carat gold. The topknot, called ushnisha, of the Buddha statue contains a relic of Gautama Buddha that was given as a gift by the Government of Sri Lanka. The enshrinement of the relic in the ushnisha was done by Prince Vajiralongkorn, the knot was placed in 1978. In 1982, during 200th anniversary of the establishment of Bangkok city, the image was refurbished and fitted with Italian golden mosaic tiles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Solder joints are {{critical}} to the reliability of circuit boards. If gold is introduced to the solder joint, brittle AuSn 4 intermetallic compounds develop which affect reliability of that solder joint. To {{determine the effects of}} gold when dissolved into a non-lead solder joint, a process was developed in order to apply gold content onto SAC 305 solder <b>paste.</b> The <b>gold</b> was transferred as a paste from a micropipette onto each individual solder bump. This process was designed to apply a range of gold content from 1. 0 wt. % to 10 wt. % to each individual solder joint. The test board vehicle designed for the <b>gold</b> <b>paste</b> application integrated three different types of components; SOP- 14, chip resistors and QFN packages. Four trial runs were conducted to assess the quality and determine viability of this process. The first runs failed because the paste was not viscous enough. The second run attempted to test the process at 1. 0 wt. % Au but failed because the components floated off their pads. The third and fourth tests attempted to apply <b>gold</b> <b>paste</b> at 1. 0 wt. % Au and then at 10 wt. % Au, this resulted in the correct component positioning on the test board. The Au wt. % was not verified and needs further inspection to determine whether the process was successful or not. The results from the 1. 0 wt. % Au solder joints indicated that the <b>gold</b> <b>paste</b> was successfully applied to leads spaced far apart. The components placed on a 10 wt. % Au solder joint, drifted off center shorting leads together resulting in unknown gold concentrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} behaviour of acidic {{and neutral}} pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) was studied by cyclic voltammetry and pulse voltammetric techniques on mercury, carbon nanotube paste, carbon <b>paste</b> and <b>gold</b> electrodes. The best results, {{in terms of}} sensitivity, linearity range and detection limits, were obtained by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) for ofloxacin (LOD 5. 2 mu M), differential pulse polarography (DPP) for clofibric acid (LOD 4. 7 mu M) and normal pulse voltammetry (NPV) for diclofenac (LOD 0. 8 mu M) and propranolol (LOD 0. 5 mu M). An enrichment step of approximately two orders of magnitude was performed by a solid-phase extraction procedure (SPE) in order to concentrate the samples. The developed method was optimized and tested on spiked river water samples. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|Indelibly Stamped is {{the second}} album by the English rock band Supertramp, {{released}} in 1971. It marked {{a dramatic change in}} direction to a more straightforward rock sound, and by admission of the band's own liner notes, [...] "Travelled" [...] is the only song with any resemblance to their debut album. Like their debut, this album was a commercial failure upon release, but in later decades it went gold in France and Canada. Original editions have a colour gate-fold cover and different text for the band name and album title. The cover photograph features the tattooed torso and arms of a topless woman.

60|$|In {{other rooms}} {{artisans}} {{are at work}} upon various tasks of marqueterie,--table-tops, album-covers, paper-weights, brooches, pins and the like,--and in others they are sawing the smalts and glass into strips, and grinding the edges. Passing through yet another room, where the finished mosaic-works--of course not the pictorial mosaics--are polished by machinery, we enter the store-room, where the crowded shelves display blocks of smalts and glass of endless variety of color. By far the greater number of these colors are discoveries or improvements of the venerable mosaicist Lorenzo Radi, who has found again the Byzantine secrets of counterfeiting, in vitreous <b>paste,</b> aventurine (<b>gold</b> stone), onyx, chalcedony, malachite, and other natural stones, and who has been praised by the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice for producing mosaics even more durable in tint and workmanship {{than those of the}} Byzantine artists.|$|R

There was a great hunting up of old ribbons and finery, much cutting and <b>pasting</b> of <b>gold</b> paper, and the most {{remarkable}} quantity of straw, gray cotton, flannel, and big black beads, used by Franz and Mrs. Jo. Ned hammered at strange machines in the workshop, Demi and Tommy went about murmuring to themselves as if learning something. A fearful racket was heard in Emil's room at intervals, and peals of laughter from the nursery when Rob and Teddy were sent for and hidden from sight whole hours at a time. But the thing that puzzled Mr. Bhaer the most was what became of Rob's big pumpkin. It had been borne in triumph to the kitchen, where a dozen golden-tinted pies soon after appeared. It would not have taken {{more than a quarter of}} the mammoth vegetable to make them, yet where was the rest? It disappeared, and Rob never seemed to care, only chuckled when it was mentioned, and told his father, [...] "To wait and see," [...] for the fun of the whole thing was to surprise Father Bhaer at the end, and not let him know a bit about what was to happen.|$|R
40|$|Here {{we compare}} the {{electrochemical}} properties of a porous 10 mol. % Gd-doped CeO 2 (GDC) anode {{with those of}} the same material, but infiltrated with a new plasma spray synthesized 10 mol. % Mo-doped CeO 2 nano material (nCMO), all at 600 - 800 oC in H 2, with and without added 10 ppm H 2 S. While both of these anode materials exhibit very good H 2 oxidation activity, their performance does deteriorate when exposed to H 2 S. However, the nCMO-infiltrated GDC anode is significantly more stable and shows much better sulfur tolerance than the single-phase GDC anode. Furthermore, the response of both anodes is reversible, at least in early exposures, and the original H 2 oxidation activity is regained fully when H 2 S is removed from the fuel stream. At low temperatures (ca. 500 oC), these anode materials, contacted to a <b>gold</b> <b>paste</b> current collector, exhibit a dramatic response to H 2 S, making them of potential use as a H 2 S sensor...|$|R
40|$|The {{metallization}} of {{low temperature}} co-fired ceramic (LTCC) is typically done with commercially available silver or <b>gold</b> <b>pastes</b> using conventional screen printing processes. However, for some {{applications such as}} substrate integrated waveguides and high performance planar components where the metallization of vertical side walls is required, screen printing is difficult to apply. In such cases, electroless plating of copper can be employed to metallize the fired LTCC, which {{would also be a}} promising alternative to the high cost metals such as Ag and Au. In this study, electroless copper plating was combined with KrF excimer laser machining to deposit selective copper patterns on fired LTCC. Using this approach, a functional circuit was fabricated and electrically tested. The mask projection technique of the excimer laser can be used to create complex patterns on LTCC and initial work has been carried out to realize planar passive component layouts, including a capacitor and an inductor. The minimum feature size of the deposited copper that could be achieved in these designs was below 50 μm...|$|R
40|$|Cells are {{electrically}} active, thus {{fabrication of}} a cell-based biosensor will contribute much {{information about how}} cells respond to different environments. With such a device, researchers can submit various types of cells to different forms of stimulus and observe their reaction.

Next, sea urchin eggs were used. These eggs are larger and more robust than most cells. A device containing channels with two pure gold electrodes covered with a thin insulating layer of Teflon was constructed. A small portion of the Teflon removed over each electrode provides the necessary small area needed for an electrode that is used to measure the electrical activity of cells.

40|$|Gold thick {{films have}} been {{characterized}} by means of cyclic voltammetry in nitric acid and are compared with a pure gold electrode. Surface reconstruction and roughening is found for all electrodes, whereby the pure gold reference sample rapidly exhibits stationary behavior. In contrast, the screen-printed electrodes show a permanent linear increase of the gold surface area {{as measured by the}} charge densities for gold oxidation, which is connected with the dissolution of glass-ceramic compounds. Oxides of bismuth and copper and their aluminates are regularly used to adjust the morphology of thick films and to enhance the adhesion of screen-printed layers. Electrochemical reactions of both elements (Bi, Cu) are detected. An in-house produced <b>gold</b> <b>paste</b> free of these oxides was used for comparison and shows a linear increase in oxidation charge density as well. Cu and Bi compounds take part in the electrochemical reaction and accelerate the surface increase. The dissolution of glass-ceramic components from the surface and at the interface between thick film and substrate is revealed in FESEM images of the electrodes and at cross-sections. A model is set up for the electrochemically induced localized degradation of the thick films, which are attacked at the boundary layer to the electrolyte and the glass-ceramic interface between the LTCC substrate and gold layers...|$|R
30|$|Overall, all hybrid films {{showed some}} {{improvement}} in conductivity compared to PEDOT:PTS alone, which suggests a low contact resistance between elements. To evaluate the conductivity {{as a function}} of rGO concentration, a method employing a scanning probe microscope (SPM) was used. In this measurement, an SPM equipped with a diamond-tip cantilever was used to measure the electrical conductivity of six different hybrid films. The electrical contact {{on the other side of}} the film was fabricated with a conducting <b>gold</b> <b>paste.</b> Figure  7 (II) shows the differences in the current–voltage (I-V) characteristics of the six hybrid films. All I-V curves exhibited exponential increases until they saturated at the full-scale current of 0.7  mA. These curves represent typical I-V traces obtained reproducibly, depending on the electrical states of the films. As a result, PEDOT:PTS films hybridized with rGO showed a greater current response with increasing bias than the pure PEDOT:PTS film [Figure  7 (II), curve (a)]. The greatest current response was observed in the sample with a rGO concentration of 0.025 % (w/w), as shown in Figure  7 (II), curve (d). On the other hand, in the samples with rGO loadings of 0.05 % and 0.1 % (w/w), the current response was reduced, the same trend present in the behavior of the carrier concentration/sheet resistance shown in Figure  7 (I).|$|R
40|$|We have {{reported}} SiC integrated circuits (IC's) with {{two levels of}} metal interconnect that have demonstrated prolonged operation for thousands of hours at their intended peak ambient operational temperature of 500 C [1, 2]. However, it is recognized that testing of semiconductor microelectronics at temperatures above their designed operating envelope is vital to qualification. Towards this end, we previously reported operation of a 4 H-SiC JFET IC ring oscillator on an initial fast thermal ramp test through 727 C [3]. However, this thermal ramp was not ended until a peak temperature of 880 C (well beyond failure) was attained. Further experiments are necessary to better understand failure mechanisms and upper temperature limit of this extreme-temperature capable 4 H-SiC IC technology. Here we report on additional experimental testing of custom-packaged 4 H-SiC JFET IC devices at temperatures above 500 C. In one test, the temperature was ramped and then held at 727 C, and the devices were periodically measured until electrical failure was observed. A 4 H-SiC JFET on this chip electrically functioned with little change for around 25 hours at 727 C before rapid increases in device resistance caused failure. In a second test, devices from our next generation 4 H-SiC JFET ICs were ramped up and then held at 700 C (which is below the maximum deposition temperature of the dielectrics). Three ring oscillators functioned for 8 hours at this temperature before degradation. In a third experiment, an alternative die attach of <b>gold</b> <b>paste</b> and package lid was used, and logic circuit operation was demonstrated for 143. 5 hours at 700 C...|$|R
