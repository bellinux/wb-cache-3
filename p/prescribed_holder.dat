40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} functions {{represented by}} series ∑g∈Gcgψ(g− 1 (x)) of wavelet-type, where G {{is a group}} generated by affine functions L 1,…,Ln and ψ is piecewise affine. By means of those functions we characterize the class of self-affine fractal functions, previously studied by Barnsley et al. We compute their global and local Hölder exponents and investigate points of non-differentiability. Wavelet-representations for various continuous nowhere differentiable and singular functions are presented. Another application is the construction of functions with <b>prescribed</b> local <b>Hölder</b> exponents at each point...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this course, we {{give the}} basics of the part of multifractal theory that intersects wavelet theory. We start by characterizing the pointwise Hölder exponents by some decay rates of wavelet coefficients. Then, we give some {{examples}} of wavelet series having a multifractal behavior, and we explain how to build wavelet series with <b>prescribed</b> pointwise <b>Hölder</b> exponents. Next we develop the problematics of mul-tifractal formalism, going from the intuitive formula by Frisch and Parisi to explicit and exploitable formulas. We prove that " multifractals are everywhere ", {{in the sense that}} typical functions in Besov spaces or typical measures are multifractal in the sense of Baire's categories. We finish by some well-known examples of multifractal wavelet series, random and deterministic, focusing on the influence of certain adaptive threshold procedures to the multifractal properties of signals...|$|R
40|$|Using {{structures}} of Abstract Wiener Spaces, we define a fractional Brownian field indexed by a product space (0, 1 / 2] × L 2 (T, m), (T, m) a separable measure space, {{where the first}} coordinate corresponds to the Hurst parameter of fractional Brow-nian motion. This field encompasses a large class of existing fractional Brownian processes, such as Lévy fractional Brownian motions and multiparameter fractional Brownian motions, and provides a setup for new ones. We prove that it has satis-factory incremental variance in both coordinates and derive certain continuity and Hölder regularity properties in relation with metric entropy. Also, a sharp estimate of the small ball probabilities is provided, generalizing a result on Lévy fractional Brownian motion. Then, we apply these general results to multiparameter and set-indexed processes, proving the existence of processes with <b>prescribed</b> local <b>Hölder</b> regularity on general indexing collections...|$|R

25|$|The Companies Act, 1913 {{passed in}} pre-independent India {{prescribed}} various books {{which had to}} be maintained by a Company registered under that Act. It also required the appointment of a formal Auditor with prescribed qualifications to audit such records. In order to act as an auditor a person had to acquire a restricted certificate from the local government upon such conditions as may be <b>prescribed.</b> The <b>holder</b> of a restricted certificate was allowed to practice only within the province of issue and in the language specified in the restricted certificate. In 1918 a course called Government Diploma in Accountancy was launched in Bombay (now known as Mumbai). On passing this diploma and completion of three years of articled training under an approved accountant, a person was held eligible for grant of an unrestricted certificate. This certificate entitled the holder to practice as an auditor throughout India. Later on the issue of restricted certificates was discontinued in the year 1920.|$|R
