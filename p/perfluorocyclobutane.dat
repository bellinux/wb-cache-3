40|$|International audienceThe {{electronic}} state spectroscopy of <b>perfluorocyclobutane</b> (c-C 4 F 8) {{has been}} investigated using high resolution vacuum ultraviolet (vuv) photoabsorption spectroscopy in the energy range 6. 0 11 eV. The electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) was also recorded in the nonelectric dipolar interaction mode (100 eV incident energy, 10 ° scattering angle) over the 8 14 eV energy-loss range and the excited states in the 11 14 eV spectral region have been observed. An HeI photoelectron spectrum recorded between 11. 0 and 19. 8 eV is compared with earlier lower resolution results. This has allowed us to derive a more precise value of 12. 291 ± 0. 002 eV for the ground neutral state vertical ionization energy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} siloxane-containing <b>perfluorocyclobutane</b> (PFCB) aromatic polyethers, {{a new class}} of fluorosiloxane polymers possessing a well-defined linear structure of alternating disiloxanyl-p-phenylene (cis/trans) - 1, 2 -disubstituted perfluorocyclobutyl ether linkages with known fluoroolefin end groups, is described. The unexpected formation of an aryl Grignard reagent from 4 -[(trifluorovinyl) oxy]bromobenzene (2) allowed for the high-yield synthesis of 4 -[(trifluorovinyl) oxy]-phenyldimethylsilane (3) which was dehydrogenatively hydrolyzed in situ and condensed to bis[1, 3 -[4 -[(trifluorovinyl) oxy]phenyl]]- 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyldisiloxane monomer (4). Thermal cyclopolymerization in the bulk produces poly(1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyldisiloxanyl-p-phenylene- 1 -oxaperfluorocyclobutylene- 2 -oxa-p-phenylene) (5) as a clear, flexible, and thermally stable elastomeric film. Copolymerization of 4 with a trifunctional PFCB monomer gives a toughened thermoset with good thermal stability. Monomers and polymers were characterized by 1 H, 13 C, and 19 F NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Number-average molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography and, when possible, quantitative 19 F NMR end group analysis. Synthesis, characterization, thermal analyses, and current scope of PFCB polymer chemistry are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two general topics; {{vibrational}} excitation of gas phase molecules using cw CO_ 2 laser radiation (Chapters II and III) and stabilization of chemically activated species by infrared radiative emission (Chapters IV-VI). Chapter I is a brief introduction to the topics discussed in Chapters II- VI. Multiphoton dissociation of molecules is observed using low intensity (1 - 100 W cm^(- 2)) cw CO_ 2 laser radiation. Ion cyclotron resonance techniques allow gas phase ions to be stored and irradiated for times approaching several seconds prior to mass analysis. Chapter II describes multiphoton dissociation of ions derived from diethyl ether [(C_ 2 H_ 5) _ 2 O] while Chapter III describes multiphoton dissociation of C_ 3 F_ 6 ^+ from perfluoropropylene (C_ 3 F_ 6). Energy fluence thresholds and cross-sections for multiphoton dissociation measured using low intensity radiation qualitatively agree with similar measurements using megawatt pulsed infrared lasers. For all ions which photodissociate only the lowest activation energy process is observed. Effects of bimolecular interactions, varying laser intensity, and laser wavelength on photodissociation probabilities are explored. At high pressures collisions are observed to deactivate vibrationally excited ions. At low pressures, however, C_ 3 F_ 6 ^+ photodissociation is enhanced by collisions. The consequences of collisional enhancement of multiphoton absorption are discussed. ICR techniques are uniquely suited for studying ion-molecule reactions under nearly collisionless conditions. Chapters IV and V discuss direct association reactions of Li^+ with (C_ 2 H_ 5) _ 2 CO, CH_ 3 COC_ 2 H_ 5, (CH_ 3) _ 2 CO, (CD_ 3) _ 2 CO, CH_ 3 CHO, and H_ 2 CO at pressures low enough (< 10 ^(- 6) Torr) to preclude collisional stabilization of the chemically activated adduct. The stabilization mechanism is assumed to be via infrared emission, and calculated attachment rates are in good agreement with experiment. In experiments similar to those described above, rates of direct electron attachment to C_ 6 F_ 6 (perfluorobenzene), C_ 7 F_ 8 (perfluorotoluene), c-C_ 4 F_ 8 (<b>perfluorocyclobutane),</b> and C_ 7 F_(14) (perfluoromethylcyclohexane) are measured at low pressure by ICR techniques. Rate constants measured by ICR are found to be one to two orders of magnitudes smaller than high pressure swarm measurements. The results are discussed in terms of radiative stabilization at low pressure versus collisional stabilization at high pressure. Combination of data from time-of-flight, electron beam-swarm, and ICR experiments allows estimates of infrared radiative lifetimes to be made. These fall in the range 0. 4 - 3. 0 msec, which are typical of infrared radiative processes. Data are also presented for dissociative electron attachment of CCl_ 4. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of mechanically active functional groups (mechanophores) to polymer scaffolds {{has resulted in}} new chemical transformations and materials properties. The novel functions in these polymers are achieved {{in response to a}} universal input: mechanical force. This dissertation describes studies that expand our ability to elicit and modify chemical reactivity through the application of force (mechanochemistry), both through fundamental studies of mechanochemical coupling and through the synthesis and characterization of new mechanophores. In order to probe mechanochemical coupling, single molecule force spectroscopy was used to directly quantify and compare the forces associated with the ring opening of gem -dibromo and gem -dichlorocyclopropanes (g DBCs and g DCCs) affixed along the backbone of cis -polynorbornene (PNB) and cis -polybutadiene (PB). At a tip velocity of 0. 3 μ sec - 1, the isomerization of g DBC-PNB, g DCC-PNB, g DBC-PB, and g DCC-PB to their respective 2, 3 -dihaloalkenes occurs at 740, 900, 1210 and 1330 pN, respectively. In contrast to their relative importance in determining the rates of the thermal g DHC ring openings, the polymer backbone has much greater impact on g DHC mechanochemistry than does the halogen. The root of the effect lies in more efficient chemomechanical coupling through the PNB backbone, which acts as a phenomenological lever with greater mechanical advantage than the PB backbone. The ability to affect the reactivity of a mechanophore by polymer backbone manipulation provides a previously underappreciated means to tailor mechanochemical response. The experimental results are supported computationally and provide the foundation for a new strategy by which to engineer mechanical reactivity. The ability to increase the reactivity of mechanophores by changing their polymer scaffold can lead to the realization of mechanically-induced transformations that were otherwise inaccessible. To probe this increased mechanophore reactivity, epoxidized polybutadiene and epoxidized polynorbornene were subjected to pulsed ultrasound in the presence of small molecules capable of being trapped by carbonyl ylides. When epoxidized polybutadiene was sonicated, there was no observable small molecule addition to the polymer. Concurrently, no appreciable isomerization (cis to trans epoxide) was observed, indicating that the epoxide rings along the backbone are not mechanically active under the experimental conditions employed. In contrast, when epoxidized polynorbornene was subjected to the same conditions, both {{addition of}} ylide trapping reagents and net isomerization of cis to trans epoxide were observed. The results demonstrate the mechanical activity of epoxides, show that mechanophore activity is determined not only by the functional group but also the polymer backbone in which it is embedded, and facilitate a characterization of the reactivity of the ring opened dialkyl epoxide. Commercially available fluorinated polymers were also investigated as previously unrealized mechanophore-bearing polymers and as candidates for thermally re-mendable materials by examining their response to applied stress. <b>Perfluorocyclobutane</b> (PFCB) polymer solutions were subjected to pulsed ultrasound, leading to mechanically induced chain scission and molecular weight degradation. 19 F NMR revealed that the new, mechanically generated end groups are trifluorovinyl ethers formed by cycloreversion of the PFCB groups- a process that differs from thermal degradation pathways. One consequence of the mechanochemical process is that the trifluorovinyl ether end groups can be re-mended simply by subjecting the polymer solution to the original polymerization conditions, i. e., heating to > 150 °C. Stereochemical changes in the PFCBs, in combination with radical trapping experiments, indicate that PFCB scission proceeds via a stepwise mechanism with a 1, 4 -diradical intermediate, offering a potential mechanism for localized functionalization and cross-linking in regions of high stress.
