5|$|New Jersey's {{drinking}} age {{was lowered}} to 18 in 1973 {{as part of}} a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a <b>private</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{participants}} in a LARP physically portray characters in a fictional setting, improvising their characters' speech and movements somewhat like actors in improvisational theatre. This is distinct from tabletop role-playing games, where character actions are described verbally. LARPs may be played in a public or <b>private</b> <b>area</b> and may last for hours or days. There is usually no audience. Players may dress as their character and carry appropriate equipment, and the environment is sometimes decorated to resemble the setting. LARPs can be one-off events or {{a series of events}} in the same setting, and events can vary in size from a handful of players to several thousand.|$|E
5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own <b>private</b> <b>area,</b> each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
25|$|The age {{of consent}} in Wisconsin is 18 {{and there is}} no close-in-age {{exception}}. There is, however, a marital exception which allows a person to have sex with a minor 16 or older if they are married to the minor. If the minor is below 16 both sexual intercourse and any sexual contact are a felony; sexual intercourse with a minor 16-17 by a perpetrator who is not married to the minor is a Class A misdemeanor. However, Wisconsin has a child enticement law that prohibits people of any age from taking people under 18 to a <b>private</b> <b>area</b> such as a room and exposing a sex organ to them or having the minor expose their sex organ to them. This is a Class B or C felony.|$|E

25|$|A {{wife was}} also {{seen as being}} of high value, and was therefore, usually, {{carefully}} looked after. Early nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as beena, in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession (specifically, Jael, Sarah, and Jacob's wives). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own <b>private</b> <b>area</b> to which men were not permitted; {{in the case of}} wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} faces south west over Cardiff Bay, {{it has a}} glass façade {{around the}} entire building and is dominated by a steel roof and wood ceiling. It has three floors, {{the first and second}} floors are accessible to the public and the ground floor is a <b>private</b> <b>area</b> for officials. The building was designed to be as open and accessible as possible, the architects, the Richard Rogers Partnership (RRP) said [...] "The building was not to be an insular, closed edifice. Rather it would be a transparent envelope, looking outwards to Cardiff Bay and beyond, making visible {{the inner workings of the}} Assembly and encouraging public participation in the democratic process." [...] The main area in the building is the debating chamber, called the Siambr, including a public viewing gallery. Other areas of the building are the Neuadd, which is the main reception area on the first floor and the Oriel on the second floor. The three committee rooms and the Cwrt are on the ground floor.|$|E
500|$|Goffman {{describes}} the theatrical performances {{that occur in}} face-to-face interactions. He holds that when an individual comes in contact with another person, he attempts to control or guide {{the impression that the}} other person will form of him, by altering his own setting, appearance and manner. [...] At the same time, the person that the individual is interacting with attempts to form an impression of, and obtain information about, the individual. Goffman also believes that participants in social interactions engage in certain practices to avoid embarrassing themselves or others. Society is not homogeneous; we must act differently in different settings. This recognition led Goffman to his dramaturgical analysis. He saw a connection between the kinds of [...] "acts" [...] that people put on in their daily lives and theatrical performances. In a social interaction, as in a theatrical performance, there is an onstage area where actors (individuals) appear before the audience; this is where positive self-concepts and desired impressions are offered. But there is, as well, a backstage – a hidden, <b>private</b> <b>area</b> where individuals can be themselves and drop their societal roles and identities.|$|E

500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The <b>private</b> <b>area</b> of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what {{has been described as}} a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the front door to talk to people, but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|E

The United States enacted the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 to punish those who intentionally capture an individual's <b>private</b> <b>areas</b> without consent, when the person knew the subject had an expectation of privacy.

2500|$|Relatives {{gathered}} at Las Américas International Airport. The airport created a <b>private</b> <b>area</b> for relatives wishing to receive news about Flight 587.

Kennedy International Airport used the JFK Ramada Plaza to house relatives {{and friends of the}} victims of the crash. Because of its role in housing friends and relatives of several plane crashes, the hotel became known as the [...] "Heartbreak Hotel". Due to the fact that many families were ethnic Dominicans, the hotel prepared Dominican cuisine for them. The family crisis center later moved to the Javits Center in Manhattan.|$|E

On 6 May [...] 2008, he was released after his sentence was cut in half and further 18 days were remitted due to a government plan to reduce overcrowding. He also had another 2 days off for being in police custody (after serving just over 4 weeks of a 14-week sentence). He described prison life as [...] "a lot of gangsters and Radio 4" [...] and showed a certificate confirming he had passed a drugs test while inside.|$|E
2500|$|María Segovia, {{the elder}} sister of Darío Segovia, {{became known as}} [...] (the Mayoress) for her {{organizational}} skills and outspokenness. As the families became more organized, the government took steps to provide some comforts, eventually providing a more <b>private</b> <b>area</b> for the relatives to avoid constant interrogation by the energetic press corps. Infrastructure such as a kitchen, canteen area, sanitary facilities and security were later added. Bulletin boards sprouted up and the local government established shuttle bus stops. Over time a school house and children's play zones were built while volunteers worked to help feed the families. Clowns entertained the children and organizations provided emotional and spiritual comfort to the waiting families. Police and soldiers were brought in from Santiago to help maintain order and security with some patrolling the desert perimeter on horseback. In many respects the camp gradually grew into a small city.|$|E

However, one reporter, Mark Schierbecker, the same videographer from the November Melissa Click incident, refused, and justified his refusal to leave by saying the unreserved room was a [...] "limited public forum" [...] that was open to students {{and that he was}} a reporter on assignment and it was his [...] "personal preference" [...] to stay. Despite the meeting taking place on campus property, the group continued to ask him to leave, and eventually threatened to call campus police.
