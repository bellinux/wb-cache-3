50|$|The long {{wheelbase}} {{meant that the}} facing <b>point</b> <b>locking</b> <b>bars</b> on the line had to be lengthened. It went into service in April or May 1907, and the rail motor gradually took {{up the majority of}} the passenger traffic, and by July 1907 was working the ordinary passenger trains four days per week, at a daily saving of £3 6s 6d.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{before this}} generational change, a <b>Lock</b> <b>Bar</b> Stabilizer (or LBS) {{was added to}} prevent 'hyperextension' of the {{titanium}} <b>lock</b> <b>bar.</b> While this change is {{commonly referred to as}} part of the second generation Umnumzaan, there are a few models made in early-mid 2012 which have both the old pivot brushing and the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> stabilizer, although these are relatively rare.|$|R

50|$|Ceramic ball {{integrated}} into integral <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> - Also introduced as a {{feature in the}} Umnumzaan, the ceramic ball embedded into {{the end of the}} <b>lock</b> <b>bar,</b> creating the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm surface. The ball doubles to drop into a mating detent on the blade to ensure that the blade does not open accidentally.|$|R
2500|$|Since the 2008 introduction, the Umnumzaan {{has seen}} several {{incremental}} improvements and one generational change. These changes {{have all been}} minor and very few visual changes have occurred since initial introduction. Around 2011, changes to the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> were made to make engaging the lock with one hand easier (through making the bottom portion of the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> slightly more flared, which was a common request voiced by owners on various knife forums).|$|R

50|$|Patented in 1912, the lockrod {{was first}} used to secure {{railroad}} boxcar doors. Today, sometimes confused with <b>locking</b> <b>bars</b> or <b>bar</b> <b>locks,</b> lockrods have evolved to secure virtually every trailer or container that has a swing door (a door that swings open and closed rather than rolls up). Roll up doors are sometimes used in place of swing doors on some trailers that make shorter haul deliveries.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent {{investigation}} and litigation {{established that the}} derailment was caused by an undetected, fractured heel block in a switch. The fracture then propagated through several bolt holes. A contributing factor was a <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> that had been missing for approximately a year.|$|R

50|$|A Tantalus {{is a type}} {{of drinks}} {{decanter}} stand in which the bottle stoppers are clamped down by a <b>locked</b> <b>bar,</b> as a means of preventing servants from stealing the master's liquor. The decanters are clearly visible but the liquor is out of reach.|$|R
50|$|The {{lack of a}} <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> on many Weaver-type {{accessories}} also lends {{to another}} alignment issue: Canting. Though this problem is not common {{it can be very}} problematic especially with scopes. Because scopes need to be mounted to a rifle in perfect parallel to the barrel and to ensure the cross hairs sit exactly where a bullet will go (POI), a small variation of even ¼ of one degree can cause massive problems at longer ranges. The <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> holds the mount in a perfect 90 degree to the rail system where as a non-locking bar system can cant to the left or right. This canting (sometimes called jamming of surfaces) is caused by not matching the clamping surface perfectly to the rail. When tightened down, stress exerted on the base can cause the scope to be off from the POI by as much as several feet at 100-200 yards and gets progressively worse the farther out the range goes. Lower grade materials used in manufacturing of scope bases, inconsistent design tolerances from one manufacturer to another and other factors can cause twisting stress and cause the mount to move out of parallel with the rifle barrel. The <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> system allows for even stress to be distributed and prevent canting of the scope mount.|$|R
25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium <b>lock</b> <b>bar,</b> milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|R
50|$|The Lock Back Safety mechanism, also {{invented by}} Ron Lake, {{is similar in}} {{function}} to the LAWKS mechanism. It is a lockback folder with a switch that can prevent the <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> from being depressed. Inside the handle {{there is a small}} rod with a flange near the butt of the handle. The other end is connected to a switch near the pivot end. When the switch is pulled back (away from the pivot) the lock functions as a regular lockback. When the switch is closed the flange on the rod slides under tip of the <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> at the butt end. This prevents the depression of the bar and the blade from unlocking. When the knife is closed the system functions the same way to lock it closed or allow it to open.|$|R
5000|$|Three signalmen {{were present}} in the signalbox, the enquiry found that one of them had pulled the wrong lever; he had {{intended}} to set the points for the incoming train but instead set the points ahead of the Scarborough. <b>Locking</b> <b>bars</b> should have prevented these points from being changed as the signal ahead of the Scarborough was set to clear. Unfortunately one of the other signalmen was setting the signals behind the Scarborough train to danger, in contravention of the rules this was done whilst the train was still passing. This therefore disengaged the <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> on the <b>points</b> for a few seconds before the Scarborough train reached it, allowing them to be changed by the application of the wrong lever. A combination of these two failings led to the disaster.|$|R
