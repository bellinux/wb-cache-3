50|$|In {{traditional}} economic models, consumers display preference {{given the}} constraints of a <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> space. Consumers perceive certain brands with common characteristics to be close substitutes, and differentiate these products from their unique characteristics. For example, there are many brands of chocolate with nuts and others without them. Hence, the chocolate with nuts is a constraint of its <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> space.|$|R
40|$|The food {{industry}} is a complex supply chain, where {{the path of a}} specific food product may vary and the supply chains within the {{food industry}} may have different structures from each other. Another important characteristic of the food industry is the high frequency of new product introductions; this increases choice for consumers and initiates uncertainty related to product issues such as high product failure rates, short product life cycles and high inventory holding costs. Consequently, {{it is important to understand}} <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> as a source of supply chain uncertainty, how they can be managed and the resulting impact on performance. This paper presents a review of the available literature on supply chain uncertainty and related fields, highlights that although <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> has been identified as a source of uncertainty, insufficient empirical evidence has been presented. Multi-case study research, using semi-structured interviews, has been conducted across a group of inter-related companies in the food industry in Indonesia to investigate the role of <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> in creating uncertainty. The result of analysis helps to refine the concept and provides a basis for detecting and managing <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> uncertainty, critical in the current competitive context...|$|R

500|$|Tufan Hashemi said Roksan {{sought to}} create {{equipment}} that would excel in high-quality musical reproduction {{and capable of}} involving the listener on an emotional level. <b>Product</b> <b>characteristics</b> were to include precision and transparency of the sound. Moghaddam, acting as chief designer, {{set out to find}} solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in the belt-driven suspended sub-chassis turntable design of Edgar Villchur, where the sub-chassis and tonearm are free to rotate. Moghaddam believed that the design generated undesirable torsional modes. One such torsional mode is said to be caused by [...] "groove drag" [...] – dynamic forces exerted by the stylus on the record as it tracked it. Moghaddam chose to attenuate the torsion by mounting the turntable-drive motor casing on its own bearing. The motor, mounted separately and tethered to a spring, is allowed limited rotation about its own axis; because the load varied with groove modulations, the increases in drag would thus be dampened by the spring-loaded motor, and the platter acceleration mitigated. In the words of Tufan Hashemi, Roksan Audio's managing director: [...] "We argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read, as the record itself would be floating. We said that the record surface should remain stationary and solid but in complete isolation {{from the rest of the}} deck, and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it." ...|$|E

40|$|When {{screening}} {{a production}} process for nonconforming items {{the objective is}} to improve the average outgoing quality level. Due to measurement errors specification limits cannot be checked directly and hence test limits are required, which meet some given requirement, here given by a prescribed bound on the consumer loss. Classical test limits are based on normality, both for the <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> and for the measurement error. In practice, often nonnormality occurs for the <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{as well as for the}} measurement error. Recently, nonnormality of the <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> has been investigated. In this paper attention is focussed on the measurement error. Firstly, it is shown that nonnormality can lead to serious failure of the test limit. New test limits are therefore derived, which have the desired robustness property: a small loss under normality and a large gain in case of nonnormality when compared to the normal test limit. Monte Carlo results illustrate that the asymptotic theory is in agreement with moderate sample behaviour...|$|R

Value differentiation, {{the process by}} which agrifood chain actors isolate, match, and exploit heterogeneity in consumer preferences and product attributes, is examined. Value differentiation is characterized by complementarities across four activities at each stage of the production chain: <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> measurement, <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> production, coordination between stages, and customer preference detection. Complementarities at the firm level are modeled using supermodularity. The model's predictions are discussed, as are potential testing approaches, and implications are presented for agrifood firms, marketing orders, and returns to research. complementarities, supermodularity, value differentiation, Agribusiness,...|$|R
2500|$|As {{in every}} {{economic}} sector, the construction industry's purchases {{of materials and}} services creates a whole chain of processes from raw material selecting in situ, removal from the earth, usually proceeding to cutting, finishing, or processing/manufacturing, then transport, and retailing. [...] All of these activities have significant upstream (off-site) environmental impacts, whether in terms of energy and raw resource use or emissions to air, land, or water impacting living organisms or the Earth's surface (non-organic). [...] Life cycle assessment is a method for estimating and comparing a range of environmental performance measures (e.g. global warming, acidification potential, toxicity, ozone depletion potentials) over the full life cycle of a product, a building assembly, or a whole building. [...] As such, it provides a comprehensive means for evaluating and comparing products rather than prescriptive measures of individual <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E

50|$|Finally, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) {{bring the}} {{asymmetric}} information framework {{to bear in}} analyzing the issue of advertising and pricing. Traditionally, economists have thought of advertising as being either informative (as for example classified ads, which describe the <b>characteristics</b> of the <b>product</b> for sale), or persuasive (as for example many television commercials which seem to provide little or no information about a <b>product’s</b> <b>characteristics).</b> Following earlier ideas by Nelson (1970, 1974), Milgrom and Roberts (1986) show that even “uninformative” advertising, that is, advertising expenditures that provide no direct information about a <b>product’s</b> <b>characteristics,</b> may be informative in equilibrium {{to the extent that}} they work as a signal of the advertiser’s quality level. Methodologically, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) also make an important contribution: the study of signaling equilibria when the informed party has more than one available signal (price and advertising, in the present case).|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} identication and {{estimation}} of Gorman-Lancaster style hedonic models {{of demand for}} dierentiated products for the case when one <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> is not observed.

Relative to Rosen’s approach, we generalize the rst stage estimation to allow for a single dimensional unobserved <b>product</b> <b>characteristic,</b> and also allow the hedonic pricing function to have a general, non-additive structure. In the second stage, if the product space is continuous and the functional form of utility is known then there exists an inversion between the consumer’s choices and her preference parameters. This inversion can be used to recover the distribution of random coecients nonparametri-cally. For the more common case when the set of products is nite, we use the revealed preference conditions from the hedonic model to develop a Gibbs sampling estimator for the distribution of random coecients. We apply our methods to estimating personal computer demand...|$|R
