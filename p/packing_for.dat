25|$|The combed slivers {{produced}} on {{any type of}} combing machine are passed through {{a process known as}} finishing. This process takes place in a series of gill boxes in which the fibres are redistributed, the slivers made uniform in thickness and moisture added in order to give the wool its natural suppleness and condition. Blending is done where necessary to keep the top up to a given standard of quality and, if dyed, consistency of colour. The top ball produced is suitable for <b>packing</b> <b>for</b> transport and unwinding. The top represents the wool comber's finished product, and it is in this form that the wool is bought and sold as the spinner's raw material.|$|E

500|$|Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network {{declined}} to post {{commentary on the}} preview announcement for the second season, claiming [...] "we assume if you loved School Rumble, you're gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says, so why bother reviewing it?" [...] David F. Smith from IGN gave {{the first part of}} season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story. Specifically, Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously, and the studio for not cutting its budget for sight gagsâ€”something he notes that other companies do. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive, and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality. She complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle. Chris Beveridge claimed that, although it comes across well, the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting. He was more critical of Funimation's packaging, preferring the first season's metal locker boxart to the <b>packing</b> <b>for</b> the half-season sets.|$|E

2500|$|In a United States {{court case}} in 2017, , an appellate court was {{required}} to interpret a statute under which the [...] "canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, <b>packing</b> <b>for</b> shipment or distribution" [...] of certain goods were activities exempted from the general requirement of overtime pay; the question was whether this list included distribution of the goods, or only packing of the goods for distribution. The omission of the serial comma suggested one meaning, while the omission of the conjunction or before [...] "packing" [...] {{and the fact that}} the Maine Legislative Drafting Manual advised against use of the serial comma suggested another. The lower court held that [...] "distribution" [...] was itself an exempt activity. On appeal, however, the Circuit Court decided that the sentence was ambiguous and [...] "because, under Maine law, ambiguities in the state's wage and hour laws must be construed liberally in order to accomplish their remedial purpose", adopted the drivers' narrower reading of the exemption and ruled that those who distributed the goods were entitled to overtime. Thus, in this instance, it is implied that the fault lies in the absence of a serial comma. U.S. appeals judge David J. Barron wrote, [...] "For want of a comma, we have this case." ...|$|E
