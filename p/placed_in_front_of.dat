5|$|After being anointed, {{the monarch}} {{rises from the}} Coronation Chair and kneels down at a faldstool <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it. The {{archbishop}} then concludes the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting a prayer that is the English translation of the ancient Latin prayer Deus, Dei Filius, recited in the consecration of other Christian sovereigns. Once this prayer is finished, the monarch rises and sits again in the Coronation Chair. The Knights of the Garter then bear away the canopy.|$|E

5|$|During the Late Preclassic {{structures}} were built using volcanic stone {{held together with}} clay, as in the Middle Preclassic. However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented corners and stairways dressed with rounded pebbles. At the same time, old Olmec-style sculptures were moved from their original positions and <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the new-style buildings, sometimes reusing sculpture fragments in the stone facing.|$|E

5|$|Passport to Pimlico was {{released}} into UK cinemas on 26 April 1949; {{the film was}} financially successful. For the US release on 23 October 1949, soil was imported and <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the cinema; commissionaires in the uniform of a British policeman would hand out mock passports and invite passers-by to step onto English soil to see the film.

Both cameras were of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the tube.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E
5|$|Kailasanathar Temple, {{dedicated}} to Shiva and {{built by the}} Pallavas, is the oldest Hindu temple in existence and is declared an archaeological monument by the Archaeological Survey of India. It has a series of cells with sculptures inside. In the Kamakshi Amman Temple, goddess Parvati is depicted {{in the form of}} a yantra, Chakra or peetam (basement). In this temple, the yantra is <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the deity. Adi Sankara is closely associated with this temple and is believed to have established the Kanchi matha after this temple.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: {{the work was}} <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.|$|E
5|$|As a {{circular}} highway, M-185 has no specific termini; the generally accepted {{starting point is}} at the mile0 marker <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Mackinac Island State Park Visitor Center. The highway uses wooden markers to measure miles instead of the common metal signage; these signs are erected by the MISPC, as MDOT does not install the standard state highway reassurance markers along this roadway. M-185 {{is one of only}} three state trunkline highways in Michigan on islands; the others are M-134 on Drummond Island and M-154 on Harsens Island. No part of M-185 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Over a half million people travel along the trunkline in a year.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a {{great number}} of devotees come to the monastery, popularly known as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of the}} church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E

5|$|Malmö Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 26,500 spectators for sports, of which 14,000 are standing spectators. When hosting concerts, the stadium can host 25,000 spectators when {{the stage is}} on either long side of the stadium, or up to 40,000 when it is <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> either short side. It comprises two main stands {{on each of the}} long sides of the pitch: the Southern Stand and the Northern Stand, both of which have two tiers. The lower tier of the Northern Stand is terraced, and was the only tier of the stand until the upper, seated tier was built in 1992. The short sides of the pitch feature two minor terracing sections, respectively named the Eastern Stand and the Western Stand. When Malmö FF were based at the ground, the Northern Stand terracing was the section with the most season ticket holders, while the Eastern Stand was the section used to house away fans.|$|E
5|$|The Asiatic lion is {{a common}} motif in Chinese art. They were first used in art during the late Spring and Autumn period (fifth or sixth century BC), and became much more popular during the Han Dynasty (206 BC – AD 220), when {{imperial}} guardian lions started to be <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of Buddhist art to China in the Tang Dynasty (after the sixth century AD), lions usually were wingless, with shorter, thicker bodies, and curly manes. The lion dance {{is a form of}} traditional dance in Chinese culture in which performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums, and gongs. They are performed at Chinese New Year, the August Moon Festival and other celebratory occasions for good luck.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
