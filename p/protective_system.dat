40|$|The {{failure of}} <b>protective</b> <b>systems</b> can be catastrophic, and has its origin in management. Yet, most {{engineering}} works regarding <b>protective</b> <b>systems</b> {{focus on their}} physical components. Historically, <b>protective</b> <b>systems</b> have relied on a document-based approach, which implies handling several disjointed artifacts that are expensive to maintain and have a high potential for inconsistency and obsolescence. We present a framework that embeds management and governance in <b>protective</b> <b>systems</b> and harmonizes regulations, theories, and inconsistent industry guidelines. It pioneers the modeling of <b>protective</b> <b>systems</b> according to the tenors of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), which significantly reduces the pitfalls of its document-based counterpart. It provides a realistic approach to manage multiple aspects of change, and offers traceability, simulation, and visualization capabilities. First, we sketched a conceptual model that encompasses the physical components, management system, policy, laws and regulation, stakeholders and lifecycle, and {{stresses the importance of}} understanding the interactions among elements and their dynamic nature. Then, we used it as a baseline to develop the structure and behavior of our computerized model in SysML. Our MBSE framework advances {{the state of the art}} in safety-critical <b>protective</b> <b>systems</b> by integrating management and governance, and offering further capabilities inherent to the MBSE approach. It is suitable for combined design, operation, and regulation; it reduces the cost of maintenance of its artifacts; and it offers tools for simulation, impact analysis, and management of change. It supports shared governance and mitigates information asymmetry. Potential users include both enterprises and regulators from the chemical process safety industry and the energy sector, and any other agents invested in the design and management of <b>protective</b> <b>systems.</b> The model of <b>protective</b> <b>systems</b> developed in this research conforms to the standards issued by the Object Management Group (OMG) and the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE). We believe that it may constitute a beginning point in the development of more sophisticated standards and both prescriptive and performance-based regulation for <b>protective</b> <b>systems,</b> intended to prevent catastrophic failures. It may also help regulators to synthesize and disseminate information, as they serve as an interface and mediator between companies and the general public...|$|R

He then proceeded to inquire why, with such an increased produce, we were still, as regards bread corn, to a certain extent, an importing nation? This he accounted for by the universally improved condition of the people, and the enlarged command of food by the working classes. He drew an animated picture, founded entirely on the representations of writers and public men adverse to the <b>Protective</b> <b>System,</b> of the superior condition of the people of 'England, happy England,' to that of other countries: how they consumed much more of the best food, and lived much longer. This was under Protection, which Lord John Russell had stigmatized, in his letter, 'the bane of agriculture.' 'In the history of my noble friend's illustrious family,' he continued, 'I should have thought that he would have found a remarkable refutation of such a notion.' And then he drew a lively sketch of the colossal and patriotic works of the Earls and Dukes of Bedford, 'whereby they had drained and reclaimed three hundred thousand acres of land drowned in water, and brought them into cultivation, and thus converted into fertile fields a vast morass extending over seven counties in England.' Could the system which had inspired such enterprise be justly denounced as baneful? ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the absence}} of the direct, we may next try, as in other cases, the {{supplementary}} resource, called in a former place the Indirect Method of Difference; which, instead of two instances differing in nothing but {{the presence or absence of}} a given circumstance, compares two classes of instances respectively agreeing in nothing but the presence of a circumstance on the one side and its absence on the other. To choose the most advantageous case conceivable (a case far too advantageous to be ever obtained), suppose that we compare one nation which has a restrictive policy with two or more nations agreeing in nothing but in permitting free trade. We need not now suppose that either of these nations agrees with the first in all its circumstances; one may agree with it in some of its circumstances, and another in the remainder. And it may be argued, that if these nations remain poorer than the restrictive nation, it can not be for want either of the first or of the second set of circumstances, but it must be for want of the <b>protective</b> <b>system.</b> If (we might say) the restrictive nation had prospered from the one set of causes, the first of the free-trade nations would have prospered equally; if by reason of the other, the second would; but neither has; therefore the prosperity was owing to the restrictions. This will be allowed to be a very favorable specimen of an argument from specific experience in politics, and if this be inconclusive, it would not be easy to find another preferable to it.|$|E
60|$|And {{this was}} very true. The fact is, though the Protectionist party had made a most {{unexpected}} and gallant defence, no one was really prepared for the contest except Bentinck. Between the end of November and the meeting of Parliament, he had thrown all the energies of his passionate mind into this question. He had sought information on all points and always at the fountain-head. He had placed himself in immediate communication with the ablest representatives of every considerable interest attacked, and being ardent and indefatigable, gifted with a tenacious memory and a very clear and searching spirit, there was scarcely a detail or an argument connected with his subject which was not immediately at his command. No speeches in favour of the <b>protective</b> <b>system</b> have ever {{been made in the}} House of Commons compared with his in depth and range of knowledge; and had there been any member not connected with the government, who had been able to vindicate the merits of British agriculture as he did when the final struggle occurred, the impression which was made by the too-often unanswered speeches of the Manchester confederation would never have been effected. But the great Conservative party, exhausted by the labours of ten years of opposition, thought that after the triumph of '41 it might claim a furlough. The defence of their cause was left entirely to the ministers of their choice; and ministers, distracted with detail and wearied with official labour, are not always the most willing or the most efficient champions of the organic principles of a party.|$|E

60|$|This {{view of the}} situation, {{which was}} {{certainly}} adroit, for it combined the vindication of order with an indefinite delay of the measures for {{the repeal of the}} <b>protective</b> <b>system,</b> seemed to please every one; there was a murmur of approbation, and when one of the most considerable of the country gentlemen expressed the prevalent feeling, and added that all that was now to be desired was that Lord George Bentinck would kindly consent to be the organ of the party on the occasion, and state their view to the House, the cheering was very hearty. It came from the hearts of more than two hundred gentlemen, scarcely one of whom had a personal object in this almost hopeless struggle beyond the maintenance of a system which he deemed advantageous to his country; but they wished to show their generous admiration of the man who, in the dark hour of difficulty and desertion, had proved his courage and resource, had saved them from public contempt, and taught them to have confidence in themselves. And after all, there are few rewards in life which equal such sympathy from such men. The favour of courts and the applause of senates may have their moments of excitement and delight, but the incident of deepest and most enduring gratification in public life is to possess the cordial confidence of a high-spirited party, for it touches the heart as well as the intellect, and combines all the softer feelings of private life with the ennobling consciousness of public duty.|$|E
60|$|The {{economic}} tap-root, {{the chief}} directing motive {{of all the}} modern imperialistic expansion, is the pressure of capitalist industries for markets, primarily markets for investment, secondarily markets for surplus products of home industry. Where the concentration of capital has gone furthest, and where a rigorous <b>protective</b> <b>system</b> prevails, this pressure is necessarily strongest. Not merely do the trusts and other manufacturing trades that restrict their output for the home market more urgently require foreign markets, {{but they are also}} more anxious to secure protected markets, and this can only be achieved by extending the area of political rule. This is the essential significance of the recent change in American foreign policy as illustrated by the Spanish War, the Philippine annexation, the Panama policy, and the new application of the Monroe doctrine to the South American States. South America is needed as a preferential market for investment of trust ``profits'' and surplus trust products: if in time these states can be brought within a Zollverein under the suzerainty of the United States, the financial area of operations receives a notable accession. China as a field of railway enterprise and general industrial development already begins to loom large in the eyes of foresighted American business men; the growing trade in American cotton and other goods in that country will be a subordinate consideration to the expansion of the area for American investments. Diplomatic pressure, armed force, and, where desirable, seizure of territory for political control, will be engineered by the financial magnates who control the political destiny of America. The strong and expensive American navy now beginning to be built incidentally serves the purpose of affording profitable contracts to the shipbuilding and metal industries: its real meaning and use is to forward the aggressive political policy imposed upon the nation by the economic needs of the financial capitalists.|$|E

The real avalanche to be dreaded,--are we to expect it from the ever-gathering mass of ignorant brute force, with the irresponsibility of animals and the passions of men, {{which is one of the}} fatal necessities of slavery, or from the gradually increasing consciousness of the non-slaveholding population of the Slave States of the true cause of their material impoverishment and political inferiority?

He told them how, after an experience now becoming long, the one standing pain to the political man in England {{is a sense of}} the inequality of his best exertions to the arduous duty of government and legislation. England had undertaken responsibilities of empire such as never before lay on the shoulders or the minds of men. We governed distant millions many times outnumbering ourselves. We were responsible for the welfare of forty or forty-five separate states. Again, what other nation was charged with the same responsibility in the exercise of its moral influence abroad, in the example it is called upon to set, in the sympathy it must feel with the cause of right and justice and constitutional freedom wherever that cause is at issue? As for our fellow subjects abroad, we had given them practical freedom. It was our duty to abstain as far as may be from interference with their affairs, to afford them the shelter and protection of the empire, {{and at the same time}} to impress upon them that there is no grosser mistake in politics than to suppose you can separate the blessings and benefits of freedom from its burdens. In other words, the colonies should pay their own way, and if the old dream of making their interests subservient to those of the mother country had passed away, it was just as little reasonable that the mother country should bear charges that in equity belonged to them, and all the more if the colonies set up against the industry and productions of England the mischiefs and obstructions of an exploded <b>protective</b> <b>system.</b> On foreign policy he enforced the principles that, after all, had given to Europe forty years of peace, and to England forty years of diplomatic authority and pre-eminence. “It is impossible that to a country like England the affairs of foreign nations can ever be indifferent. It is impossible that England, in my opinion, ever should forswear the interest she must naturally feel in the cause of truth, of justice, of order, and of good government.” The final word was an admonition against “political lethargy.” For the first time, I think, he put into the forefront the tormenting question that was to haunt him to the end. “They could not look at Ireland,” he told them, “and say that the state of feeling there was for the honour and the advantage of the united kingdom.” ...|$|E

In every case, however, the head [...] of a government may be influenced more or less in the affairs of [...] each department of state by the person in charge of that [...] department.

I myself had invariably, during [...] Peel's government, spoken of protection not as a thing good in [...] principle, but to be dealt with as tenderly and cautiously as might [...] be according to circumstances, always moving in the direction of [...] free trade.

So far [...] as relates to the final change in the corn law, you will see that [...] no influence proceeded from me, but rather that events over which I [...] had no control, and steps taken by Sir R. Peel while I was out of [...] the government, had an influence upon me in inducing me to take [...] office. I noticed some days ago that you had made an observation on [...] this subject, but I did not recollect that it was a question. Had I [...] adverted to this I should have answered it at once. If I had any [...] motive for avoiding the subject, it was, I think, this--that it is [...] not easy to discuss such a question as that of an influence of mine [...] over a mind so immeasurably superior, without something of egotism [...] and vanity.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, {{however, the}} Review made {{considerable}} {{noise in the}} world, and gave a recognised status, {{in the arena of}} opinion and discussion, to the Benthamic type of Radicalism, out of all proportion to the number of its adherents, and to the personal merits and abilities, at that time, of most of those who could be reckoned among them. It was a time, as is known, of rapidly rising Liberalism. When the fears and animosities accompanying the war with France had been brought to an end, and people had once more a place in their thoughts for home politics, the tide began to set towards reform. The renewed oppression of the Continent by the old reigning families, the countenance apparently given by the English Government to the conspiracy against liberty called the Holy Alliance, and the enormous weight of the national debt and taxation occasioned by so long and costly a war, rendered the government and parliament very unpopular. Radicalism, under the leadership of the Burdetts and Cobbetts, had assumed a character and importance which seriously alarmed the Administration: and their alarm had scarcely been temporarily assuaged by the celebrated Six Acts, when the trial of Queen Caroline roused a still wider and deeper feeling of hatred. Though the outward signs of this hatred passed away with its exciting cause, there arose on all sides a spirit which had never shown itself before, of opposition to abuses in detail. Mr. Hume's persevering scrutiny of the public expenditure, forcing the House of Commons to a division on every objectionable item in the estimates, had begun to tell with great force on public opinion, and had extorted many minor retrenchments from an unwilling administration. Political economy had asserted itself with great vigour in public affairs, by the petition of the merchants of London for free trade, drawn up in 1820 by Mr. Tooke and presented by Mr. Alexander Baring; and by the noble exertions of Ricardo during the few years of his parliamentary life. His writings, following up the impulse given by the Bullion controversy, and followed up in their turn by the expositions and comments of my father and McCulloch (whose writings in the Edinburgh Review during those years were most valuable), had drawn general attention to the subject, making at least partial converts in the Cabinet itself; and Huskisson, supported by Canning, had commenced that gradual demolition of the <b>protective</b> <b>system,</b> which one of their colleagues virtually completed in 1846, though the last vestiges were only swept away by Mr. Gladstone in 1860. Mr. Peel, then Home Secretary, was entering cautiously into the untrodden and peculiarly Benthamic path of Law Reform. At this period, when Liberalism seemed to be becoming the tone of the time, when improvement of institutions was preached from the highest places, and a complete change of the constitution of Parliament was loudly demanded in the lowest, it is not strange that attention should have been roused by the regular appearance in controversy of what seemed a new school of writers, claiming to be the legislators and theorists of this new tendency. The air of strong conviction with which they wrote, when scarcely anyone else seemed to have an equally strong faith in as definite a creed; the boldness with which they tilted against the very front of both the existing political parties; their uncompromising profession of opposition to many of the generally received opinions, and the suspicion they lay under of holding others still more heterodox than they professed; the talent and verve of at least my father's articles, and the appearance of a corps behind him sufficient to carry on a Review; and finally, the fact that the Review was bought and read, made the so-called Bentham school in philosophy and politics fill a greater place in the public mind than it had held before, or has ever again held since other equally earnest schools of thought have arisen in England. As I was in the headquarters of it, knew of what it was composed, and {{as one of the most}} active of its very small number, might say without undue assumption, quorum pars magna fui, it belongs to me more than to most others, to give some account of it.|$|E
