25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization for ascariasis are: albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate.</b> Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide. <b>Pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.|$|E
25|$|For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as {{mebendazole}} and albendazole are {{the drugs}} of choice recommended by WHO. These anthelminthics are administered {{in a single}} dose are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective for several months. Mebendazole can be given with a single dose twice a day for three consecutive days. Albendazole is given at a single dose. WHO recommends annual treatment in areas where between 20 and 50% of people are infected, and a twice a year treatment if it is over 50%; and in low risk situation (i.e. less than 20% prevalence) case-by-case treatment. In addition to these, <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> is also equally effective on ascaris.

25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode’s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> may be used. A 2008 review {{found that the}} efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate.</b> This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate (200mg) be administered three times daily {{at the same time}} as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{improved}} sanitation, {{which includes}} improving access to toilets and proper disposal of feces. Handwashing with soap appears protective. In areas {{where more than}} 20% {{of the population is}} affected, treating everyone at regular intervals is recommended. Reoccurring infections are common. There is no vaccine.

50|$|Trichostrongylus tenuis, {{also known}} as the {{strongyle}} worm, is a gut nematode found in the United Kingdom, sensitive to <b>Pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate.</b> Larvae have a short migration inside the mucosa of the intestine and return quickly to the digestive tract.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the use of}} {{herbivore}} manure as fertilizer is {{a common}} practice preceding infection, thorough cleaning and cooking of vegetables is required for prevention of infection. Treatment with <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> is recommended. Alternative agents include mebendazole and albendazole. Successful treatment with ivermectin has also been reported.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> {{acts as a}} depolarizing neuromuscular {{blocking}} agent, thereby causing sudden contraction, {{followed by}} paralysis, of the helminths. This has the result of causing the worm to [...] "lose its grip" [...] on the intestinal wall and be passed {{out of the system}} by natural process. Since Pyrantel is poorly absorbed by the host's intestine, the host is unaffected by the small dosage of medication used. Spastic (tetanic) paralyzing agents, in particular <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate,</b> may induce complete intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. This obstruction is usually {{in the form of a}} worm impaction and happens when a very small, but heavily parasitized animal is treated and tries to pass a large number of dislodged worms at once. Worms usually pass in normal stool or with diarrhea, straining, and occasional vomiting.|$|E
50|$|Acanthocephaliasis {{is treated}} with anti-helminthics. There is {{considerable}} {{debate over the}} efficacy of anti-helminth drugs on this parasite, but thus far, the drugs seem to be working. <b>Pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> and ivermectin {{have been shown to}} be particularly effective in treating patients. Mebendazole and thiabendazole have also both been cited to work.|$|E
50|$|Another {{medication}} {{administered to}} kill worm infections has been <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate.</b> For some parasitic diseases, {{there is no}} treatment and, {{in the case of}} serious symptoms, medication intended to kill the parasite is administered, whereas, in other cases, symptom relief options are used. Recent papers have also proposed the use of viruses to treat infections caused by protozoa.|$|E

5000|$|The typical adult {{therapy for}} oesophagostomiasis {{is a single}} 400 mg dose of {{albendazole}} (200 mg for children) or <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate.</b> [...] Albendazole works by binding to the free beta tubulin, which inhibits tubulin polymerization. This results in the inhibition of glucose uptake by the Oesophagostomum. Albendazole and <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> at these doses have cure rates of 85% and 59-82%, respectively. Excision of Oesophagostomum larvae from nodules {{has been shown to}} have a curative effect on the patient but is invasive and more resource intensive than chemotherapy. For oesophagostomiasis with complications, the type of treatment varies depending on the severity of the disease. Usually 200-400 mg of albendazole will be given immediately and continued for up to 5 days in conjunction with 250 mg dosages of amoxicillin.In the case of formation of abscesses or fistulae arising from Dapaong tumors, incision and drainage is performed, followed by a regimen of albendazole and antibiotic treatment.|$|E
50|$|Humans {{suffering}} from visceral infection of T. canis, the drugs albendazole (preferred), mebendazole and thiabendazole are highly effective. For other treatments, see a physician or reference the disease pages: visceralis larva migrans and ocularis larva migrans. Anthelminithic drugs {{are used to}} treat infections in dogs and puppies for adult worms. The best treatment for puppies is <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> to prevent the larvae from reproducing and causing disease.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{typically}} with two {{doses of the}} medications mebendazole, <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate,</b> or albendazole two weeks apart. Everyone who lives with or takes care of an infected person should be treated at the same time. Washing personal items in hot water after each dose of medication is recommended. Good handwashing, daily bathing in the morning, and daily changing of underwear can help prevent reinfection.|$|E
50|$|No formal {{prevention}} strategies {{exist for}} control of H. polygyrus although the parasite is susceptible {{to a number of}} drug treatments. Treatment of an infected mouse with <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate,</b> ivermectin or other anthelmintic drugs will help clear infection and provide immunity to reinfection. Furthermore, a cocktail of H. polygyrus excretory-secretory antigens can be collected, and administered to mice in the presence of alum to induce sterilizing immunity pre-infection.|$|E

50|$|Praziquantel is {{the drug}} of choice for treatment. Treatment is {{effective}} in early or light infections. Heavy infections {{are more difficult to}} treat. Studies of the effectiveness of various drugs for treatment of children with F. buski have shown tetrachloroethylene as capable of reducing faecal egg counts by up to 99%. Other anthelmintics that can be used include thiabendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate.</b> Oxyclozanide, hexachlorophene and nitroxynil are also highly effective.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for N. americanus are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. Benzimidazoles kill adult worms by binding to the nematde’s Beta-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. Keiser and Utzinger {{conducted a study}} in 2008, Efficacy of Current Drugs Against Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infections: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, which found that the efficacy of single-dose treatments for Hookworm infections were as followed: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Deworming {{programmes}} {{for children}} usually administer an anthelmintic drug such as albendazole or mebendazole (or praziquantel in a weight based or height based dose for schistosomiasis). The treatment is given {{as a single}} dose in a pill formulation. Other drugs used, though not approved by the WHO, include <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate,</b> piperazine, piperazine citrate, tetrachloroethylene, and levamisole. In mass deworming programs, all children are given the medication, whether they are infected or not. In endemic areas, the deworming needs to be repeated regularly. The frequency of the treatment depends on the prevalence and severity of infection which is determined by periodic surveys but is usually required annually.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the severe}} side effects (even when used as directed), {{the need for}} a purgative, and the {{development}} of many safer deworming drugs, santonin has largely fallen out of use. Typically mebendazole and <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> are used in modern pharmacopoeia practice where santonin was formerly used; even guides on holistic medicine strongly recommend avoiding the use of santonin due to its severe and occasionally fatal side effects and the availability of far safer anthelminthics http://www.indiangyan.com/books/healthbooks/complet_femily_medicine_book/Worm_infestations.shtml. The Council Directive 65/65 European EconomicCommunity (EEC) (in regards to pharmaceuticals and naturopathic preparations) has officially ruled santonin preparations to have an [...] "unacceptable" [...] risk-benefit ratio and preparations containing santonin are no longer eligible for registration in EU countries http://www.diahome.org/content/abstract/1996/dj304878.pdf.|$|E
5000|$|Deworming {{can begin}} with foals at {{four to eight}} weeks of age and is {{repeated}} about every 60 days. Treatment is with anthelmintic medication, and rotating between different classes of anthelmintics is recommended. [...] Effective treatments include the macrocyclic lactones, notably ivermectin or moxidectin, which can kill the early larval stages before they migrate into the liver and lungs. Another class of effective medication are the benzimidazoles, such as fenbendazole. <b>Pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> is also used, and a closely related variant, pyrantel tartrate, can be fed as a daily dose that is effective at killing larvae. Prior to development of these drugs, during the 1950s and 1960s, treatment with piperazine, dichlorvos and trichlorfon was used.|$|E
50|$|The {{benzimidazole}} compounds albendazole (brand names e.g., Albenza, Eskazole, Zentel and Andazol) and mebendazole (brand names e.g., Ovex, Vermox, Antiox and Pripsen) are {{the most}} effective. They work by inhibiting the microtubule function in the pinworm adults, causing glycogen depletion, thereby effectively starving the parasite. A single 100 milligram dose of mebendazole with one repetition after a week, is considered the safest, and is usually effective with cure rate of 96%. Mebendazole has no serious side effects, although abdominal pain and diarrhea have been reported. <b>Pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> (also called pyrantel embonate, brand names e.g., Reese's Pinworm Medicine, Pin-X, Combantrin, Anthel, Helmintox, and Helmex) kills adult pinworms through neuromuscular blockade, and is considered {{as effective as the}} benzimidazole compounds and is used as a second-line medication. Other medications are piperazine, which causes flaccid paralysis in the adult pinworms, and pyrvinium pamoate (also called pyrvinium embonate), which works by inhibiting oxygen uptake of the adult pinworms. Pinworms located in the genitourinary system (in this case, female genital area) may require other drug treatments.|$|E

40|$|Trials were {{conducted}} in ponies to evaluate the efficacy of <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> (Strongid-T®) and two newer anthelmintics not yet commercially available, nitramisole and avermectin B 1 a, against migrating Strongylus vulgaris larvae. Ponies were removed from their mares within 24 - 48 hr after birth and reared in isolation, worm free. Between six and 14 weeks of age they were infected with 2000 or 2500 infective S. vulgaris larvae. Subsequently, they were monitored daily for clinical signs until the experiment terminated at 28 days postinfection. All ponies showed increased body temperature and reduced appetite within {{the first week of}} infection. All anthelmintics were administered on day 7 and in addition <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> was given on day 8 postinfection. The anthelmintics were in liquid formulation.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of ivermectin, fenbendazole, <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> and doramectin was evaluated {{under field conditions}} at 2 sites in the Free State Province of South Africa. The study involved 25 horses at each site, divided into 5 groups of equal size. Ivermectin, fenbendazole and <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> were administered orally at doses of 0. 2, 10 and 19 mg/kg respectively. Doramectin was administered by intramuscular injection at a dose of 0. 2 mg/kg. Treatment efficacy {{was based on the}} mean faecal egg count reduction 14 days post treatment. At site A a faecal egg count reduction of 100 % was found after treatment with ivermectin, fenbendazole and doramectin. A 96. 1 % reduction was found after treatment with <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate.</b> At site B ivermectin and doramectin produced a 100 %reduction in faecal egg counts, fenbendazole produced an 80. 8 % reduction and <b>pyrantel</b> <b>pamoate</b> a 94. 1 %reduction. Doramectin produced a 100 %reduction in faecal egg counts at both sites, despite not being registered for use in horses. In addition, the results indicated reduced {{efficacy of}} fenbendazole at site B, which suggested benzimidazole resistance. Larval cultures showed that cyathostomes accounted for between 86 and 96 %of pre-treatment parasite burdens at both sites.
