Our study aims to understand how social workers experience both their professional role and organisation when working with women who suffers from domestic violence and abuse ubstances such as drugs and alcohol. This study is qualitative and was done with semi-structed interviews with eight professionals who work in various Social Services in the south of Sweden. The results show that among other things the organization’s economy together with lack of <b>protective</b> <b>houses</b> plays a big part in the professional’s work with these women. We also found that the structure of the Social Services’s organization and the way the professional relate to his work affect these women’s needs av help and support...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution of leakage radiation from two unshielded diagnostic-type X-ray tube housings. This information was used to determine the shielding required in the housings to bring them into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type <b>protective</b> tube <b>housing,</b> as set forth by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements in Report No. 33. Two special diagnostic X-ray tube units were used, one containing a rotating anode tube and the other a stationary anode tube. The only shielding supplied was that provided by the steel, oil-containing tube casing which surrounds the X-ray tube. A measurement of the distribution of leakage radiation on a sphere of one meter radius about the focal spot of the X-ray tube was made on each tube when the tube was operated at its maximum rated continuous current for its maximum rated operating voltage. From the leakage radiation measured, the thickness of lead shielding required to bring the X-ray tube housing into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type <b>protective</b> tube <b>housing</b> was calculated. Lead shielding was placed on each of the X-ray tube housings, and measurements were made to determine if each housing was then in compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type <b>protective</b> tube <b>housing.</b> As a result of this study, it was found that the distribution of leakage radiation from an unshielded diagnostic-type tube housing is non-uniform. The amount and location of shielding required in the housing is dependent upon the distribution of the leakage radiation, and is, therefore, a function of the design and rating of the X-ray tube used in the housing...|$|R

50|$|An action {{camera or}} action-cam is {{a digital camera}} {{designed}} for filming action while being immersed in it. Action cameras are therefore typically compact and rugged, and waterproof at surface. They typically record video as a priority over stills, as this allows continuous capture of the action without having {{to interact with the}} camera or indeed removing it from its housing, if an additional <b>protective</b> <b>housing</b> is used.

50|$|Odorizers {{are used}} in carbon dioxide fire {{extinguisher}} systems, the odorizer assembly injects wintergreen oil into the carbon dioxide stream when the agent is discharged. Approximately 50 cc of wintergreen oil contained within a frangible glass cartridge is mounted within a <b>protective</b> <b>housing</b> attached to the discharge piping {{in such a manner}} as to rupture the glass container when the carbon dioxide manifold is pressurized during discharge, atomizing the oil and dispersing it. The strong wintergreen scent effectively notifies the occupants of the presence of carbon dioxide gas after carbon dioxide has been discharged into the hazard.|$|E
