5|$|In Australia, 2012 {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} there are more than 7.2million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. As such it {{has become one of the}} continent's most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the family <b>Potoroidae</b> including the desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbys, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabys and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited to areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established.|$|E

40|$|Australidelphia is the cohort, {{originally}} {{named by}} Szalay, of all Australian marsupials and the South American Dromiciops. A lot of mitochondria and nuclear genome studies {{support the hypothesis}} of a monophyly of Australidelphia, but some familial relationships in Australidelphia are still unclear. In particular, the familial relationships among the order Diprotodontia (koala, wombat, kangaroos and possums) are ambiguous. These Diprotodontian families are largely grouped into two suborders, Vombatiformes, which contains Phascolarctidae (koala) and Vombatidae (wombat), and Phalangerida, which contains Macropodidae, <b>Potoroidae,</b> Phalangeridae, Petauridae, Pseudocheiridae, Acrobatidae, Tarsipedidae and Burramyidae. Morphological evidence and some molecular analyses strongly support monophyly of the two families in Vombatiformes. The monophyly of Phalangerida {{as well as the}} phylogenetic relationships of families in Phalangerida remains uncertain, however, despite searches for morphological synapomorphy and mitochondrial DNA sequence analyses. Moreover, phylogenetic relationships among possum families (Phalangeridae, Petauridae, Pseudocheiridae, Acrobatidae, Tarsipedidae and Burramyidae) as well as a sister group of Macropodoidea (Macropodidae and <b>Potoroidae)</b> remain unclear. To evaluate familial relationships among Dromiciops and Australian marsupials as well as the familial relationships in Diprotodontia, we determined the complete mitochondrial sequence of six Diprotodontian species. We used Maximum Likelihood analyses with concatenated amino acid and codon sequences of 12 mitochondrial protein genomes. Our analysis of mitochondria amino acid sequence supports monophyly of Australian marsupials+Dromiciops and monophyly of Phalangerida. The close relatedness between Macropodidae and Phalangeridae is also weakly supported by our analysis.

40|$|Mycophagous bioturbators provide {{ecosystem}} services {{that can be}} important for the resilience and restoration of ecosystems. Among the Australian mammals, mycophagy is most prevalent within the <b>Potoroidae</b> (bettongs and potoroos). However, proportionally more species of <b>Potoroidae</b> are either recently extinct or currently threatened than any other mammalian family in Australia, and {{they are among the}} least studied. The critically endangered woylie, or brush-tailed bettong (Bettongia penicillata), is a mycophagous, ground dwelling 'ecosystem engineer' that was one of Australia's most abundant and widely distributed potoroids prior to European settlement. After substantial range contraction, however, the remaining indigenous populations are now restricted to eucalypt forests in south-western Australia. Using an experimental approach, we investigated the population responses of the woylie to timber harvesting in these forests. Nine treatments, including varying logging intensities and unharvested controls, were applied at 22 sites. The abundance of the woylie in the harvested areas, in unharvested stands between logged areas, and in extensive unharvested stands outside the harvest management area were compared using a replicated before-after-control-impact (BACI) repeated measures design and capture-mark-recapture modelling. A total of 5860 captures of 815 individuals were recorded during 35 trapping sessions over 16 years (one year preceding, two years during, and 13 years after disturbance). Capture rate was a good index of abundance for this species and woylie abundance, survivorship and recruitment were not adversely affected by silvicultural practices in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest. On the contrary, the harvested areas may have afforded some localised protection when an unrelated, species-wide decline began three years after harvesting disturbance ended; woylie numbers declined by up to 77 % and 95 % in harvested and unharvested areas, respectively. Thus the nature and spatial extent of the timber harvesting regimes investigated in this study were not a major threatening process for this species. However, ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure that timber harvesting activities remain benign {{in the face of a}} changing climate, possible increased mortality from introduced predators, disease, and further declines in the abundance of this critically endangered marsupial...|$|E
40|$|The cytochemical {{staining}} {{characteristics of}} leukocytes from four species of Macropodidae and one species of <b>Potoroidae</b> were studied {{to investigate the}} cellular composition of leukocytes within the Macropodidae family and determine markers that may be useful for identifying cell lineage. Blood smears from the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosis), the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus), quokka (Setonix brachyurus) and a potoroid species, the woylie (Bettongia pencillata) were examined following reaction for Sudan Black B (SBB), peroxidase (PER), chloracetate esterase (CAE), α-naphthyl butyrate esterase (NBE) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Similar to domestic animal species, the neutrophils and eosinophils of macropodid species stained for both SBB and PER while monocytes and lymphocytes showed little or no reaction. CAE and NBE, however, were not useful as markers for macropodid neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. Significant variation between species was seen in ALP content. Tammar wallabies and quokkas demonstrated strong ALP activity within their neutrophils and eosinophils. In contrast, western grey kangaroos and red kangaroos contained no ALP activity in any of their leukocytes and staining in woylies was limited to weak reaction within some eosinophils...|$|E

Since then T. pteropi from the flying fox, T. hipposideri from the dusky horseshoe-bat (Hipposideros bicolor albanensis), T. binneyi from the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), T. thylacis from the northern brown bandicoot (Thylacis obesulus) and more recently novel Trypanosoma sp. from the Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) and a common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), have been detected (Mackerras 1959; Noyes et al., 1998). Recently, trypanosomes were identified in blood smears from the critically endangered Gilbert’s potoroo (Potorous gilbertii). This is the first record of trypanosomes in Western Australia and within the family <b>Potoroidae.</b> This novel trypanosome was characterised using conventional light microscopy and molecular tools to determine morphological and molecular characteristics. From stained blood smears various stages of the trypanosome life cycle were observed and the trypanosomes were also successfully established in vitro culture systems. Phylogenetic analyses of partial Trypanosoma sequences of the 18 S rRNA gene indicated that Gilbert’s potoroo trypanosome was closely related to an isolate from the wombat discovered in Victoria. Morphological characterisation confirmed that the isolate belongs to the Stercorarian group of trypanosomes in the subgenus Herpetosoma, an observation consistent with the phylogenetic tree analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} bettong (Bettongia tropica) (<b>Potoroidae),</b> is {{an endangered}} macropod with a restricted distribution. We combined radio-tracking and trapping data with microsatellite genotypes to infer the mating system and local dispersal patterns of this species, and discuss their relevance to translocations. We defined the mating system as 2 ̆ 7 overlap promiscuity 2 ̆ 7 (sensu Wittenberger 1979), though we cannot rule out serial monogamy. We found significant effects of proximity (average distance between parents = 190 m) and male weight, but not size, on {{the likelihood of}} paternity, suggesting that closer, heavier males have greater mating success. The average distance between putative pairs of relatives suggested that most dispersal occurred over short distances, with the distance between 2 ̆ 7 related 2 ̆ 7 females significantly lower than that between related males (0. 9 km versus 1. 3 km). A spatial autocorrelation analysis showed high female relatedness across distances of up to 435 m, equivalent to half an average home range width. Conversely, male pairs had low relatedness across 0 to 870 m. These results suggested that female young often settle next to their mother, while males avoid nesting within their father 2 ̆ 7 s home range. Both limited natal and 2 ̆ 7 mating 2 ̆ 7 dispersal {{may have contributed to}} the strong genetic structure previously reported for this species...|$|E

(Nematoda: Oxyuridae) is {{described}} based on specimens {{recovered from the}} caecum and colon of two woylies, Bettongia penicillata (Marsupialia: <b>Potoroidae)</b> from Western Australia. Only one other species of Potoroxyuris has been described previously, Potoroxyuris potoroo (Johnston and Mawson, 1939) Mawson, 1964, from Potorous tridactylus. The new species is most easily differentiated from P.  potoroo by {{the shape of the}} pharyngeal lobes. The pharyngeal lobes of P.  keninupensis n. sp. are widest at the base while those of P.  potoroo are widest at the tip. The genus Potoroxyuris most closely resembles Macropoxyuris based especially on structures of the caudal end of males. The other three genera of oxyurids known to infect Australian marsupials have longer caudal alae, and more caudal papillae than these two genera. The genus Potoroxyuris has previously been defined by the characteristic that the pharyngeal lobes protrude through the oral opening. However, the pharyngeal lobes of P.  keninupensis n. sp. do not quite protrude, so the definition of the genus should be modified as follows. The genus Potoroxyuris can be easily differentiated from Macropoxyuris by the following differences in the morphology of the buccal cavity. The pharyngeal lobes of Potoroxyuris almost reach the oral opening, or protrude beyond it, whereas those of Macropoxyuris only reach to about the anterior third of the buccal cavity. The buccal cavity of Potoroxyuris is poorly cuticularized compared to Macropoxyuris and other genera of oxyurids known from Australian marsupials, and does not contain inter-radial lamellae...|$|E
40|$|Links between {{species and}} the effect they have on {{ecosystem}} function is becoming increasingly recognised. Examples of such links include the complex, often multi-staged process of animal mediated seed dispersal, seed-caching by mammals and the tripartite relationship that occurs between many fungus-eating (mycophageous) mammal species, mycorrhizal fungi and woody plants. In this thesis, the role a small omnivorous marsupial, Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi (woylie), plays in ecosystem function, using its interaction with Santalum spicatum (Western Australian sandalwood) as a model, was examined. The {{study was conducted in}} a semi-arid open wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) woodland, in Western Australia. Dryandra Woodland, (32 ° 48 ' 8, l 16 ° 54 'E) 160 km southeast of Perth, {{is one of the largest}} and most diverse remnants supporting over 800 native plant species and 24 mammal species, seven of which are threatened. Dryandra Woodland experiences a Mediterranean climate with warm to hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Bettongia penicillata Grey 1837 is a small, nocturnal marsupial within the family <b>Potoroidae.</b> Since European settlement, the distribution and numbers of woylies have decreased dramatically. Factors attributed to this decline include habitat loss, the introduction of feral predators such as the cat (Felis catus), the European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and competing herbivores. From its original distribution across the south-western third of the continent, only three remnant natural populations remain in the south-west of Western Australia at Perup Nature Reserve, Tutanning Nature Reserve and Dryandra Woodland representing a reduction in range of approximately 97...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the structure-function relationships {{that underlie the}} aerobic capacities of marsupial mammals that hop. Marsupials have relatively low basal metabolic rates (BMR) and historically were seen as 'low energy' mammals. However, the red kangaroo, Macropus rufus (family Macropodidae), has aerobic capacities equivalent to athletic placentals. It has an extreme aerobic scope (fAS) and its large locomotor muscles feature high mitochondrial and capillary volumes. M. rufus belongs to a modern group of kangaroos and its high fAS is not general for marsupials. However, other hopping marsupials may have elevated aerobic capacities. Bettongia penicillata, a rat-kangaroo (family <b>Potoroidae),</b> is a small (1 kg), active hopper whose fAS is somewhat elevated. We {{examined the}} oxygen delivery system in its muscles to ascertain links with hopping. An elevated fAS of 23 provided a relatively high maximal aerobic oxygen consumption (VO₂,max) in B. penicillata; associated with this is a skeletal muscle mass of 44 % of body mass. Ten muscles were sampled to estimate the total mitochondrial and capillary volume of the locomotor muscles. Values in B. penicillata {{were similar to those}} in M. rufus and in athletic placentals. This small hopper had high muscle mitochondrial volume densities (7. 1 - 11. 9 %) and both a large total capillary volume (6 ml kg⁻¹ body mass) and total capillary erythrocyte volume (3. 2 ml kg⁻¹). Apparently, a considerable aerobic capacity is required to achieve the benefits of the extended stride in fast hopping. Of note, the ratio of VO₂,max to total muscle mitochondrial volume in B. penicillata was 4. 9 ml O₂ min⁻¹ ml⁻¹. Similar values occur in M. rufus and also placental mammals generally, not only athletic species. If such relationships occur in other marsupials, a fundamental structure-function relationship for oxygen delivery to muscles likely originated with or before the earliest mammals. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} bettong, Bettongia tropica, is {{an endangered}} species of <b>Potoroidae</b> with a restricted distribution in the wet tropics of north Queensland, Australia. The species is only found within a thin strip of sclerophyll forest along the western margin of rainforest. This tight association with rainforest boundaries is predicted to have resulted in population isolation as rainforest contracted during the Pleistocene, though some have proposed that the northern bettong was not present in the wet tropics until the late Pleistocene. The dispersal ability of the species, and of the family, is not known. This study examined gene flow among populations within areas of continuous habitat complemented by a broader analysis of phylogeography. Individuals trapped {{at each of the}} four known regions (one region was subsampled at three different sites), were sequenced for 547 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and typed for seven microsatellite loci. The mtDNA phylogeny showed congruence with a biogeographical hypothesis, a relatively deep split suggesting historical isolation in separate northern and southern refugia. The two divergent clades were both present within the Lamb Range, indicating an expansion from these refuges and subsequent admixture at one site. mtDNA allele frequencies indicated relatively limited gene flow within the Lamb Range over distances as short as nine km. Tests of population divergence using microsatellites (FST and assignment tests) strongly supported this result. A molecular signal indicative of a recent bottleneck was unexpectedly detected in one of the Lamb Range subpopulations. This lead us to examine the behaviour of the statistics used in this bottleneck test under a linear stepping-stone model with varying migration rates. We found that it may be more difficult to detect molecular signatures for recent bottlenecks under conditions of very low migration rates than for isolated populations and, conversely, that 2 ̆ 7 false 2 ̆ 7 bottleneck signatures may be observed at higher migration rates. The Lamb Range FST estimate clearly fell within the category of potentially 2 ̆ 7 false 2 ̆ 7 bottleneck signals. Despite relatively limited gene flow, evidence for asymmetric dispersal suggests more complicated population dynamics than a simple linear stepping-stone model...|$|E
40|$|Cross-fostering is an {{assisted}} reproductive {{method that}} has been used to improve the_ productivity of endangered marsupial fauna. Pouch young from endangered species are transferred to the pouch of related common species, allowing the donor female to produce further offspring without going through the entire lactation cycle. In this project I tested the applicability of cross-fostering in rat-kangaroos (family <b>Potoroidae)</b> using the Tasmanian bettong (Bettongia gaimardt) and the Longnosed potoroo (Potorous tridacty/us) as model species. The effect of a 'transfer age difference' (TAD) between transferred young was investigated to determine the most beneficial time for pouch young transfer: optimising both the mother's reproductive rate and young's survival to independence. Thirty two young were transferred, 18 intra-species and 14 inter-species. The transfers were carried out at various stages of pouch life (1 to 11 weeks) with TADs ranging from 0 to 3 weeks. Nutritional analyses were undertaken on 460 milk samples. Growth measurements and development data were obtained for 110 bettong and 46 potoroo young. The effect of cross-fostering on species specific behaviour patterns was investigated using both video-recordings and direct observations. Twenty one young survived and 19 subsequently bred successfully. Milk composition and production rates {{did not appear to be}} affected by transfers. Comparisons of growth rates between cross-fostered and either fostered or untransferred young showed an advantage for cross-fostered potoroos and a disadvantage for cross-fostered bettong. These were most pronounced during the period between pouch vacation and weaning. During asynchronous intraspecies transfers the younger of the two transferees grew faster than untransferred bettong young. The magnitude of both these effects increased with TAD up to an age difference of three weeks when growth related problems appeared. Although cross-fostered young were influenced by transfer mothers' behaviour, they developed normal pecies-specific behaviour. Difficulties in reuniting cross-fostered young with their own species were probably a consequence of different levels of sociability in the two species. At maturity, all surviving transfer young were successful in both mate recognition and production of offspring. Growth and development of the transfer young are affected by the design of the fransfer procedure. The combination of species, temperament and experience of the transfer mother; the age of young at transfer arid the TAD all affect the outcome. The accessibility of the young in the pouch enables progress monitoring and, where required, early intervention for repeated transfers and/or hand-rearing. Recommendations for the management of transfer animals in captivity are provided...|$|E
