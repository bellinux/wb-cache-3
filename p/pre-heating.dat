25|$|The use of {{live steam}} and exhaust steam {{injectors}} also assists in the <b>pre-heating</b> of boiler feedwater {{to a small}} degree, {{though there is no}} efficiency advantage to live steam injectors. Such <b>pre-heating</b> also reduces the thermal shock that a boiler might experience when cold water is introduced directly. This is further helped by the top feed, where water is introduced to the highest part of the boiler and made to trickle over a series of trays. G.J. Churchward fitted this arrangement to the high end of his domeless coned boilers. Other British lines such as the LBSCR fitted some locomotives with the top feed inside a separate dome forward of the main one.|$|E

Six test plates were joined by two types of filler wire with similar chemical composition to the base metal, and with lower carbon content and slightly higher alloy elements content compared to the first one. Test plates then exerted three different <b>pre-heat</b> and post-heat treatments on both groups. The three types of heat treatments were alternatively without <b>pre-heat</b> and post-heat, with <b>pre-heat</b> only, and finally with <b>pre-heat</b> and post-heat.

40|$|Casting is a {{manufacturing}} process where a solid is melted, heated to proper temperature, and is then poured into a cavity or mold, which contains {{it in the}} proper shape during solidification. Casting process generally is classified as expendable mold or permanent mold. These researches consist of design and fabricate mould for die casting process and analyze the structure and surfaces of the casted materials. Objective of the research is to design and fabricates mold for tensile test specimen, following ASTM E 8 standard and to analysis the surface and structure of casted material. Material {{that has been used}} for mold is mild steel meanwhile casted material is aluminum alloys. Furthermore, this research is consisting of several main processes which mold is design by Solidwork software and simulation for machining process is done by mastercam software. Meanwhile, fabrication process is done by CNC milling machine and finally perform casting process to produce casted materials. Subsequently, these researches were carried out in order to analyze the effect of surface roughness, dimension and thickness values on casted material by 3 different <b>pre-heated</b> temperatures. For these experiments, 3 measurements were measured at 3 casted materials from three different <b>pre-heated</b> mold temperatures. Therefore, 100 °c, 250 °c and 350 °c temperatures were tested to observe the effects of surface roughness, dimension and thickness of casted material. For surface roughness,the analysis of results indicated the value of surface roughness does not affected by different preheated temperature. Other than that, the values of thickness and dimensions of the casted material were slightly decreased at different <b>pre-heated</b> temperature. When the dimension and thickness <b>pre-heated</b> at 150 °c, the values decreased compared with other <b>pre-heated</b> temperature. For <b>pre-heated</b> mold temperature 150 °c, the dimension and thickness values are 8. 18 mm and 3. 29 mm. Meanwhile, for 250 °c and 350 °c <b>pre-heated</b> mold temperature, the dimension and thickness values is 12. 55 mm, 12. 57 mm, 3. 37 mm and 3. 54 mm. For pre- heated temperature 200 °c and 350 °c, the values of dimension and thickness not significantly different. In addition, the morphology examinations through scanning electron microscope (SEM) were examined in order to investigate the effects of porosity defects by different <b>pre-heated</b> mold temperature. The result shows that porosity still occurred at casted material with different <b>pre-heated</b> mold temperatures. However, for pre- heated 150 °c mold temperature, porosity occurred more than other <b>pre-heated</b> mold temperature. It proved that the undesirable <b>pre-heated</b> mold temperatures causes more porosity will occurred on casted material. The appropriate <b>pre-heated</b> temperature is 280 °c and 350 °c for aluminum alloys to produce good casted products...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the {{principles}} underlying the revamping of <b>pre-heat</b> trains to save energy through increased heat recovery. For brevity, we do not consider throughput changes. Only <b>pre-heat</b> train performance is considered. The interaction between <b>pre-heat</b> train and crude oil distillation column performance is considered elsewhere. The principles underlying the design of new <b>pre-heat</b> trains are also considered elsewhere. That study shows that that <b>pre-heat</b> trains differ from general heat recovery networks in four important respects: (i) The heat demand is dominated by a single 'cold' stream; (ii) Rather than having a distinct 'pinch point', the composite curves are often close over quite a large region; (iii) The heat demand can be broken up into two or three distinct processing regions and the temperatures of these divisions are fixed and more significant than the 'pinch point' itself; (iv) The rate of fouling encountered in <b>pre-heat</b> train exchangers is dependent upon crude oil velocity and exchanger wall temperature. This means that the 'pinch technology principle' of matching the hottest hot stream with the cold stream at its hottest point, first proposed by Ponton & Donaldson, does not necessarily apply with <b>pre-heat</b> trains. When it comes to revamping projects, <b>pre-heat</b> trains differ from general problems in other important aspects. The first is that pressure drop considerations are very important. The pumps used to drive the crude through the train are very expensive. The designer will therefore seek to achieve the targets without pump replacement. Pressure drop is very strongly affected by fouling and allowance will have been made for this in the pump specification. There is, as shown below, a need to consider the hydraulic effects of fouling during retrofit projects. Finally, exchanger technologies which mitigate fouling are becoming established and should be considered during revamp design...|$|R

25|$|Both {{the fresh}} water {{production}} and the waste brine from the evaporator are led through an output cooler. This acts as a heat exchanger with the inlet seawater, <b>pre-heating</b> it to improve efficiency. The plant may operate at either a low pressure or slight vacuum, according to design. As the evaporator works at pressure, not under vacuum, boiling may be violent. To avoid the risk of priming and a carry over of saltwater into the vapour, the evaporator is divided by a bubble cap separator.|$|E
25|$|Choosing {{the right}} heat {{exchanger}} (HX) requires {{some knowledge of}} the different heat exchanger types, {{as well as the}} environment where the unit must operate. Typically in the manufacturing industry, several differing types of heat exchangers are used for just one process or system to derive the final product.

With sufficient knowledge of heat exchanger types and operating requirements, an appropriate selection can be made to optimise the process.|$|E

25|$|The lower {{temperature}} of cooking (the boiling point of water) {{is a significant}} safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic. Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. <b>Pre-heating</b> the food in a microwave oven before putting it into the grill or pan reduces {{the time needed to}} heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes, however unlike deep-frying, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels.
