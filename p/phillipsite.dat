40|$|Electron {{microprobe}} {{data are}} presented for clinopyroxenes, plagioclases, palagonites, smectites, celadonites, and zeolites in Hole 462 A sheet-flow basalts and Site 585 volcaniclastic sediments. Glomerocrystic clinopyroxenes in Hole 462 A are predominantly Ti-poor augites with minor fractionation to ferroaugites in rim portions. Quenched plumose clinopyroxenes show considerable variation from Ca-rich to Ca-poor augites, although all {{are characterized by}} being Tirich and Cr-poor relative to the glomerocrysts. Two differentiated series of Site 585 pyroxene compositions, calcic augite and diopside-salite, demonstrate the coexistence, in the vitric and lithic clasts, of tholeiitic and alkali basalt types, respectively. Plagioclase compositions in all samples are mainly labradorites, although some zoned Hole 462 A glomerocrysts range from An 73 to An 20 and are characterized by high Mg and Fe contents in the more calcic varieties. The K content of the plagioclases is highest in the more sodic crystals, although the overall higher orthoclase component of Site 585 plagioclases reflects the generally higher bulk-rock K content. The compositions of both secondary smectites and celadonites are similar irrespective of the alteration location (glass, matrix, vesicles, etc.), although brown smectites replacing interstitial glass have marginally higher total Fe contents than pale green and yellow smectites. Analyzed zeolites are mainly <b>phillipsites</b> with variable alkali content, and, together with associated celadonite, represent late-stage alteration repositories for K under mildly oxidizing conditions.

40|$|Mt Etinde eruptions are dated at 0. 65 Ma. it {{is located}} on the SW oceanic border of Mt Cameroon, and is {{composed}} essentially of nephenilitic rocks. The weathering of nephelinites has resulted in the formation of a 150 cm deep Andic Cambisol (Humic) consisting of three horizons: Ah/Bw/C. Mineral weathering was studied in detail in two profiles: one (P- 1) developed from unaltered nephelinite (nephelinite(U)) and the other (P- 2) formed from hydrothermally altered nephelinite (nephelinite(H)). Emphasis was on the impact of hydrothermal alterations on weathering profiles, to characterise the signature of halloysite in nephelinitic regoliths and to discuss the evolution of Mt Etinde soils on the Quaternary nephelinitic parent rocks. The mineralogy of nephelinite(U) consists predominantly of clinopyroxene, nepheline, leucite, hauyne, titano-magnetite, perovskite, apatite and sphene. Nephelinite(H) differs from nephelinite(U) by phillipsite-calcite occurrence. The main weathering products are halloysites (1 -nm and 0. 7 -nm) and minor occurrence of gibbsite and hematite. SEM micro morphological examination coupled with microprobe analyses showed halloysites resulting from in situ alterations of feldspathoids, <b>phillipsites</b> and clinopyroxenes. 1 -nm hydrated halloysite neoformation characterises the alteromorphs of the saprolite while 1 -nm and 0. 7 -nm halloysite coexist in the Bw and the Ah horizons of both soils. During weathering, these halloysites had a chemical dependence with parent mineral as follows: Ce-rich halloysite characterises alteromorph after phillipsite; Fe-rich halloysite, alteromorph after clinopyroxene: Ca-rich halloysite alteromorph, after hauyne; and K-rich halloysite, alteromorph after leucite. Ce-rich halloysite is a tracer of the hydrothermal impact in soils profile. The Si/Al ratio is also characteristic of the parent mineral. Therefore, the availability of Si is the only factor that controlled the formation of 1 -nm halloysite {{at the base of the}} saprolite while the presence of 1 -nm and 0. 7 halloysite in the upper part of the saprolite, the Bw horizon and the Ah horizon suggesting only time controls of the evolution of the profiles by both kinetic (wet-dry seasons) and thermodynamic (Si-bearing) factors. Gibbsite occurs only in the nephelinite(H) soil. Its presence is due to the hydrothermal alteration which favoured the development of an intense microporosity allowing the elimination of silica. The study highlighted the influence of past hydrothermal activity on the recent weathering process in the humid tropical area...|$|R
40|$|The Cherokee Group of {{southern}} Iowa {{consists of a}} complex sequence of sediments including numerous coals. Lateral relationships of the coal seams are unclear {{on the basis of}} lithologic evidence alone. Preliminary palynological studies suggested the need for detailed examination of vertical variability of miospore populations within selected coal seams as a supplement to routine channel sample analyses for biostratigraphic correlation. A thick coal of uncertain stratigraphic relations, designated CP- 19 - 4, was sampled to test the utility of detailed miospore profile evaluation. CP- 19 - 4 yielded a diverse, well-preserved miospore population with marked vertical variation, appearing to relate closely to gross petrologic variability of coal lithotypes. Three major miospore associations were distinguished, dividing the seam into nearly equal sub-units;—a lower interval, dominated by gymnospermous prepollen and pollen grains, designated the Florinites interval; a middle interval, characterized by an abundance of lycopsid-related spores, designated the Densosporites-Crassispora interval; and an upper interval, dominated by the arborescent lycopsid spore Lycospora granulate, designated the Lycospora interval. The overall miospore assemblage is equivalent in age to that of the Pope Creek Coal of the Illinois Basin. A paleoecologic reconstruction of the coal swamp depositional history is suggested {{on the basis of the}} miospore profile. The distribution of specific miospores within the seam indicates a series of depositional events, evidence of which may be traceable laterally and useful for correlation. A comparison with coals obtained from other cores illustrates the utility of the approach in complex stratigraphic sections. Formal taxonomic information is provided for 171 miospore species; eight new genera, 13 new species and 4 new combinations are proposed.

40|$|Zeolites {{have been}} used in {{agriculture}} since the 1960 s, due to the effectiveness of these crystalline microporous solids as soil amendments for plant growth, their cation exchange capacity (CEC) and slow-release fertilizer properties. Most work on slow-release fertilizers has focused on natural Clinoptilolite, <b>Phillipsite</b> and Chabazite. The aim {{of this study was to}} synthesize zeolites, study their effectiveness as soil amendments and their ability to act as controlled release fertilizers to decrease nitrate leaching. Nitrate pollution of groundwater is a major agro-environmental concern. The zeolites <b>Phillipsite</b> and Linde-type F were synthesized from aluminosilicate gels; ion exchanged to introduce ammonium and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques, both before and after ion exchange. Ammoniumexchanged Phillipsites (natural and synthetic), ammonium-exchanged synthetic Linde-type F (the zeolite having highest affinity towards ammonium) and ammonium exchanged Phillipsites (high crystalline and high aluminium) were compared with conventional NPK fertilizer. Three glasshouse experiments were performed to study the effects of zeolite-amended soils on maize growth. Ion exchanged synthetic and natural Phillipsites were first used as soil amendments (w/w 2, 4, 8 % zeolite to soil). Synthetic <b>Phillipsite,</b> at 2 % loading, resulted in the most significant improvement in both plant growth and phased ammonium release. The synthetic ammonium-exchanged zeolites <b>Phillipsite</b> and Linde-type F (at w/w 1, 2, 4 %) were then compared; synthetic <b>Phillipsite,</b> at 2 % loading, again resulted in the most significant plant growth response with an increase (≥ 15 %) in shoot dry weight and a decrease (≥ 30 %) in nitrate leaching. Experiments using unexchanged synthetic <b>Phillipsite</b> (at w/w 2 %), but with added NPK fertilizer, showed increased plant growth and decreased nitrate leaching, compared with parallel experiments containing unexchanged synthetic Linde-type F (at w/w 2 %) and a conventional fertilizer amended soil. This revealed the beneficial effect of <b>Phillipsite</b> for soil amendment, even without ion exchange to the ammonium form. To study the physico-chemical properties affecting the release of ammonium from the <b>Phillipsite</b> framework; high crystalline/low aluminium and low crystalline/high aluminium forms were synthesized and ion exchanged. Both forms were introduced as soil amendments (at w/w 1 and 2 %) and experiments showed that the lower zeolite crystallinity decreased cation exchange and therefore decreased nitrate leaching. Experimental results from the glasshouse experiments and cation exchange capacity (CEC) experiments suggest that synthetic <b>Phillipsite,</b> at lower loadings (1 and 2 % w/w zeolite to soil) have most potential as soil amendments for both plant growth and controlled-release applications. This conclusion is supported by soil leachate and shoots dry weight analysis. Furthermore, <b>Phillipsite,</b> synthesized in a low crystalline and low ammonium form, may be an even better soil amendment for controlled release of ammonium, which will thereby further decrease nitrate pollution.

The siliceous <b>phillipsite</b> preferred the larger cation more strongly for the Na-K system, and Na more strongly for the Na-Ca system than the aluminous phil-lipsite.

The expedition was carried out as a research cooperation between Indonesia and French Governments using Marion Dufresne Research Vessel, belonging to IFRTP (French Institute for Polar Research). Within this sample, the <b>phillipsite</b> minerals were firstly found by the first author. Using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) at the magnification of x 1, 000 for group and up to x 20, 000 for individual photos, the nannoplanktons were shown to accumulate on the <b>phillipsite</b> minerals as a binding matrix. Different directions and velocity of the bottom current when the <b>phillipsite</b> minerals were originated, might have contributed in binding of the various mineral shapes. The calcareous nannoplankton in the studied area is preserved within the sediments between 3880 m to 3914 m depths below sea level (bsl). This interval possibly located between Lysocline and Carbonate Compensation Depth (CCD), is indicated by the presence of well preserved calcite minerals and calcareous nannoplankton within sediments. Discoaster multiradiatus, the dominant fossil within the sediments in the studied area, is Paleocene in age. Therefore, the binding of nannoplakton accumulation as a matrix of the <b>phillipsite</b> minerals occurred as a postgenetic deposition. </p...|$|E

H 20 + I. IH 4 SiO 4 + 0. 43 K +. Sodium and potassium activities of brines associated with both <b>phillipsite</b> and analcime were used to es-timate the equilibrium constant for this reaction as 3. 04 • 10 - 5. The AG O value for the reaction is + 6. 2 kcal/mole at 25 ~ and 1 atm pressure. The estimated AG o value ofphillipsite, using this reaction, is- 1072. 8 kcal/mole at 25 ~ and 1 atm...|$|E
