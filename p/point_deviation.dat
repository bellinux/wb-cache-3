40|$|Real-time reverse {{transcription}} followed by {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT–PCR) is the most suitable method for the detection and quantification of mRNA. It offers high sensitivity, good reproducibility and a wide quantification range. Today, relative expression is increasingly used, where {{the expression of a}} target gene is standardised by a non-regulated reference gene. Several mathematical algorithms have been developed to compute an expression ratio, based on real-time PCR efficiency and the crossing <b>point</b> <b>deviation</b> of an unknown sample versus a control. But all published equations and available models for the calculation of relative expression ratio allow only for the determination of a single transcription difference between one control and one sample. Therefore a new software tool was established, named REST© (relative expression software tool), which compares two groups, with up to 16 data points in a sample and 16 in a control group, for reference and up to four target genes. The mathematical model used is based on the PCR efficiencies and the mean crossing <b>point</b> <b>deviation</b> between the sample and control group. Subsequently, the expression ratio results of the four investigated transcripts are tested for significance by a randomisation test. Herein, development and application of REST© is explained and the usefulness of relative expression in real-time PCR using REST© is discussed. The latest software version of REST© and examples for the correct use can be downloaded at [URL]...|$|E

The high Fermi velocity under uniaxial strain and strain tunable work function could promote potential applications of silicene in nanoelectronic devices.|$|E

30|$|We perform first-principles {{calculations}} of mechanical and electronic properties of silicene under uniaxial strains. Poisson's ratio and the rigidity of silicene show strong chirality dependence under large uniaxial strains. The ultimate strains of silicene with uniaxial strain {{are smaller than}} those with biaxial strain. We find that uniaxial strains induce Dirac <b>point</b> <b>deviation</b> from the high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone and semimetal-metal transitions. Therefore, no bandgap opens under the uniaxial strain. Due to its peculiar structure and variable sp 3 /sp 2 ratio of the chemical bond, the deviation directions of Dirac points from the high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone and variation of Fermi velocities of silicene exhibit significant difference from those of graphene. Fermi velocities show strong anisotropy {{with respect to the}} wave vector directions and change slightly before the semimetal-metal transition. We also find that the work function of silicene increases monotonously with the increasing uniaxial strains.|$|E

The concept of the optimization pump operation conditions is to adjust the operation point of the pump to obtain higher reliability {{at the cost of}} lower system efficiency using a joint regulation of valve and frequency convertor.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel proxy caching scheme for {{video-on-demand}} (VoD) services. Our approach {{is based on}} the observation that streaming video users searching for some specific content or scene pay most attention to the initial delay, while a small shift of the starting point is acceptable. We present results from subjective VoD tests that relate waiting time and starting <b>point</b> <b>deviation</b> to user satisfaction. Based on this relationship as well as the dynamically changing popularity of video segments, we propose an efficient segment-based caching algorithm, which maximizes the user satisfaction by trading off between the initial delay and the deviation of starting point. Our caching scheme supports interactive video cassette recorder (VCR) functionalities and enables cache replacement with a much finer granularity compared to previously proposed segment-based approaches. Our experimental results show a significantly im-proved user satisfaction for our scheme compared to conventional caching schemes.

30|$|Our results lend {{support to}} the claim that a worker’s {{knowledge}} of labor market conditions is crucial: “The information a man possesses on the labor market is capital: it was produced at the cost of search, and it yields a higher wage rate than on average would be received in its absence” (Stigler 1962, p. 103). We find that workers’ pessimistic view of the labor market situation lowers their wages—-each 1 percentage <b>point</b> <b>deviation</b> of the perceived unemployment rate from the actual one translates into a reduction in wages of 0.7 % (0.4 % once we control for job and employer attributes). This result is very robust to alternative specifications of the model. In turn, an optimistic view of the labor market has no significant impact on wages. We discuss possible mechanisms driving these results. An overestimation of the unemployment rate leads to concern over one’s own future employment prospects and is therefore likely to reduce perceived bargaining power, lowering reservation wages; its underestimation, on the contrary, could raise reservation wages, but it would render job finding more difficult.|$|E
