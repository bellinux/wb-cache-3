The brushite crystals were grown by single and double diffusion techniques in agar-agar gel at room temperature. Effects of different growth parameters were discussed in single diffusion and double diffusion techniques. Good quality star, needle, platy, rectangular, and <b>prismatic</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>crystals</b> in single diffusion and nuclei with dendritic growth were obtained in double diffusion. These grown nuclei were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

We have synthesized and grown 5 millimeter to 1 centimeter size single crystals of Beta-gallium oxide (Beta-Ga 2 O 3). We used a flux and semi wet method to grow transparent good quality crystals. In the semi-wet method Ga 2 O 3 was synthesized with starting gallium nitrate solution and urea as a nucleation agent. In the flux method we used tin and other metallic flux. This crystal was placed in an alumina crucible and temperature was raised above 1050 degrees Centigrade. After a time period of thirty hours, we observed <b>prismatic</b> and needle <b>shaped</b> <b>crystals</b> of gallium oxide. Scanning electron microscopic studies showed step growth morphology. Crystal was polished to measure the properties. Bandgap was measured 4. 7 electronvolts using the optical absorption curve. Another wide bandgap hexagonal 2 H-SiC was grown by using Si-Al eutectic flux in the graphite crucible. We used slight AlN also as the impurity in the flux. The temperature was raised up to 1050 degrees Centigrade and slowly cooled to 850 degrees Centigrade. Preliminary characterization results of this material are also reported...|$|R

40|$|The surface {{properties}} of single and agglomerated micro-crystals are characterised using the micro-focus X-ray beams available at a third generation synchrotron light source {{together with other}} laboratory facilities. The influence of the crystallisation environment, on the resultant product crystals is studied by both varying the cooling rates during crystallisation and through the addition of impurities and cross-correlated with the morphology and size changes. Unmodified urea crystallised in 99 % ethanol produce needle-like crystals whilst addition of 4 % of biuret in crystallisation of urea produce a more <b>prismatic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>shape.</b> At faster cooling rates smaller sized crystals are produced and vice versa. Dispersive surface energy analysis using inverse gas chromatography (IGC) shows that unmodified urea has lower dispersive surface energy than urea modified by biuret. The dispersive surface energy also increases as the cooling rates increased. Both the morphology changes and surface energy measurements are validated using molecular modelling. The morphological prediction intermolecular force calculations of unmodified urea and urea modified by biuret are used to calculate a weighted value for the whole crystals’ dispersive surface energies. The results are in good agreement with experimental results from IGC. The sorption of urea crystals on water moisture showed that unmodified urea samples adsorbed water higher than urea modified by biuret by the observation {{of the percentage of}} mass change with respect to the relative humidity. The study of variability within powdered samples was found that no significant different in the unit cell parameters values of each single crystals. The orientation relationship between agglomerated micro-crystalline particles of aspirin showed the agglomerates tend to interact at the faces that have ability to form bonding. In urea samples, most of the agglomerates are mostly aligned due to epitaxy growth of the crystals.

40|$|Otoconia are calcified protein {{matrices}} {{within the}} gravity-sensing organs of the vertebrate vestibular system. These protein matrices {{are thought to}} originate from the supporting or hair cells in the macula during development. Previous studies of mammalian calcitic, barrel-shaped otoconia revealed an organized protein matrix consisting of a thin peripheral layer, a well-defined organic core and a flocculent matrix inbetween. No studies have reported the microscopic organization of the aragonitic otoconial matrix, despite its protein characterization. Pote et al. (1993 b) used densitometric methods and inferred that prismatic (aragonitic) otoconia have a peripheral protein distribution, compared to that described for the barrel-shaped, calcitic otoconia of birds, mammals, and the amphibian utricle. By using tannic acid as a negative stain, we observed three kinds of organic matrices in preparations of fixed, decalcified saccular otoconia from the adult newt: (1) fusiform shapes with a homogenous electron-dense matrix; (2) singular and multiple strands of matrix; and (3) more significantly, <b>prismatic</b> <b>shapes</b> outlined by a peripheral organic matrix. These <b>prismatic</b> <b>shapes</b> remain following removal of the gelatinous matrix, revealing an internal array of organic matter.

40|$|In this work, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} to modify the shape and {{nanostructure}} of core-shell materials, which have been usually generated on the basis of amorphous spherical cores. Novel core-shell silicate particles, each of which consists of a silicalite- 1 zeolite crystal core and mesoporous shell (ZCMS), were synthesized for the first time. The ZCMS core-shell particles are unique because they are of pseudohexagonal <b>prismatic</b> <b>shape</b> and have hierarchical porosity of both a uniform microporous core and a mesoporous shell coexisting in a particle framework. The nonspherical bimodal porous core-shell particles were then utilized as templates to fabricate a new carbon replica structure. Interestingly, the pore replication process was carried out only through the mesopores in the shell, and not through the micropores due to the narrower micropore size in the core, resulting in nonspherical carbon nanocases with a hollow core and mesoporous shell (HCMS) structure. Nonspherical silica nanocases with HCMS structure were also generated by replication using the carbon nanocases as templates, which are not possible to synthesize through other synthetic methods. Interestingly, the pseudohexagonal <b>prismatic</b> <b>shape</b> of the zeolite crystals was transferred onto the carbon and silica nanocases...|$|R
