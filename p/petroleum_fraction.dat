The prokinetic, laxative, and antidiarrheal activities of M. [*]nigra were assessed in mice, while isolated rabbit jejunum and guinea-pig ileum were used to explore insight into mechanism(s). At 30 and 70 [*]mg/kg, the crude extract of M. [*]nigra (Mn. Cr) exhibited atropine-sensitive prokinetic and laxative effects, similar to carbachol (CCh). While at higher doses (100, 300, and 500 [*]mg/kg), Mn. Cr offered protection against castor oil-induced diarrhea. In rabbit jejunum, Mn. Cr and its chloroform fraction inhibited CCh-induced contractions more potently compared with high K(+) (80 [*]mm). Conversely, <b>petroleum</b> <b>fraction</b> was more potent against high-K(+) -induced contractions. At 0. 01 [*]mg/mL, Mn. Cr caused a parallel shift in acetylcholine concentration-response curves (CRCs) followed by a non-parallel shift at 0. 03 [*]mg/mL, similar to dicyclomine. At further tested concentrations, Mn.

Surface tension and density measurements have been made on synthetic hydrocarbon mixtures simulating real SC 8, SC 10, SC 13 groups, their mixtures and a kerosene sample covering the range SC 4 -SC 14 {{in order to determine}} their experimental parachors. Two methods to compute the parachors of fractions are proposed based on the equation of Broseta, the correlations of Riazi and Al-Sahhaf and the pseudocompound approach of Daubert. The first, denoted method I, is given byPa(cut) =[0. 85 - 0. 19 ω(cut) ]Tc 12 / 11 (cut) Pc 9 / 11 (cut) and the second, denoted method II, byPa(cut) =zPPa(P) +zAPa(A) +zNPa(N) where Pa is the parachor of the cut, ω the acentric factor, P, N and A the P/N/A components, zP/N/A the mole fractions of the P/N/A components and the other terms have their usual meaning. Both of these methods were found to compute the parachors of mixtures representing the SC 8, SC 10 and SC 13 groups, mixtures of these groups and the kerosene sample with an absolute deviation of 2 %. Comparison of the experimental parachors with calculated ones show that the parachor of a <b>petroleum</b> <b>fraction</b> depends not only on its molecular weight but also on the ratio of the P/N/A components.
