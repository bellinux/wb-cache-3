50|$|A {{variety of}} {{pathophysiological}} mechanisms {{have been proposed}} for <b>pouchitis,</b> but the precise pathogenesis (biological cause) remains unknown. A pilot study {{on the effect of}} reducing dietary FODMAP intake on bowel function in patients without a colon ran by Croagh C, Shepherd SJ, Berryman M, Muir JG, Gibson PR indicates there might be a relation between <b>Pouchitis</b> and FODMAP content of diets.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of <b>pouchitis</b> include Increased stool frequency, urgency, incontinence, nocturnal seepage, {{abdominal}} cramping, pelvic discomfort, and arthralgia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pouchitis</b> is an {{inflammation}} of the ileo-anal pouch, which occurs particularly {{in cases where the}} pouch has been created to manage colitis. The symptoms are normally somewhat similar but less acute than those of colitis, and include (sometimes bloody) diarrhea, urgency or difficulty in passing stools, and, in few cases, pain. The standard treatment for <b>pouchitis</b> is a 7- to 10-day course of a combination ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} {{of a first}} episode of <b>pouchitis</b> at 1, 5 and 10 years post-operatively is 15%, 33% and 45% respectively.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms of cuffitis mimic {{those of}} <b>pouchitis.</b> In addition, {{patients}} with cuffitis often present with small volume bloody bowel movements. Often, cuffitis can produce {{the appearance of}} bright red blood on tissue.|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} where the pouch was formed to manage colitis, {{inflammation}} can return to the pouch {{in a similar way}} to the original inflammation in the colon. This is known as <b>pouchitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Endoscopy in {{patients}} with <b>pouchitis</b> usually reveals erythematous pouch mucosa, loss of pseudocolonic vasculature or other architecture, and friability of the mucosa. Biopsies show evidence of inflammatory cells or red blood cells in the lamina propria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pouchitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the ileal pouch (an artificial rectum surgically created out of ileal gut tissue in patients who have undergone a colectomy), which is created {{in the management of}} patients with ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, FAP, or, rarely, other colitides.|$|E
5000|$|Alicaforsen is an {{antisense}} oligonucleotide therapeutic that targets the messenger RNA {{for the production}} of human ICAM-1 protein. [...] It was discovered by Ionis Pharmaceuticals (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals) and as of 2017 was under development by Atlantic Healthcare for <b>pouchitis</b> in an enema formulation.|$|E
50|$|The {{duration}} of <b>pouchitis</b> {{is defined as}} acute (less {{than or equal to}} four weeks) or chronic (four weeks or more) and the pattern classified as infrequent (1-2 acute episodes), relapsing (three or fewer episodes) or continuous.

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{rebamipide}} can fight the damaging effects of NSAIDs on the GIT mucosa, and more recently, the small intestine. It has also been studied {{for the treatment of}} Behçet's disease. It was shown to successfully treat <b>pouchitis</b> in a single-N study after first-line therapies for the condition were unsuccessful. Some studies have shown effectiveness in presbyacusis (age-related hearing loss).|$|E
50|$|The company reformulated alicaforsen as an enema {{and three}} small trials were {{published}} between 2004 and 2006, an open label trial in chronic <b>pouchitis</b> and two randomized trials in ulcerative colitis (UC); in the UC trials the drug missed its primary endpoint of improvements at 6 weeks, but showed a better {{effect in the}} longer term (between 18 and 30 weeks).|$|E
50|$|Symptom {{severity}} {{does not}} always correlate with severity of endoscopically- or histologically-evaluated pouch inflammation. Additionally, these symptoms are not necessarily specific for <b>pouchitis,</b> asthey may arise from other inflammatory or functional pouch disorders such as Crohn's disease of the pouch, cuffitis, pouch sinus, or irritable pouch syndrome. The most reliable tool for diagnosis is endoscopy combined with histologic features (derived from tissue biopsies obtained during endoscopy).|$|E
50|$|There is no {{clinically}} approved {{treatment for}} pouchitis.First line treatment is usually with antibiotics, specifically with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Ampicillin or Piperacillin {{can also be}} considered as alternatives to empiric Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole). Administration of metronidazole at a high daily dose of 20 mg/kg can cause symptomatic peripheral neuropathology in up to 85% of patients. This can be a limiting factor in the use of maintenance metronidazole to suppress chronic <b>pouchitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|CD and UC are chronic {{inflammatory}} diseases, {{and are not}} medically curable. However, {{ulcerative colitis}} can in most cases be cured by proctocolectomy, although this may not eliminate extra-intestinal symptoms. An ileostomy will collect feces in a bag. Alternatively, a pouch can be created from the small intestine; this serves as the rectum and prevents {{the need for a}} permanent ileostomy. A small percentage of patients with ileo-anal pouches do have to manage occasional or chronic <b>pouchitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|A vague, or even {{completely}} fake, {{medical or}} psychiatric label {{given to the}} patient or to the medical records department for essentially non-medical reasons, such as to reassure the patient by providing an official-sounding label, to make the provider look effective, or to obtain approval for treatment. This term is also used as a derogatory label for disputed, poorly described, overused, or questionably classified diagnoses, such as <b>pouchitis</b> and senility, or to dismiss diagnoses that amount to overmedicalization, such as the labeling of normal responses to physical hunger as reactive hypoglycemia.|$|E
50|$|Antisense oligonucleotides {{have been}} {{researched}} as potential drugs for {{diseases such as}} cancers (including lung cancer, colorectal carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, malignant glioma and malignant melanoma), diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy and diseases such as asthma, arthritis and <b>pouchitis</b> with an inflammatory component. As of 2016, several antisense drugs have {{been approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): fomivirsen as a treatment for cytomegalovirus retinitis, mipomersen for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy.|$|E
50|$|Alicaforsen {{is a first}} {{generation}} antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to bind specifically to the human ICAM-1 messenger RNA through Watson-Crick base pair interactions in order to subdue expression of ICAM-1. ICAM-1 propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes (white blood cells) into inflamed tissue. Increased expression of ICAM-1 has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of ulcerative colitis, <b>pouchitis</b> and Crohn's sufferers where ICAM-1 over production correlated with disease activity. This suggests that ICAM-1 is a potential therapeutic target {{in the treatment of}} these diseases.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pouchitis,</b> a term {{coined by}} Kock to {{describe}} the reservoir ileitis seen in recipients of any pouch procedure, is a common one. [...] Also, the first Kock pouches were not created with any type of valve mechanism. The procedure required additional development, work which Kock continued to advance through further experimentation into the 1970s and 1980s. [...] Early experience showed that 50% of those receiving the procedure would not stay continent afterward. Kock developed what he termed a [...] "nipple valve" [...] in 1972 to help eliminate a portion of these problems. The nipple valve was created from intestinal tissue itself.|$|E
5000|$|Lactobacillus species {{administered}} as {{a single}} probiotic agent is of no benefit in people with irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease. When it is administered {{in combination with other}} probiotics, may help people with irritable bowel syndrome, although in a minority of cases may cause negative side effects, uncertainty remains around which type of probiotic works best, and around the size of the effect. Lactobacillus and bifidobacteria probiotics can reduce clinical symptoms of <b>pouchitis</b> and cholangitis. L. acidophilus is used to prevent necrotizing entercolitis and other neonatal infections. Lactobacillus have been recently shown to counteract the long term side effect of exposure to antibiotics in early life in mice.|$|E
50|$|Pouchoscopy is a {{minimally}} invasive endoscopic procedure to examine an ileo-anal pouch, {{a replacement for}} the colon / rectum which is surgically created from the small intestine (ileum) as Treatment for ulcerative colitis and {{as a treatment for}} other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, a preventative measure in certain genetic illnesses such as FAP or HNPCC or as a procedure in the treatment of colon cancer. Typically, a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube is passed through the anus. Although it may determine the integrity of the J-pouch (hence the name pouchoscopy), it is much more common to perform a pouchogram to determine the pouch's integrity (a necessary step in preparing for reversal of the temporary ileostomy, or takedown surgery). A pouchoscopy is normally part of a routine follow up and is used to confirm diagnosis of <b>pouchitis</b> and cuffitis.|$|E
5000|$|Tropomyosins {{have been}} implicated in the {{autoimmune}} disease ulcerative colitis, a disease of the colon that is characterised by ulcers or open sores. The link between this disease and tropomyosin was first acknowledged in a study that found blood serum taken from 95% of patients with ulcerative colitis contained antibodies that reacted positively to tropomyosin. Additional studies have confirmed these results, but also identify Tropomyosin 5 and Tropomyosin 1 as the primary tropomyosins involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Tropomyosin 5 has been related {{to the development of}} <b>pouchitis</b> in the ileal pouch following surgery for ulcerative colitis. The elevated number of IgG-producing cells in the colonic mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients is largely committed to producing IgG against Tropomyosin 5-related epitopes. Tropomyosin 5 is, therefore, capable of inducing a significant T-cell response. [...] A physicochemical analysis of common structural motifs present in 109 human autoantigens revealed that tropomyosins have the highest number of such motifs, and thus a very high propensity to act as autoantigens.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Sogin’s {{molecular}} phylogeny from ribosomal RNA sequences provided {{a framework for}} reconstructing the evolution of microbial eukaryotes. He documented early diverging eukaryotic lineages, giving the earliest evidence of a link between animals and fungi, {{to the exclusion of}} all other eukaryotes. His work demonstrated that the AIDS-related pathogen Pneumocystis shares a recent common ancestor with fungi instead of with the parasitic protozoa that cause malaria. He also discovered the “rare biosphere” which represents most of Earth’s microbial diversity. Sogin was the first to use PCR to amplify and sequence ribosomal RNA genes and to use next generation DNA sequencing to characterize complex microbial communities, which now dominates the field of molecular microbial ecology, including efforts underway within the Human Microbiome Project. He has contributed to analytical strategies to determine the taxonomic identity of marker gene surveys and with David Mark Welch of the Josephine Bay Paul Center has established the Visualization of Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) website, which offers tools for comparing microbial community populations. As part of the Census of Marine Life, Sogin formed and led the International Census of Marine Microbes. His group currently collaborates on studies of human microbiome dynamics with Dr. Eugene Chang of the University of Chicago. They study <b>pouchitis,</b> a model for ulcerative colitis. Dr. Sogin also serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology (formerly Journal of Protozoology), Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Protist (formerly Archiv fur Protistenkunde), Applied and Environmental Microbiology, and Environmental Microbiology.|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} {{and characteristics of}} reservoir inflammation after restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis were studied {{in a series of}} 179 patients. The median follow up time was 27 months (range 6 - 80). <b>Pouchitis</b> occurred in 36 patients (20 %) and nine of these (5 %) developed a chronic, persisting <b>pouchitis.</b> There were no pouch failures as a result of <b>pouchitis</b> and no significant adverse effect on longterm functional outcome. The overall cumulative risk to develop <b>pouchitis</b> four years after surgery was 23 %. The risk of <b>pouchitis</b> is unpredictable on clinical grounds except that there were significantly less patients with left sided colitis in the group who subsequently developed <b>pouchitis.</b> Morphological and histochemical studies showed a greater degree of colonic metaplasia in the pouch mucosa in patients with <b>pouchitis</b> and patients with a chronic <b>pouchitis</b> had the highest degree of changes.

40|$|<b>Pouchitis</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} complication of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for treatment of ulcerative colitis. There are several possible explanations. Among them, {{we focus on the}} one that considers <b>pouchitis</b> as an extracolonic manifestation of ulcerative colitis. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between <b>pouchitis</b> and extra-intestinal manifestations (EIM), which are frequent in these patients. Sixty patients underwent restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal J pouch (IPAA) from September 1984 to December 1998. <b>Pouchitis</b> was defined by clinical, endoscopic, and histologic criteria. The following extra-intestinal manifestations were studied: articular, cutaneous, hepatobiliary, ocular, genitourinary, and growth failure. Thirteen patients, of which 10 were female (76. 9 %), developed one or more episodes of <b>pouchitis.</b> Twelve patients of this group (92. 3 %) presented some kind of extra-intestinal manifestation, 4 pre-operatively (exclusively), 2 post-operatively (exclusively), and 6 both pre- and post-operatively (1. 7 per patient). Twenty patients (42. 7 %) of the 47 without <b>pouchitis</b> did not present extra-intestinal manifestations; 10 / 35 (28. 5 %) of females had <b>pouchitis,</b> compared to 3 / 35 (12. 0 %) of men. <b>Pouchitis</b> was more frequent among females, though not statistically significant. EIM increases the risk of <b>pouchitis.</b> <b>Pouchitis</b> is related to EIM in 92. 3 % of cases, corroborating the hypothesis that it could be an extracolonic manifestation of ulcerative colitis...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Pouchitis</b> is {{the most}} common {{complication}} of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Our previous study suggested that symptoms alone are not reliable for the diagnosis of <b>pouchitis.</b> The most commonly used diagnostic instrument is the 18 -point <b>pouchitis</b> disease activity index consisting of three principal component scores: symptom, endoscopy, and histology. Despite its popularity, the <b>pouchitis</b> disease activity index has mainly been a research tool because of costs of endoscopy (especially with histology), complexity in calculation, and time delay in determining histology scores. It is not known whether pouch endoscopy without biopsy can reliably diagnose <b>pouchitis</b> in symptomatic patients. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether omitting histologic evaluation from the <b>pouchitis</b> disease activity index significantl...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{etiology}} of <b>pouchitis</b> after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is unknown, its manifestations resemble those of nonspecific inflammatory bowel disease, including, anecdotally, the apparent ability to evoke extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to determine in what manner <b>pouchitis</b> and EIMs were associated. The computerized records of 819 consecutive patients who underwent IPAA between January 1981 and December 1988 were reviewed. Eighty-five patients were excluded (because of incomplete follow-up, death, or permanent ileostomy). Follow-up of the remaining 734 patients was complete (mean, 41 months). The mean age was 32 years and the ratio of men to women was 1 : 1. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was performed for chronic ulcerative colitis in 91 % of patients and for familial adenomatous polyposis in 9 %. <b>Pouchitis</b> occurred in 31 % of chronic ulcerative colitis patients and 6 % of familial adenomatous polyposis patients (p less than 0. 01). The mean time to first occurrence was 17 months. <b>Pouchitis</b> recurred in 61 % of patients at risk. Patients with preoperative and postoperative EIMs had significantly higher rates of <b>pouchitis</b> than did patients without EIMs (39 % preoperative EIMs versus 26 % with no EIMs, p less than 0. 001; 53 % postoperative EIMs versus 25 % with no EIMs, p less than 0. 001). Of patients with <b>pouchitis</b> in whom EIMs resolved after IPAA but then recurred (n = 12), EIMs recurred when <b>pouchitis</b> occurred and abated when <b>pouchitis</b> was treated in seven patients. We concluded that <b>pouchitis</b> occurred frequently after IPAA and that patients with EIMs were at higher risk of developing <b>pouchitis</b> than were patients who never had EIMs. Furthermore some patients experienced a temporal relationship between flares of EIMs and <b>pouchitis.</b> These results imply that <b>pouchitis</b> may be a novel manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease persisting after operation...|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Pouchitis</b> can be {{classified}} as occasional or relapsing and about 5 % of patients develops a chronic inflammatory condition. Chronic <b>pouchitis</b> {{can lead to the}} pouch failure. Aims of our study were to identify possible relationship between chronic/relapsing <b>pouchitis</b> and mucosa-associated microbiota, systemic and local inflammation, local cytokines network and toll like receptors expression. Patients and methods In this prospective study 32 consecut- ive patients who underwent restorative proctocolectomy, coming for follow up endoscopy in our out-patient department were recruited in 2007. Clinical disease activity was classified using <b>Pouchitis</b> Disease Activity Index. During pouch endoscopy biopsies from the ileal pouch were obtained to culture bacteria adherent to the mucosa and perform routine histology. Systemic inflammatory status was graded according to blood cell count, ESR, CRP, and albuminemia. Local inflammatory status was assessed with faecal lactoferrin levels analyzed by quantitative ELISA. Serum and mucosal levels of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α were measured with immunometric assays. The mucosal expression of toll-like receptors for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (TLR 4) and peptidoglycan (TLR 2) were measured by quantitative Real Time RT-PCR. After a median follow up of 23 (IQR 20 - 24) months the patients were contacted for a reassessment of current and past disease activity. Univariate logistic regression, non parametric statistics and survival analysis were performed. Results Clinical diagnosis of <b>pouchitis</b> (PDAI> 7) had been made in 10 patients in 2007. During the follow up 3 of these patients failed to recover and thus had chronic <b>pouchitis</b> while other 3 of them had relapsing episodes of <b>pouchitis.</b> In patients with chronic/relapsing <b>pouchitis</b> mucosal TLR 2 and TLR 4 were more expressed than in those with no or only one episode of <b>pouchitis</b> (p= 0. 036 and p= 0. 016, respectively). The number of CFU of mucosa-associated Clostridiaceae spp was higher in patients with chronic/relapsing <b>pouchitis</b> than in those with no or only one episode of <b>pouchitis</b> (p= 0. 031). The presence of Clostridiaceae spp adherent to the ileal mucosa was associated to a significant risk of chronic/relapsing <b>pouchitis</b> [OR: 14 (95 % CI 0. 887 - 224. 021), p= 0. 045]. Survival analysis showed that the presence of Clostridiaceae spp wasassociated to earlier <b>pouchitis</b> relapse (p= 0. 019). Conclusion Chronic/relapsing <b>pouchitis</b> is associated to increased expression of mucosal TLR 2 and TLR 4. The populations of mucosa- associated Clostridiaceae spp seemed {{to play a role in}} the pathogenesis of chronic/relaps- ing <b>pouchitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal {{anastomosis}} (IPAA) {{is considered}} the procedure of choice in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) refractory to medical therapy. The incidence of <b>pouchitis</b> is 40 % at 5 years. Ten to 15 % of patients with <b>pouchitis</b> experience chronic <b>pouchitis.</b> AIM: To determine the efficacy of medical therapies {{for the treatment of}} chronic refractory <b>pouchitis</b> in patients undergoing IPAA for UC. METHODS: A systematic computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed between 1966 and February 2016. All original studies reporting remission rates following medical treatment for chronic <b>pouchitis</b> were included. All study designs were considered. Remission was defined according to the individual study. Remission endpoints ranged from 15 days to 10 weeks. Chronic <b>pouchitis</b> was defined by each study. RESULTS: Twenty-one papers were considered eligible. Results from all studies combined suggested that overall remission was obtained in 59 % of patients (95 % CI: 44 - 73 %). Antibiotics significantly induced remission in patients with chronic <b>pouchitis</b> with 74 % remission rate (95 % CI: 56 - 93 %), (P < 0. 001). Biologics significantly induced remission in patients with chronic <b>pouchitis</b> with 53 % remission rate (95 % CI: 30 - 76 %), (P < 0. 001). Steroids, bismuth, elemental diet and tacrolimus all can induce remission but failed to achieve significance. Faecal microbiota transplantation in a single study was not found to achieve remission.
