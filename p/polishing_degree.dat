40|$|The {{effect of}} surface {{polishing}} on the flexural strength of anorthite based porcelainised stoneware was stud-ied. The flexural strength results obtained from both polished and unpolished samples were analysed by using Weibull statistical method. The state of surfaces and microstructures of polished and unpolished samples were also characterised by profilometry and scanning electron microscopy. Typical flexural strength value obtained from anorthite based stoneware body fired at 1210 C was about 100 MPa. The average flexural strength (σm) and Weibull modulus (m) values for as fired, ground, and ground and polished specimens increased sequentially with <b>polishing</b> <b>degree.</b> The surface roughness measurements and microstructure observations {{showed that the}} severity of the surface flaws declined as the polishing process proceeded. The obtainment of better strength behaviour with polishing was attributed to high crystalline to glassy phase ratio of the anorthite based porcelainised stoneware together with the formation of network structure of these anorthite crystals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Research {{has clearly}} shown {{that as the}} skid {{resistance}} of a road surface decreases, the road-based transport crash rate increases. In recognizing the importance of providing safe pavement surfacings for travel during wet weather, most highway controlling authorities in developed countries have skid resistance standards. However, recent {{research has demonstrated that}} there is significant variation in performance between natural aggregates where supposedly high-quality surfacing aggregates (as measured by the Polished Stone Value Test) have not performed well or predictably over an economic asset life in areas of high demand for friction. A comparison is made between the performance of six natural aggregates (greywackes, felsic volcanic rocks and basalts) used in New Zealand as road surfacing dressing. The comparison includes surface friction test results of prepared samples that have undergone accelerated polishing using a new laboratory test method. The coefficient of friction is measured at various stages of polishing by the Dynamic Friction Tester. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs show the characteristics of the microtexture of the aggregate surface before and after accelerated <b>polishing,</b> correlating the <b>degree</b> of surface <b>polishing</b> to the measured skid resistance performance and relating this to the aggregate mineralogy, grain size, and degree of lithification and diagenesis.

40|$|The {{polishing}} {{process in}} the mold and die making industries is nowadays still predominantly done manually. As a consequence of this {{the quality of the}} mold strongly depends on the worker's skill, experience and also on his form on the day, patience and concentration. Furthermore, polishing is in most cases the last manufacturing step of the process chain and occurring surface defects are critical and often a "knock-out-criterion". Until now there exists no systematical acquisition or explanation for the appearance of this polishing defects. This paper shows the results of experiments describing the polishing process and defect mechanisms in order to generate process strategies for manufacturing "defect-free" high-gloss polished tool steel surfaces. Ten different steel grades were analyzed in order to see how the final surface quality is influenced by e. g. the <b>polishing</b> system, the <b>degree</b> of purity or the microstructure. The surface quality is represented by roughness va lues and SEM-images. It could be concluded that the degree of purity and the homogeneity of the steel material are crucial to the final surface quality. The lower the amount of inclusions, the better the surface quality. Furthermore, a classification of the occurred defects during the polishing process is shown in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian {{cancer has}} the lowest {{survival}} rate of the gynecologic cancers because it is predominantly diagnosed in Stages III or IV {{due to the lack}} of reliable symptoms, as well as the lack of efficacious screening techniques. Detection before the malignancy spreads or at the early stage would greatly improve the survival and benefit patient health. In this report, we present an integrated optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) prototype endoscopy system for ovarian tissue characterization. The overall diameter of the prototype endoscope is 5 mm which is suitable for insertion through a standard 5 - 12. 5 mm endoscopic laparoscopic port during minimally invasive surgery. It consists of a ball-lensed OCT sample arm probe, a multimode fiber having the output end <b>polished</b> at 45 <b>degree</b> angle so as to deliver the light perpendicularly for PAI, and a high frequency ultrasound transducer with 35 MHz center frequency. System characterizations of OCT, US and PAI are presented. In addition, results obtained from ex vivo porcine and human ovarian tissues are presented. The optical absorption contrast provided by PAI, the high resolution subsurface morphology provided by OCT, and the deeper tissue structure imaged by US demonstrate the synergy of the combined endoscopy and the superior performance of this hybrid device over each modality alone in ovarian tissue characterization...|$|R
500|$|In {{the years}} between the {{completion}} of his dissertation and habilitation, Weber {{took an interest in}} contemporary social policy. In 1888 he joined the Verein für Socialpolitik, a new professional association of German economists affiliated with the historical school, who saw the role of economics primarily as finding solutions to the social problems of the age and who pioneered large scale statistical studies of economic issues. He also involved himself in politics, joining the left-leaning Evangelical Social Congress. In 1890 the Verein established a research program to examine [...] "the Polish question" [...] or Ostflucht: the influx of Polish farm workers into eastern Germany as local labourers migrated to Germany's rapidly industrialising cities. Weber was put in charge of the study and wrote {{a large part of the}} final report, which generated considerable attention and controversy and marked the beginning of Weber's renown as a social scientist.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the inﬂuence of team project experiences of students (presence and role of a leader; fairness in team projects; conditions supporting teamwork created by a university) on their attitudes towards teamwork, especially the perception of teamwork effectiveness and the preference of working in teams. Methodology: In the study the quantitative research was done among master <b>degree</b> <b>Polish</b> students of Management (105 questionnaires). The measures used for the study were developed specifcally for the study referring to the previous research in the feld. Findings: Results indicate that leaders in team projects and conditions supporting teamwork are connected with the students’ perception of teamwork effectiveness, while the fairness in team projects is connected with students’ preference of working collectively. Research implications: We conclude that in order to develop a positive attitude towards teamwork, the teamwork projects should be better supported by the instructors (especially supporting the emergence of leader(s) and minimising the problem of free riders) and the university should create a climate that facilitates teamworking, otherwise team projects might negatively inﬂuence students’ attitude towards collective work. Value: On the labour market the teamwork skills {{are one of the most}} important skills of employees, as the team-based organizational designs are becoming the norm in work organization. The study is contributing to the understanding of the relations between student experiences and their attitudes as well as the role played by high education in the development of these attitudes. Some previous research in Anglo-Saxon culture countries indicate that team project assignments realised by students during studies might even hinder their attitudes to teamwork and their willingness to work in teams in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} the class of graphs on topological spaces which have Baire {{measurable}} perfect matchings includes all acyclic locally finite Borel graphs on <b>Polish</b> spaces of <b>degree</b> at least three. A graph on a set X is an irreflexive symmetric subset G of X×X. A matching of G is a fixed-point-free involution ι of a subset of X whose graph is contained in G. A matching is perfect if its domain is X. A G-path is a sequence (xi) i∈n+ 1 such that (xi, xi+ 1) ∈ G for all i ∈ n. We refer to n as {{the length of the}} G-path. A graph G is acyclic if there is at most one injective G-path between any two points. The degree of a point y is given by degG(y) = |{x ∈ X | (x, y) ∈ G}|. A graph has degree n if every point has degree n. We say that a graph has degree at least n if every point has degree at least n. A graph is locally finite if every point has finite degree. It is well known that there are acyclic Borel graphs of degree two which do not have Baire measurable perfect matchings. It is also known that there are acyclic Borel graphs of countably infinite degree which do not have Baire measurable perfect matchings. Our main result here rules out the analogous result for graphs of intermediate degree. Let EXG denote the smallest equivalence relation on X containing G. The connected component of a point is its EXG-class. A set Y ⊆ X is G-invariant if it is the union of connected components. The restriction of G to a set Y ⊆ X is the graph on Y given by G Y = G ∩ (Y × Y). A G-ray is a sequence (xi) i∈ω such that (xi, xi+ 1) ∈ G for all i ∈ ω. We say that a sequence (xi) i∈I has low even degree if degG(xi) = 2 for all even natural numbers i ∈ I. Theorem 1 (ZF). Suppose that X is a Polish space, G is an acyclic locally finite Borel graph on X of degree at least two, and there is no injective G-ray of low even degree.

It strikes me, alas, {{that he is}} not quite so interesting as he was fondly intended to be, and this in spite of the multiplication, within the picture, of his pains and penalties; so that while I turn this slight anomaly over I come upon a reason that affects me as singularly charming and touching and at which indeed I have already glanced. Any presentation of the artist in triumph must be flat in proportion as it really sticks to its subject--it can only smuggle in relief and variety. For, to put the matter in an image, all we then--in his triumph--see of the charm-compeller is the back he turns to us as he bends over his work. [...] "His" [...] triumph, decently, is but the triumph of what he produces, and that is another affair. His romance is the romance he himself projects; he eats the cake of the very rarest privilege, the most luscious baked in the oven of the gods--therefore he mayn't [...] "have" [...] it, {{in the form of the}} privilege of the hero, at the same time. The privilege of the hero--that is, of the martyr or of the interesting and appealing and comparatively floundering person--places him in quite a different category, belongs to him only as to the artist deluded, diverted, frustrated or vanquished; when the [...] "amateur" [...] in him gains, for our admiration or compassion or whatever, all that the expert has to do without. Therefore I strove in vain, I feel, to embroil and adorn this young man on whom a hundred ingenious touches are thus lavished: he has insisted in the event on looking as simple and flat as some mere brass check or engraved number, the symbol and guarantee of a stored treasure. The better part of him is locked too much away from us, and the part we see has to pass for--well, what it passes for, so lamentedly, among his friends and relatives. No, accordingly, Nick Dormer isn't [...] "the best thing in the book," [...] as I judge I imagined he would be, and it contains nothing better, I make out, than that preserved and achieved unity and quality of tone, a value in itself, which I referred to at the beginning of these remarks. What I mean by this is that the interest created, and the expression of that interest, are things kept, as to kind, genuine and true to themselves. The appeal, the fidelity to the prime motive, is, with no little art, strained clear (even as silver is <b>polished)</b> in a <b>degree</b> answering--at least by intention--to the air of beauty.

40|$|The {{article is}} based on {{empirical}} research conducted by the author in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The research comprised licence agreements (for both export and import), concluded between 1981 - 1987 by Polish enterprises with partners from the CMEA countries. Analysing the contents of the contracts the author takes into account the stipulations of the CMEA documents which in the form of "directives" regulate the circulation of so-called „. scientific and technical works". Taken into account were the stipulations of Organizational, Methodical, Economic and Legal Foundations for Scientific and Technological Co-operation of the CMEA Member States of 1972 (in the 1986 version) and the provisions of „model forms of licencing agreements" issued by the CMEA Secretariat in 1975. The purpose of the analysis was to establish to what degree the solutions recommended for application within the CMEA influence the praxis of shaping the contents of contracts. It should be emphasized that licence relations have not yet been regulated in the acts of the so-called „CMEA common '' law". Besides, the author analyses the contents of particular clauses, especially those of importation contracts, from the viewpoint of their agreement with Polish norms regulating the transfer of technology contained in the 1986 Regulation on Principles and Procedure of Exportation and Importation of Scientific and Technical Achievements issued by the Minister of Foreign Trade. The author aims at establishing to what <b>degree</b> <b>Polish</b> licencees are able to secure for themselves preferred elements of the contents of contracts and to what degree contracts for importation of technology from the CMEA countries are tainted with restrictive practices. The author carries out a survey of typical licence clauses, in particular clauses regulating the extent and character of a licence, the transfer of technical documentation, the exchange of technological improvements, the licensor's legal and technical protective measures and the liability for infringing them, technical assistance, licence fees and their payments, measures to protect the secrecy of know- -how, the clauses regulating the settling of disputes and the choice of applicable law. Then, the author turns her attention to the areas of inadequate contractual regulation (especially the problems of liability and the choice of applicable law). She also discovers in importation contracts. concluded with the CMEA countries the existence of practices restricting the economic activity of Polish licences. From among the restrictive clauses indicated in the Regulation of 1986 the author finds the restrictions as to the right of granting sublicences, exportation restrictions and interdictions to question the licensor's protective title. In that connection the author deals with the character of Polish legal norms regulating the transfer of technology and analyses the relation of these provisions to the norms of the Law on Counteracting Monopolistic Practices. She concludes that restrictive licence clauses may be subject to, sanctions provided for in the Law. The last part of her article is devoted to the problem of transfer of technology within joint ventures carried out with partners from the CMEA countries. Legal foundations of such a form of co-operation and means of transfering the technology within joint ventures have been discussed.
