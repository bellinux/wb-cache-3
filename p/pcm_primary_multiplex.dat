40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years {{there has been}} {{extensive}} research on the application of spread spectrum multiplexing techniques for communications via optical fiber. Optical Code Division Multiplexing (OCDMA) is the technique that has exhibited the most promise as a <b>primary</b> <b>multiplexing</b> vehicle for the transition into all-optical processing of data, and as a supplement to other techniques such as Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM). OCDMA can be classified into incoherent OCDMA, where coding and detection is done on the basis of optical power, and coherent OCDMA where coding is done on a field amplitude basis. The commercialization of these technologies has been a slow process as interferometic noise (know as beat noise), multiuser access interference (MAI) and optical component cost are the major hurdles. ^ This thesis concentrates on the application of incoherent OCDMA on a Fiber to the Home (FTTH) type access network where users receive information from a central terminal that is OCDMA encoded electronically. Only the user with the proper optical decoding stage will be able to discriminate and reconstruct the original information. The decoding is done via passive optical delay lines performing a convolution between the electrical orthogonal optical code (OOC) and the impulse response of the optical delay lines. The result is an autocorrelation peak or a crosscorrelation that provides no outstanding optical intensity peak. ^ This document analyzes the proper autocorrelation and crosscorrelation waveforms for 2 users on this “hybrid” OCDMA coding scheme and defines threshold, beat noise mitigation and information reconstruction techniques for further expansion of the network. ...|$|R

Mucosal and skin lesions were found in 65. 1 % and 12. 7 % of the patients, respectively. Odynophagia and dysphagia were present in 38. 1 % each. All patients had lung interstitial infiltrates, and 31. 7 % had also alveolar lesions; fibrosis was recorded in 46 % of them. An inverse correlation was shown for fibrosis and presence of either odynophagia or dysphagia. Cluster analyzes strongly supported two sets of patients: those with mucosal damage, odynophagia/dysphagia, and alveolo-interstitial infiltrates and those with dermal lesions, dyspnea, and lung fibrosis.

40|$|Abstract—The low {{luminance}} {{levels of}} light-emitting diodes (LEDs) compared to arc lamps {{make it difficult}} to design high-brightness LED-based projectors. Besides, the specificities of LEDs do not always allow using the same design schemes as with arc lamp-based projection displays. This paper performs a taxonomy of the techniques {{that can be used to}} increase the brightness of LED-based projection displays. We show that, in étendue-limited systems, the perceived brightness depends on the system étendue limit, the efficiency of the light engine, and the source luminance. The ability to improve each of these parameters depends on the design constraints. The system étendue limit can be increased at the expense of bulkier, more complex, and more expensive designs. The light engine efficiency can be increased by using free-form shape components adapted to the shapes and the emission patterns of the considered LEDs. The apparent source luminance can be increased at the expense of the flux by either recycling light or restricting the light collection to a smaller étendue with higher average luminance. Luminance can also be increased by using multiple color <b>primaries</b> (spatial <b>multiplexing)</b> or pulsed LEDs (temporal multiplexing). Finally, we review how light recycling can be implemented to convert polarization without increasing étendue.

40|$|Paracoccidioidomycosis (<b>PCM)</b> is a <b>primary</b> {{pulmonary}} {{infection that}} often disseminates to other organs and systems. Involvement {{of the central}} nervous system (CNS) is rare and {{due to the fact that}} both clinical alertness and establishment of the diagnosis are delayed, the disease progresses causing serious problems. We report here a case of neuroparacoccidioidomycosis (NPCM), observed in a 55 year-old male, who consulted due to neurological symptoms (left hemiparesis, paresthesias, right palpebral ptosis, headache, vomiting and tonic clonic seizures) of a month duration. Upon physical examination, an ulcerated granulomatous lesion was observed in the abdomen. To confirm the diagnosis a stereotactic biopsy was taken; additionally, mycological tests from the ulcerated lesion and a bronchoalveolar lavage were performed. In the latter specimens, P. brasiliensis yeast cells were visualized and later on, the brain biopsy revealed the presence of the fungus. Treatment with itraconazole (ITZ) was initiated but clinical improvement was unremarkable; due to the fact that the patient was taking sodium valproate for seizure control, drug interactions were suspected and confirmed by absence of ITZ plasma levels. The latter medication was changed to clonazepam and after several weeks, clinical improvement began to be noticed and was accompanied by diminishing P. brasiliensis antigen and antibody titers. In the PCM endemic areas, CNS involvement should be considered more often and the efficacy of itraconazole therapy should also be taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the high}} refresh power and {{scalability}} issues of DRAM, non-volatile memories (NVM) such as phase change memory (PCM) and resistive RAM (RRAM) are being actively investigated as viable replacements of DRAM. However, although these NVMs are more scalable than DRAM, they have shortcomings such as higher write energy and lower endurance. Further, the increased capacity of multi- and triple-level cells (MLC/TLC) in these NVM technologies comes {{at the cost of}} even higher write energies and lower endurance attributed to the MLC/TLC program-and-verify (P&V) techniques. This dissertation makes the following contributions to address the high write energy associated with MLC/TLC NVMs. First, we describe MFNW, a Flip-N-Write encoding that effectively reduces the write energy and improves the endurance of MLC NVMs. MFNW encodes an MLC/TLC word into a number of codewords and selects the one resulting in lowest write energy. Second, we present another encoding solution that is based on perfect knowledge frequent value encoding (FVE). This encoding technique leverages machine learning to cluster a set of general-purpose applications according to their frequency profiles and generates a dedicated offline FVE for every cluster to maximize energy reduction across a broad spectrum of applications. Whereas the proposed encodings are used as an add-on layer on top of the MLC/TLC P&V solutions, the third contribution is a low latency, low energy P&V (L 3 EP) approach for MLC/TLC <b>PCM.</b> The <b>primary</b> motivation of L^ 3 EP is to fix the problem from its origin by crafting a higher speed programming algorithm. A reduction in write latency implies a reduction in write energy as well as an improvement in cell endurance. Directions for future research include the integration and evaluation of a software-based hybrid encoding mechanism for MLC/TLC NVMs; this is a page-level encoding that employs a DRAM cache for coding/decoding purposes. The main challenges include how the cache block replacement algorithm can easily access the page-level auxiliary cells to encode the cache block correctly. In summary, this work presents multiple solutions to address major challenges of MLC/TLC NVMs, including write latency, write energy, and cell endurance...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{pathogenicity}} {{is mainly}} {{due to the}} production of a number of secreted and cell surface-associated proteins under the regulation of the agr gene. A region of the agr gene was used to subgroup S. aureus strains according to restriction fragment length polymorphisms.

Virulence capabilities of agr genotype subgroups were evaluated using an in vitro neutrophil bactericidal assay, which showed that prevalent genotypes were significantly better at evading this <b>primary</b> host defense. <b>Multiplex</b> PCR was then used to detect enterotoxin genes among the genotype subgroups in order to determine possible virulence candidates that enable strains to combat neutrophil killing. The prevalent genotype strains were found to possess higher production capabilities for enterotoxin A than did low-prevalence strains. The significance of enterotoxin A production capabilities in affecting pathogenicity of S. aureus strains was evaluated and found to {{have a profound effect on}} neutrophil killing abilities. The use of a large epidemiological database as a tool for subgrouping strains with varying degrees of pathogenicity has allowed the identification of relevant and previously undefined virulence factors that affect a pathogen's capability to overcome host immune defenses...|$|R
40|$|The <b>primary</b> {{barriers}} to <b>multiplexed</b> {{point of care}} immunoassays are: (1) cost; (2) response time; and (3) sample handling. Described here is a self-contained, multiplexed immunoassay platform for point of care detection that leverages a number of enabling technologies to address these barriers. This platform {{is referred to as}} the "D 4 " assay, as it is composed of the following four sequential, concerted events (Figure 1) : (1) Dispense (droplet of blood); (2) Dissolve (printed reagents on chip); (3) Diffuse across surface; (4) Detect binding event. The D 4 assay process begins when a finger-stick is administered and the resulting droplet of blood is applied to the surface of a detector chip. Hydrophobic ink printed onto the surface of the chip confines the blood droplet to a non-fouling region containing soluble, labile spots of detection antibodies and insoluble, non-labile spots of capture antibodies. As the soluble detection antibodies are dissolved from their printed spots by the droplet of blood, three serial events occur to generate signal (Figure 2) : (1) the first half of the detection complex is formed by the binding of analytes present in blood to the stable capture agent spots; (2) diffusion of the blood laterally through the polymer brush, resulting in the dissolution and diffusion of soluble detection antibody spots; (3) solubilized detection antibodies bind to their respective analyte-capture agent spots, completing the detection complex and resulting in signal generation at the position of the non-labile capture antibody spots. This assay relies upon the ability of labeled detection antibodies, printed into a nonfouling brush as "labile spots", to be carried by blood flow to adjacent rows of stably immobilized capture antibodies by diffusion of the analyte solution (Figure 2). Generation of signal at a given capture spot location provides identification of individual analytes (positives). Quantification of the concentration of the different analytes is carried out identically to a conventional fluorescence immunoassay by pre-calibration of the system using a dilution series of the analyte spiked into whole blood. The D 4 assay addresses several critical needs in point of care testing as follows: First, the cost of testing is reduced through miniaturization, multiplexing and one-step, on-site processing of undiluted whole blood obtained from a finger stick. Second, in order to simplify the immunoassay process, the D 4 relies on diffusion to bring spatially localized reagents together to create a functional assay and thereby eliminate the need for liquid transfer steps, microfluidic manipulation of sample or reagents, and wash steps. Third, this multiplexed platform is capable of screening for a panel of markers in a single drop of blood with no sample preprocessing. Fourth, the assay is fast, which alleviates the difficulties often associated with communicating the outcome of diagnostic tests. A prototype of the D 4 assay is shown in Figure 3 below.
