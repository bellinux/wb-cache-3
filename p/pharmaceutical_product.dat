2500|$|Prescriptions may {{be entered}} into an {{electronic}} medical record system and transmitted electronically to a pharmacy. Alternatively, a prescription may be handwritten on preprinted prescription forms that have been assembled into pads, or printed onto similar forms using a computer printer or even on plain paper according to the circumstance. In some cases, a prescription may be transmitted from the physician to the pharmacist orally by telephone; this practice may {{increase the risk of}} medical error. The content of a prescription includes the name and address of the prescribing provider and any other legal requirement such as a registration number (e.g. DEA Number in the United States). [...] Unique for each prescription {{is the name of the}} patient. [...] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the patient's name and address must also be recorded. Each prescription is dated and some jurisdictions may place a time limit on the prescription. In the past, prescriptions contained instructions for the pharmacist to use for compounding the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>product</b> but most prescriptions now specify pharmaceutical products that were manufactured and require little or no preparation by the pharmacist. Prescriptions also contain directions for the patient to follow when taking the drug. These directions are printed on the label of the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E

RESULTS: A list of sulfite-containing <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> was compiled from data supplied by the 90 responding companies. Companies whose products contained no sulfites were separately identified. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfites are present in many <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> and are one of many excipients and additives that {{have been reported to}} cause severe adverse reactions. The provided list should be a useful aid for health care practitioners when prescribing <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> for sulfite-sensitive patients...|$|R

2500|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has revenues {{in the hundreds}} of billions of dollars a year globally. [...] With such a large industry counterfeiting and copyright infringement are serious issues, and hydrogen isotope fingerprinting has become a useful tool in verifying the authenticity of various drugs. [...] As described in the preceding sections, the utility of D/H ratios highest when combined with measurements of other isotope ratios as well. [...] In an early study on the stable isotope compositions of tropicamide, hydrocortisone, quinine and tryptophan, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were analyzed by EA-IRMS and clear distinctions were able to be made between manufacturers and even batches of the drugs based on their isotope signatures. [...] In this study it was determined that the hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios were the two best fingerprints for distinguishing between different drug sources. [...] A follow-up study analyzing naproxen from various lots and manufacturers also showed similar ability to distinguish between sources of the drugs. [...] The use of these isotope signatures could not only be used to distinguish between different manufacturers, but also between different synthetic pathways for the same compound. [...] These studies relied on the natural variations that occurred in the synthesis of these drugs, but other studies have used starting ingredients that are intentionally labelled D and 13C, and showed that these labels could be traced into the final <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>product.</b> [...] D/H ratios can also be determined for specific sites in a drug by 2H NMR, and has been used to distinguish between different synthetic methods for ibuprofen and naproxen in one study, and prozac and fluoxetine in another. [...] These studies show that bulk D/H ratio information for EA-IRMS, and site-specific D/H ratios from 2H NMR have great utility for pharmaceutical drug authenticity testing.|$|E
