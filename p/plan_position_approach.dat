50|$|While in Noum√©a, the S-31 {{became the}} first American {{submarine}} to be equipped with a <b>plan</b> <b>position</b> indicator, or PPI. Originally intended for Admiral Halsey's flagship, the USS South Dakota, crewmen from the S-31 appropriated the <b>plan</b> <b>position</b> indicator for their own use. The <b>plan</b> <b>position</b> indicator proved remarkably useful during her eighth war patrol.|$|R
