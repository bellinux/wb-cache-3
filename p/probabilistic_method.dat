25|$|In {{probabilistic}} combinatorics, {{the questions}} are of the following type: what is {{the probability of a}} certain property for a random discrete object, such as a random graph? For instance, what is the average number of triangles in a random graph? Probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties (for which explicit examples might be difficult to find), simply by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0. This approach (often referred to as the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>method)</b> proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory. A closely related area is the study of finite Markov chains, especially on combinatorial objects. Here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the mixing time.|$|E
25|$|Of his contributions, the {{development}} of Ramsey theory {{and the application of}} the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>method</b> especially stand out. Extremal combinatorics owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of analytic number theory. Erdős found a proof for Bertrand's postulate which proved to be far neater than Chebyshev's original one. He also discovered the first elementary proof for the prime number theorem, along with Atle Selberg. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erdős and Selberg. Erdős also contributed to fields in which he had little real interest, such as topology, where he is credited as the first person to give an example of a totally disconnected topological space that is not zero-dimensional.|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{operation}} of robotic systems in an agricultural environment {{is a difficult}} task due to the inherent uncertainty in the environment. The robot is in a dynamic, non-deterministic and semi-structured environment with many sources of noise and {{a high degree of}} uncertainty. A novel approach dealing with uncertainty is by means of <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods.</b> This PhD thesis studies the efficacy of <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> for autonomous robot applications in agriculture focusing on two agricultural tasks namely automatic detection of weed in a grassland and autonomous navigation of a robot in a Maize field. In automatic weed detection we look at the detection of a common weed called Rumex obtusifolius (Rumex). The suitability of image analysis for the task is examined, various existing methods are scrutinized and new <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> are proposed for robust detection of Rumex using a monocular camera in real-time. For autonomous navigation in a Maize field, <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> are developed for row following using a camera as well as a laser scanner. New sensor models are proposed to characterize the noisy measurements which are used in the navigation method for tracking the position of the robot and the plant rows. Through extensive field experiments we show that the proposed <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> are robust to varying operating conditions and conclude that <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> are essential for autonomous {{operation of}} robotic systems in an agricultural environment. </font...|$|R

40|$|<b>Probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> {{have largely}} {{replaced}} deterministic techniques {{in the assessment}} of generating capacity adequacy in large modem electric power utilities. In spite of their widespread application in large systems, <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> are not generally applied to small isolated power systems. A recent survey [6] by Newfoundland & Labrador Hydro indicates that all Canadian small isolated systems employ some type of deterministic method to assess the adequacy of the existing or proposed generating facilities to meet the total load requirement. These approaches do not normally include any explicit recognition of system risk and do not provide comparable risks for systems of different size or composition. The reluctance by system planners of small isolated systems to accept <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> in their present form dictates a need to develop new approaches to bridge the deterministic methods and the prevalent probabilistic techniques. This thesis presents a new approach, known as system well-being analysis that links the accepted deterministic criteria with <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods.</b> A description of the new evaluation techniques, new adequacy indices and comparative studies of the different indices and approaches are presented with the objective of providing practical <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> for capacity planning in small isolated power systems. A graphical user-interface software package named SIPSREL has been developed as a practical tool for small isolated system planning. It is hoped that <b>probabilistic</b> <b>methods</b> will be employed in practice in the adequacy evaluation of small isolated power systems using the methodologies and evaluation tools that have been developed in this research work...|$|R
