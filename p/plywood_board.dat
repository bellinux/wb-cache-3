The water and melamine resin uptake and resulting weight percent gain of the veneers were investigated, whereby the air plasma pre-treated veneers showed improved liquid uptake. Five-layer <b>plywood</b> <b>boards</b> were then manufactured and tested for their dimensional stability, compressive strength, bending strength, and tensile strength. <b>Plywood</b> <b>boards</b> made of thermally modified and plasma pre-treated veneers showed a significantly improved dimensional stability, along with small influences on their mechanical properties.|$|R
40|$|Current paper {{deals with}} {{stiffness}} optimisation of silver birch (Betula pendula) plywood rib stiffened hollow core sandwich panels. Such a structural solution has several advantages over conventional <b>plywood</b> <b>boards</b> - weight and material savings {{are just some}} of them. However hollow core panels demand special attention to accurate structural design for selected loading scenarios. In order to acquire mechanical behaviour of <b>plywood</b> <b>boards</b> and rib-stiffened panels the ANSYS finite element (FE) calculation code has been employed linked with predefined design of computer experiments. Based on acquired mechanical responses from FE analysis metamodelling technique has been implemented to optimise cross-section parameters of rib stiffened panels. Optimisation results demonstrated that such a strategy allows to obtain an optimum solutions and to substitute conventional thick <b>plywood</b> <b>boards</b> (h> 30 mm) with equivalently stiff hollow core sandwich alternative. This could be of particular interest for applications where bending is dominating load case and structure span length is at least 20 times larger than thickness. In such a case weight reduction of plywood hollow-core panels may reach up to 45 %, comparing with conventional <b>plywood</b> <b>boards.</b> Experimental validation of obtained optimal designs confirmed the match between load/deflection curves among conventional and equivalent rib stiffened panel designs. Some slight stiffness deviations observed in tests are mainly caused by geometrical intolerances included in manufactured prototypes...|$|R

50|$|Matchboard {{was most}} {{popular in the}} late Victorian period, when {{woodworking}} machinery had developed that could cut the edge joints quickly and cheaply. In the 1930s, further developments in glues and veneer-cutting machinery made plywood affordable. This also gave a cleanly smooth-surfaced Modernist look that suited the taste for new styles. Matchboard then became much less popular. In the 1970s there was a resurgence {{of interest in the}} style as a retro feature, but this was usually provided, for cost reasons, as a faux matchboard effect pressed into the surface of a <b>plywood</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

On another occasion during the time Corll resided at Schuler Street, Henley knocked Brooks unconscious {{as he entered the}} house. Corll then tied Brooks to his bed and assaulted the youth repeatedly before releasing him. Despite the assault, Brooks continued to assist Corll in the abductions of the victims.|$|E
50|$|The {{extraction}} of the kernel from {{the fruit of}} the black walnut is difficult. The thick, hard shell is tightly bound by tall ridges to a thick husk. The husk is best removed when green, as the nuts taste better if it is removed then. Rolling the nut underfoot on a hard surface such as a driveway is a common method; commercial huskers use a car tire rotating against a metal mesh. Some take a thick <b>plywood</b> <b>board</b> and drill a nut-sized hole in it (from one to two inches in diameter) and smash the nut through using a hammer. The nut goes through and the husk remains behind.|$|E
50|$|His {{works from}} that period {{dealt with the}} {{division}} and organization of work surfaces. In an installation from 1973-1974, Tevet placed white-painted <b>plywood</b> <b>boards</b> on top of chairs. The work showed {{the influence of the}} aesthetic principles of minimalist art and emphasized the temporariness of the expression of an artistic experience. In another work, “Beds” (1974), Tevet displayed rectangular, white-painted <b>plywood</b> <b>boards,</b> with legs attached to them that turned the two-dimensional “painting” into a work of sculpture. The interpretation of this work that grew up over the years required that, in addition to the formalistic aspect of the work, the biographical background of Tevet, as a former kibbutz member, needed to be taken into account. Relating to plywood as a “painting” and to its placement as a work of art reflected the ambivalent relationship of Tevet {{to the surface of the}} painting.|$|R

(It was also nicknamed [...] "Airknocker" [...] and [...] "Razorback".) The general design of the C-2 could {{have been inspired by}} Jean Roche's initial flight experiences with an American-built copy of the Santos-Dumont Demoiselle, which had a similar triangular [...] "basic" [...] fuselage cross-section, and wire-spoked main landing gear wheels against the fuselage sides.|$|E
50|$|The Loft Bed - After {{a lesson}} on framing, the contestants must build a loft bed (essentially, an indoor deck), {{complete}} with lag bolts to secure the frame to a post, from which a <b>plywood</b> <b>board</b> is placed on top, to support the bed's mattress. Matt does this easily, as he is experienced at building decks. Deen also passes after some work, though he mismeasures his plywood covering. The rest, however, do not fare as well. Simon admits to failing after failing to support the outside corner. Cory, ambitious to decorate the posts after quickly finishing the structure, fails after admitting to not reading the instructions to the post covering.

Newsprint is visible under the stripes. Reading the texts, {{it is clear that}} the newsprint was not selected at random: Johns steered clear of headlines, or national or political news, and used inconsequential articles or adverts. The painting has a rough-textured surface, and the 48 stars are not identical. It is dated 1954 on its reverse.|$|E

5000|$|An annual {{tradition}} of roach races {{began in the}} town in 1981, as [...] "a gimmick for the Fourth of July carnival". To insure large sizes the roaches are imported from South Carolina labs. Contestants put their insects in a plastic container that is placed on an oval track on a four by eight <b>plywood</b> <b>board.</b> The container is lifted {{at the start of}} the race and whichever roach reaches the perimeter of the board first is declared the winner of each heat. The popularity of the race resulted in its appearing on the television programs regionally on Across Indiana and nationally on Good Morning America.

5000|$|The {{underside}} {{structure of}} a Dalek casing was indeterminate until the publication of The Dalek Book [...] (1964). This included a cutaway drawing entitled 'Anatomy of a Dalek' which showed it to have a base through which a large central sphere, surrounded by smaller satellite 'balancing globes', protrudes. This layout was generally adopted and used in subsequent Dalek plans and comic strip representations. This is at variance with the few glimpses seen in early Doctor Who television episodes and films, which made little attempt to show (or hide) {{anything other than the}} actual base of the Dalek prop. As this usually took the form of a <b>plywood</b> <b>board</b> to which castors had been attached and a hole cut out for the operator's feet, these brief appearances were of little assistance in maintaining the illusion of the props being functional, armoured casings housing an alien being. This situation was finally remedied in the episode [...] "Dalek" [...] (2005) and subsequent appearances of the New Series Dalek. This variant is shown to have an underside consisting of a large, recessed central hemisphere surrounded by eight satellite hemispheres. The central hemisphere and four of the satellite hemispheres glow when the Dalek is in flight mode.|$|E
