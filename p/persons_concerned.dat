25|$|Nearly all {{of almost}} 500 cases of sodomy between <b>persons</b> <b>concerned</b> the {{relationship}} between an older man and an adolescent, often by coercion, {{with only a few}} cases where the couple were consenting homosexual adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse. Adolescents were generally punished more leniently than adults, but only when they were very young (under ca. 12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape did {{they have a chance to}} avoid punishment altogether. As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years. As about half of those tried were under this age, it explains the relatively small percentage of death sentences.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (Council of Europe) has {{published}} its report on its 2007 visit to Estonia, stating {{that many of}} the persons detained by the police in connection with the April 2007 events in Tallinn were not granted all the fundamental safeguards (the right of those concerned to inform a close relative or another third party of their choice of their situation, the right of access to a lawyer, and the right of access to a doctor) from the outset of their detention: while many of the <b>persons</b> <b>concerned</b> were allowed to contact someone and to be assisted by a lawyer only when brought before a judge, a number of detained persons claimed that their requests to see a doctor whilst in police custody had been denied, even when they displayed visible injuries.|$|E
25|$|Peucestas (in Greek Πευκέστας; lived 4th century BC) was {{a native}} of the town of Mieza, in Macedonia, and a {{distinguished}} officer in the service of Alexander the Great. His name is first mentioned as one of those appointed to command a trireme on the Hydaspes. Previous to this we do not find him holding any command of importance; but it is evident that he must have distinguished himself for his personal valour and prowess, as he was the person selected by Alexander to carry before him in battle the sacred shield, which he had taken down from the temple of Athena at Troy. In this capacity he was in close attendance upon the king's person in the assault on the capital city of the Malavas (325 BC); and all authors agreed in attributing the chief share in saving the life of Alexander upon that occasion to Peucestas, while they differed as to almost all the other circumstances and <b>persons</b> <b>concerned.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite Levants age {{there was}} still some {{consideration}} of restoring her to active service. As late as 1 August 1780 there were newspaper reports that she was [...] "repairing and will soon be fit for sea", but no repairs were made. On 16 August, Admiralty issued orders that she be sailed to Deptford Dockyard where, on 27 September, she was broken up. Her passing was mourned by her crew, with their sentiments recorded by Levants former first lieutenant, Erasmus Gower, that [...] "having captured so considerable a number of prizes... few vessels, perhaps, have ever quitted a station with more éclat respecting herself, and more regret from the officers and other <b>persons</b> <b>concerned,</b> who derived advantage from her good fortune and the activity of her people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Chinese {{government}} {{appears to}} be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. [...] For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, “Some <b>persons</b> <b>concerned</b> in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.” [...] This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province. However, it remains unclear to what extent the government has prosecuted or disciplined the officials in charge of family planning in the country.|$|E
2500|$|As California {{considers}} [...] "all <b>persons</b> <b>concerned</b> in {{the commission}} of a crime, whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense... principals in any crime so committed", Marin County Superior Judge Peter Allen Smith charged Davis with [...] "aggravated kidnapping and first degree murder {{in the death of}} Judge Harold Haley" [...] and issued a warrant for her arrest. Hours after the judge issued the warrant on August 14, 1970, a massive attempt to locate and arrest Angela Davis began. On August 18, 1970, four days after the initial warrant was issued, the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover listed Davis on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List; she was the third woman and the 309th person to be listed.|$|E

2500|$|Although souls {{alone have}} the freedom and {{responsibility}} for their acts and thus reap the fruits of karma, i.e., good and evil karma, God as Vishnu, is the supreme Enforcer of karma, by acting as the Sanctioner (Anumanta) and the Overseer (Upadrasta). According to Ramanuja, all jivas are burdened with their load of Karma, which gives them only enjoyments and sufferings, but also desires and tendencies to act in particular ways; although the moral responsibility accrues only [...] to the Jiva, as he acts according to the tendencies and deserts he has acquired by his karma, Ramanuja believes that God wills only their fructification. According to the foregoing concept, God is [...] "compared to light which {{may be used for}} forging or for reading scriptures," [...] but the merits or demerit [...] "devolves entirely on the <b>persons</b> <b>concerned</b> and not on the light." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first [...] "Self-denying Ordinance" [...] {{was moved}} on 9 December 1644, and {{provided}} that [...] "no member of either house shall have or execute any office or command...", etc. This was not {{accepted by the}} Lords. In the end, a second [...] "self-denying ordinance" [...] was agreed to on 3 April 1645, whereby all the <b>persons</b> <b>concerned</b> were to resign, but without prejudice to their reappointment. Simultaneously with this, {{the formation of the}} New Model was at last definitely taken into consideration. The last exploit of Sir William Waller, who was not re-employed after the passing of the ordinance, was the relief of Taunton, then besieged by General Goring's army. Cromwell served as his lieutenant-general on this occasion. We have Waller's own testimony that he was, in all things, a wise, capable and respectful subordinate. Under a leader of the stamp of Waller, Cromwell was well satisfied to obey, knowing the cause to be in good hands.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{software}} distributions provide pre-compiled packages, {{but they}} are usually outdated as many distributions version freeze old stable releases.

[...] gtk-gnutella, like any gnutella client, is still usable behind a firewall or a router, but with some reduced functionality, if it cannot receive incoming TCP connections or UDP packets.

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} donor portraits was to memorialize the donor and his family, and {{especially}} to solicit prayers for them after their death. [...] Gifts to the church of buildings, altarpieces, or large areas of stained glass were often accompanied by a bequest or condition that masses for the donor be said in perpetuity, and portraits of the <b>persons</b> <b>concerned</b> were thought to encourage prayers on their behalf during these, and at other times. [...] Displaying portraits {{in a public place}} was also an expression of social status; donor portraits overlapped with tomb monuments in churches, the other main way of achieving these ends, although donor portraits had the advantage that the donor could see them displayed in his own lifetime. Furthermore, donor portraits in Early Netherlandish painting suggest that their additional purpose was to serve as role models for the praying beholder during his own emotional meditation and prayer – not in order to be imitated as ideal persons like the painted Saints but to serve as a mirror for the recipient to reflect on himself and his sinful status, ideally leading him to a knowledge of himself and God. To do so during prayer is in accord with late medieval concepts of prayer, fully developed by the Modern Devotion. This process may be intensified if the praying beholder is the donor himself.|$|E
