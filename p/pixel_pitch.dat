2500|$|Similar colored {{fringing}} around highlights {{may also}} be caused by lens flare. Colored fringing around highlights or dark regions {{may be due to}} the receptors for different colors having differing dynamic range or sensitivity – therefore preserving detail in one or two color channels, while [...] "blowing out" [...] or failing to register, in the other channel or channels. On digital cameras, the particular demosaicing algorithm is likely to affect the apparent degree of this problem. Another cause of this fringing is chromatic aberration in the very small microlenses used to collect more light for each CCD pixel; since these lenses are tuned to correctly focus green light, the incorrect focusing of red and blue results in purple fringing around highlights. This is a uniform problem across the frame, and is more of a problem in CCDs with a very small <b>pixel</b> <b>pitch</b> such as those used in compact cameras. Some cameras, such as the Panasonic Lumix series and newer Nikon and Sony DSLRs, feature a processing step specifically designed to remove it.|$|E

The method has been evaluated with real images: for 25 -mm focal length cameras located at 377 mm of the target origin and with an angle of 12 degrees with it, the locations of the optical center were found with a 2 mm accuracy and the mark location reconstruction RMS error was below 0. 5 pixels. The method has also been evaluated with the synthetic images available from the Visualization Society of Japan and it was observed that there was no signi cant decrease in the quality of the ow eld evaluation when the recovered camera model was substituted to the exact one even though the optical pathway includes an air to water refraction index change that theoretically makes the pinhole model inappropriate...|$|R

5000|$|In {{a closed}} system, X-ray {{shielding}} is put around the scanner so the operator {{can put the}} scanner on a desk or special table. Although the scanner is shielded, {{care must be taken}} and the operator usually carries a dosimeter, since X-rays have a tendency to be absorbed by metal and then re-emitted like an antenna. Although a typical scanner will produce a relatively harmless volume of X-rays, repeated scannings in a short timeframe could pose a danger. Digital detectors with small <b>pixel</b> <b>pitches</b> and micro-focus x-ray tubes are usually employed to yield in high resolution images. [...] Closed systems tend to become very heavy because lead is used to shield the X-rays. Therefore, the smaller scanners only have a small space for samples.|$|R

An empirical model is tested on the experimental data and validated on all the irradiated optical imagers. This model is able to describe all the presented dark current distributions with no parameter variation for neutron energies of 14 MeV or higher, regardless of the optical detector and irradiation characteristics. For energies below 1 MeV, it is shown that a single parameter has to be adjusted because of the lower mean damage energy per nuclear interaction. This model and these conclusions can be transposed to any silicon based solid-state optical imagers such as CIS or Charged Coupled Devices (CCD). This work can also be used when designing an optical imager instrument, to anticipate the dark current increase or to choose a mitigation technique...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a digital readout integrated circuit (DROIC) implementing time delay and integration (TDI) for scanning type infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPAs) with a charge handling capacity of 44. 8 Me− while achieving quantization noise of 198 e− and power consumption of 14. 35 mW. Conventional {{pulse frequency modulation}} (PFM) method {{is supported by a}} single slope ramp ADC technique to have a very low quantization noise together with a low power consumption. The proposed digital TDI ROIC converts the photocurrent into digital domain in two phases; in the first phase, most significant bits (MSBs) are generated by the conventional PFM technique in the charge domain, while in the second phase least significant bits (LSBs) are generated by a single slope ramp ADC in the time domain. A 90 × 8 prototype has been fabricated and verified, showing a significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 51 dB for low illumination levels (280, 000 collected electrons), which is attributed to the TDI implementation method and very low quantization noise due to the single slope ADC implemented for LSBs.

This paper presents the design and characterization results of the Explorer 0 chip, manufactured in the TowerJazz 180 nm CMOS Imaging Sensor process, based on a wafer with high-resistivity (ρ> 1 kΩcm) and 18 μm thick epitaxial layer. The chip is organized in two sub-matrices with different <b>pixel</b> <b>pitches</b> (20 μm and 30 μm), each of them containing several pixel designs. The collection electrode size and shape, as well as the distance between the electrode and the surrounding electronics, are varied; the chip also offers the possibility to decouple the charge integration time from the readout time, and to change the sensor bias. The charge collection properties of the different pixel variants implemented in Explorer 0 have been studied using a 55 Fe X-ray source and 1 – 5 GeV/c electrons and positrons. The sensor capacitance has been estimated, and the effect of the sensor bias has also been examined in detail.

40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) are widely used in mobile devices due to their thin form factor, wide color gamut, and high efficiency. The introduction of OLEDs into televisions and monitors has been slowed, in part, by the difficulty of patterning organic thin films over large areas at micron-scale resolutions. A practical patterning technology must also be compatible with efficient device architectures, such as phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs). Organic vapor jet printing (OVJP) is an approach for depositing and patterning the emissive layers of OLED displays in a scalable manner. An inert carrier gas is used to mix organic vapor from multiple material sources. The vapor mixture is then distributed to a Si micronozzle array that collimates it into multiple jets to deposit well-defined thin film features onto a chilled substrate. This technique is capable of printing features smaller than 20 μm and arrays of 100 μm wide multicolor PHOLED segments. An experimentally validated deposition model predicts that full color (red-green-blue) <b>pixel</b> <b>pitches</b> of 150 μm are obtainable without cross-contamination of dopants between adjacent sub pixels. Green PHOLEDs with an external quantum efficiency of 8. 0 ± 0. 7 %, comparable to that achieved with standard techniques, were fabricated with OVJP. Since the micronozzle array is fabricated using standard Si processing techniques, this approach is readily scalable. Based {{on the performance of}} the laboratory system, a production OVJP tool has the potential to print a full color OLED emissive layer onto Gen 8 (4 m 2) substrate in as little as 250 s...|$|R
40|$|Autostereoscopic {{displays}} {{suitable for}} the mass market typically rely on spatial multiplexing to present different views in different directions. To obtain the wide viewing freedom often requested by display users, the number of views presented is increased by the sacrifice of display resolution. The 3 D mode of a spatially multiplexed display has reduced resolution. To assess optimum design parameters, {{it is necessary to}} investigate both the loss of resolution and the redistribution of the colour filter pattern in the 3 D mode. The quantitative analysis of frequency structure using Nyquist boundaries is a well known technique for analysing the two dimensional distribution of sampling data points[8, 9]. In order to compare such multi-view displays, both quantitative and qualitative comparisons have been made of resolution losses and pixel appearance. Specifically, 2. 2 ” 2 D/ 3 D panel performance has been assessed using Nyquist boundaries, human visual contrast sensitivity models and autostereoscopic display optical output simulations. The panel matrix array function a(x,y) is the convolution of a two-dimensional comb function comb(x,y), comprising a two dimensional δ function array, and a single pixel structure φ(x,y) a(x,y) = comb(x,y) ⊗ φ(x,y) (1) A strong candidate for an optimum compromise between display brightness, viewing angle and 3 D pixel appearance is a 4 -view vertical Polarisation Activated Microlens technology with either QVGA mosaic or VGA stripe pixel arrangements. comb(x,y) = Σ δ(x-iα, y-jβ) (2) i,j=-∞ α and β are the horizontal and vertical <b>pixel</b> <b>pitches,</b> where typically for stripe configuration panels, α=β/ 3.
