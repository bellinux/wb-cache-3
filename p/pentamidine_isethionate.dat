However, intravenous solutions of antiviral foscarnet and antifungal fluconazole are incompatible with pentamidine.

40|$|The first-dose {{pharmacokinetics}} of pentamidine {{were studied}} {{in patients with}} AIDS. Pen-tamidine isethionate (4 mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly or intravenously to two groups of six patients each. Serial plasma and urine concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, which is accurate and precise (sensitivity limits, 2. 29 ng/ml in plasma and 229 ng/ml in urine). The mean peak concentrations in plasma after intramuscular and intravenous administration were 209 ng/ml and 612 ng/ml, respec-tively. Plasma concentrations, which declined biexponentially, were detectable through-out the 24 -hr dosing interval and fell to 40 years with an incomplete knowledge of its pharmacology [1].

To investigate these alternatives, samples of locally obtained drugs were analysed for diminazene aceturate content and a strain of Trypanosoma brucei brucei was isolated from a diminazene-refractory dog in Nsukka, south-eastern Nigeria, and used to infect albino rats. The quality of diminazene aceturate-based preparations was variable, with two preparations containing less than 95 % of the stated active compound. Rats infected with T. brucei isolated from the dog were treated 7 and 10 days after infection either with 7 mg/kg diminazene aceturate (intraperitoneally, once) or with 4 mg/kg <b>pentamidine</b> <b>isethionate</b> (intramuscularly, 7 consecutive days).
