5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender <b>paradox</b> <b>is</b> a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E
5|$|The Jevons <b>paradox</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this paper}} is to discuss why, how, and when nonlogical {{set-theoretic}} <b>paradoxes</b> <b>were</b> discovered.

5000|$|The first <b>paradox</b> (the Liar) <b>is</b> {{probably}} the most famous, and {{is similar to the}} famous paradox of Epimenides the Cretan. The second, third and fourth <b>paradoxes</b> <b>are</b> variants of a single paradox and relate to the problem {{of what it means to}} [...] "know" [...] something and the identity of objects involved in an affirmation (compare the masked man fallacy). The fifth and sixth <b>paradoxes</b> <b>are</b> also a single <b>paradox</b> and <b>is</b> usually thought to relate to the vagueness of language.

25|$|The twin <b>paradox</b> <b>is</b> {{a thought}} {{experiment}} involving identical twins, {{one of whom}} makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket, returning home {{to find that the}} twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin observes the other twin as moving, and so at first glance, it would appear that each should find the other to have aged less. The twin paradox sidesteps the justification for mutual time dilation presented above by avoiding the requirement for a third clock. Nevertheless, the twin <b>paradox</b> <b>is</b> not a true paradox because it is easily understood within the context of special relativity.|$|E
25|$|Speculative {{theories}} of quantum gravity that combine general relativity with quantum mechanics {{have their own}} associated paradoxes that are generally accepted to be artifacts {{of the lack of}} a consistent physical model that unites the two formulations. One such <b>paradox</b> <b>is</b> the black hole information paradox which points out that information associated with a particle that falls into a black hole is not conserved when the theoretical Hawking radiation causes the black hole to evaporate. In 2004, Stephen Hawking claimed to have a working resolution to this problem, but the details have yet to be published and the speculative nature of Hawking radiation means that it isn't clear whether this <b>paradox</b> <b>is</b> relevant to physical reality.|$|E
