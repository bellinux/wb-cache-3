5000|$|Pasties (singular pasty or <b>pastie)</b> are patches {{that cover}} a person's nipples and areolae which are affixed with adhesive.

5000|$|The name Mr. <b>Pastie</b> {{derives from}} [...] "pastie" [...] or [...] "pasty," [...] a Welsh or Cornish {{appellation}} for a meat pie commonly taken by miners {{to work in}} the slate mines of Wales and the neighboring English county of Cornwall. Some of these miners emigrated to the United States and settled {{in the eastern part of}} Pennsylvania, where slate was also mined (the [...] "Slate Belt"), bringing their traditional recipes with them.

50|$|Pasties come in {{a variety}} of colors, diameters, and shapes. Though pasties {{come in a}} variety of sizes, they usually are not much larger than the areola. Pasties are usually applied with a special tape or glue fixative, often gum arabic. However, in some {{situations}} keeping pasties from falling off can be an issue, as can be their removal. Some women are allergic to some adhesives or <b>pastie</b> material. Due to this, most high quality nipples are made of hypoallergenic silicone and use special adhesives to reduce the chances of an allergic reaction. Some pasties are for single-use, while others are washable and can be reused.|$|E
