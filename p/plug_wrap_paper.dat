40|$|To {{minimize}} {{the effect of}} permeability variations of tipping and <b>plug</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>paper</b> {{on the degree of}} filter ventilation and consequently on the smoke yields, a mathematical model for the flow through a layered structure of perforated tipping paper and porous <b>plug</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>paper</b> was derived.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this contribution is to characterise the distribution of adhesive between the <b>plug</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>paper</b> and the tipping paper on a finished cigarette. On the one hand, {{it is well known}} that this distribution influences various properties of the cigarette, but on the other hand, there are no methods available to completely determine this distribution. The area covered by adhesive, the amount of adhesive, and the thickness and position of the adhesive layer between the plug wrap and the tipping paper were chosen as essential quantities. Image analysis was used to evaluate the area covered by adhesive, and the amount of adhesive between the papers. The thickness and position of the adhesive layer were determined by processing pictures of paper cross-sections obtained with a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS) ...|$|E

30|$|Cigarette filter {{ventilation}} {{is used to}} dilute, {{during a}} puff, mainstream smoke generated in the tobacco burning zone with air entering through holes or perforations in the filter tipping paper, thereby reducing mainstream smoke yields (Norman 1974). Many cigarettes have a ventilation system in which both the tipping paper and a non-porous <b>plug</b> <b>wrap</b> are perforated by an ‘on-machine laser’ (OML). Ventilation levels are measured on unlit cigarettes {{as the percentage of}} airflow entering the ventilation holes at a puff-flow rate of 17.5  mL/s (equivalent to ISO smoking conditions).|$|R

5000|$|In Western culture, {{gifts are}} often <b>wrapped</b> in <b>wrapping</b> <b>paper</b> and {{accompanied}} by a gift note which may note the occasion, the receiver's name and the giver's name.

[...] Some people attempt to avoid this by unwrapping gifts with care to hopefully allow the paper to be reused, while others use decorated cloth gift sacks {{that can be easily}} reused many times; both of these concepts are part of the Green Gifting trend that encourages recycling.
