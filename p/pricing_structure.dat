Numerical results from the model implementation show that (a) shipping <b>pricing</b> <b>structures</b> can have pronounced impacts on manufacturing/assembly and distribution decisions both in the parent and host countries, (b) different shipping <b>pricing</b> <b>structures</b> might not be equally profitable as the cost benefits may only offset the losses from a discriminatory tariff or substantial storage expenses, and (c) increased manufacturing in the host country can be decelerated {{to a large extent}} by the localisation policy in the parent country and tight transport and storage limitations.

40|$|The <b>price</b> <b>structure</b> of {{district}} heating {{has been no}} major scientific issue for the last decades in energy-related research. However, today trends in district heating pricing tend to move towards a more customer-oriented approach with predetermined prices under a longer periods, leading to a more complex <b>price</b> <b>structure.</b> If a district heating supplier offers district heating with predetermined prices in order to compete with similar electricity offers, the financial risk of the new <b>price</b> <b>structure</b> is {{significantly higher than the}} risk of an ordinary variable cost offer based on short-run marginal cost. In contrary to an electricity seller, the district heating company cannot transfer all of the risk of predetermined prices to the financial market, instead the company is thrown upon its own ability to handle the risk by, e. g., hedging its own energy purchase. However, all uncertainties cannot be coped with in this manner. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a methodology that can be used to estimate the financial risk of different <b>price</b> <b>structures</b> and to value different opportunities to reduce the risk.

However, reviewers were critical of the emphasis on microtransactions, and though the game was [...] "generous" [...] with providing free Plays and other in-game currency rewards, this approach could still disappoint some players. Carter found that he could ignore the microtransactions and instead enjoy the freely-playable curated music channels, helping him to play music that he had not yet heard or was outside of his normal play style, giving him a [...] "a really cool feeling" [...] about exploring new music, as well as seeing music videos from his youth again. Ogilvie similarly found that he could spend his time in GHTV within the free channels exploring new music, but believed the mode was [...] "somewhat inflexible for the time poor" [...] as players may not find the type of music they want to play when they are ready the play and that {{there was a lack of}} a programming guide for these channels. Griffin said that the <b>pricing</b> <b>structure</b> was weak compared to established DLC models, believing that the pricing for options like the Party Pack would have been better used to unlock the ability to play songs that he would enjoy. Miller stated that the microtransaction [...] "structure is exploitative", preventing him from easily accessing his favorite songs to play and making him frustrated with the game in the long run. Buttersworth was displeased with the need to grind through songs in the free channels as to earn Play tokens to access a song he wanted to play, and the ability to permanently unlock a song, stating [...] "that lack of freedom undermined a lot of the fun". Premium shows were particularly noted as problematic, in addition to the lack of a practice mode for the GHTV songs, which may impact how those players that seek to perfect every song would enjoy the game mode. Tan noted that in addition to either the time to complete the challenges or in-game currency to unlock the show, the player would have to complete the show in one of the ranked positions to earn the offered prize, and if they failed, they would have to repeat that process again.|$|E

2500|$|Interstate {{pipeline}} {{companies in}} the US {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Prior to 1992, these companies owned all the gas that flowed through their systems. This also included gas in their storage facility, over which they had complete control. Then FERC Order 636 was implemented. This required the companies to operate their facilities, including gas storage on an open access basis. For gas storage, this meant that these companies could only reserve the capacity needed to maintain system integrity. The rest of the capacity would be available for leasing to third parties on a nondiscriminatory basis. Open access has opened a wide variety of application for gas storage, particularly for marketers which can now exploit price arbitrage opportunities. Any storage capacity would be priced at cost-based pricing, unless the provider can demonstrate to FERC that it lacks market power, in which case it may be allowed to price at market-based rates to gain market share. FERC defines market power as [...] "..the ability of a seller profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time.". The underlying <b>pricing</b> <b>structure</b> for storage has discouraged development in the gas storage sector, which has not seen many new storage facilities constructed, besides current ones being expanded. In 2005, FERC announced a new Order 678 targeted particularly to gas storage. This rule is intended to stimulate the development of new gas storage facility in the ultimate goal of reducing natural gas price volatility. Commission Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher observed: [...] "Since 1988, natural gas demand in the United States has risen 24 percent. Over the same period, gas storage capacity has increased only 1.4 percent. While construction of storage capacity has lagged behind the demand for natural gas, we have seen record levels of price volatility. This suggests that current storage capacity is inadequate. Further, this year, what storage capacity exists may be full far earlier than in any previous year. According to some analysts, that raises the prospect that some domestic gas production may be shut-in. Our final rule should help reduce price volatility and expand storage capacity." ...|$|E
