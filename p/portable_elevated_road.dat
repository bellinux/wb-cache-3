30|$|Urban traffic {{environment}} {{is becoming more}} complex, particularly in bigger cities, for example, with the building of more <b>elevated</b> <b>roads</b> {{to deal with the}} increasing traffic demands. For example, in North Texas, there are at least 10 interchanges that are 81 ft or taller&#x 2014;and nine of them have been built in roughly the past 15 years 1 &#x 2014;and as recent as February 2018, the Texas Department of Transportation has proposed building a 7 -mile elevated freeway to connect Loop 410 to Loop 1604 &#x 2019; 2 in the city of San Antonio. Such <b>elevated</b> <b>roads</b> and highways can pose considerable challenges to existing 2 D vehicle positioning systems in VANETs as such systems may not be capable of detecting whether a vehicle is on the <b>elevated</b> <b>road</b> or on the ground <b>road</b> under the <b>elevated</b> <b>road.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the location decision of an <b>elevated</b> new <b>road</b> in a corridor. The distribution of residents is uniformly located along this corridor and each individual makes {{trips to the}} CBD at the end-point of the corridor. Trip demand is elastic and dependent {{on the cost of}} a car trip that incorporates congestion cost. The government is assumed to build a new <b>elevated</b> <b>road</b> on this corridor to reduce the traffic congestion, but it has to decide where to locate the entrance of this <b>elevated</b> <b>road.</b> The optimal location of the new <b>elevated</b> <b>road</b> demon the following factors: (1) the set of tolls for the new road and original road; (2) the demand parameters; (3) the travel cost parameters; and (4) the construction cost parameters. We explore the effects of determining the location of an <b>elevated</b> <b>road</b> entrance and the tolls of road pricing on a simple spatial model with a welfare-maximizing objective of the government. The result also shows that, for a given set of tolls, the ratio of taking the <b>elevated</b> <b>road</b> is monotonically decreasing as the location of the entrance is set outward from the CBD. The socially optimal location of the entrance and the second-best toll are obtained from a set of numerical examples. ...|$|R

50|$|Noida has got roads laid in a {{grid pattern}} {{and due to}} proper planning, all main roads are 6 lanes wide, arrow {{straight}} and are well finished. Noida features three main expressways. One is the DND Flyway, which connects Noida and Delhi, runs across the river Yamuna, and receives heavy patronage from office-goers in the city. The second is the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway {{and the third is}} the Yamuna Expressway which connects Noida to Agra via Mathura. The Delhi eastern peripheral Road, Upper Ganga Canal Expressway and the Ganga Expressway are the three proposed expressways which will be passing the city. The area adjacent to the NGN Expressway has seen heavy residential development in recent years. A double-decker <b>elevated</b> <b>road</b> is being constructed on MP-II and its first phase is operational and the whole stretch would be operational by Oct. 2017. This 4.8 km road will begin from Flex crossing and end at Vishwa Bharti school. Another <b>elevated</b> <b>road</b> from sector 12/22 to sector 12/10-21/21A crossing is going to be built on the MP-I <b>road.</b> Three more <b>elevated</b> <b>roads</b> are planned. Along with these five <b>elevated</b> <b>roads,</b> several underpasses are under construction or approval and all these projects will be completed by 2018.

It facilitates specialization, extension of markets and exploitation of economies of scale. It {{is used for}} the smooth conveyance of both people and goods. Now days, <b>elevated</b> <b>roads</b> are built to ease the traffic between two points to enhance accessibility and flexibility of operations. Case study represents before and after accidents impact on Panipat-flyover stretch. This study examines the impact of the construction of Panipat Expressway over the traffic scenario of the city. This study presents accident data analysis over a period of 11 years (2003 - 2013) which includes collection of 5. 5 years (Jan 2003 - June 2008) data before construction and 5. 5 years (July 2008 – Dec 2013) data after construction. The results suggest that increased provision of <b>elevated</b> <b>roads</b> is likely to reduce accidents. Journey and running speed is also improved due to construction of <b>elevated</b> <b>roads.</b> <b>Elevated</b> <b>roads</b> also reduce traffic congestion and conflicts resulting in a safer and more efficient circulation of traffic in the city. 1...|$|R
