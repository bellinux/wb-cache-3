30|$|In general, deferring the {{investment}} {{appears to be}} more valuable as a strategy if LNG <b>prices</b> <b>at</b> Japan are used in the model.

In other words, LNG <b>prices</b> <b>at</b> Japan are significantly higher than those from Henry Hub in the USA. The bigger variability and mean values of LNG prices affect substantially the total savings obtainable between the operation of two types of vessels.|$|R
