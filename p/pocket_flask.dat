6000|$|... (Produces a <b>pocket</b> <b>flask,</b> topes a cruel {{quantity}} of double-distilled thunder-and-lightning out of it, smiles so grimly as to darken all {{the stage and}} sings): ...|$|E
60|$|At {{three minutes}} after twelve Milt left the garage {{to go to}} dinner. The fog of the morning had turned to rain. McGolwey {{was not at the}} Old Home. Sometimes Mac got tired of serving meals, and {{for a day or two}} he took to a <b>pocket</b> <b>flask,</b> and among his former {{customers}} the cans of prepared meat at Rauskukle's became popular. Milt found him standing under the tin awning of the general store. He had a troubled hope of keeping Mac from too long a vacation with the <b>pocket</b> <b>flask.</b> But Mac was already red-eyed. He seemed only half to recognize Milt.|$|E
60|$|The groom {{looked in}} the {{direction}} where Edie pointed with her whip, and saw lying on the ground, straight before the horses' heads, a drunken man, asleep and helpless, with a small <b>pocket</b> <b>flask</b> clasped in his hand, quite empty.|$|E
60|$|In May Cherokee {{packed his}} burro and turned its thoughtful, mouse- {{coloured}} forehead to the north. Many citizens escorted {{him to the}} undefined limits of Yellowhammer and bestowed upon him shouts of commendation and farewells. Five <b>pocket</b> <b>flasks</b> without an air bubble between contents and cork were forced upon him; and he was bidden to consider Yellowhammer in perpetual commission for his bed, bacon and eggs, and hot water for shaving {{in the event that}} luck did not see fit to warm her hands by his campfire in the Mariposas.|$|R
60|$|But behold! As soon as I {{went out}} on the adventure-path I met John Barleycorn again. I moved through a world of strangers, and the act of {{drinking}} together made one acquainted with men and opened the way to adventures. It might be in a saloon with jingled townsmen, or with a genial railroad man well lighted up and armed with <b>pocket</b> <b>flasks,</b> or with a bunch of alki stiffs in a hang-out. Yes; and it might be in a prohibition state, such as Iowa was in 1894, when I wandered up the main street of Des Moines and was variously invited by strangers into various blind pigs--I remember drinking in barber-shops, plumbing establishments, and furniture stores.|$|R
60|$|So the Master Thief {{went to a}} shop, {{and bought}} enough brandy to fill two <b>pocket</b> <b>flasks,</b> and he put a {{sleeping}} drink into one of these, but into the other he poured brandy only. Then he engaged eleven men to lie that night in hiding behind the Governor's stable. After this, by fair words and good payment, he borrowed a ragged gown and a jerkin from an aged woman, and then, with a staff {{in his hand and}} a poke on his back, he hobbled off as evening came on towards the Governor's stable. The stable boys were just watering the horses for the night, and it was quite {{as much as they could}} do to attend to that.|$|R
60|$|The deadly dexterity of {{it struck}} him cold. His nerves gave way. He drew {{back with a}} start of guilty fear, and looked round the room. A <b>pocket</b> <b>flask</b> of brandy lay {{on the table at}} his bedside. He {{snatched}} it up, and emptied it at a draught--and felt like himself again.|$|E
60|$|He listened without sympathy to his father's {{evocation}} of Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or draughts from his <b>pocket</b> <b>flask</b> whenever {{the image of}} some dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strangers to him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately been fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's property {{was going to be}} sold by auction, and in the manner of his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his phantasy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dragged myself nigher, {{and tried}} to stop the bleedin' with sech rags as I could tear off of me with one hand. But it warn't no use, and he lay moanin' with horrid pain, and lookin' at me with them lovin' eyes of his, till I thought I couldn't bear it. I give him all the help I could, and when the sun got hotter and hotter, and he began to lap out his tongue, I tried to get to a brook that was a good piece away, but I couldn't do it, being stiff and faint, so I give it up and fanned him with my hat. Now you listen to this, and when you hear folks comin' down on the rebs, you jest {{remember}} what one on 'em did, and give him credit of it. I poor feller in gray laid not fur off, shot through the lungs and dyin' fast. I'd offered him my handkerchief to keep the sun off his face, and he'd thanked me kindly, for in sech times as that men don't stop to think on which side they belong, but jest buckle-to and help one another. When he see me mournin' over Major and tryin' to ease his pain, he looked up with his face all damp and white with sufferin', and sez he, 'There's water in my canteen; take it, for it can't help me,' and he flung it to me. I couldn't have took it ef I hadn't had a little brandy in a <b>pocket</b> <b>flask,</b> and I made him drink it. It done him good, and I felt as much set up as if I'd drunk it myself. It's surprisin' the good sech little things do folks sometime;" [...] and Silas paused as if he felt again the comfort of that moment when he and his enemy forgot their feud, and helped one another like brothers.|$|E
2500|$|Che Guevara's {{likeness}} {{has undergone}} continual apotheosis while being weaved throughout {{the public consciousness}} {{in a variety of}} ways. From being viewed as a [...] "Saintly Christ-like" [...] figure by the rural poor in Bolivia where he was executed, to being viewed as an idealistic insignia for youth, longing for a vague sense of rebellion. His likeness can also be seen on millions of posters, hats, key chains, mouse pads, hoodies, beanies, flags, berets, backpacks, bandannas, belt buckles, wallets, watches, wall clocks, Zippo lighters, <b>pocket</b> <b>flasks,</b> bikinis, personal tattoos, and most commonly T-shirts. Meanwhile, his life story can be found in an array of films, documentaries, plays, and songs of tribute. Throughout television, music, books, magazines, and ironically even corporate advertisements, Che's visage is an ever-present political and apolitical emblem that has been endlessly mutated, transformed, and morphed over the last forty years of visual popular culture. This allows Che to operate as [...] "both a fashionable de-politicized logo, as well as a potent anti-establishment symbol used by a wide spectrum of human rights movements and individuals affirming their own liberation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} rob you," [...] said I; {{and raising the}} cloak I took from the <b>pockets</b> a silver <b>flask,</b> a square wooden case and a field-glass. All these I handed to him. The wretch opened the case, took out a pistol, and pointed it {{straight}} at my head.|$|R
60|$|Melbury was a {{traveller}} of {{the old-fashioned}} sort; having {{just come from}} Shottsford-Forum, he still had in his <b>pocket</b> the pilgrim's <b>flask</b> of rum which he always carried on journeys exceeding a dozen miles, though he seldom drank much of it. He poured it down the surgeon's throat, with such effect that he quickly revived. Melbury got him on his legs; but the question was {{what to do with}} him. He could not walk more than a few steps, and the other horse had gone away.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{innovations}} {{included a}} swimsuit design which incorporated an interior bra with an alluring low-cut back by using hidden straps that crossed {{in the back}} and closed around the waist. This design was patented in 1930 and retailed by Best & Company. Other designs were made with detachable elements and reversible sections. Also in 1930, she is credited with having produced the first evening dress with a matching jacket. During Prohibition in the United States, Schiaparelli's popularly named [...] "speakeasy dress" [...] provided a hidden <b>pocket</b> for a <b>flask</b> for alcoholic beverage.|$|R
60|$|The {{picture of}} human life in the market-place, though its general tint was the sad gray, brown, or black of the English emigrants, was yet enlivened by some {{diversity}} of hue. A party of Indians--in their savage finery of curiously embroidered deerskin robes, wampum-belts, red and yellow ochre, and feathers, and armed with the bow and arrow and stone-headed spear--stood apart with countenances of inflexible gravity, beyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain. Nor, wild as were these painted barbarians, were they the wildest feature of the scene. This distinction could more justly be claimed by some mariners--a part of {{the crew of the}} vessel from the Spanish Main--who had come ashore to see the humours of Election Day. They were rough-looking desperadoes, with sun-blackened faces, and an immensity of beard; their wide short trousers were confined about the waist by belts, often clasped with a rough plate of gold, and sustaining always a long knife, and in some instances, a sword. From beneath their broad-brimmed hats of palm-leaf, gleamed eyes which, even in good-nature and merriment, had a kind of animal ferocity. They transgressed without fear or scruple, the rules of behaviour that were binding on all others: smoking tobacco under the beadle's very nose, although each whiff would have cost a townsman a shilling; and quaffing at their pleasure, draughts of wine or aqua-vitae from <b>pocket</b> <b>flasks,</b> which they freely tendered to the gaping crowd around them. It remarkably characterised the incomplete morality of the age, rigid as we call it, that a licence was allowed the seafaring class, not merely for their freaks on shore, but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element. The sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own. There could be little doubt, for instance, that this very ship's crew, though no unfavourable specimens of the nautical brotherhood, had been guilty, as we should phrase it, of depredations on the Spanish commerce, such as would have perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice.|$|R
60|$|As I remember, it {{was almost}} midnight when we took our leave. We had had some biscuit and dried fish for supper, and Steerforth had {{produced}} from his <b>pocket</b> a full <b>flask</b> of Hollands, which we men (I may say we men, now, without a blush) had emptied. We parted merrily; and as they all stood crowded round the door to light us {{as far as they}} could upon our road, I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em'ly peeping after us, from behind Ham, and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we went.|$|R
6000|$|In {{a moment}} Allan {{was at his}} side. He looked uselessly round the lonely limits of the wreck, as he lifted Midwinter's head on his knee, for a chance of help, where all chance was ruthlessly cut off. [...] "What am I to do?" [...] he said to himself, in the first impulse of alarm. [...] "Not {{a drop of water}} near, but the foul water in the cabin." [...] A sudden {{recollection}} crossed his memory, the florid color rushed back over his face, and he drew from his <b>pocket</b> a wicker-covered <b>flask.</b> [...] "God bless the doctor for giving me this before we sailed!" [...] he broke out, fervently, as he poured down Midwinter's throat some drops of the raw whisky which the flask contained. The stimulant acted instantly on the sensitive system of the swooning man. He sighed faintly, and slowly opened his eyes. [...] "Have I been dreaming?" [...] he asked, looking up vacantly in Allan's face. His eyes wandered higher, and encountered the dismantled masts of the wreck rising weird and black against the night sky. He shuddered at the sight of them, and hid his face on Allan's knee. [...] "No dream!" [...] he murmured to himself, mournfully. [...] "Oh me, no dream!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{could have}} put {{the case to the}} guide himself; but though the guide was imaginably liberated to a {{cosmopolitan}} conception of things by three years' service as waiter in English hotels, where he learned the language, he might not have risen to this. He would have tried, for he was a willing and kindly soul, though he was not a 'valet de place' by profession. There seemed in fact but one of that useless and amusing race (which is everywhere falling into decay through the rivalry of the perfected Baedeker,) left in Leipsic, and this one was engaged, so that the Marches had to devolve upon their ex-waiter, who was now the keeper of a small restaurant. He gladly abandoned his business to the care of his wife, in order to drive handsomely about in his best clothes, with strangers who did not exact too much knowledge from him. In his zeal to do something he possessed himself of March's overcoat when they dismounted at their first gallery, and let fall from its <b>pocket</b> his prophylactic <b>flask</b> of brandy, which broke with a loud crash on the marble floor in the presence of several masterpieces, and perfumed the whole place. The masterpieces were some excellent works of Luke Kranach, who seemed the only German painter worth looking at when there were any Dutch or Italian pictures near, but the travellers forgot the name and nature of the Kranachs, and remembered afterwards only the shattered fragments of the brandy-flask, just how they looked on the floor, and the fumes, how they smelt, that rose from the ruin.|$|R
