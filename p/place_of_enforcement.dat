Therefore, each country can rule whether public policy and its related issues are part of the country 2 ̆ 7 s public policy. Courts around the world have recognized that Article V of the Convention is discretionary. The courts of Civil Law countries appear to be interpreting public policy broadly. This is quite evident from decisions made by courts in Indonesia, The People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China, Japan and Korea. The Indonesian Court considered Article V (2) (b) of the New York Convention which states that the court may deny the enforcement of an arbital award if enforcement would violate public policy of the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement.</b> In addition, before the enactment of Law No. 30 of 1999 concerning Arbitration and Alternative Disptue Resolution, the Court referred to Indonesian Supreme Court Regulation No. 1 of 1999, which provides that the enforcement of foreign arbital awards in Indonesia imitatively applies to awards which do not violate public policy order in terms of all underlying principles of the Indonesian legal system and society. In Indonesia, Bakrie Brothers v. Trading Corporation of Pakistan Ltd., was the first case in which the Indonesian court rejected the enforcement of foreign arbital awards for the reason of violating public policy...|$|E

This review focuses on three aspects, firstly looking at the main ways drugs are trafficked into prisons, secondly looking at the issues linked to the use of drugs within prisons and finally evaluating what is being done to try to tackle the problem. Drugs find their way into prisons in numerous ways, which causes problems for the prison system. Prison officials {{need to be able to}} keep up with the creative and inventive ways inmates are developing to traffic drugs into prisons. A third of prisoners in England and Wales claimed it was easier to get hold of drugs in prison than it was outside. This undermines prison security and creates problems with violence together being linked with reoffending. Two in five prisoners in England and Wales are known to commit offences in order to get funds to purchase drugs. Health risks are created by inmates sharing syringes, leading to the transmission of infectious diseases. This in turn causes the costs of treatments and detection methods to spiral out of control. Governments are constantly trying to proactively find ways to tackle drugs in prison; these include the use of sniffer dogs and employing more thorough searches by staff. But more needs to be done to eradicate drugs completely...|$|R

The paper investigates institutions in Mexico, Chile,and Colombia, and shows {{that for the}} successful inception of an institutionalised system for evaluation, three common factors stand out: {{the existence of a}} democratic system with a vocal opposition, the existence of influential M&E champions to lead the process, and a clear powerful stakeholder. Mexico’s CONEVAL is the most independent of the three bodies, mainly {{due to the fact that}} it is reporting to an executive board of independent academics; Chile’s Dipres is the best <b>placed</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>enforcement,</b> with its location within the Ministry of Finance and control of an independent budget; and Colombia’s Sinergia helps promote a culture of utilization of evaluations as a project management tool. However, actual usage of M&E information and the resulting effect upon development effectiveness are the benchmarks of success. The paper concludes that an explicit and thoughtful process of assessing the needs, the focus, and the emphasis of the system should serve officials and champions to identify adequate arrangements for the particular country context and understand how to better respond to the forces pushing for the creation of new M&E units and bodies. institutionalisation; impact evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the role that law school clinics could play in remedying a gap in legal services for youth with special education needs while simultaneously enhancing law students’ awareness and understanding of disabilities and providing students with unique skills. The authors show that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), recently reauthorized by Congress, <b>places</b> the burden <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> on parents but leaves these parents — particularly those marginalized by poverty, race, language or immigration status — without sufficient access to legal representation. The authors suggest that this representation gap is aggravated by lawyers’ and law students’ lack of awareness {{of the civil rights}} implications of this inequity and sometimes exacerbated still further by disability bias. The authors contend that law schools have an obligation to confront such “dis-awareness” by raising issues of disability discrimination and disability rights in the classroom and in clinical programs. Drawing on their informal survey of law school clinics that address the subjects of special education, child advocacy and juvenile justice, the authors assert that such clinics not only serve an essential unmet need for legal services but also further the pedagogical goals of fostering disability consciousness and teaching skills that are applicable to many areas of social justice practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contains}} the chapters on public <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> law and on criminal law from a general, forthcoming book, Foundations of Economic Analysis of Law (Harvard University Press, 2003). By public {{law enforcement is}} meant the use <b>of</b> public law <b>enforcement</b> agents [...] such as police, tax inspectors, regulatory personnel [...] to enforce legal rules. A number of important dimensions <b>of</b> public law <b>enforcement</b> may be distinguished. One is {{the choice of the}} basic rule of liability: whether liability is strict or fault-based, and whether liability is imposed only if harm is done or may be imposed on the basis of acts alone (independently of the occurrence of harm). A second dimension <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> is the type of sanction, whether monetary or nonmonetary, notably, imprisonment. A third aspect <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> is the magnitude of sanctions. And a fourth dimension <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> is the degree <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> effort, which determines the probability of imposition of sanctions. These dimensions <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> are discussed in the chapters that follow. In chapter 20, the basic theory <b>of</b> public <b>enforcement</b> employing monetary sanctions is discussed; in chapter 21, the basic theory <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> using nonmonetary sanctions is examined; and in chapter 22, extensions to the basic theory are considered. Then, in chapter 23, functions of sanctions apart from deterrence, namely, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and retribution, are discussed. Finally, in chapter 24, the subject of criminal law is addressed against the background of the theory <b>of</b> public <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> law. ...|$|R

The fewer the substitute products and/or the more difficult it is for other firms to begin to supply those products, the less elastic the demand curve is and the more probable is to find higher prices.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the cost <b>of</b> <b>enforcement,</b> to which we take a {{satisficing}} approach through the examination of marginal cost-benefit ratios. Social simulation is used to establish that less enforcement can be beneficial overall in economic terms, depending on the costs to system and/or stakeholders arising from enforcement. The results are demonstrated by means of a case study of wireless mobile grids (WMGs). In such systems the dominant strategy for economically rational users is to free-ride, i. e. to benefit from the system without contributing to it. We examine the use <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> agents that police the system and punish users that take but do not give. The agent-based simulation shows that a certain proportion <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> agents increases cooperation in WMG architectures. The novelty of the results lies in our empirical evidence for the diminishing marginal utility <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> agents: that is how much defection they can foreclose at what cost. We show that {{an increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> agents does not always increase the overall benefits-cost ratio, but that with respect to satisficing, a minimum proportion <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> agents can be identified that yields the best results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
