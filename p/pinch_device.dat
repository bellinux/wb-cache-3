2500|$|In 1950–1951 I.E. Tamm and A.D. Sakharov in the Soviet Union, first {{discussed}} a tokamak-like approach. Experimental research on those designs began in 1956 at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow {{by a group}} of Soviet scientists led by Lev Artsimovich. The tokamak essentially combined a low-power <b>pinch</b> <b>device</b> with a low-power simple stellarator. The key was to combine the fields {{in such a way that}} the particles orbited within the reactor a particular number of times, today known as the [...] "safety factor". The combination of these fields dramatically improved confinement times and densities, resulting in huge improvements over existing devices.|$|E
2500|$|The largest [...] "classic" [...] <b>pinch</b> <b>device</b> was the ZETA, {{including}} {{all of these}} suggested upgrades, starting operations in the UK in 1957. In early 1958, John Cockcroft announced that fusion had been achieved in the ZETA, an announcement that made headlines around the world. When physicists in the US expressed concerns about the claims they were initially dismissed. US experiments soon demonstrated the same neutrons, although temperature measurements suggested these could not be from fusion reactions. The neutrons seen in the UK were later demonstrated to be from {{different versions of the}} same instability processes that plagued earlier machines. Cockcroft was forced to retract the fusion claims, and the entire field was tainted for years. ZETA ended its experiments in 1968.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pinch</b> <b>devices</b> {{were among}} the {{earliest}} efforts in fusion power. The concept traces itself {{to work in the}} UK in the immediate post-war era, but a lack of interest led to little development until early 1950. Then, the announcement of the Huemul Project in early 1951 led to fusion efforts around the world, notably <b>pinch</b> <b>devices</b> in the UK and pinch and stellarators in the US. A number of small experiments were built at labs as various practical issues were addressed, but all of these machines demonstrated unexpected instabilities of the plasma that would cause it to hit the walls of the container vessel. The problem became known as the [...] "kink instability".|$|R
25|$|By {{this time}} the latest {{versions}} of the US <b>pinch</b> <b>devices,</b> Perhapsatron S-3 and Columbus S-4, were producing neutrons of their own. The fusion research world reached a high point. In January, results from pinch experiments in the US and UK both announced that neutrons were being released, and that fusion had apparently been achieved. The misgivings of Spitzer and Colgate were ignored.|$|R
50|$|By 1951 {{there were}} {{numerous}} <b>pinch</b> <b>devices</b> in operation; Cousins and Ware had built several follow-on machines, Tuck built his Perhapsatron, and another team at Los Alamos built a linear machine known as Columbus. It was later learned that Fuchs had passed information about the early UK work to the Soviets, and they had started a pinch program as well.|$|R
5000|$|However, none {{of these}} {{techniques}} helped. Sceptre IV proved {{to have the same}} performance problems as the earlier machines. Sceptre IV proved to be the last major [...] "classic" [...] <b>pinch</b> <b>device</b> built in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The largest Reversed Field <b>Pinch</b> <b>device</b> {{presently}} {{in operation}} is the RFX (R/a = 2/0.46) in Padua, Italy. Others include the MST (R/a = 1.5/0.5) in the United States, EXTRAP T2R (R/a = 1.24/0.18) in Sweden, TPE-RX (R = 0.51/0.25) in Japan, and KTX (R/a = 1.4/0.4) in China.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the same}} time, Jim Tuck had been {{introduced}} to the pinch concept while working at Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University. He was offered {{a job in the}} US and eventually ended up at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), where he acquainted the other researchers with the concept. When he heard Spitzer was promoting the stellarator, he also traveled to Washington to propose building a <b>pinch</b> <b>device</b> at Los Alamos. He considered Spitzer's plans [...] "incredibly ambitious". Nevertheless, Spitzer was successful in gaining $50,000 in funding from the DOE, while Tuck received nothing.|$|E

50|$|The {{failure of}} Perhapsatron was {{followed}} by the failure of other <b>pinch</b> <b>devices.</b> Another team at Los Alamos had been working on another fast-pinch machine that used electrical fields instead of magnetic, known as Columbus, with the same results. Meanwhile the much larger ZETA machine in the UK also failed, but only after publishing results with great fanfare saying they had successfully achieved fusion. By 1961 work on Z-pinch devices had largely ended, although some research continued on the related theta-pinch concept.|$|R
50|$|Feller is a {{traditional}} name for someone who cuts down trees, and bunching is the skidding and assembly {{of two or more}} trees. A feller buncher performs both of these harvesting functions and consists of a standard heavy equipment base with a tree-grabbing device furnished with a chain-saw, circular saw or a shear—a <b>pinching</b> <b>device</b> designed to cut small trees off at the base. The machine then places the cut tree on a stack suitable for a skidder or forwarder, or other means of transport (yarding) for further processing (e.g., delimbing, bucking, loading, or chipping).|$|R
50|$|Other {{teams in}} the UK {{continued}} their efforts. Thomson passed his concepts on to Stan Cousins and Alan Ware, who assembled a linear <b>pinch</b> <b>device</b> out of old radar equipment and started operations in 1947. Follow-on experiments used large banks of capacitors to store energy that was quickly dumped into the plasma through a solenoid wrapped around a short tube. These experiments demonstrated a number of dynamic instabilities that caused the plasma to break up and hit {{the walls of the}} tube long before it was compressed or heated enough to reach the required fusion conditions.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternate}} {{approach was}} the [...] "pinch" [...] concept, {{developed in the}} United Kingdom. Unlike the magnetic bottle approaches, in a <b>pinch</b> <b>device,</b> the required magnetic field {{was created by the}} plasma itself. Since the plasma is electrically conductive, if one were to run a current through the plasma, it would create an induced magnetic field. This field, through the Lorentz force, will act to compress the conductor. In the case of a plasma, the force would collapse it into a thin filament, [...] "pinching" [...] it down. Since the current had to be very large, pinch devices made no attempt to confine the plasmas for extended periods. They would attempt to reach fusion conditions quickly and then extract power from the resulting hot products.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Cockcroft {{arranged}} {{a meeting of}} several Harwell physicists to study Thomson's latest concepts, including Harwell's director of theoretical physics, Klaus Fuchs. Thomson's concepts were poorly received, especially by Fuchs. When this presentation also failed to gain funding, Thomson passed along his concepts to two graduate students at Imperial, Stan Cousins and Alan Ware. He added a report on a type of toroidal particle accelerator known as the [...] "Wirbelrohr" [...] ("whirl tube"), designed in Germany by Max Steenbeck. The Wirbelrohr consisted of a transformer with a torus-shaped vacuum tube as its secondary coil, similar in concept to the toroidal <b>pinch</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|ZETA won the race, and by {{the summer}} of 1957 it was {{producing}} bursts of neutrons on every run. Although the scientists working on the device, and similar ones in the US and UK, were careful to point out that it was not proven, the results were nevertheless released with great fanfare as the first successful step on the path to commercial fusion energy. However, further study soon demonstrated that the measurements were misleading, and none of the machines were near fusion levels. Interest in <b>pinch</b> <b>devices</b> faded, although ZETA and its cousin Sceptre would serve for many years as experimental devices.|$|R
5000|$|In the tokamak, {{stellarator}} {{and most}} <b>pinch</b> <b>devices,</b> the plasma {{is forced to}} follow helical magnetic lines. This alternately moves the plasma from {{the outside of the}} confinement area to the inside. While on the outside, the particles are being pushed inward, following a concave line. As they move to the inside they are being pushed outward, following a convex line. Thus, following Teller's reasoning, the plasma is inherently more stable on the inside section of the reactor. In practice the actual limits are suggested by the [...] "safety factor", q, which vary over the volume of the plasma.|$|R

50|$|Although it {{remained}} relatively unknown for years, Soviet scientists used the pinch concept {{to develop the}} tokamak device. Unlike the stabilized <b>pinch</b> <b>devices</b> in the US and UK, the tokamak used considerably more energy in the stabilizing magnets, and much less in the plasma current. This reduced the instabilities due to the large currents in the plasma, and led to great improvements in stability. The results of their experiments were so good that other researchers were skeptical of {{them when they were}} first announced in full force in 1968. Members of the still-operational ZETA team were called in to verify the results. The tokamak has since gone on to become the most studied approach to controlled fusion.|$|R
2500|$|In 1956, while {{planning}} a well publicised state visit by Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin to the UK, the Harwell researchers received {{an offer from}} Soviet scientist Igor Kurchatov to give a talk. They were surprised when he began his talk on [...] "the possibility of producing thermonuclear reactions in a gaseous discharge". Kurchatov's speech revealed the Soviet efforts to produce fast <b>pinch</b> <b>devices</b> similar to the American designs, and their problems with instabilities in the plasmas. Kurchatov noted that they had also seen neutrons being released, and had initially believed them to be from fusion. But as they examined the numbers, it became clear the plasma was not hot enough and they concluded the neutrons were from other interactions.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} plasma profiles evolution during pulsed poloidal {{current drive}} experiments {{performed with the}} RFX reversed field <b>pinch</b> <b>device.</b> With external drive of edge poloidal current, magnetic fluctuations are reduced suggesting a concomitant reduction of the spontaneous dynamo action. The electron temperature profile is seen to peak in the plasma core, consistently with a reduction of the heat conductivity due to a substantial decrease of MHD dynamo fluctuations. Our results also indicate that the magnetic turbulence due to these fluctuations, which dominates heat transport {{in the core of}} the reverse field pinch configuration, does not drive an appreciable heat flux at the edge...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of {{transient}} transport experiments in a reversed-field <b>pinch</b> <b>device.</b> Measurements {{have been made in}} the Madison Symmetric Torus experiment using a novel soft x-ray diagnostic. Spontaneous transient transport events are observed in enhanced confinement shots obtained using the pulsed parallel current drive technique, as a consequence of bursts of magnetic fluctuations triggered by an edge resonant m = 0 instability. The perturbed electron heat diffusivity, chi(e), is estimated through a numerical transient heat transport model, and the values thus obtained are compared with those measured in similar unperturbed enhanced confinement and standard plasmas using the power balance technique...|$|E
40|$|A strong {{external}} dc {{magnetic field}} introduces a basic anisotropy in incompressible MHD turbulence. The modifications {{that this is}} likely to produce in the properties of the turbulence are investigated for high Reynolds numbers. It is found that the turbulent spectrum splits into two parts: (1) an essentially two-dimensional spectrum with both the velocity field and the magnetic fluctuations perpendicular to the dc magnetic field, and (2) a generally weaker and more nearly isotropic spectrum of Alfven waves. These results are discussed in relation to measurements from the Culham-Harwell Zeta <b>pinch</b> <b>device</b> and the UCLA Macrorotor tokamak, as well as in relation to measurements of MHD turbulence in the solar wind...|$|E
40|$|To study {{processes}} {{involved in}} a helical structure formation in reversed field <b>pinch</b> <b>devices,</b> the scaling of a turbulent boundary layer width associated with a vortex structure having large shears of magnetic field and flow is obtained for reduced magnetohydrodynamics. The coherent vortex, with its flow and magnetic shears, interacts with Alfvén turbulence, forming a turbulent boundary layer {{at the edge of}} the vortex. The layer arises from the balance between turbulence diffusion rates and shearing rates and suppresses the turbulence in the structure. The suppression of turbulence impedes relaxation of the coherent vortex profiles, leading to long coherence times. The scaling of the boundary layer width reveals that both magnetic shear and flow shear can effectively suppress magnetic turbulence...|$|R

50|$|Early {{stellarator}} designs used {{a system}} {{similar to those}} in the <b>pinch</b> <b>devices</b> to provide the initial heating to bring the gas to plasma temperatures. This consisted of a single set of windings from a transformer, with the plasma itself forming the secondary set. When energized with a pulse of current, the particles in the region are rapidly energized and begin to move. This brings additional gas into the region, quickly ionizing the entire mass of gas. This concept was referred to as ohmic heating because it relied on the resistance of the gas to create heat, in a fashion not unlike a conventional resistance heater. As the temperature of the gas increases, the conductivity of the plasma improves. This makes the ohmic heating process less and less effective, and this system is limited to temperatures of about 1 million Kelvin.|$|R
40|$|Turbulence {{induced by}} the ion {{temperature}} gradient (ITG) is investigated in the helical and axisymmetric plasma states of a reversed field <b>pinch</b> <b>device</b> by means of gyrokinetic calculations.

Despite its enhanced confinement, the high-current helical state demonstrates a lower ITG stability threshold compared to the axisymmetric state, and ITG turbulence is expected to become an important contributor to the total heat transport.

50|$|A {{reversed}} field pinch {{is formed}} similarly to other toroidal <b>pinch</b> <b>devices,</b> by driving current through the plasma from an associated capacitor bank or other high-current power source. In a tokamak the toroidal field is much stronger than the poloidal field, but in an RFP it's just the opposite. In fact, in an RFP the externally applied toroidal field is switched off shortly after startup. The plasma in an RFP is also {{much closer to the}} wall than in a Tokamak. This permits a peculiar arrangement of the magnetic field lines, which will 'relax' into a new state such that the total magnetic energy in the plasma is minimized and the total magnetic helicity is conserved. The relaxed state, called a Taylor state, is marked by a peculiar arrangement of magnetic field lines where the toroidal magnetic field at the edge spontaneously reverses direction.|$|R

2500|$|By early 1952 {{there were}} {{numerous}} <b>pinch</b> <b>devices</b> in operation; Cousins and Ware had built several follow-on machines under the name Sceptre, and the Harwell team had built a series of ever-larger machines known as Mark I through Mark IV.

It was clear to all of these groups that something was seriously wrong in the pinch machines. As the current was applied, the plasma column inside the vacuum tube would become unstable and break up, ruining the compression. Further work identified two types of instabilities, nicknamed [...] "kink" [...] and [...] "sausage". In the kink, the normally toroidal plasma would bend to the sides, eventually touching the edges of the vessel. In the sausage, the plasma would neck down at locations along the plasma column to form a pattern similar to a link of sausages.|$|R
