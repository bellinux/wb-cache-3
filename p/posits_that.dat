5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E
5|$|The Standard Model <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> {{elementary}} particles {{derive their}} masses from the Higgs mechanism, which is associated to the Higgs boson.

5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E
5|$|As {{the two are}} {{otherwise}} unattested outside of Snorri's Prose Edda, suggestions have been made that Hjúki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> Snorri may have known or had access to a now lost verse source wherein Hjúki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} dís (a type of female deity).|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{factors include}} {{claims that the}} {{relationship}} between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Euryarchaeota and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as Thermotoga maritima, from horizontal gene transfer. The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the eocyte hypothesis, <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E

5|$|In both Feuchtwanger's {{novel and}} Harlan's film, the {{dramatic}} climax is rape. However, Feuchtwanger <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> Süß has a hidden daughter whom the duke discovers, rapes and who then dies by drowning. The novel then focuses on Süß's {{grappling with the}} desire for revenge and the tragedy resulting from his decision to exact vengeance {{for the loss of}} his daughter. Harlan replaced the rape of Süß's daughter by the duke with Süß's rape of an Aryan woman, thus completely inverting Feuchtwanger's plot device from a father's tragic quest for vengeance to the punishment of a Jew for having sexual relations with a Christian.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E

On July 12, 2001, Olds was arrested for {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol and resisting arrest near his home in Steamboat Springs. Olds, briefly hospitalized during the incident for facial cuts, pleaded guilty in return for charges of weaving and felony vehicular eluding being dropped. Olds was placed on one year probation, and ordered to pay almost $900in fines and costs, attend an alcohol education course, and perform 72hours of community service.|$|E
5|$|Olivia worries it {{will happen}} again, and though she {{attempts}} to ward off sleep, she next dreams that she helps a woman murder her husband at a restaurant. They interview the wife, who tells them she became so convinced her husband {{was going to leave}} her that she became angry and stabbed him. The team <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> while no one is actually causing the incidents, they are happening as Olivia has seen them. At the restaurant, the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene. Walter <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> because she never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those near him adopt his emotions. Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child, Lane was treated with the nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials, and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes.|$|E
5|$|The R+L=J theory <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> {{rather than}} Rhaegar {{kidnapping}} Lyanna, {{they fell in}} love and ran away together. Living for a year in the Tower of Joy, they conceived a child—Jon. Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert, and Lyanna died in childbirth. Ned claimed the baby as his own to protect him from Robert, who sought to exterminate all Targaryens out of hatred and to secure his claim to the throne.|$|E

5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> {{having an}} induced abortion {{can increase the}} risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer over time.|$|E
5|$|The second theory <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> either {{increased}} {{blood flow}} to the brain or increase in the brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role, but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vivo and suggests that CBF is abnormally elevated in many patients with IIH. Both biopsy samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue. It remains unclear why this might be the case.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos {{would have to}} contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E

5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} {{in a city with}} a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by thousands of people who were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions.|$|E
5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E

Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, <b>posits</b> <b>that</b> the gradual alteration of the prints above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.|$|E
