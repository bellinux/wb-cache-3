It crashes into the kingdom's huge stove, {{knocking}} over a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The water puts out the fire, which causes the warm updraft {{going into the}} chimney to cease; this updraft was actually holding Seven's barge in stasis all of this time. The barge comes crashing down into the kingdom, and Jake uses his stretching powers to save Finn. Thence, Finn, Jake, and Seven escape.|$|E
5|$|Once, Khandoba and Mhalsa {{play a game}} of saripat (translated as game of dice or chess). Khandoba loses {{everything}} to Mhalsa in the wager, except his dhoti, his flag, his staff (wand) and his bhandari, the bag of magical bhandara (turmeric powder). In a dream, he sees Banai and falls in love with her. He goes on a hunt in the forest, gets away from the army and stays with Banai for twelve years. He marries her in non-ritualistic marriage and brings her back to Jejuri. A variant describes how Khandoba arrives in Chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty. A Dhangar directs him to Banai's vada. Banai offers him water or sends a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> in which Khandoba reads Banai's name. In another version, the pot with nine jewels is a sign for Khandoba to recognise Banai, the girl he saw in his dream. He falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with Mhalsa and accepts a twelve-year exile. In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father. Some folk songs have erotic overtones, for example, some songs give erotic descriptions of Banai's beauty which maddens Khandoba.|$|E

25|$|The purna kumbha or full <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is {{the second}} most {{discernible}} element of the Ganga iconography. Appearing first also in the relief in Udayagiri Caves (5th century), it gradually appeared more frequently as the theme of the goddess matured. By the seventh century it had become an established feature, as seen, for example, the Dashavatara temple, Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh (seventh century), the Trimurti temple, Badoli, Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, and at the Lakshmaneshwar temple, Kharod, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, (ninth or tenth century), and seen very clearly in frame 3 above and less clearly in the remaining frames. Worshipped even today, the full pot is emblematic of the formless Brahman, as well as of woman, of the womb, and of birth. Furthermore, The river goddesses Ganga and Saraswati were both born from Brahma's pot, containing the celestial waters.|$|E
500|$|Archaeologists {{have found}} {{evidence}} of textile dyeing {{dating back to the}} Neolithic period. In China, dyeing with plants, barks and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years. The essential process of dyeing changed little over time. [...] Typically, the dye material is put in a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and then the textiles to be dyed are added to the pot, which is heated and stirred until the color is transferred. [...] Textile fibre may be dyed before spinning ("dyed in the wool"), but most textiles are [...] "yarn-dyed" [...] or [...] "piece-dyed" [...] after weaving. Many natural dyes require the use of chemicals called mordants to bind the dye to the textile fibres; tannin from oak galls, salt, natural alum, vinegar, and ammonia from stale urine were used by early dyers. [...] Many mordants, and some dyes themselves, produce strong odors, and large-scale dyeworks were often isolated in their own districts.|$|E

[...] In fondue bourguignonne, diners dip small pieces of beef into a pot of hot oil at the table. [...] Both techniques typically feature accompanying flavorful sauces to complement the meat.|$|E

2500|$|Whole Foods {{announced}} in June 2006 {{that it would}} stop selling live lobsters and crabs, but in February 2007 made an exception for a Portland, Maine store {{for its ability to}} meet [...] "humane standards". The lobsters are kept in private compartments instead of being piled {{on top of one another}} in a tank, and employees use a device that gives them a 110-volt shock so that they are not boiled alive in a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> This decision was criticized by ex-lobsterman Trevor Corson as damaging a New England tradition and as removing people's connection to where their food actually comes from.|$|E
2500|$|When a trunk {{with good}} starch is discovered, {{one or more}} women will open {{up most of the}} trunk from base to top of the tree and {{systematically}} pound the fiber with the back of an axe to loosen it up and soften it. Large amounts (15–50kg) are then transported back to the camp in baskets for further processing. At camp the palm fiber is dipped handful by handful into a pot full of water and wrung out by hand to extract all the starch. [...] The <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> containing the starch is then used to boil meat or insect larva. This mixture will be eaten hot (as a thick gravy broth) or allowed to cool overnight, which hardens it into a pudding.|$|E

50|$|Chelama is {{the oldest}} well in the village, dug {{approximately}} 200 years ago. Water from this well is considered pure by the villagers.

5|$|India's first {{records of}} {{smallpox}} {{can be found}} in a medical book that dates back to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox. India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted. Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> cool <b>water</b> in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims. Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease.
