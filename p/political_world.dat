5|$|In 1989, {{shortly after}} the fall of the Berlin Wall, Zacharias was invited to speak in Moscow. While there he spoke to {{students}} at the Lenin Military Academy as well as political leaders at the Center for Geopolitical Strategy. This was the first of many evangelism opportunities towards the <b>political</b> <b>world.</b> Future events included an invitation to Bogota, Colombia in 1993, where he spoke to the judiciary committee on the importance of having a solid moral foundation.|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the <b>political</b> <b>world.</b> The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The <b>political</b> <b>world</b> is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'Ã©tat. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

Still, Treen won by fewer than ten thousand votes. Lambert said that he believed that Fitzmorris' suit had cost Lambert the governorship.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 the Italian <b>political</b> <b>world</b> {{was shaken}} by the Mani Pulite (clean hands) {{corruption}} scandal, after {{which most of the}} parties that had been the traditional political supporters of the mafia would disappear.

25|$|When Papagos {{died after}} a brief illness (1955), King Paul of Greece {{appointed}} the 48-year-old Karamanlis as Prime Minister. The King's appointment took the Greek <b>political</b> <b>world</b> by surprise, as it bypassed Stephanos Stephanopoulos and Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, two senior Greek Rally politicians who were widely considered as the heavyweights {{most likely to succeed}} Papagos. After becoming Prime Minister, Karamanlis reorganized the Greek Rally as the National Radical Union. One of the first bills he promoted as Prime Minister implemented the extension of full voting rights to women, which stood dormant although nominally approved in 1952. Karamanlis won three successive elections (1956, 1958 and 1961).|$|E
25|$|The {{worldwide}} Great Depression, {{starting in}} 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European <b>political</b> <b>world,</b> {{leading to the}} rise of fascism as an ideology and a movement arrayed against both liberalism and communism, especially in Nazi Germany and Italy. The rise of fascism in the 1930s eventually culminated in the Second World War, the deadliest conflict in human history. The Allies prevailed in the war by 1945, and their victory {{set the stage for the}} Cold War between the communist Eastern Bloc and the liberal Western Alliance.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{on leaving}} the Army, Hutchison pitched into the <b>political</b> <b>world</b> as Conservative {{candidate}} in Glasgow Central. The previous election {{had seen a}} relatively narrow Conservative majority of 3,521, and was regarded as close {{enough to be a}} test of opinion among the Glasgow business community. Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill (who was somewhat late arriving) addressed a mass meeting at Blythswood Square in the division and received a warm reception from a large crowd. In the circumstances of the election (where the Conservatives lost 180 seats), Hutchison did well to win by 1,516 although the swing in Glasgow was much less than elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{continued}} his campaign against any further {{transfer of power}} to Indian natives. He continued to predict conflict in India and mass unemployment at home. His speeches often quoted nineteenth-century politicians and his own policy was to maintain the existing Raj. In pursuing this campaign Churchill cut himself off from the mainstream of Conservative politics as much as {{from the rest of}} the <b>political</b> <b>world.</b> Younger Conservatives such as Duff Cooper, who later described Churchill's campaign as the most unfortunate event that occurred between the two wars, and Harold Macmillan saw Churchill as a reactionary, someone who was completely out of touch and at base, undemocratic - leaning towards the totalitarian regimes. Churchill's public comments often seemed that way.|$|E
25|$|With {{the acts}} of allegorizing mythological-pastoral world of drama, Dubravka expands {{the meaning of the}} plot on the {{contemporary}} <b>political</b> <b>world</b> of Dubrovnik and also expands with the convention certain limits of the pastoral and pastoral genre itself. At the same time, according to its ideal imaginary political vision of a prosperous city-state, Dubravka is a kind of utopia; its a hymn to the ideal social order and to {{the best of all possible}} countries ruled by divine principles of fairness, honesty, beauty and goodness. With the pastoral story line set in a timeless, mythical world of eternal love and freedom, in the allegorical tone, GunduliÄ sets his work in the specific time and place and gives it the moral, political and ethical meaning of his time, noting also its advantages and disadvantages.|$|E

25|$|In the {{subsequent}} year, the social psychologist Gerhard Vinnai (University of Bremen), came to similar conclusions. When writing his work Hitler â Scheitern und Vernichtungswut (2004; âHitler â Failing and rage of destructionâ), Vinnai had a psychoanalytic point of depart; he first subjected Hitlerâs book Mein Kampf a depth psychological interpretation {{and tried to}} reconstruct how Hitler had processed his experiences in World War I {{against the background of}} his childhood and youth. But similar to Dorpat, Vinnai explains the destructive potential in Hitler's psyche {{not so much as a}} result of early childhood experiences, but rather due to trauma that Hitler had suffered as a soldier in World War I. Not only Hitler, but a substantial part of the German population was affected by such war trauma. Vinnai then leaves the psychoanalytical discourse and comments on social psychological questions, such as how Hitlerâs <b>political</b> <b>world</b> view could have emerged from his trauma and how this could appeal to large numbers of people.|$|E
25|$|In 1841 Lowe {{moved to}} London {{to read for}} the Bar, but his {{eyesight}} showed signs of serious weakness, and, acting on medical advice, sailed to Sydney in the colony of New South Wales, where he set {{to work in the}} law courts. On 7 November 1843 he was nominated by Sir George Gipps, the Governor of New South Wales, to a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council; owing to a difference with Gipps he resigned his seat on 9 September 1844, but was elected in April 1845 for Counties of St Vincent and Auckland. Lowe held that seat until 20 June 1848 and was elected for City of Sydney in July 1848, a seat he held until November 1849. Lowe soon made his mark in the <b>political</b> <b>world</b> by his clever speeches, particularly on finance and education; and besides obtaining a large legal practice, he was involved with the founding {{and was one of the}} principal writers for the Atlas newspaper.|$|E
25|$|In January 1932, Rundstedt was {{appointed}} commander of Wehrkreis III, based in Berlin, and also given {{command of the}} 3rd Infantry Division. This brought him, at 57, into the highest ranks of the German Army, reflected in his promotion to Lieutenant General (Generalleutnant). It also inevitably brought him into close contact with the <b>political</b> <b>world,</b> which was in a disturbed state due to the Great Depression and subsequent rise of Hitler's Nazi Party. The Defence Minister, General Kurt von Schleicher, was intriguing to bring the Nazis into the government, and the Chancellor, Franz von Papen, was planning to overthrow the Social Democrat government of Prussia, Germany's largest state. Despite his dislike of politics, Rundstedt could not remain uninvolved in these matters. In July 1932 Papen used his emergency powers to dismiss the Prussian Government. Martial law was briefly declared in Berlin and Rundstedt was made martial law plenipotentiary. He protested to Papen about this and martial law was lifted after a few days. In October Rundstedt was promoted to full General and given command of Gruppenkommando 1, covering the whole of eastern Germany.|$|E
