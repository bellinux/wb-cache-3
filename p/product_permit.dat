In 2010 researches were carried out in three Sicilian plum orchards, two in Palermo Province (Monreale and San Giuseppe Jato) and one in Agrigento Province (Castrofilippo), in order to monitor the population, to evaluate damage levels caused by the plum moth and to estimate how many generations it could complete by Charmillot’s forecasting model. In addition, in San Giuseppe Jato, the effectiveness of mineral oil and Spinosad, <b>products</b> <b>permitted</b> in organic farming, was evaluated on three different plum cultivars, Angeleno, Friar and Stanley. Field data showed that the plum moth completes at least three yearly generations. Moreover, clear differences have been found among the cultivars compared in San Giuseppe Jato orchard, Angeleno being the most susceptible to the moth attack. Local plum cultivars in Monreale were more susceptible to plum moth attack than all the other ones. Charmillot's model about generation numbers by temperature records, provided an overestimate of the C. funebrana generations. The only orchard in which the infestation level was very low was that in Castrofilippo. Field trials did not show adequate efficacy of tested products to reduce C. funebrana damages...|$|R

The heating devices are brought {{into contact with the}} semi-finished product simultaneously from opposing sides. A three dimensional form part is formed by application of difference pressure between an upper side and a lower side of the semi-finished product. The heating circuit is provided with a ceramic heating layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a heating device for performing a method for thermoforming a thermoplastic semi-finished product. USE - Method for thermoforming a thermoplastic semi-finished product. ADVANTAGE - The thermoplastic semi-finished product obtains local differing forming characteristics even for small and middle-sized forming geometries without the use of pre-drawing pressing or irradiative heating. The method avoids the need for adjusting absorption characteristics of the <b>product,</b> <b>permits</b> fine adjustable temperature distribution within the thermoplastic semi-finished <b>product,</b> and <b>permits</b> a targeted control of a wall thickness distribution in the product...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} in HPLC based {{procedure that}} has been developed for {{the determination of the}} 9 -fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC) content of protected amine-functionalised polymer beads. FMOC reagents are frequently employed both in the protection of amines and in their determination. The procedure utilises the stoichiometric base cleavage of dibenzofulvene from the protected amine using 1, 8 -diazabicyclo undec- 7 -ene. This stearically hindered base prevents the adduct formation that occurs with alternative base systems and measurement performance is enhanced by the incorporation of anthracene into the system as a non-reactive internal standard. HPLC separation of the reaction <b>products</b> <b>permits</b> the measurement of FMOC in the presence of additional chromophores that might otherwise impede direct measurement by UV-vis spectrophotometry.
