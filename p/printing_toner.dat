40|$|A {{halftone}} {{image in}} the computer is a bitmap matrix that contains either 0 or 1, where 0 means the printer will not deposit any toner onto a paper and 1 means the printer will deposit some amount of toner onto a paper. The amount of toner that is put by the printer onto a paper for a given input signal pattern is characterized. The hypothesis was that the distribution of toner mass on the paper for a given input matrix pattern can be modeled with a toner point spread function, a toner transfer efficiency function, and a noise function. In order to study <b>toner</b> mass distribution <b>printed</b> on paper, {{it is necessary to}} develop an analytical technique for measuring the distribution of toner mass. The analytical technique used in this thesis is an optical analysis based on light transmitted through the printed sample. This analytical technique was calibrated against a gravimetric analysis. Linear relation between the optical analysis and gravimetric analysis indicates that the technique can be used for measuring spatial distribution of <b>printed</b> <b>toner</b> mass on a micro-scale. Guided by experimental measurements of toner mass distribution, a quantitative model of the three printer functions, the spread function, the toner delivery function, and the noise function, were characterized. These functions were used to construct a printer function that was used to compare the efficiency of different halftone patterns. The result of the printer model was extended to include the optical point spread function of the paper. This provided a complete printing model that simulated both physical and optical dot gain...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{substrates}} {{have been used}} for fabrication of microchips for DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and DNA fragment separation, including the more conventional glass and silicon as well as alternative polymer-based materials. Polyester represents one such polymer, and the laser-printing of toner onto polyester films {{has been shown to be}} effective for generating polyester-toner (PeT) microfluidic devices with channel depths on the order of tens of micrometers. Here, we describe a novel and simple process that allows for the production of multilayer, high aspect-ratio PeT microdevices with substantially larger channel depths. This innovative process utilizes a CO(2) laser to create the microchannel in polyester sheets containing a uniform layer of <b>printed</b> <b>toner,</b> and multilayer devices can easily be constructed by sandwiching the channel layer between uncoated cover sheets of polyester containing precut access holes. The process allows the fabrication of deep channels, with similar to 270 mu m, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of multilayer PeT microchips for dynamic solid phase extraction (dSPE) and PCR amplification. With the former, we found that (i) more than 65 % of DNA from 0. 6 mu L of blood was recovered, (ii) the resultant DNA was concentrated to greater than 3 ng/mu L., (which was better than other chip-based extraction methods), and (iii) the DNA recovered was compatible with downstream microchip-based PCR amplification. Illustrative of the compatibility of PeT microchips with the PCR process, the successful amplification of a 520 bp fragment of lambda-phage DNA in a conventional thermocycler is shown. The ability to handle the diverse chemistries associated with DNA purification and extraction is a testimony to the potential utility of PeT microchips beyond separations and presents a promising new disposable platform for genetic analysis that is low cost and easy to fabricate.
