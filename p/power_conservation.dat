50|$|HiperLAN {{does not}} {{conflict}} with microwave and other kitchen appliances, which are on 2.4 GHz.An innovative feature of HIPERLAN 1, which may other wireless networks do not offer, {{is its ability}} to forward data packets using several relays. Relays can extend the communication on the MAC layer beyond the radio range. For <b>power</b> <b>conservation,</b> a node may set up a specific wake up pattern. This pattern determines at what time the node is ready to receive, so that at other times, the node can turn off its receiver and save energy. These nodes are called p-savers and need so called p-supporters that contain information about wake up patterns of all the p-savers they are responsible for. A p-supporter only forwards data to a p-saver at the moment p-saver is awake. This action also requires buffering mechanisms for packets on p-supporting forwaders.|$|E

40|$|Conservation farming (CF) {{offers a}} set of {{sustainable}} agronomic practices for Zambian smallholder farmers using either hand hoe or animal draft tillage. The CF package includes dry-season land preparation using minimum tillage methods (hand hoe basins or ADP ripping), crop residue retention, precision input application (in a precise grid of planting basins or along rip lines), and nitrogen-fixing crop rotations. These practices aim to improve soil structure and water retention and {{reduce the need for}} chemical fertilizers {{while at the same time}} increasing crop yield. Yet CF also increases weeding labor, at least in the early years following adoption. Using survey data from the 2001 / 2 cropping season, this paper evaluates yield gains against input usage increases in order to assess financial incentives for farmers to switch from conventional to CF tillage systems. Results suggest that in 2001 / 2 CF basins proved financially more attractive to hand hoe farmers than conventional hand hoe tillage in in Zambia’s Agro-ecological Regions I and IIa, regions of erratic rainfall and in areas with extensive plow-pan damage where 440, 000 smallholders currently farm.
