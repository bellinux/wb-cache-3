The two main state-owned broadcasters, Channel One and Rossiya, did not interrupt their regular programming following the school seizure. After explosions and gunfire started on the third day, NTV Russia shifted away from the scenes of mayhem to broadcast a World War II soap opera.

25|$|A 2014 poll {{commissioned}} by the US Spanish-language network Univision of more than 2,000 Catholics in 12 countries (Uganda, Spain, the US, Brazil, Argentina, France, Mexico, Italy, Colombia, Poland, the Philippines, and the DRC) found that two thirds of respondents were opposed {{to the idea of}} civil same-sex marriage, and around one third was in favor.

25|$|Managed {{care plans}} are widely {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing {{the health care industry}} to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those <b>polled</b> <b>said</b> they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the series, the PublicMind {{conducted}} a second national survey on The Sopranos. In this poll, 41% of the 776 people <b>polled</b> <b>said</b> that they watched the show regularly, and 61% of this group (194 people, or 25% of the total) disagreed with the idea that the show portrayed Italian Americans in a negative light. Professor Roberts stated: [...] "The show helped to perpetuate one of the more problematic and stereotypical images of Italian Americans. Both Italian and Italian American cultures have much more diverse and interesting heritages than the American public generally realizes." [...] Humanities professor Camille Paglia, herself an Italian American, has spoken negatively about The Sopranos, arguing that its depiction of Italian Americans was inaccurate, inauthentic, dated, and racist.|$|E

30|$|As {{previously}} seen, generating {{pairs of}} matching events, across different traces, requires the master {{to send a}} request to the slave. This {{can be achieved by}} having the master trigger a hardware interrupt on the slave, thus forcing its workflow to be suspended in order to process the incoming interruption. Upon reception of the interruption, the slave can write its ACK flag in the shared memory. In the meantime, the master would <b>poll</b> <b>said</b> memory and wait for the slave to complete.|$|R
50|$|Over time, many in France became {{disappointed}} with Hollande's government, believing {{that it had}} failed to deliver on its promises. In particular, his government failed to reduce chronically high unemployment rates in the country: in early 2016 the rate was at 10.6 percent, up from 9 percent when Hollande took office, while the youth unemployment rate was above 25 percent. By early 2016, opinion <b>polls</b> <b>said</b> that four in five voters were opposed to Hollande running for re-election in 2017.|$|R

2500|$|Cheating in {{high schools}} is growing in the United States at an {{exponential}} rate. There {{is also a great}} difference in students' perceptions and the realty of their own ethical behavior. In a 2008 survey of 30,000 students in high school carried out by the Josephson Institute for Youth Ethics, 62 percent of students <b>polled</b> <b>said</b> they [...] "copied another's homework two or more times in the past year." [...] Yet, on the same survey, 92 percent said they were [...] "satisfied with their personal ethics and character." [...] Hence, there is generally a discrepancy between actual behavior and self-image of high school students' character.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{empirical}} evidence that immigration, including illegal immigration, increases {{the crime rate}} in the United States. According to PolitiFact, [...] "every expert we <b>polled</b> <b>said</b> there is a consensus among scholars that undocumented immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens." [...] Most {{studies have shown that}} illegal immigrants tend to commit less crime than natives. For immigration in general, a majority of studies in the U.S. have found lower crime rates among immigrants than among non-immigrants, and that higher concentrations of immigrants are associated with lower crime rates. Some research even suggests that increases in immigration may partly explain the reduction in the U.S. crime rate.|$|E

50|$|Polls in {{the past}} have shown that most Japanese people oppose an {{expansion}} of immigration. However, a recent 2015 poll by the Asahi Shimbun found that fewer people (34%) oppose an expansion of immigration to maintain Japan's economic status {{in the face of a}} shrinking and rapidly aging workforce, while many (51%) people support increased immigration.

2500|$|Just {{before the}} NPA's announcement, however, {{at least two}} {{political}} parties intimated that they would consider legal action of their own should the charges be dropped. The Democratic Alliance subsequently filed for a judicial review of the NPA's decision, with party leader Helen Zille stating that Mpshe had [...] "not taken a decision based in law, but [...] buckled to political pressure". The case was set to be heard on 9 June 2009. Whilst Zuma filed his responses timeously, Mpshe delayed the hearing of the matter, requesting two extensions to file the NPA's response. NPA spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga {{said he could not}} file papers because there were [...] "outstanding matters" [...] to be resolved. Zille, the Democratic Alliance's party head contended that Zuma's response was fundamentally wrong and [...] "devoid of any constitutional basis". Whilst the legal challenges continued, a survey showed that, as at June 2009, more than half of South Africans believed President Jacob Zuma was doing a good job. The poll, conducted by TNS Research Studies in the last half of June 2009, revealed that Zuma's approval ratings had steadily improved. Around 57% of the people <b>polled</b> <b>said</b> they thought Zuma was a capable leader – this was up 3% from April 2009 when the president was inaugurated. In November 2008, just months after former president Thabo Mbeki was recalled and when Zuma was facing graft charges, only 36% of South Africans were positive about him.|$|E
