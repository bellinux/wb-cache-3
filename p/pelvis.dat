5|$|The pudendal nerve passes {{between the}} {{piriformis}} muscle and coccygeus (ischiococcygeus) muscles {{and leaves the}} <b>pelvis</b> through {{the lower part of}} the greater sciatic foramen. It crosses over the lateral part of the sacrospinous ligament and reenters the <b>pelvis</b> through the lesser sciatic foramen. After reentering the <b>pelvis,</b> it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal, along with the internal pudendal blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The <b>pelvis</b> and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the <b>pelvis),</b> which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the first}} bones to be {{affected}} are the fingers, facial bones, ribs, and <b>pelvis.</b> Long bones, which are longer than they are wide, are also among the first affected. As the disease progresses, any bone may be affected.|$|E

50|$|Other researchers, like Yoel Rak, from Tel-Aviv University in Israel, {{have noted}} that the fossil records show that Neanderthal <b>pelvises</b> in {{comparison}} to modern human <b>pelvises</b> {{would have made it}} much harder for Neanderthals to absorb shock and to bounce off from one step to the next, giving modern humans another advantage over Neanderthals in running and walking ability.|$|R

5|$|Herrerasaurus {{displays}} {{traits that}} are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most {{of the characteristics of}} dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its <b>pelvis</b> is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets the <b>pelvis)</b> that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Macroolithus eggs {{have been}} found {{containing}} oviraptorid dinosaur embryos resembling Heyuannia. Multiple other associations between oviraptorid and elongatoolithids (including other eggs containing embryos, parents brooding on nests, {{and a pair of}} shelled Macroolithus-like eggs preserved within an oviraptorid's <b>pelvis)</b> confirm that the parent of Macroolithus was an oviraptorid.|$|E
5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the <b>pelvis,</b> such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the <b>pelvis</b> to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
25|$|Anteaters and {{armadillos}} {{are also}} included among Xenarthra. The earliest xenarthrans were arboreal herbivores with sturdy spines, fused <b>pelvises,</b> stubby teeth, and small brains.|$|R
50|$|Reflecting {{the overall}} sex {{differences}} {{between male and}} female <b>pelvises,</b> the obturator foramina are oval in the male and wider and more triangular in the female.|$|R
50|$|The twins' two <b>pelvises</b> {{formed a}} single {{combined}} ring. Each twin had one working kidney. Lakshmi {{had a second}} kidney which was necrotic. The autosite's (Lakshmi herself) feet were affected by clubfoot.|$|R
5|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within the <b>pelvis</b> {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue. It may appear {{at the site of}} the cancer but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to the lower back, the external genitalia or perineum.|$|E
5|$|Recurrence {{of early}} stage endometrial cancer ranges from 3 to 17%, {{depending}} on primary and adjuvant treatment. Most recurrences (75–80%) occur {{outside of the}} <b>pelvis,</b> and most occur {{two to three years}} after treatment, 64% after two years and 87% after three years.|$|E
5|$|The tail of Sauropelta was {{characteristically}} {{long and}} made up {{nearly half of the}} body length. One skeleton preserved forty caudal (tail) vertebrae, although some were missing, suggesting that the true number of caudal vertebrae may have exceeded fifty. Ossified tendons stiffened the tail along its length. Like other ankylosaurs, Sauropelta had a wide body, with a very broad <b>pelvis</b> and ribcage. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, which resulted in an arched back, with the highest point over the hips. Its feet, limbs, shoulders, and <b>pelvis</b> were all very stoutly constructed and reinforced to support a great deal of weight. American paleontologist Ken Carpenter estimated the mass of S. edwardsorum at 1,500kilograms (3,300lb).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{deformable}} registration of male <b>pelvises</b> in CT images is proposed. It is composed of three major steps. Firstly, an attribute vector is defined for each voxel in the image, and is used to reflect the density distribution of the bone tissues {{in the neighborhood of}} that voxel. Different anatomical structures thus own different attribute vectors. Secondly, the match of two images under a particular deformation is evaluated by integrating the similarities of attribute vectors on the corresponding voxels. Finally, a set of hierarchical deformation strategies are employed, {{in order to avoid the}} local minimum match of two images. The performance of this deformable registration method has been demonstrated by both synthesized and real CT images of <b>pelvises.</b> 1...|$|R
50|$|Contributing {{factors to}} the {{interlocking}} of twins include uterine hypertonicity, small fetal size, and reduced levels of amniotic fluid following rupture of the membranes. It {{is more likely}} to occur in women with large <b>pelvises,</b> young primigravidae (young women in their first pregnancy), and pregnancies with monoamniotic twins.|$|R
5|$|Thoratic scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to {{teardrop}} shaped, and possess sharp ridges {{that rise}} distally. Some scutes {{were long and}} had small domes on them. The first primary osteoderms on the <b>pelvis</b> are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short point. S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the <b>pelvis.</b> One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was {{from the edge of}} the pelvic region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them. Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the <b>pelvis</b> following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the <b>pelvis,</b> overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} bones are present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the <b>pelvis</b> is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy. The examination of the pubic arch {{and the location of}} the sacrum can help determine sex.|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose Osseous pelvic tumors can be resected and reconstructed using massive bone allografts. Geometric {{accuracy}} of the conventional surgical procedure {{has not yet been}} documented. The aim of this experimental study was mainly to assess {{accuracy of}} tumoral resection with a 10 -mm surgical margin, and also to evaluate the geometry of the host-graft reconstruction. Methods An experimental model on plastic <b>pelvises</b> was designed to simulate tumor resection and reconstruction. 4 experienced surgeons were asked to resect 3 different tumors and to reconstruct <b>pelvises.</b> 24 resections and host-graft junctions were available for evaluation. Resection margins were measured. Several methods were created to evaluate geometric properties of the host-graft junction. Results The probability of a surgeon obtaining a 10 -mm surgical margin with a 5 -mm tolerance above or below, was 52...|$|R
50|$|Descendants of {{the dwarf}} {{men of the}} family were born taller; the women did not become {{pregnant}} due to their small <b>pelvises.</b> The firstborn of the dwarfs, Rozika Ovitz, died in 1984 {{at the age of}} 98. The last adult dwarf survivor of the family, Perla Ovitz, died in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Pelvimetry {{used to be}} {{performed}} routinely to discern if spontaneous labour was medically advisable. Women whose <b>pelvises</b> were deemed too small received caesarean sections instead of birthing naturally. Research indicates that pelvimetry is not a useful diagnostic tool for CPD (see below) and that in all cases spontaneous labour and birthing should be facilitated.|$|R
5|$|His injury {{problems}} {{started as}} early as 1980, when he was 15 years old and saw Glentoran's physio Bobby McGregor to resolve a groin strain; Whiteside said that the highly physical massage he was subjected to damaged his <b>pelvis</b> and robbed him of his natural pace. His lack of pace was later seen as the one weakness in his game. Six weeks into his apprenticeship, in July 1981, and an innocuous looking challenge by a Preston North End player in an 'A' team game saw Whiteside requiring an operation on his right knee. Had the injury occurred {{a couple of years}} later he would have been able to have pioneering keyhole surgery, which could potentially have saved his career. After a seven-month lay-off and a further operation to remove cartilage, he returned to fitness in January 1982. He had to adapt his playing style to compensate for his damaged knee and <b>pelvis,</b> and developed well under youth team coach Eric Harrison.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the <b>pelvis.</b> Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportions}} of the legs, <b>pelvis</b> and sacrum of the Rodrigues and red rail were generally similar. The Rodrigues rail differed from the red rail by having a broader and shorter skull, longer and lower nostrils, a proportionately longer humerus, a shorter, stouter femur, {{as well as a}} considerably different plumage, based on early descriptions.|$|E
30|$|To precise {{the anatomy}} of recto-vaginal septum in women, we study <b>pelvises</b> of female foetal specimens. Posterior anatomy of the pelvic floor {{supports}} is different to anterior one. The recto-vaginal septum does not really exist as a fascia. The recto-vaginal fascia, especially at the level II, is lateral and {{can be defined as}} the recto-vaginal meso.|$|R

5|$|Barbary falcons have a {{red neck}} patch but {{otherwise}} differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only {{the outer part}} of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but less often and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's shoulder and <b>pelvis</b> bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed {{at different times of}} year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies, but they are capable of interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary falcon ("peregrinoid") complex.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, the {{material}} available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM J13505, {{a piece of}} a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth; OUM J13577, a posterior dorsal vertebra; OUM J13579, an anterior caudal vertebra; OUM J13576, a sacrum of five sacral vertebrae; OUM J13585, a cervical rib; OUM J13580, a rib; OUM J29881, an ilium of the <b>pelvis,</b> OUM J13563, a piece of the pubic bone; OUM J13565, a part of the ischium; OUM J13561, a thighbone and OUM J13572, the lower part of a second metatarsal. As he himself was aware, these did not all belong to the same individual; only the sacrum was articulated. Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a syntype series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary (front part of the lower jaw), OUM J13505, as such a lectotype. Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian <b>pelvis,</b> much taller than with typical reptiles, Buckland misidentified several bones, interpreting the pubic bone as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a clavicle. Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the Sauria – the Lizards, at the time seen as including the crocodiles – and he placed it in the new genus Megalosaurus, repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described, indicated an animal twelve metres long in life.|$|E
5|$|However, the <b>pelvis</b> is {{not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
50|$|Paracrax {{is known}} {{from a variety}} of materials, such as <b>pelvises,</b> keels, forelimb {{elements}} and coracoids. The humerus material is distinct from the closely related Bathornis by an internal condyle that is less distinctively raised in relation to the external condyle. Overall, it can be assumed that it had similar proportions to phorusrhacids, with proportionally short wings and a large, deep bill.|$|R
50|$|Sloths {{belong to}} the {{superorder}} Xenarthra, a group of placental mammals that evolved in South America around 60 million years ago, although at least {{one study found that}} xenarthrans broke off from other placental mammals around 100 Mya. Anteaters and armadillos are also included among Xenarthra. The earliest xenarthrans were arboreal herbivores with sturdy spines, fused <b>pelvises,</b> stubby teeth, and small brains.|$|R
50|$|In the sex position, the {{receiving}} partner {{would be in}} the inner spoon position and the penetrator is in the outer spoon in preparation for rear-entry penetration. For penetration, the partners may separate their upper bodies, with just the <b>pelvises</b> connecting, and their legs can also rest on top of each other. The receiving partner may lift the upper knee to allow for easier penetration.|$|R
