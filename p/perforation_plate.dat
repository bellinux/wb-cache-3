5000|$|In {{secondary}} xylem - the xylem which is produced as a stem thickens rather {{than when it}} first appears - a vessel element originates from the vascular cambium. A long cell, oriented along the axis of the stem, called a [...] "fusiform initial", divides along its length forming new vessel elements. The cell wall of a vessel element becomes strongly [...] "lignified", i.e. it develops reinforcing material made of lignin. The side walls of a vessel element have pits: more or less circular regions in contact with neighbouring cells. Tracheids also have pits, but only vessel elements have openings at both ends that connect individual vessel elements to form a continuous tubular vessel. These end openings are called perforations or perforation plates. They {{have a variety of}} shapes: the most common are the simple perforation (a simple opening) and the scalariform perforation (several elongated openings in a ladder-like design). Other types include the foraminate <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> (several round openings) and the reticulate <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> (a net-like pattern, with many openings).|$|E

40|$|The {{qualitative}} and quantitative studies, presented in this article, on wood anatomy of various species belonging to ancient Magnolia genus reveal new aspects of phylogenetic relationships between the species and show evolutionary trends, known to increase fitness of conductive tissues in angiosperms. They also provide new examples of phenotypic plasticity in plants. 			 			The type of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> in vessel members {{is one of the}} most relevant features for taxonomic studies. In Magnolia, until now, two types of perforation plates have been reported: the conservative, scalariform and the specialized, simple one. 			 			In this paper, are presented some findings, new to magnolia wood science, like exclusively simple perforation plates in some species or mixed perforation plates – simple and scalariform in one vessel member. Intravascular pitting is another taxonomically important trait of vascular tissue. Interesting transient states between different patterns of pitting in one cell only have been found. This proves great flexibility of mechanisms, which elaborate cell wall structure in maturing tracheary element. The comparison of this data with phylogenetic trees, based on the fossil records and plastid gene expression, clearly shows that there is a link between the type of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> and the degree of evolutionary specialization within Magnolia genus...|$|E

40|$|High vein density (DV) {{evolution}} in angiosperms represented a key functional transition. Yet, a mechanistic account {{on how this}} hydraulic transformation evolved remains lacking. We demonstrate that a consequence of producing high DV is that veins must become very small to fit inside the leaf, and that angiosperms are the only clade that evolved the specific type of vessel required to yield sufficiently conductive miniature leaf veins. From 111 species spanning key divergences in vascular plant evolution, we show, using analyses of vein conduit {{evolution in}} relation to vein packing, that a key xylem innovation associated with high DV evolution is a strong reduction in vein thickness and simplification of the <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of primary xylem vessels. Simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in the leaf xylem occurred only in derived angiosperm clades exhibiting high DV (> 12 mm mm− 2). <b>Perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in the vessels of other species, including extant basal angiosperms, consisted of resistive scalariform types that were associated with thicker veins and much lower DV.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effect of date palm fibre as backing on sound {{absorption}} using three types of perforation plates and porous layers. The predicted results were verified by measurements conducted in an impedance tube on normal incidence sound absorption of 30 and 50 mm-thick date palm fibre and backing that may have positive effect are elaborated in this study. It describes how the porous materials of date palm fibre absorber panel can change the absorption behavior. The results obtained show that <b>perforation</b> <b>plate,</b> porous layers have a significant effect on absorption, whereas thickness panel have considerable effect too. This further indicate that three types have been used and also supported can be powerfully exploited to improve the absorption of date palm fibre and at the same time a reasonable thickness chosen, would be very efficient for absorption sound. An example is presented to show the approaches of enhancing the absorption, by utilizing the advantage of modification in the absorption sound. It exhibits that properly chosen perforation ratio along with suitable sample thickness can increase the absorption as well as the selected porous layers. It was evident that these can be powerfully exploited to improve the absorption of date palm fibre. Three types of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate,</b> porous layers were used to improve acoustic properties of date palm fibre.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of functionally adaptive diversification of wood {{structure in the}} course of evolution as advanced by Carlquist is critically tested for vessel member length and type of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate.</b> The functional significance of within-tree variation in vessel member morphology is discussed first, and a criticism of Philipson & Butterfield’s theory for explaining classical length-on-age curves for fusiform initial length is given. At the genus and family level examples are cited which contradict the hypothesis that specialization of the <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> has a strong selective advantage for the occupation of more xeric environments or for high conductive rates. Other examples, however, seem to support this. The functional interpretation of correlations between vessel member length and ecological conditions is criticised. A comparison is made between whole woody floras or vegetation types with respect to the proportion of genera with scalariform perforation plates (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 2). In tropical lowland rain forests the percentage of genera with scalariform plates is rather low. It strongly increases for tropical montane forests and for temperate to arctic floras. It is lowest in seasonally dry to arid regions. These trends support Carlquist’s idea that scalariform plates are, in general, only successful for conditions which require low rates of water conduction. In addition, the role of temperature is stressed. The total evidence presented in this paper is discussed in terms of random ‘patio ludens’ evolution which has to a considerable extent been canalized through selective pressures by environmental factors...|$|E

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} manuka growing in five {{different}} habitats was analysed to establish {{whether or not}} different anatomical forms exist. The study involved {{the use of the}} light microscope for obtaining vessel and fibre quantitative data such as their length, width, wall thickness, density of vessel elements in a transection and average grouping of vessels. The confocal microscope was used to measure the area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of fibriform vessels and wide vessels. The study also involved the use of the scanning electron microscope for determining the presence of cell wall sculpturing in the walls of wide vessels. The data was analysed by univariate analysis to determine any variation of wood characters within a population and between populations in the five habitats. The habitats were margins of lowland forests, swamp, sand dune, subalpine and hot thermal soils. The study has established variations within each population in all the cell types. The study showed that plants differed anatomically in the average sizes of their cell length, width, wall thickness, abundance of vessels, area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and the average grouping and the type of grouping of vessels. There was also variation of wood anatomy between populations in most cell characters except for the length of wide vessels, length of fibriform vessels and wall thickness of fibre-tracheids. In these characters the wood anatomy of manuka was more homogeneous. The significant trends were that margins of lowland forests had wide and thick walled cells in all the cell types and also had high average group of vessels and large area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of fibriform vessels and small area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> for wide vessels. It had short libriform fibres and fibre-tracheids. The swamp habitat seemed to follow margins of lowland forests except that it had the longest fibre-tracheids and libriform fibres and had the greatest area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> for wide vessels. Both of these habitats had the lowest density of wide vessels. Sand dune, hot thermal soils and subalpine habitats had on average the smallest vessels in terms of diameter and wall thickness and area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> but had high abundance or density of wide vessels. Sand dune had wide and thick walled libriform fibres like margins of lowland forests. Subalpine and hot thermal soils had comparatively small fibres in all dimensions. Even though variations were established in most of the cell characters, the correlation of wood with ecology was less pronounced as compared to that found in families and genera in past research. Significant trends were manifest in diameter, wall thickness and density of wide vessels. The margins of lowland forests and swamp (more mesic habitats) had great diameter and cell wall thickness. They also had low density of cells. The other habitats, sand dune, subalpine and hot thermal soils (less mesic habitats) had comparatively narrow diameter of wide vessels, thin cell walls and high levels of wide vessels densities. It was found that the other characters such as length, width, wall thickness of fibriform vessels, libriform fibres, and fibre-tracheids, grouping and area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of wide vessels showed complex and overlapping ranges between the habitats and had no significant correlation with ecology. From this research it is clear that general trends of ecological adaptation were evident and also that manuka has its own specific ecological trends...|$|R
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} 81 species of Ilex is {{described}} in detail. The wood anatomical range encountered is presented in a generic description (p. 196). Data on ontogenetic changes in vessel member length and number of bars per perforation are given for three species. The great amount of variation in mainly quantitative but also in some qualitative features is hardly or not related with subgeneric classification but with latitudinal and altitudinal distribution. In both {{the northern and southern}} hemisphere and in both the Old and New World, temperate and subtropical species are characterized by conspicuous growth rings, numerous narrow vessels, relatively short vessel members and few bars per <b>perforation</b> <b>plate,</b> conspicuous spiral thickenings on both vessel and fibre walls, and the fibretracheids are frequently provided with rather numerous conspicuously bordered tangential wall pits. In tropical lowland species growth rings are absent or less marked, the vessels are scanty and wide, the vessel members are long and the number of bars per <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> is high. Spirals are lacking or faint, or occur only in a minor part of the axial elements. The fibre-tracheids have usually few pits with more reduced borders on the tangential walls. Tropical montane species resemble the temperate ones to a great extent, but this does not apply to growth rings, spiral thickenings, and frequency and size of fibre-tracheid pits. The only wood sample of a climbing Ilex species from the tropics studied deviates from the general trend in having few bars per <b>perforation</b> <b>plate.</b> The two temperate species I. serrata and I. verticillata are exceptional in lacking spiral thickenings. In all wood characters they resemble the genus Nemopanthus (also Aquifoliaceae) very closely. Comparisons with data from literature and original observations on Prunus, Symplocos, Vaccinium. Viburnum, and to some extent also on Hydrangea, support the view that the gradual differences between temperate and tropical Ilex species conform to a general trend also present in other taxa. Therefore a major climatic influence on wood structure is indicated. This is discussed with reference to the major trends of phylogenetic wood specialization. The fact that within Ilex and Symplocos the tropical lowland species have perforations with the most numerous bars cannot be brought in agreement with the general phenomenon of a rare occurrence of scalariform perforations in tropical lowland floras. Other items such as the parallel between the absence of spiral thickenings and the presence of entire leaf margins, the lack of a clear taxonomic pattern in the wood anatomical variation in Ilex, and observations by former students of Ilex wood anatomy are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The seven {{families}} hypothesized by Sosa and Chase {{to comprise}} Crossosomatales possess relatively long vessel elements with scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and scalariform to opposite vessel-ray pitting; tracheids; diffuse axial parenchyma; and heterogeneous rays. These and other primitive character {{states do not}} indicate relationships, {{but they do not}} offer any evidence against the idea that Crossosomatales are a natural order. Departures from the primitive character states are related to ecological adaptations. Crossosomataceae have simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> (scalariform brieﬂy {{at the beginning of the}} secondary xylem), a feature correlated with the seasonal aridity of habitats occupied by the family, the sole family of the order to exhibit such an ecological shift. Presence of tracheids (which confer embolism resistance to a wood) in ancestors of Crossosomataceae probably pre-adapted the family for entry into highly seasonal habitats. Minimal vessel grouping in all other genera shows that tracheid presence deters vessel grouping; tracheid presence also deters shortening of vessel elements. Autapomorphies are shown by Aphloiaceae (tracheid dimorphism, rays of two distinct widths); Crossosomataceae (<b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> predominantly simple, lateral wall pitting of vessels alternate); Geissolomataceae (wide rays); Ixerbaceae (ﬁber-tracheid tendency); Staphyleaceae (adjacence of axial parenchyma to vessels); Stachyuraceae (simpliﬁcation of perforation plates); and Strasburgeriaceae (large cell size).

All of these species occur in habitats (cliffs, talus) of mountains of North America that are seasonally dry in summer and cold in winter.

The modifications include wide perforations alternating with narrow perforations (especially prominent in Bommeria); discontinuous perforation plates (Cheilanthes, Pellaea); and narrow, slitlike perforations (Cheilanthes). The discontinuous perforation plates are newly reported for ferns. The exceptionally prominent perforations of Bommeria vessels may be correlated with greater laminar surface and higher transpiration during wet periods in that genus; the other genera have small laminae with probable low transpiration rates even during moist periods...|$|E

Wood anatomy for stem, root, and lignotuber is reported for the monotypic Cape genus Retzia. Stilbaceae and Retziaceae are alike in wood anatomy but differ from Verbenaceae by having scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with few and wide-bordered bars (simple plates and modified scalariform plates are also present); vessel elements clearly fibriform in shape; very scarce axial parenchyma; and long uniseriate wings on multiseriate rays. When added to endosperm presence and ericoid habit, these features may serve to segregate Stilbaceae from Verbenaceae. The wood of Stilbaceae is xeromorphic in having very narrow vessels, numerous vessels per mm 2, and pores grouped into radial multiples. The least xeromorphic wood within Stilbaceae is found in species from relatively moist montane localities; these species also have scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in vessels. The most xeromorphic wood occurs in those Stilbaceae restricted to lowlands or lowlands plus dry montane sites. Scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> are interpreted {{as an indicator of}} primitiveness in Stilbaceae and Retziaceae, an interpretation reinforced by presence of borders on pits of imperforate tracheary elements in Eurylobium serrulatum (all other Stilbaceae have libriform fibers with simple pits).

The wood structure of Oligarrheneae {{is similar to that of}} Styphelieae, but the very narrow vessel elements, exclusively uniseriate rays and the lack of prismatic crystals in Oligarrheneae distinguish these two tribes. The secondary xylem of Monotoca tamariscina indicates that it does not fit in Styphelieae; a position within Oligarrheneae is possible. Like most Cosmelieae, all Richeeae are characterized by exclusively scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with many bars, a very high vessel density and paratracheal parenchyma, although they clearly differ in ray width (exclusively uniseriate rays in Cosmelieae vs. uniseriate and wide multiseriate rays in Richeeae). Several wood anatomical features confirm the inclusion of epacrids in Ericaceae s. l. Furthermore, there are significant ecological implications. The small vessel diameter and high vessel frequency in many epacrids are indicative of a high conductive safety to avoid embolism caused by freeze-thaw cycles, while the replacement of scalariform by simple vessel <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and an increase in vessel diameter would suggest an increased conductive efficiency, which is especially found in mesic temperate or tropical Styphelieae.

40|$|Este trabalho aborda aspectos da caracterização morfológica dos elementos traqueais dos órgãos vegetativos de quatro espécies de Portulacaceae (Portulaca hirsutissima Camb., P. halimoides L., P. werdermannii Poelln., e de P. mucronata Link.) ocorrentes na região Sudeste e Nordeste do Brasil. Os elementos de vaso observados são todos pequenos (This paper {{deals with}} the {{morphological}} features of the tracheary elements of the vegetative organs in four Portulaca species (Portulaca hirsutissima Camb., P. halimoides L., P. wedermannii Poelln. and P. mucronata Link.) occurring in Southeast and Northeast Brazil. The vessel elements are small (< 25 &# 956;m) and with simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plate.</b> The pattern of wall thickening varied from bordered pitting (in roots) to scalariform and helicoidal (stem and leaves). Statistical methods show variation in vessel-element diameter in different vegetative organs; wider elements were observed in roots. Tracheids occurring in leaves of P. hirsutissima and P. wedermannii, have morphological features {{that are similar to}} terminal tracheids or tracheoid idiolasts frequently associated with xerophytes. The paedomorphic features (juvenlism) observed here may be related, in part, to aspects of water transport and storage as described in Cactaceae...|$|E
40|$|The wood {{anatomical}} variation within 17 eurytherm hardwood genera {{in relation}} to altitude and latitude has been studied using wood samples from 52 species. With increasing latitude a miniaturization of secondary xylem elements (shorter vessel members, narrower vessels, shorter and sometimes narrower fibres, lower rays) is reported, together {{with an increase in}} vessel frequency and frequency and expression of helical thickenings to the vessel walls. Increasing altitude has similar but much weaker effects, and none on vessel grouping or helical thickenings. The number of bars per <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> in genera with partly or exclusively scalariform perforations is in general not correlated with altitude or latitude. In the softwood genus Podocarpus tracheid length and diameter and ray height decrease with increasing altitude. An analysis of the wood anatomical variation within 2 species with a wide latitudinal and 5 with a wide altitudinal range did not reveal correlations between the above mentioned features and latitude or altitude. The results are discussed with reference to previous interpretations of latitudinal and altitudinal variation in wood (Baas, 1973), stressing the significance for phylogenetic wood anatomy...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of vestured pits in angiosperms is briefly reviewed. In some major clades, {{the character is}} of constant occurrence and thus very conservative; in others, it is more variable and apparently subject to both parallel origins and reversible losses. There is a striking correlation between the type of vessel <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> and vestured pits. Virtually all taxa with vestured pits have simple perforation plates. This correlation, together with contrasting ecological trends for scalariform perforation plates and vestured pits, has inspired functional hypotheses that vestured pits contribute to hydraulic safety. Whereas scalariform perforations may be instrumental in reducing the effects of freezing-induced embolisms in temperate to boreal and alpine regions, vestured pits {{seem to be a}} good candidate to facilitate embolism reversal in xeric and warmer regions with high transpiration rates. The presence of highly lignified structures within the pit chamber may influence hydraulic resistance, decrease vulnerability to cavitation, or help to repair embolism by compartmentalizing or affecting the contact angle of the convex air-water interface within intervessel pits. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSections {{of fixed}} {{material}} of four collections of three species of Sansevieria were studied {{by means of}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to initiate study of distribution of vessel elements and the ultrastructural nature of tracheary elements in the genus. Roots of Sansevieria have scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in vessels; only tracheids are present in stems (=rhizomes) and leaves. This distribution {{is similar to that}} of genera of Asparagales claimed in recent molecular phylogenies to be close to Sansevieria: Dracaena, Ophiopogon, and Ruscus. Also similar in tracheary element types is Orchidaceae, now considered a member of Asparagales. Ultrastructural study of Sansevieria tracheary elements reveals intermediacy between vessel elements and tracheids because porose pit membranes extend across entire end walls of tracheids, and portions of scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of vessel elements. This correlates with longevity of roots in Sansevieria, and probable moderate transpiration rates in leaves. In Sansevieria, as in other monocotyledons, vessel type occurrence, organographic distribution, and tracheary element ultrastructure relate primarily to ecology, although molecular-based trees, in fact, help understand the patterns of shift in ecological adaptation with attendant change in tracheary element structure...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomical}} characteristics for 21 taxa of Cassiope are reported. Qualitative features differ somewhat {{from the}} general pattern of the Ericaceae. However, considerable deviation {{is found in the}} quantitative aspects of the wood features. The stems are very slender with narrow growth rings evident in all but one species. Vessel elements are very small and usually have scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with several bars. Vessels are extremely abundant in transection. Vascular rays are mostly uniseriate with a few biseriates and all are composed exclusively of erect cells. The imperforate elements are tracheids which are the only conductive elements in the late wood. Calluna-type pith is found in most of the taxa while homogeneous pith is found in two species. The recognition of these in the separate genus Harrimanella is supported. Cassiope plants are often found in moist, protected microenvironments in arctic and alpine areas of extreme cold and desiccating winds. Short growing seasons and low mean temperatures probably contribute {{in large part to the}} dwarf stature of the plants, which in turn accommodates the reduced vascular system. The tracheids provide a safe conductive system in the late wood which is less susceptible to loss of function due to air embolisms. The vessel elements with scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> accommodate the presumably slow conductive rates in the earlier part of the growing season. The vessel elements of Cassiope are considerably smaller than most others known to have scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> The values for vulnerability, an indicator of the degree of vessel redundancy and hence safety, are much lower than any yet calculated for any group. The same is true for figures for mesomorphy, which introduces vessel element length as an independent measure of degree of xeromorphy...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePremise of research. Piperales {{displays}} a wide diversity of growth forms {{that appears to}} be linked with differences in cambial activity and subsequent derived wood production. To date, no overall synthesis of the evolution of woodiness in Piperales has been done and few studies have proposed an ancestral habit (woody/herbaceous). We provide anatomical data of all lineages within Piperales and reconstruct ancestral character states, focusing on the origin of woodiness within the order and on the ecological significance of key anatomical features. Methodology. Stem anatomical observations with special emphasis on wood anatomical features were performed on 28 species of the Piperales; by combining previously published studies with original data, we conducted phylogenetic reconstructions of cambial activity and vessel element <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> to assess the origin of woodiness and vessel evolution in Piperales. Pivotal results. Different patterns of cambial activity are observed in Piperales, from active secondary growth in both intra- and interfascicular areas in Aristolochia, Thottea (Aristolochiaceae), Saruma (Asaraceae), Manekia, and Piper (Piperaceae) to cambial activity mainly restricted to fascicular areas in Saururaceae and a complete lack of secondary growth in Verhuellia. Vessels in Piperaceae, Aristolochiaceae, and Asaraceae present simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> while those of Saururaceae are mostly scalariform. A stem endodermis bearing a Casparian band—an atypical feature in aerial stems—is reported for all genera within the Piperaceae and for Saururus and Houttuynia in the Saururaceae. Conclusions. The common ancestor of the order likely had an active cambium and woody habit, including vessel elements with simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> All woody species share several wood features, including wide and tall rays, suggesting a single origin of wood in the order. The high diversity of growth forms observed in Piperales is linked to frequent shifts in cambial activity and changes in habit-related features within the different lineage...|$|R
