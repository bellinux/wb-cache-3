40|$|BACKGROUND: Human gross anatomy {{is one of}} the {{cornerstones}} of {{a medical}} curriculum and cannot be performed without adequate cadaver procurement, which is a particular challenge for medical schools with a large student enrolment. The authors present the situation in a country with a low public awareness for willed body donor programmes and the prior absence of adequate legislation. AIM: Against this background, a comprehensive proposition of a whole-body procurement procedure was elaborated in the health-care law. RESOLVING THE PROBLEM: The main goals of the proposition were: (a) identification of options for cadaver <b>procurement</b> (<b>body</b> bequeathal programme, unclaimed bodies and body donated with the permission of the next-of-kin); (b) defining the chain of order and responsibility of institutions in informing the medical school of the possible candidate for body procurement; (c) body storage and related procedures; (e) confidentiality of the deceased's personal data; (f) burial procedure of the deceased's remains. CONCLUSIONS: The authors are convinced that the willed programme for whole-body donation is a definite aim of such a legislation. However, we suggest that the acquisition of unclaimed bodies is maintained as a temporary solution, until a satisfactory level of public awareness of the problem has been reached...|$|E
40|$|Organ Donation and Cancer Pr Olivier Detry, Dpt of Abdominal Surgery and Transplantation, University of Liege The risk of {{transmission}} of cancer with the transplanted organ {{has been known}} since the pioneering years of solid organ transplantation, and is enhanced by immunosuppression and particularly the calcineurin inhibitors. Therefore, classically, potential organ donors with past history of cancer are excluded from donation, {{with the exception of}} low-grade malignant tumours of the central nervous system, the skin and the cervix uteri. Despite that policy, every year, some cases of cancer transmission with organ transplantation were regularly reported in transplant medical journals. At the other hand, there is a clear graft shortage, with long organ transplant waiting lists and inacceptable mortality while waiting for a life saving graft. One mean {{to increase the number of}} available grafts could be to accept donation from donors with past history of cancer. Several uncertainties remain: what is the risk of cancer transmission with organ transplantation? This risk depends of course of many donor factors, as the staging and the nature of the donor malignant tumour, the oncological management, the delay between the remission and the organ procurement. This risk may also vary according to the type of organ transplanted, as livers and lungs are more prone to bear occult metastases, compared to the hearts for example. In fact, this risk is unknown, and was clearly overestimated by the old registries as the IPTR, and by the various case reports. All modern prospective registries, as from UNOS or from UK transplant, now report a very low rate of cancer transmission when the donor cancer was known and evaluated before organ donation. Undiagnosed or occult cancer transmission with transplantation is clearly another issue that should not be mistaken with the donors with past history of cancer. In most of the recent reported cases of cancer transmission with transplantation, the donor cancer was not diagnosed before and during organ donation. And this risk increases in modern organ transplantation, as we are now accepting older and older donors, particularly in transplantation of the liver, an organ particularly at risk of metastases. Therefore surgical donor exploration is an important step of organ <b>procurement.</b> <b>Body</b> CT could be a tool to diagnose some, but not all, of these tumours. To my view, the risk of cancer transmission with transplantation has to be balanced with the risk of dying on the waiting lists. Donors with active or recent aggressive cancers have to be excluded from donation. Some types of aggressive cancers, as lymphoma or melanoma, are at high risk. In donors with past history of cancer with some years of remission, organ donation should be considered for recipients at high risk of death without a rapid transplantation. Particularly, heart transplantation, an organ with a low risk of cancer transmission but with a severe organ shortage, could benefit from such a policy...|$|E

Now, we are witnessing the first signs of evidence what might become the explosion of mobile content and applications that will be shaping the (mobile) Internet of the future.

40|$|One of {{the criticisms}} against the new rules {{applicable}} to the granting of State aid to finance the provision of services of general economic interest (SGEI) in the ‘Almunia package’ is that enforcement {{is likely to be}} their weakest point. Similarly, in the more general setting of the ‘private’ enforcement of State aid rules, the 2006 Study on the Enforcement of State Aid Law at National Level recommended that the European Commission create a common minimum standard of remedies applicable in all EU jurisdictions, stressing that ‘one possible means of creating such a standard would be to adopt a remedies directive for State aid cases, which could be modelled on the remedies directive for procurement cases’. Building upon these considerations, {{the extent to which the}} existing remedies within the system for the enforcement of EU public procurement rules provide an effective platform to enforce EU State aid rules, particularly those for the financing of SGEI, before public <b>procurement</b> review <b>bodies</b> and courts is assessed. The paper describes the main groups of cases where public procurement litigation ‘phagocytises’ State aid considerations. It then proceeds to explore the viability, from an EU law perspective, of configuring public <b>procurement</b> review <b>bodies</b> and courts as ‘State aid courts’ for the purposes of the simultaneous enforcement of both sets of rules in a single setting of ‘private’ litigation. It also submits that using the public procurement system in this way provides effective remedies for the enforcement of the Almunia Package for the financing of SGEI, and adds consistency in terms of harmonisation of the material rules to be applied.

This has been documented by researchers examining the processes through which organ procurers select donors. As Sharp has indicated, [...] "through organ <b>procurement,</b> human <b>bodies</b> are commodified and codified following a relatively strict hierarchy of medical value and social worth". Age, race and ethnicity all play a role in the identification of ideal candidates. Organ receivers are also interested in obtaining information about donors.

40|$|Maintaining {{the current}} {{course of the}} global society is {{threatening}} the human civilization. The urgency of the situation, understood from empirical research, has caused many researchers to call for more prescriptive research as a necessary supplement, to better support decision making for sustainability. While policymakers need to direct and stimulate sustainable production and consumption through, e. g., legislation and market phenomena such as eco-labelling, business represents {{a significant proportion of}} the necessary resources, capabilities and mechanisms for the innovation needed for a transition towards sustainability. However, while businesses more and more realize the self-interest in working proactively with sustainability, there is a desire for better support for how to do this also from this end. Such support needs to consider a significant shift going on in business; that individual businesses tend to no longer compete as autonomous entities, but rather as supply chains. Thus, no company is more sustainable than its supply chain partners. Therefore, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) as a business function, and sustainable procurement as a subset thereof, plays an increasingly pivotal role for sustainable development. The overall aim of this thesis is to contribute to sustainable development by studying how three phenomena; eco-labelling, procurement and supply chain management are related {{to each other and to}} a strategic sustainability perspective, and to suggest how these phenomena can be integrated with such a perspective to provide better support for decision making and innovation for sustainability. For this purpose, a framework for strategic sustainable development, including a definition of sustainability and generic guidelines to inform stepwise strategic plans towards sustainability, is used as a foundational methodology. The development of new approaches is also based on case studies with eco-labelling and sustainable public <b>procurement</b> <b>bodies,</b> businesses and public institutions. Information is collected by shadowing of criteria development and collaboration processes, interviews and literature studies. While the findings point to a clear rational for all of the phenomena and several strengths in existing schemes and practices, the findings also point to several shortcomings. Sustainability is not defined, and as a result, there is no foundation for strategic and proactive approaches. Furthermore, decisions are not based on considerations of all dimensions of sustainability, the whole life cycle of products, all relevant stakeholders and a long-term perspective. As a result, the full potential of these phenomena for contributing to sustainable development is not utilized. This thesis prescribes enhanced processes for eco-labelling, sustainable procurement and SSCM, and shows how these can support organisations in developing from reacting individually on known sustainability-related problems to acting proactively and collaboratively in supply chains, in a coordinated and economically viable way, on society’s remaining gap to the full scope of ecological and social sustainability...|$|R

[...] Dept. of Art and Art History. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 This thesis examines two disparate developments {{that began in}} sixteenth-century Renaissance Italy and converged in almost inconceivable ways in eighteenth-century London. One of these developments was the public study of human anatomy through dissection. The other development was the satirical art of caricature. This thesis explores the point in time where the study of anatomy {{and the art of}} caricature converge by examining eighteenth-century texts as well as contemporary scholarly writing on the subjects of medicine, anatomy and caricature. This thesis argues that caricature was the medium best suited to visually record this unusual time in medical history and to expose the social responses to these medical advances. In order to narrow the scope of the two broad topics of art and medicine, this thesis looks at two of London's most notable Georgian era anatomists, Dr. William Hunter and his brother John, a surgeon. It examines how they, and anatomists in general, were depicted by their contemporaries and acquaintances, Thomas Rowlandson and William Hogarth. This thesis explores the clandestine activities involved in running an anatomy school in Georgian England by examining the written record as well as the visual record found in the prints of Hogarth and Rowlandson. This thesis briefly examines the religious and legal ramifications of the <b>procurement</b> of <b>bodies</b> for dissection.

Moreover, a qualitative evaluation of the CPF added a valuable understanding of the wider economic impact of the CFP.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the findings of a multi-case study centered around two public-private partnership (P 3 s) projects in Ontario: the Royal Ottawa Hospital and the Brampton Civic Hospital. Partnerships have become particularly important as a part of infrastructure procurement for all levels of government in Canada. While infrastructure public-private partnerships have grown in popularity, they remain a controversial means of procuring public assets. Considerable questions remain as to whether the mechanisms related to partnerships with the private sector represent a sufficient response to the challenges facing health care systems. As such, major avenues exist for contributions in the form of evidence-based examinations to the field of knowledge pertaining to hospital <b>procurement.</b> A <b>body</b> of research literature and review of public-private partnerships, including those with a particular focus on health-sector projects in Canada, has grown over the past two decades. This study contributes an analysis of the relationship between public and private partners to that literature, utilizing a conceptual lens developed out of complex evolutionary systems theory. The study is intended to examine the capacity of public managers entering into a public-private partnership arrangement to successfully activate agents and utilize the skill and knowledge of these agents, conduct joint fact finding and consensus building, and better understand how they have arranged and organized joint interactions between the public and private sector. The two case studies demonstrate the key inputs into the decision-making processes for what were formative health infrastructure partnership projects in Ontario, providing an assessment {{of the degree to which}} the government of Ontario was successful in managing a cooperative decision-making process that stressed inclusion and horizontal steering. Results find that public managers struggled in some ways to leverage an effective horizontal management style and engage in smart interventions to utilize expert knowledge to address knowledge gaps, contributing to stagnating negotiations and driving up transaction costs for the projects. Some noteworthy successes were experienced in the case of the Royal Ottawa Hospital in leveraging private-sector knowledge to develop performance metrics, and the approach to stakeholder engagement in this case presents positive lessons-learned for future P 3 infrastructure projects...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{the history}} of anatomy in the Third Reich has often {{concentrated}} on the influence of the National Socialist (NS) regime on anatomists and their consequent unethical activities. Only recently, the focus has shifted to NS victims whose bodies were used for anatomical purposes. As a first approach to learning more about the victims, this study investigated the persons whose names Hermann Stieve, chairman of the Anatomical Department at the University of Berlin, had listed after using their bodies for his research. The study draws a group portrait and recounts selected biographies of the 174 women and eight men on the list. Most women were of reproductive age, two‐thirds were German and a majority was executed for political reasons. Among the executed were at least two pregnant women. The corrected names, biographical data, and nationalities of all persons on the list are published here. None of them volunteered to be dissected, nor were the anatomists at the time interested in the victims' personal background. Future work will have to focus on the investigation of further biographies so that numbers can be turned back into people.

Herein lies the paradox of the Pernkopf Atlas, as a legacy of the Third Reich: the fact that Pernkopf and his illustrators, by embracing Nazi ideology and benefiting from the atrocities committed, created a Nazi anatomy atlas in which irreconcilable opposites were forcibly reconciled. Beautiful anatomical drawings were created, but this was only made possible by the unethical and unlawful procurement of the anatomical remains of murdered victims of an evil Nazi regime-thus beauty and evil were fused. This fusion not only perverts and diminishes the status and content of the Pernkopf Atlas, but also explains why it should be rejected.It should be permitted to show its duplicitous face only rarely and then for very good reason in the teaching of history, medical ethics and medical law so that its lessons will be learned and its history never repeated.|$|R
