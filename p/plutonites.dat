40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the U–Pb data of zircon {{separated}} from three samples representative of mylonitic leucogranites, trondhjemites and pegmatites occurring along the Alpine tectonic zone between the Castagna and Sila Units in northern Calabria. These mylonites are associated to Variscan granitic-granodioritic biotiterich augen gneisses derived from Neo-Proterozoic-Early Cambrian protoliths. Apparent ages ranging from Early Cambrian to post-Variscan have been obtained. Th, U and rare earth elements have been determined in two zircon domains of mylonitic leucogranite and trondhjemite giving different ages {{in order to get}} information relative to their geological significance. The pegmatite preserves intrusive contact with the augen gneisses and with the other mylonites; {{it turns out to be}} emplaced at 290 – 300 Ma, like the Variscan <b>plutonites</b> of the Castagna Unit. The deformation masks the original contacts of the mylonitic leucogranite and trondhjemite with the biotite-rich augen gneisses. The age-group averaging 540 Ma is interpreted as indicative of the emplacement of the protoliths and it coincides with the age previously determined for the emplacement of the protoliths of the biotite-rich augen gneisses. Zircon from the mylonitic pegmatite includes domains showing concordant and discordant ages younger than 290 Ma, thus reflecting various degrees of partial resetting and Pb-loss caused by post-Variscan events. Zircon from the mylonitic leucogranite and trondhjemite includes apparent ages between 300 and 280 Ma as well as ages younger than 250 Ma. Perturbation of U–Pb system by Alpine shearing appears evident; however, possibile effects caused by thermal input and hydrothermal fluid infiltration from the Variscan <b>plutonites</b> cannot be excluded...|$|E

The area is mainly formed of {{basement}} complex except its extreme south-western corner where it is covered by foreland sediments of Nubian sandstone. The area is structurally complicated {{where it has been}} subjected to various stages of successive tectonic movements since the Precambrian times. The basement complex in the study area is represented by a wide variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks belonging to seven major lithostratigraphic units namely: geosynclinal sediments, main geosynclinal volcanics, synorogenic <b>plutonites,</b> emerging geosynclinal volcanics, postgeosynclinal sediments, late erogenic <b>plutonites</b> and postorogenic volcanics. This alternating sedimentation, volcanicity and plutonism reflects the principal geotectonic evolution of this part of the erogenic belt in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The basement rocks exposed in the area under consideration are of different ages ranging from Precambrian to early Paleozoic. Accordingly, they display various degrees of metamorphism and structural deformation. The lithostratigraphy, mode of occurrence and petrography of these rock exposures, as well as their mutual relationships, are discussed in this paper. تقع منطقة وادي عطا الله - المسيكات في وسط الصحراء الشرقية بمصر ، وهي تغطي مساحة حوالي 2000 كيلومتر مربع بين خطي عرض 10 - 26 - 0 4 - 6 2 شمالا وخطي طول 5 1 - 33 - 0 4 - 33 شرقا وقد تم إعداد خريطة جيولوجية للمنطقة بمقياس رسم 000 : 1 ، 40 كما درست المكاشف الصخرية التي تغطي المنطقة وكلها من صخور القاعدة المركبة التي تنتمي إلى عصر ما قبل الكامبري - الباليوزوي المبكر بالإضافة إلى بعض الصخور النارية الأحدث ، ويحفها من الجنوب الغربي طبقات من الحجر الرملي النوبي. وقد أمكن تصنيف صخور المنطقة إلى المجموعات الرئيسية التالية وذلك في ضوء التصنيف الجيولوجي التركيبي لصخور القاعدة المصرية : 1 - رسوبيات التقعر الإقليمي 2 - بركانيات التقعر الإقليمي. 3 - الاندفاعيات الملازمة لنشأة الجبال 4 – بركانيات الظهور من التقعر الإقليمي 5 - رسوبيات ما بعد التقعر الإقليمي 6 - الاندفاعيات الملازمة لنشأة الجبال 7 - البركانيات اللاحقة لنشوء الجبال وبركانيات أرض المقدمة 8 - رواسب أرض المقدمة الفتاتية...|$|E
40|$|St. Catherine area, some 900 km in size, is {{dominated}} by basement rocks Encompassing old continental gneisses, metasediments, greenstone belt, calc-alkaline granites (G-II-granites), rift-related volcanics (RV), and anorogenic within plate granites (G-III-granites). The greenstone belt is composed of subduction-related volcanics (SV) intercalated with metasediments. These volcanics split into older group (moderately metamorphosed) and younger group (slightly metamorphosed). The calc-alkaline granites were formed during collision and partial melting of the lower crust. Probably mantle materials were incorporated in the melt. The rift-related volcanics (RV), and the anorogenic granites form, in {{the central part of}} St. Catherine, an incomplete ring massif intruded by a granitic belt of younger age. The igneous activity and the structural development are related in space and time. The first event was the formation of {{the southern part of the}} ring fault along which alkalibasalts were erupted (rift-related old volcanics). This phase was followed by the eruption of alkalirhyolites and ignimbrites (rift-related young volcanics). Wide assimilation processes occurred where the alkalibasalts are converted into a black syenitoid rock. This later volcanic phase was the surface expression of an alkaline syenite-granite magmatism. The earlier member of these alkaline <b>plutonites</b> was alkalie-red syenite emplaced along the progressively formed northern part, of the ring fault. Crustal melting then increased and acidic members of red-granite, leuco-granite, and granophyric granite were successively emplaced, crossing the ring massif. These alkaline granitoids are anorogenic <b>plutonites</b> formed during hot spot and incipient rifting mechanism. تغطي صخور القاعدة منطقة سانت كاترين (900 كم 2) ، وتشمل هذه الصخور الرسوبيات القارية المتحولة في نطاق الحزام الجزري والرسوبيات المتحولة القديمة والصخور البركانية (أ س في) ، الجرانيت الكالس قلوي (جـ 2) ، الصخور البركانية (ارفي) والجرانيت (جـ 3). وتكون الصخور البركانية (ارفي) والجرانيت (جـ 3) معقد حلقي بيضاوي الشكل غير كامل. ولقد تكونت الصخور البركانية (ا س في) ، الجرانيت (ب 2) في بيئات جزر قوسية بينما تكون الجرانيت (جـ 3) والصخور البركانية (ارفي) خلال الألواح. ولقد تكون معقد سانت كاترين الحلقي لطفح البازلت القلوي خلال صدع دائري ثم تلا ذلك طفح الرايوليت القلوي حيث تمت عملية تمثيل بينهما كونت صخور مماثلة للسيانيت في الجزء الجنوبي اما الجزء الشمالي فيتكون من السيانيت الأحمر الذي قطع بالجوانيت (جـ 3) فيما بعد...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} an east-west {{trending}} belt of granitic to intermediate intrusions and their volcanic {{cover in the}} northern Dur Kan Complex, a continental slice outcropping {{to the north of}} the exposed Makran accretionary wedge in southeastern Iran. Field observations, petrographic descriptions, trace element, and isotope analyses combined with U-Pb zircon geochronology are presented to determine the time frame of magmatism and tectonic setting during the formation of these rocks. Results document three magmatic episodes with different melt sources for (1) granites, (2) a diorite-trondhjemite-plagiogranite sequence, and (3) diabases and lavas. Granites, dated at 170 – 175 [*]Ma, represent crystallized melt with a strong continental isotopic contribution. The diorite-trondhjemite-plagiogranite sequence is 165 – 153 [*]Ma old and derives from a mantle magma source with minor continental contribution. East-west trending diabase dikes and bodies intruded the granitoids, which were eroded and then covered by Valanginian (140 – 133 [*]Ma) alkaline lavas and sediments. Alkaline dikes and lavas have a mantle isotopic composition. Temporal correlation with <b>plutonites</b> of the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone to the northwest defines a narrow, NW-SE striking and nearly 2000 [*]km long belt of Jurassic intrusions. The increasing mantle influence in the magma sources is explained by thinning of continental lithosphere and related mantle upwelling/decompression melting.

40|$|Zones {{of mixing}} between shallow groundwaters of {{different}} composition were unravelled by “two-way regionalized classification,” a technique based on correspondence analysis (CA), cluster analysis (ClA) and discriminant analysis (DA), aided by gridding, map-overlay and contouring tools. The shallow groundwaters {{are from a}} granitoid <b>plutonite</b> in the Fundão region (central Portugal). Correspondence analysis detected three natural clusters in the working dataset: 1, weathering; 2, domestic effluents; 3, fertilizers. Cluster analysis set an alternative distribution of the samples by the three clusters. Group memberships obtained by correspondence analysis and by cluster analysis were optimized by discriminant analysis, gridded over the entire Fundão region, and converted into “two-way regionalized classification” memberships as follows: codes 1, 2 or 3 were used when classification by correspondence analysis and cluster analysis produced the same results; code 0 when the grid node was first assigned to cluster 1 and then to cluster 2 or vice versa (mixing between weathering and effluents); code 4 in the other cases (mixing between agriculture and the other influences). Code- 3 areas were systematically surrounded by code- 4 areas, an observation attributed to hydrodynamic dispersion. Accordingly, the extent of code- 4 areas in two orthogonal directions was assumed proportional to the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities of local soils. The results (0. 7 – 16. 8 and 0. 4 – 4. 3 m, respectively) are acceptable at the macroscopic scale. The ratios between longitudinal and transverse dispersivities (1. 2 – 11. 1) are also in agreement with results obtained by other studies. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical {{data that}} {{constrain}} the hydrothermal alteration and gold mineralization in the Um El Tuyor area, SE Egypt. In order {{to distinguish the}} characteristics and envisage the genesis of gold mineralization in the study area, insights into the geologic context, structural evolution and geochemistry of the country rocks are provided. The geochemical investigations have been integrated with field and petrographic relationships, along with Landsat (TM) imagery interpretations to better constraints on the tectonic setting of the basement complex in the study area. The particular geographic location near the intersection of two major high strain zones, namely the Allaqi-Heiani suture and Hamisana Shear Zone, {{played a crucial role}} in the deformation history of the Um Tuyor area. The basement complex cropping out in the Um El Tuyor area is part of the Neoproterozoic Allaqi-Heiani ophiolitic belt, comprising allochtonous ophiolitic thrust slices and detached sheets, island arc volcano-sedimentary-plutonic assemblages, and syn-orogenic and post-orogenic intrusions. The ophiolitic rocks exhibit field and geochemical characteristics that make them akin to the supra-subduction zone ophiolites, formed most likely in a back-arc basin. The island arc assemblage comprises mainly calc-alkaline metavolcanic-plutonic rocks and back-arc pelitic metasediments. Early calc-alkaline granite intrusions tapered along the foliation and thrust planes during the orogenic episodes, whereas less fractionated tholeiitic olivine gabbro and peraluminous monzogranite encompass a course of post-orogenic plutonism evolved in a within plate setting. An early period of crustal shortening (Dm) involved transportation and overriding of huge ophiolitic sheets from the north to south is manifested by major thrust faults and imbricate ophiolitic thrust slices. Regional folds and pervasive foliation cleavage signify a NE-SW compressional regime (D 2) superimposed on the thrust fabrics. A third deformation increment is indicated by the presence of abundant NNW-trending major folds and left-lateral faults superimposed on the older structural fabrics (D 3). D 4 records an episode of transcurrent deformation yielded slip reactivation of the pre-existing NW-trending faults and formation of discrete shear zones, one of which accommodates gold mineralization in the study area. Finally, a weak shear strain (D 5) is indicated by the intersecting fault and joint trends traversing the post-orogenic rocks. Regional metamorphism was coeval with deformation, and peaked under conditions of amphibolite facies during D 2. Geothermobarometry calculations point to temperatures of 534 - 561 oC and pressure of 5. 26 - 6. 20 kbar for the peak of the metamorphic path of Um El Tuyor basement. Gold is mainly confined to the quartz veins and less commonly to narrow domains of the next quartz-sericite alteration zones. Field, microscopic and microprobe observations suggest that hydrothermal alteration in the Um El Tuyor mine area was post-peak metamorphism, and syn-kinematic with local shearing. The main auriferous veins in the Um El Tuyor mine area consist of massive, partially recrystallized, or laminated quartz ±carbonate. The quartz-carbonate veins are essentially fault-fill bodies, which have been fractured and re-filled with milky to grey laminated quartz in later stages of the geothermal system. The laminated quartz veins contain narrow elongate slivers of the host pelitic rocks (composed essentially of chrorite-sericite-sulphides±graphite), assumed to have been peeled off and incorporated during incremental (crack-seal) vein growth. vii Gold occurs as inclusions or within the lattice in arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite, commonly in association with subordinate sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite in the auriferous quartz veins. Another, high fineness type of gold fills microfractures in sulphides and quartz, and/or occurs as dispersed blebs and globules in domains of pervasive alteration, particularly where sericite and carbonate are intergrown. In the mine area, a metal zonation extends from an inner Fe-As-Zn-Au ±Pb±Ag±Te bearing veins through an intermediate Fe-As-Cu rich wallrocks to a distal halo enriched in Fe-Cu-Co, and Ni. A three stage hydrothermal alteration model (initial, transitional and advanced) is proposed for the Um El Tuyor ore-forming hydrothermal system, on basis of the field and microscopic observations and the electron microprobe data. The initial stage involved hydrolysis of the wallrocks in presence of a near acid fluid, whose pH was buffered by the wallrock mineralogy. The transitional stage involved also hydrolysis reactions, but was dominated by carbonatization, sulphidation and redox reactions. The latter reduced the interacting fluids, particularly where the fluid : rock ratio was low and provided favourable conditions for gold deposition. It is interpreted that sulphidation has affected the gold solubility via changes in oxygen fugacity through redox reactions. The advanced stage was most likely a phase of intense sericitization (after chlorite), which consumed K+, liberated H+, and buffered the solution pH. Cation-exchange reactions were limited to the time when favoured Na+ activity and temperature conditions promoted deposition of albite. Sulphidation remained operating through this stage, and the un-buffered conditions were locally attained under high fluid/rock ratios. Compositional zoning of the auriferous pyrite and arsenopyrite crystals, along with the presence of patchy pyrrhotite and sphalerite inclusions in these crystals, and the absence of these features in pyrite and arsenopyrite of the late sulphide assemblage may imply incipient low oxygen fugacity conditions during gold deposition. Further, compositional zoning of the large arsenian pyrite crystals, from barren cores to auriferous margins, is considered as a function of redox reactions involving oxidation of Au and reduction of As. Fluid inclusion studies revealed heterogeneous entrapping of immiscible aqueous and carbonic fluids in the Um El Tuyor auriferous quartz veins. Criteria including the primary and secondary modes of occurrence of the carbonic inclusions, coexistence of inclusions with carbonic and aqueous fluids of variable relative proportions, densities, filling degrees, partial homogenization temperatures, and bulk compositions are considered evocative for phase separation as gold deposition mechanism in the Um El Tuyor auriferous quartz veins. The initially homogenous ore fluid was likely a low salinity aqueous-carbonic solution (± 1 - 2 mol% CH 4 or N 2), which started to separate into two phases and precipitate gold when conditions attained ~ 340 °C at ~ 1. 5 kbar (at depth of ~ 6 km under lithostatic condition). Destabilization of gold-sulphur complexes through interplay of cooling, redox state variation, pH changes, and decrease in sulphur fugacity should have contributed in gold deposition in the auriferous veins. The entire gold-base metal mineralization and quartz veining event extended over conditions of 170 - 429 oC at 0. 9 - 2. 1 kbar respectively, equivalent to depths of 3 - 8 km and compatible with crustal conditions of greenschist metamorphism and brittle–ductile transition. This wide range of pressure probably represents the total fluid pressure regime within the shear zone from the formation of the auriferous quartz veins to periods of continuous pressure decrease during uplift, including a sudden pressure decrease occurred as a consequence of incremental opening of the fissure, followed by filling by newly deposited quartz. Diese Dissertation beschreibt die petrographischen, mineralogischen und geochemischen Hintergründe, die zur Goldmineralisation und zur hydrothermalen Nebengesteinsalteration im Gebiet von Um El Tuyor, Südost Ägypten beigetragen haben. Um jedoch die genetischen Hintergründe und Charakteristika der Goldmineralisation im Untersuchungsgebiet näher zu verstehen, bedarf es zunächst einer eingehenden Analyse der geologischen Zusammenhänge, der strukturgeologischen Entwicklungsgeschichte und Geochemie der gesamten Nebengesteinsabfolgen. Die geochemischen Auswertungen wurden in die Feldarbeiten und die petrographischen Untersuchungen eingebunden, ebenso die Satellitenbildinterpretationen (TM-Szenen) zum besseren Verständnis der Tektonik des Grundgebirges im Untersuchungsgebiet. Die spezielle geographische Position des Um El Tuyor Gebietes im Umfeld der Überschneidung von zwei „high strain“ Suturzonen, nämlich des Allaqi-Heiani Gürtels und der von Süden kommenden Hamisana Zone trug wesentlich sowohl zu deren komplexen Deformationsgeschichte als auch Lagerstättengenese bei. Der anstehende Grundgebirgskomplex des Um El Tuyor Gebietes stellte sich als ein Teil des Neoproterozoischen Allaqi-Heiani Ophiolit Gürtels heraus, der aus allochtonen ophiolitischen Überschiebungspartien und abgesonderten Schuppen vulkano-sedimentärer und plutonischer Abfolgen vom Inselbogentyp sowie syn-und post-orogener Intrusionen besteht. Die ophiolitischen Gesteine lassen sich sowohl nach den Geländedaten als auch geochemisch als Supra-Subduktionszonen-Ophiolite eines Back-Arc Beckens deuten. Während des Pan-African (Spätes Proterozoikum) wurden diese Ophiolite transportiert, durch mittlere bis steile Verfaltung verkürzt und verschuppt wobei sie immature Inselbogenabfolgen mit zwischengeschalteten Back-Arc Metasedimenten überlagerten.

Kornerupine replacement by the reaction krn = spr-crd-low Al opx (5 - 7 wt% Al₂O₃) implies much lower pressures (5 - 6 kbars) at similar T (750 - 800 °C), indicating a quasi-isothermal synmetamorphic decompression event from 8 - 10 to 5 - 6 kbars.

Modern fluvial sand composition in the Tajo River drainage basin reflects {{the nature of the}} source region, which lies in {{the central part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. Four fluvial petrographic provinces (A, B, C and D) can be established in the Tajo drainage basin, corresponding well with the four principal structural units drained: (1) the Iberian Range; (2) the Hesperian massif; (3) The Tertiary Tajo basin; and (4) the Neogene Santarem–Lisboa basin. Province A corresponds to the Tajo River head and is characterized by quartzolithic sedimenticlastic sands (Qm 67 F 4 Lt 29 and Rs 79 Rg 3 Rm 18). These sands have been derived from diverse Mesozoic siliciclastics and carbonates of the Iberian Range. Province B appears in the upper reaches of the Tajo River course and is quartzofeldspathic (Qm 57 F 34 Lt 9) with diverse rock fragments (Rs 34 Rg 23 Rm 43). Sources are Hercynian granitoids and metasediments and Neogene clastics and minor carbonates of the Tertiary Tajo basin. Province C extends along the middle course of the Tajo River with quartzofeldspathic metamorphiclastic sand modes (Qm 60 F 33 Lt 7; Rs 4 Rg 21 Rm 75). The sources are metamorphic rocks intruded by <b>plutonites</b> of the Hesperian Massif. Province D is quartzofeldspathic (Qm 55 F 39 Lt 6) with a dominance of phaneritic rock fragments (Rs 5 Rg 33 Rm 62) and corresponds to the lower reaches of the Tajo River, where siliciclastic deposits of the Neogene Santarem–Lisboa basin are the main sources. Sands plot on provenance-discrimination diagram (QmFLt) within the recycled-orogen field (Tajo River head) and continentalblock fields (upper, middle and lower course). In addition, we have proven the usefulness of the RsRgRm diagram to discriminate the defined fluvial provinces, originating from heterogeneous parent-rock textures and mineralogy. Climate does not exert any strong influence on the petrogenesis of the Tajo River drainage basin sand, and erosion in the source areas may be described in terms of weathering-limited denudation regime. By contrast, mixing with tributary supplies is the main process that modifies composition in the Tajo River sand.

Sandstone records from Rift cycle 1 (Permo-Triassic) and Rift cycle 2 (Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous) show similarities in composition. Based on the most recent data, this paper describes sandstone petrofacies developed during both rifting periods. Six petrofacies can be distinguished: two associated with Rift cycle 1 (PT- 1 and PT- 2) and four with Rift cycle 2 (JC- 1 to JC- 4). All six petrofacies can be classifi ed as sedimentoclastic or plutoniclastic. Sedimentoclastic petrofacies developed during early rifting stages either through the recycling of pre-rift sediments or signifi cant palaeogeographical changes. These facies comprise a thin succession (< 100 m) of clastic deposits with mature quartzose and quartzolithic sandstones containing sedimentary and metasedimentary rock fragments. Carbonate diagenesis is more common than clay mineral diagenesis. Sedimentoclastic petrofacies have been identifi ed in Rift cycle 1 (Saxonian facies, PT- 1) and Rift cycle 2 (JC- 1 and JC- 3; Tithonian and Valanginian, respectively). In {{the absence of the}} pre-rift sedimentary cover, metasedimentoclastic petrofacies sometimes develop as a product of the erosion of the low- to medium-grade metamorphic substratum (Petrofacies JC- 2, Tithonian-Berriasian). Plutoniclastic petrofacies were generated during periods of high tectonic activity and accompanied by substantial denudation and the erosion of <b>plutonites.</b> Forming thick stratigraphic successions (1000 to 4000 m), these feldspar-rich petrofacies show a rigid framework and clay mineral diagenesis. In Rift cycle 1, plutoniclastic petrofacies (PT- 2) are associated with the Buntsandstein. This type of petrofacies also developed in Rift cycle 2 in the Cameros Basin (JC- 4) from DS- 5 to DS- 8 (Hauterivian-Early Albian), and represents the main basin fi ll interval. Sedimentoclastic and plutoniclastic petrofacies can be grouped into three pairs of basic petrofacies. Each pair represents a ‘provenance cycle’ that records a complete clastic cycle within a rifting period. Petrofacies PT- 1 and PT- 2 represent the ‘provenance cycle’ during Rift- 1. In the Cameros Basin, two provenance cycles may be discerned during Rift cycle 2, related both to the Tithonian-Berriasian and the Valanginian-Early Albian megasequences. Tectonics is the main factor controlling petrofacies. Other factors (e. g., maturation during transport, local supply) may modulate the compositional signatures of the petrofacies yet their main character persists and even outlines he hierarchy of the main bounding surfaces between depositional sequences in the intracontinental Iberian Rift Basin...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of mafic (mainly gabbros and diorites) and felsic (syenites and granites) rocks, in close spatial association, in the Elvas region, {{at the northern}} part of the Ossa-Morena Zone, could be interpreted as a single bimodal (alkaline) plutonic complex. However, in spite of scarce isotopic (Sm-Nd) data, the co-magmatic origin of both rock groups (mafic and felsic) has already been questioned [1]. Based on the mineral chemistry of primary clinopyroxenes (Di–Hd, %En: 45. 5 – 27. 2) and representative whole-rock analyses, gabbros and diorites of the Elvas massif show a transitional character between alkaline and non-alkaline fields and wide compositions: SiO 2 (42. 47 – 58. 00 wt%); TiO 2 (0. 24 – 1. 68 wt%); Y/Nb (4. 0 – 10. 7); Th (0. 1 – 6. 8 ppm); Zr (18. 6 – 576. 9 ppm). The felsic group is composed by highly differentiated rocks which correspond to distinct levels of silica saturation and alkalinity. Peralkaline syenites usually present sodic (riebeckite) and sodic-calcic (aegirine-augite, ferrowinchite) inosilicates and reveal quite variable compositions: SiO 2 (57. 50 – 72. 07 wt%); TiO 2 (0. 10 – 1. 45 wt%); Th (1. 7 – 67. 0 ppm); Zr (133. 0 – 4800. 0 ppm). The alkaline granites show hedenbergite as the characteristic inosilicate, presenting relatively common compositions: SiO 2 (61. 85 – 78. 06 wt%); TiO 2 (0. 21 – 0. 58 wt%); Th (11. 8 – 38. 4 ppm); Zr (317. 3 – 1234. 6 ppm) [2]. Recent Sm-Nd isotopic results, on a total of 18 whole-rock samples (6 mafites and 12 felsites), allow new and more consistent interpretation concerning the petrogenesis of these plutonic rocks. Assuming an age of 490 Ma [3], the felsic rocks provide ( 0. 6 < Nd 490 <  4. 3), similar to other contemporary (per) alkaline rocks of this region [4], reflecting magmatic extractions from time-integrated depleted mantle sources followed by variable and incomplete mixing (and/or AFC-type) processes with enriched, probably crustal sources. This alkaline/peralkaline magmatism is thought to represent the main regional record of the rifting event which presumably led to the opening of the Rheic Ocean. On the other hand, the mafic plutonic rocks of the Elvas massif cannot represent the magmatic precursors of these syenites and granites as they show completely distinct Nd isotopic ratios ( 3. 7 < Nd 490 <  1. 2) indicating important contribution of long-term enriched (crustal) sources. Instead, considering the age and the Nd isotopic signature of other mafic plutonic unit emplaced nearby (the Campo Maior massif: ca. 370 Ma;  6. 0 < Nd 370 <  5. 2) [5], and recalculating the isotopic ratios of the Elvas massif for the same age ( 4. 3 < Nd 370 <  1. 6), it is plausible to consider that these plutons (Campo Maior and Elvas) can be coeval and representative of the Variscan magmatism in this region. In such hypothesis, the differences between these isotopic values could be explained, on a time-integrated basis, either by magmatic sources for the Elvas massif less enriched in LREE than the sources involved in the Campo Maior massif, or, if both <b>plutonites</b> share similar depleted mantle sources, by magmatic differentiation paths considerably affected by crustal contamination processes, which reached higher degrees in the Campo Maior massif...|$|E
40|$|The Es Safya Graben (ESG), a so far unknown {{structural}} {{feature of the}} North Kordofan Block (NKB), has been revealed by applying multidisciplinary methods such as satellite image interpretation and field-geological and geophysical investigations. The ESG is 65 kilometres long and some 25 kilometres wide, containing a sedimentary section of 200 to 500 metres. The highly complex structure is formed by three half-graben-type segments which are linked by a transfer zone and a basement uplift. The low- to high-angle normal boundary faults show various amounts of displacement. The ESG is bounded to the north {{by a series of}} faults comprising the Sodiri Shear Zone (SSZ). To the south the graben is bounded by the Abu Harr Shear Zone (AHSZ), a structure which could be revealed by this study. Fault orientations and the direction of relative movements provide evidence that left-lateral wrenching along and in between the Sodiri and Abu Harr Shear Zones transtensionally formed the ESG using pre-existing, antithetic Riedel faults, thus suggesting similarities to a pull-apart structure like development. Sedimentological and structural evidence indicate a post-sedimentary normal faulting. Up to now Triassic lateral displacement along the SSZ was assumed to be the latest deformation of pre-existing Late Proterozoic lines of lithospheric weakness (structural grain) of the NKB. In the light of the structural and statigraphic setting of the ESG it can now be proved that during Late Cretaceous and Tertiary times a further tectonic development took place, which now can be added as D 5 to the known deformational phases D 1 -D 4 (Late Proterozoic to Triassic). Crystalline rocks comprising the graben shoulders consist of Pan-African basement and anorogenic magmatic complexes. The <b>plutonites</b> have a calc-alkalic composition being typical for subduction-related magmatism. They indicate the existence of fossil plate margins and give for the Es Safaya area a scenario of a complex geodynamic pattern of terranes during the Pan-African orogeny, similar to the known picture of the Gebel Rahib area in the N of the NKB. Alkalic magmatism took place in the Es Safaya region, like in the entire of Sudan, during several episodes in between Ordovician and Jurassic times. K-Ar age data indicate that some of the anorogenic magmatites are approximately 290 Ma old, thus providing ages which sofar have only little been known for the NKB. The distribution of alkalic complexes in the study area is controlled by the SSZ and AHSZ. Both shear-systems are interpreted to be branching elements of the Central African Fault Zone (CAFZ). The graben sediments have been subdivided into lower and upper Hamrat el Wuz Formation. The lower sequence is composed out of deltaic to lacustrine interbedded sandstone and mudstone yielding Albian to Turonian palynomorphs. The upper sequence is composed out of heterogeneous shaly to conglomeratic sediments of mainly fluvial origin whose age coud be assigned to the Campanian/Maastrichtian because of the palaeoflora Salvinia. Shallow-marine ingressions are indicated by the occurrence of Diplocraterion and Thalassionoides, thus proving a far more southerly advance of Campanian/Maastrichtian transgressions than previously supposed. Knowledge of graben-fill and structural geometries allows in connection with data on climate and water consumption a gross evaluation of the groundwater situation of this arid to semi-arid area. Dated findings of medieval ironworks prove a progressive climatic deteriation and are of great archaeological interest...|$|E
40|$|Physico-chemical and mineralogical {{studies of}} the soils of the São Paulo State by the Soil Division of The Agronomical Institute proved the {{existence}} of different violet soils in South-Brasil and its origin from basaltic rocks. The Brasilian denomination "terra roxa" is already many times translated to "red soil", which is inexact, because the colour "roxa" corresponds to "violet" in English. We must insist on the perfection of Brasilian expression, which gives the shortest and the best characteristic of the true violet soil, derived through the decomposition of basalts and diabases in the São Paulo State. The term "red soil" originated much confusion, because there are in this state many "red soils" of different origins, but the true violet soil is quite unique. The violet colour of this soil appears very beautifully on the clean fields above the diabase hills at the distance of some hundreds of meters. In the state of complete dryness the violet soil becomes coffee brown, but never gets a red colour. The violet soil is the best soil of South America, on the contrary the red soils, which are mostly lateritic, are bad soils. Some exceptions, do exist, of course. The basalts produce laterites and other red soils of better qualities. With the purpose {{to contribute to the}} study of the violet and the red soils the present essay was made, describing the basic rocks of South-Brasil, as mother rocks of soils. The basic monograph of Djalma Guimarães "Magmatic Province of South-Brasil" (5), many times mentioned in the petrographic literature, definitively established the principal types and the mineral-components of triassic basic rocks in South-Brasil. We have found some varieties of basic rocks, not yet known, but considered important for the question of violet and red soils. To soil science we consider of importance the discovery of acid melaphyres without labradors, which are essential for all other basaltic rocks, with exception of most basic and extreme types. These melaphyres have oligoclases and andesines, as its principal components, and are outcropping in many points of the Botucatú sandstone zone, from Franca up to Pirajú in São Paulo State. The melaphyres of Franca and Pedregulhos appear on a high "plateau" with the orientation NNW. In this direction the plateau is about 50 km long and in WSW direction about 25 km wide. The slopes are very dissected, showing numerous big outcrops of melaphyrs, which rarely outcrop on the surface of the plateau, because the plateau is covered by variegated sands and sandstones. Above all, in isolated patches, appear loose, conglomeratic beds, never above 1 - 2 mt; with decomposed basaltic pebbles, and eolic sands. These eolic sands are of much later age than the S. Bento sandstone below, which contains the melaphyres, because between the eolic sands above and the latest melaphyres the variegated sandstones and sands were deposited. These sandstones have argillaceous cement and are very similar to Baurú sandstones in Rio Preto district. Our melaphyres were not yet analyzed chemically, but the predominance of more acid plagioclases in relation to the diabases and the augite-porphyrites indicates more acid general composition. We explain it by the separation of more basic part of the primitive basaltic magma in the depth, where the already formed augites and basic plagioclases remained. Thus, the plutonitic phase of the magma, which originated the melaphyres, must have more basic plagioclases. The search for these <b>plutonites</b> was directed to the cristalline zone of gneisses and schists, where the magmatic channels were discovered to the depth of several kilometers by the erosion. In the Bocayuva district of the Paraná State several big outcrops of gabbroid rocks were found. By microscopical examination we discovered the same absence of dinamometamorphic stresses which is the best characteristics of all triassic basaltic rocks in our region. In some sections we found some bending of augites and plagioclases, which are common in many diabases and augite-porphyrites. Evidently these bendings happened during the eruption. In no case could these bendings be the result of dinamometamorphism. The mineralogical composition of these gabbroid rocks is very singular. They have the same augites which are found in diabases, augite-porphyrites and melaphyres. The characteristic angle of these augites c &# 094; Ng is about 42 ° - 44 ° 26 ', as determined by D. Guimarães (5) in different samples gathered in the States of S. Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. For the determination of this angle we used the Fedorow stage and we found that in all our rocks the augites form twins, with Nm common for both parts and Ng of one half coinciding with Np of other half. In such a case c &# 094; Ng = 45 °. However there are many instances of big variations in optical properties of augites in the same sections. The biggest variations happen with the angle 2 V, which gives the angles 0 ° - 50 ° in one section of the same rock. But these variations happen in all basaltic rocks, from <b>plutonites</b> to extrusives. The plagioclases, with An 47 - An 60, give poikilitic texture, being included in bigger crystals of anorthose, with 2 V = - 54 °. The olivine in big rounded grains, only slightly altered, is always present. As accessory minerals are big well formed prisms of apatite, ilmenitic magnetite and brown biotite. We discovered big outcrops of the same gabbroid e rocks near São Bento do Sapucaí in the cristalline belt. The only difference is in somewhat slighter basidity of plagioclases, which have An 44 - An 6 o. By mineralogical composition these rocks are between gabbros and essexites. The next rocks would be shonkinites, which differ by the presence of orthoclase and nepheline, and small amount of plagioclase. Thus we must introduce a new term, calling this rock bocaiuvite by the place where are the biggest and the most characteristic outcrops. It seems difficult to put the bocaiuvites, with its sodic tendency, in the basaltic family of rocks, but there are no other plutonic phases in the crystalline belt, which would be nearer to our diabases. We must have in view the anortosic rims of plagioclases in our augite-porphyrites, which have also sodic tendencies. The essexites are common in the South-Namib (12), appearing as the central parts of biggest dikes of monchiquites. Unhappily the petrographic description of these essexites does not give the optical constants of its ortoclase, and we do not know if this ortoclase is sodic. Very probably they are sodic by its genetic relations to monchiquites. Little can be said about the part of basic rocks in the development of the orography and hidrography of crystalline zones, but in the rest of territory the basic rocks give to the surface its main characteristics. It is well seen in the São Paulo State. There the basic rocks reached the surface by two systems of faults. One system runs parallel to the limit of the crystalline belt, changing its direction from East-West in the South of the State to North-South in the North. The biggest diabasic dikes belong to this system. The other system has its faults directed normally to the first. These faults show very clearly that the Paraná basin is the result of regional subsidence by step-faults. The similar step-faults can be observed on Mato-Grosso side of the Paraná river and we have little doubt about the extension of this system to the basin of Paraguay river, more to the West. The step-faults of bigger system, which run parallel to the limit of crystalline belt, have generally its downthrow on the side contrary to the crystalline formations. There are some exceptions of this rule. The Botucatú sandstone blocks are separated by faults, which have its downthrow on the side of older Passa Dois formation, but these faults have always little vertical displacements. The biggest rivers, Paraná and Paranapanema, flow parallely to biggest faults but the affluents, as Tietê, cross these faults normally. The eruptions occurred in extreme plains, through faults and fissures. The elimination cf lava was difficult and the channels of eruption were closed by hardened lava after the first outbreak. The magma of following eruptions penetrated mostly in the São Bento sandstone, forming extensive sills. Obviously the sills in lower strata must be rare, as the magma had much more resistance there, in view of the pression of overlaying formations. Almost in all borings of S. Paulo State, which reached in some cases the considerable depth of 1600 - 1800 mts, the diabase was encountered in the whole extension of borings, but no sill of bigger dimensions was met below the S. Bento sandstone. Mostly the diabase in biggest depths was in form of dikes. The diabasic intrusions and lavas strengthened the S. Bento sandstone, which resisted the following erosion much better as older formations. Most of high plateaus in South-Brasil with abrupt sides are formed by S. Bento sand stone with diabasic or silicified layer. Excepting the predevonian metamorphic belt all narrow valleys with abrupt sides are located in S. Bento sandstone region. By the different resistance against the erosion is easily explained the broad lower plains of 500 - 550 mt altitude, on Passa Dois, Tubarão and Itararé formations, between high plateaus in the west and the crystalline coastal elevations in the East. It is generally admitted that all differences of chemical and mineralogical composition of eruptive rocks come from chemical variations of the magma, which produced these rocks. There are now established as many kinds of magma as magmatic rocks. The differences of structure are mostly explained by modern thermal diagrams, based on enormous number of experiments. To apply these diagrams for our rocks we must assume that in the nature the elements which form different combinations known as rocks are kept together during the whole forming process as they are kept in the furnace of the laboratory. It would be the case of a quite isolated subterranean chamber, with no connections either with lower reservoirs or earth surface. On the contrary, the basaltic eruptions were the product of an enormous network of aults and fissures, which the magma crossed during the process of crystallisation. We mentioned already melaphyres, which were the product of the liquid part of the magma, after the separation of more basic crystals. By the use of the Fedorow stage it was discovered that in most samples of diabase or augite-porphyrites the plagioclases of the same generation and dimensions have different chemical composition. The differences in the case of plagioclases reach sometimes 10 - 20 % An, which is much above the errors of the Fedorow method. Evidently in diabases, augite-porphyrites and melaphyres we have mechanical mixures. In other words many times the crystals were separated from the mother solution and mixed with a solution of other composition. The Fedorow stage permits easily observe that most pyroxenes and plagioclases have rounded edges. Generally such rounded edges are explained by magmatic reabsorption, and in some instances it is quite true. The diabasic magma during the eruption was heavily charged with crystals and its liquid part was very near the solid state. It is proved by no chemical action or very slight chemical action on the sides of transporting channels. Only rarely the contact zone is several meters thick. In every such case it is a contact of a big reservoir, where the magma remained till the solidification, or we have an instance of hydrothermal postvolcanic action. In such a half-solid magma no chemical differentiation was possible. In biggest sills and dikes of S. Paulo State we collected numerous samples at regular intervals normally to the sides of the intrusions. In many cases we discovered evident changes in the structure of the rock, and in the mineralogical and chemical composition of the samples of the same intrusion, but the detailed geological investigation always showed that the changes come from different phases of the eruption, and are not the result of differentiation. Different may be the case of bocaiuvites, which have consolidated as plutonitic masses far below the surface of the earth. The eruption began in the depth of many thousands of meters. In this depth the magma was more liquid and gaseous and could absorb completely the fragments of crossed rocks. The deepest strata, crossed by basaltic magma, were glass of acid composition, in half solid state, which readily was absorbed by moving basaltic magma, giving the more acid andesitic augite-porphyrites which in all diabasic dikes occupy the central parts, or cross the previously consolidated diabasic sills. We admit the existence of many magmas of different chemical composition, but most of these secondary magmas were the products of mechanical mixing during the eruption of one magma, contaminated by one or two glasses in half liquid state; once consolidated as eruptive rocks the magmatic mixtures left no other traces. The basaltic permotriassic eruptions by its extraordinary development supply the best evidence for the problem of the causes of volcanic action. The accumulation of glacial-lacustrine and eolic deposits during the permo-triassic time reached a total thickness of thousands of meters and was the cause of a subsidence of corresponding dimensions. There was one important factor which transformed this subsidence in a catastrophe of exceptional grandeur. Generally the accumulation occurs in geo-sinclinals between parallel ridges, where the pressed magma reaches the surface through channels in the form of volcans, which are the safety valves of magmatic kettle. There were no safety valves in the enormous Gondwana Continent, inaccessible for tectonic disturbances during the long permotriassic period, with exception of some little parts at its borders. The loading of this continent occurred in very different manner, when compared to deltaic or sinclinal sedimentation, which generally have big changes of thickness on the belts of several kilometers broad. The water-currents, maritime or continental, are steady. On the contrary, the eolic deposits, which were the last load on the Gondwana Continent, covered it in large overlapping zones, with many changes of direction of wind during every year. There were no mountains which could accumulate blown sands in belts. Such belts by subsidence and consequent lateral movement of magma, as estipulated by isostatic theory, would gradually reestablish the balance of crustal forces. The magma found the escape in vertical faults and fissures almost simultaneously over the shole continent. We had not sinking and rising blocks of isostatic mutual displacement. The sinking and rising movements happened in the whole continent. The sinking part were the Gondwana sediments and the rising the basic magmas. At first appeared melaphyric lavas, leaving behind heavier magma. There was no lacking of volcanic gases, which opened the fissures for the oncoming Java. When the eruptions of gas ceased and the expanding lavas closed the issues, as it was explained before, the subsidence of the continent continued some time more by the impulse taken. In this last period of subsidence the lighter sediments sank deeper in he avier magma and the diabasic sills were intruded. The difference of load on continental blocks explains the beginning of continental subsidence but cannot explain all phenomena correlated. The vertical displacement of magma instead of lateral, explains naturally the positive gravity anomalies over deltas, which the isostatic theory cannot explain. The oscillations of the level of the sea are well understood as the result of the sinking of lighter mass in heavier magma by inertia and later regaining of balance. Also many if not most part of volcanic outbreaks have its cause in the gravity pressure of the crust of the earth on the magma. The magnetometric crossection of S. Paulo and Mato Grosso States (18) shows the gradual increase of the vertical component from the crystalline belts of both states toward the axis of Paraná basin. The subsidence near this axis was the greatest and consequently the biggest are there basic intrusions. The base of S. Bento sandstone comes there down to the 80 mts level above the sea. In the North of the S. Paulo State the total thickness of eruptive sills is about 125 - 150 mts and the base of the sandstone rises to the 700 - 750 mts level. In the North-Uruguay the borings discovered a diabasic sill of 360 mts thickness and here the base of the S. Bento sandstone goes down to 500 mts below the sea-level. The same gradual descending of the Gondwana System toward the South is observed in South Africa. The Gondwana System has the maximum thickness of 27800 feet in the Cape Provinces simultaneously with maximum total thickness of diabasic sills and lavas of 4500 mts, and the lowest situation of Dwyka Tillite. In Central Transvaal the Gondwana System is olny 2430 feet thick according to A. du-Toit and the base of Dwyka Tillite rises the 1400 mts level. Farther to the North in the Nyasaland border the Gondwana System is 18000 feet thick and we have there a group of lavas up to 4500 feet thick...|$|E
