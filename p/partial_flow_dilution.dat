40|$|The {{heavy duty}} Particle Measurement Programme (PMP) inter-laboratory {{exercise}} {{consists of three}} parts: 1) the exploratory work to refine the measurement protocol, 2) the validation exercise where each lab will measure the emissions of a ¿golden¿ engine with two ¿golden¿ particle number systems simultaneously sampling from full and <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> systems, and 3) the round-robin where the emissions of a ¿reference¿ engine will be determined with a lab¿s own particle number instrumentation. This paper {{presents the results of}} the exploratory work and describes the final protocol for testing in the validation exercise (and round robin) along with the necessary facility modifications required for compliance with the protocol. Key aspects of the protocol (e. g. filter material, flow rates at the full and partial flow systems, the pre-conditioning etc.) are explained and justified. Finally, the results of particle emissions measurements during the World harmonized and the European cycles are given focusing on volatility and the presence of non-volatile materials above and below 23 nm.

40|$|Recently, a {{particle}} number (PN) limit {{was introduced in}} the European light-duty vehicles legislation. The legislation requires measurement of PN, and particulate mass (PM), from the full dilution tunnel with constant volume sampling (CVS). Furthermore, PN measurements will be introduced in the next stage of the European Heavy-Duty regulation. Heavy-duty engine certification can be done either from the CVS or from a <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> system (PFDS). For research and development purposes, though, measurements are often conducted from the raw exhaust, thereby avoiding the high installation costs of CVS and PFDS. Although for legislative measurements requirements exist regarding sampling and transport of the aerosol sample, such requirements do not necessarily apply for raw exhaust measurements. Thus, measurement differences are often observed depending on where in the experimental set up sampling occurs. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize and discuss particle loss mechanisms. Simple equations are given for the most important mechanisms. Topics like isokinetic sampling and agglomeration are discussed for various typical cases. Special emphasis is placed on thermophoretic losses since thermophoresis is the most important particle removal mechanism for raw exhaust sampling from modern engines. Sampling from high pressure exhaust gas is also mentioned, and comparisons of the effect of tubing materials on particle removal are carried out. Finally, expected losses for typical cases are shown.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of particle number {{has been introduced}} in the Euro 5 / 6 light duty vehicle legislation, {{as a result of}} the light duty inter-laboratory exercise of the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The heavy duty inter-laboratory exercise investigates whether the same or a similar procedure can be applied to the heavy duty regulation. In the heavy duty exercise two ¿golden¿ systems sample simultaneously; the first from the full dilution tunnel and the second from the <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> system of each lab. One of the targets of the exercise is to compare the full <b>flow</b> and the <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> system results. In this study we follow a different approach to compare the particle number emissions: We use a PMP compliant system at different positions (full <b>flow,</b> <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> and tailpipe) and we compare its emissions with a ¿reference¿ system always sampling from the full <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> tunnel. The results from two heavy duty diesel engines equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) show that full <b>flow</b> and <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> systems emissions have negligible differences (23 nm but depending on the engine, they are 70 - 500 % higher.

40|$|The {{results of}} the LD inter-laboratory {{exercise}} were reported during 2007 (Andersson et al. 2007). 	The HD exercise consists of three parts: ¿	The exploratory work at JRC for {{the definition of the}} measurement protocol. It includes system and sample backgrounds, filter media and filter face velocity effects, preconditioning, comparisons of different particle number systems, and investigation of the particle number instruments. ¿	The validation exercise for the evaluation of particle number repeatability and reproducibility using the same measurement systems at all labs (Golden Systems). In the validation exercise, an engine (Golden Engine) will be circulated along with two Golden Systems used to simultaneously sample from full (FFDS) and <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> exhaust <b>dilution</b> (PFDS) systems respectively. The Golden Engineer and project manager will ensure that the participating labs closely follow the measurement protocol. Low sulphur fuel and lubricant from single batches will be used at all labs. The participating labs are JRC (I), AVL_MTC (S), RICARDO (UK), UTAC (F), and EMPA (CH). JRC tested first and will also measure last to demonstrate consistency of measurement systems and test engine. ¿	The round robin exercise for the evaluation of particle number repeatability and reproducibility using different systems. In the round robin, a reference engine will circulate, but each lab will use its own particle number systems from FFDS and optionally from PFDS. All labs will use fuel and lubricant of the same type (but not from the same batch). The participating labs are from EU, Japan, Korea and Canada.

A {{diesel particulate filter}} (DPF) {{can be used to}} reduce the particulate matter (PM) emissions from a vehicle. However, when these devices fail the tailpipe emissions can change. The main goal of this project was to determine if a soot sensor provided by Honeywell could detect a failed filter, defined as an exhaust aerosol concentration downstream of the DPF greater than the current US heavy duty PM standard of 13 mg/kWh (10 mg/bhp-hr). In this study a DPF failure was first simulated on an engine dynamometer test stand using an exhaust bypass valve. Then the valve was removed and the filter was actually failed in a series of steps by drilling out individual channel end caps. Exhaust was cooled and diluted using a <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> air ejector <b>dilution</b> tunnel, and dilution ratios were determined using raw and dilute nitric oxide (NO) measurements. Dilute diesel exhaust aerosol was characterized upstream and downstream of a DPF. Filter samples and an AVL photo-acoustic soot sensor were used to estimate PM mass emissions, and TSI aerosol instruments were used to measure aerosol size distributions and total number concentrations. An electrostatic precipitator, DMA, electrometer and CPC were used to evaluate the aerosol charge distribution. Downstream measurements were repeated as the filter was progressively failed in a series of steps. These measurements were then used to evaluate the response of the Honeywell exhaust soot sensor. Under certain steady state conditions the sensor output showed a statistically significant increase as the filter was failed but the output was susceptible to interference from mechanical vibration and was dependent on engine operating conditions, and the exhaust system used. Exhaust aerosol charge measurements showed the concept is viable but further work is required to refine the sensor...|$|R
40|$|In 2011 the European Commission {{introduced}} a limit for non-volatile particle number (PN) emissions > 23 nm from light-duty vehicles and the stated {{intent is to}} implement similar legislation for on-road heavy-duty engines at the next legislative stage. This paper reviews the recent literature regarding the operation-dependent emission of PN from light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines, and the measurement procedure used for regulatory purposes. The repeatability of the PN method is of the order 5 % and higher scatter of the results could easily {{be explained by the}} effect of the vehicles or the aftertreatment devices on the PN emissions (e. g. the fill state of the diesel particulate filters). Reproducibility remains an issue since it may exceed 30 %. These high variability levels are mainly associated with calibration uncertainties of the PN instruments and drifts of the PN systems (especially those of the Particle Number Counters - PNCs) over time. Correlation measurements between the full dilution tunnels (Constant Volume Samplers - CVS) and the proportional <b>Partial</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Dilution</b> Systems (PFDS) showed agreement within 15 % for the PN method down to 1 x 1011 p/kWh. At lower concentrations, the PN background of the CVS and/or the PFDS can result in larger inconsistencies. The filter-based Particulate (matter) Mass (PM) and the PN emissions correlate well down to 1 - 2 mg/km for light-duty vehicles and also 2 - 3 mg/kWh for heavy-duty applications. The correlation improves when only elemental carbon mass is considered: It is relatively good down to 0. 1 - 0. 3 mg/km or mg/kWh; one order of magnitude below the PM levels. JRC.

40|$|Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) are {{becoming}} part of the emissions control regulations, as evidenced by the latest requirements introduced in the United States regulations for on-highway and non-road machinery. The European Union is currently following the same route to check the in-use behaviour of heavy-duty diesel vehicles. The current research programmes tend to demonstrate that both the instrumentation and the test methods are mature for gaseous emissions. For PM emissions, the development of portable PM instruments and their test protocols remain a complex challenge, as simultaneous progress take place in the engine after-treatment technologies and the official homologation procedures (the PMP programme in particular). The present paper discusses the current research strategy proposed in the EU for the development of an on-board PM test protocol. Case studies from the EU-PEMS project are presented. For the equivalency tests between portable and laboratory system, results are presented for the <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> associated with the filter mass based principle. Portable commercial PM instruments are evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions (i. e. on reference test cycles) against reference laboratory instruments using a Euro III heavy-duty engine running on different fuels, including bio-fuel. Other support instruments, measuring real-time soot or the total PM composition, are also used. Under these test conditions, the study has demonstrated the equivalency between the tested portable technology and its laboratory counterpart. Another part of the work is to evaluate the applicability of the methodology for on-board testing: results and lessons learned from on board measurements conducted on diesel city buses on urban test routes are presented and discussed showing very good test-to-test repeatability. Issues, such as filter handling and conditioning on board, need particular attention for the adaptation of the test method to the future generations of vehicles. JRC.

40|$|Field testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) is {{becoming}} an important regulatory tool to monitor the in-use compliance of large sources like heavy-duty vehicles, construction and agriculture equipment. Legislative research programmes in Europe, United States and Japan are introducing PEMS in the regulations. The current development status of instrumentation and test procedures is mature for gaseous emissions. The most critical issue remains the development of portable PM instruments and the associated protocol. The main objectives of the paper are: To {{provide an overview of}} the on-going regulatory efforts regarding on-board PM measurements both in the European Union and the United States; To review the available portable measurement techniques; To discuss the technical issues related to the development of an official ¿on-board test procedure¿. The discussion and the conclusions will be supported by some findings from the EU-PEMS project and in particular the evaluation of portable instruments under controlled laboratory conditions (i. e. on reference test cycles) and against reference instruments. PM mass measurements were carried out from a Euro III heavy-duty engine. For the filter gravimetric method, the Control Sistem micro-PSS (portable proportional diluter) was compared to the standard gravimetric methods using full dilution within the CVS dilution tunnel and two laboratory proportional flow sampling systems such as the AVL Smart Sampler (SPC 472) and the Control Sistem PSS- 20. For real-time measurement, the AVL 483 micro soot sensor was also tested in parallel with the gravimetric methods using both full flow and <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dilution.</b> The measurements were found to be highly repeatable over the regulatory cycles. Bio-fuel was also used to characterise the instruments in different ranges and its effect upon the black carbon concentration observed. Regarding the development of on-board test procedures, the first findings from tests conducted on city buses will be presented. The main issues related to a less controlled on-board environment (with vibrations, temperature changes) compared to more controlled laboratory conditions will be highlighted. JRC.

40|$|International audienceTraffic matrix {{estimation}} is well-studied, but {{in general}} has been treated simply as a statistical inference problem.
