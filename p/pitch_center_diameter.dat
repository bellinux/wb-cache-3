40|$|This essay {{provides}} {{analysis of}} the first Allegro (“Eden Valley”) and the coda from Aaron Copland’s Appalachian Spring. Following Joseph Straus and Arthur Berger, this investigation traces the correspondences of the work’s <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> with other <b>pitch</b> components of the music’s surface. The varied musical approaches of the Allegro—functional progressions, polychords, quartal trichords, chains of triads related by half or whole step, and pandiatonic melodies—coalesce to create a multi-faceted movement from centricity on A to centricity on F, while also presenting unique, individual narratives of that procession to F. In Appalachian Spring’s coda, both A and F reappear in marked contexts, and the coda’s overall focus on C recalls an important role C had in {{the progress of the}} Allegro. The resulting tonal connections span the entire composition. This linking of <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> with other musical elements can yield analytic insights into a large cross-section of repertoire cutting across stylistic and historical boundaries. In that respect, this analysis illustrates an approach potentially appropriate to any pitch-centric music...|$|R

50|$|Christ {{always has}} {{the longest and}} lowest notes, {{creating}} a stark contrast with the other characters. The <b>pitch</b> <b>center</b> for Christ is E, and it {{is accompanied by a}} drone and T-voice in the organ. For the turba, the <b>pitch</b> <b>center</b> is again E. The alto and bass voices, again always playing an M role, are mirrored, and the soprano and tenor T-voices alternate above and below the M-voices. While both are centered on E, the M-voices use E Phrygian against E major in the T-voices; this makes for striking cross-relations between G-natural and G-sharp, though the two never sound at the same time. Pilate, like Christ, is accompanied only by the organ, but sings in faster rhythmic values and has a higher tessitura. Pilate's part is the most unstable in the piece, created in part through the use of an M-voice centered on B and a T-voice centered on F (a tritone apart) and through the refusal of Pilate to be either a T-voice or M-voice, always alternating between these two roles.|$|R

The pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a nonchord tone during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost more like an added tone than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may serve as atonal <b>pitch</b> <b>centers.</b>|$|R

40|$|This work {{attempts}} to reconcile several distinct and sometimes contradictory aesthetics. As a new American symphony {{of the twenty-first}} century, it pays homage both to classical models and to pioneer American composers, but also departs from these influences in significant ways. The symphony comprises four movements conforming to the classical model exemplified by the works of Beethoven (sonata, scherzo, adagio, rondo). Superimposed across the four movements is an over-arching structure of a large-scale sonata form {{in the manner of}} the post-Beethoven generation of composers, particularly Schumann and Liszt. The first movement functions as the sonata exposition, the second and third as development, and the fourth as the recapitulation and coda. Departing from the classical model, the development section of the first movement is a self-contained fugato, unlike the freely evolving development sections of Mozart and Beethoven. The <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> in the sonata mirror the key relationships of the classical model, but the <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> are related by tritone, instead of the traditional tonic-dominant relationship. The twelve-tone series that underlies every structurally important melody, and provides the harmonic building blocks of the work, invokes the more recent model of Schoenberg's serial technique. The series has its first linear statement in the opening measures of the work as the principal theme of the sonata. Immediately thereafter, a succession of three-note chords presents the series as a fourfold iteration of a single trichord. Each of the remaining three movements is constructed from these two manifestations of the series. In a sense, then, the work as a whole functions as a set of variations on a theme. A significant stylistic feature of the work is the deliberate evocation of American orchestral music of the twentieth century [...] in particular, the symphonies of Copland, Harris, and Schuman. Hallmarks of this style include the use of simple rhythmic figures, strongly accented syncopation, and mixed meters; avoidance of complex orchestral combinations in favor of plain colors; the use of widely-spaced sonorities; a harmonic palette favoring quartal and quintal harmonies; use of extended tertian harmonies including polychords; and emphasis on uncomplicated musical textures in which melody dominates...|$|R
40|$|A laminar {{analysis}} of the receptive field properties of relay cells in the binocular region of the tree shrew dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) found three main subdivisions. Lamina 1 (receiving ipsilateral eye input) and lamina 2 (contralateral) comprise a pair of layers that contain only ON-center neurons. Laminae 4 (contralateral) and 5 (ipsilateral) comprise a pair of layers with mostly OFF-center cells (86 %). Laminae 3 and 6 (both contralaterally innervated) also form a distinct pair, although lamina 3 contains a mixture of cells with ON-centers (43 %) or OFF-centers (57 %), and lamina 6 contains mostly cells with ON-OFF centers and suppressive surrounds (81 %). Cells located in the interlaminar zones resembled neurons in laminae 3 and 6. In comparison with the cells in the OFF-center laminae 4 and 5, the ON-center cells in laminae 1 and 2 had smaller, more elliptical receptive field centers with stronger responses to flashed visual stimuli. In addition, cells in the ipsilateral eye laminae 1 and 5 showed a greater change in <b>center</b> <b>diameter,</b> with eccentricity from the area centralis, than cells in the contralateral eye laminae 2 and 4. Principal components analysis using six receptive field properties (latency to optic chiasm stimulation, receptive field <b>center</b> <b>diameter,</b> maintained discharge rate, response onset latency, peak spike density, and phasic-tonic index) suggested that the cells in laminae 3 and 6 and the interlaminar zones are W-like. Principal components {{analysis of}} the same receptive field properties in laminae 1, 2, 4, and 5 did not reveal differences clearly related to X-like (parvocellular) and Y-like (magnocellular) categories. Ninety-seven percent of the cells tested for linearity of spatial summation in laminae 1, 2, 4, and 5 were linear. We conclude that the dominant organizational features of the tree shrew LGN are the ON-center, OFF-center, and W pairs of layers that project to different regions within the striate cortex.
