50|$|The biggest change, however, {{took place}} behind the scenes. Instead of {{focusing}} {{on the needs of}} the utilities (which had by this time already adopted the Giro) and the personal banking market, National Giro would aim to capture the cash deposit business then dominated by the commercial clearing banks. The Post Office itself was a major customer of the commercial banks. It had a constant need for cash in order for it to pay out social security payments (welfare payments and pensions). Bank notes and coin had to be obtained from the banks which charged a fee for this service. The banks were also charging the depositors of these notes and coin, all of which needed to be counted before being passed on to the Post Office (which itself then had extra costs in counting the money provided by the banks. The new system was brilliantly simple. Large depositors of cash (supermarkets, petrol (gas) stations etc.) would be encouraged through pricing to pay their cash into the Post Office. Post Offices are more convenient and open longer hours so there was a natural case for choosing the Post Office. What's more, the depositor would count the money once and seal it discrete envelopes of say, units of £100, £500 or £1000. The Post Office would take the money on trust, but commit to counting it not on receipt, but within a fixed period, of say 5 days. Thus within the <b>Post</b> <b>Office,</b> <b>money</b> could be handled very easily and its source was clearly marked. The money would be counted {{at the time it was}} needed (i.e. when the envelope needed to be opened). Discrepancies were reported to the Giro, so that any attempt at systematic fraud could be easily identified. And the Giro could charge both the depositor for the deposit and the Post Office as an internal charge for the provision of the cash. As these charges were lower than those being charged by the commercial banks, everybody was happy. The Post Office internal handling of cash also became much simplified by the handling of fixed value envelopes.|$|E

5|$|Treasurer of the United States Francis E. Spinner {{has been}} {{credited}} with finding {{the solution to the}} shortage of coinage: he created postage currency (which led into the use of Fractional currency). Postage (or postal) currency was the first of five issues of US <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> fractional paper <b>money</b> printed in 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent denominations and issued from 21 August 1862 through 27 May 1863. Spinner proposed using postage stamps, affixed to Treasury paper, with his signature on the bottom (see illustration below). Based on this initiative, Congress supported a temporary solution involving fractional currency and on 17 July 1862 President Lincoln signed the Postage Currency Bill into law. The intent, however, was not that stamps should be a circulating currency.|$|R
