40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} case for harmonising some national rules, relating {{to the law of}} damages and civil procedure, which are applied to national <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> of losses resulting from breach of Articles 101 and/or 102 TFEU. Before answering whether such rules should be harmonised, the dissertation examines the broad policy rationale behind private enforcement of competition law, its goals and limits. The findings are that private enforcement plays a positive role both to compensate antitrust victims and deter undertakings from breaching competition law. This provides a sound policy for harmonisation of private enforcement rules. Subsequently, the dissertation examines the main arguments against and for harmonisation. It is argued that {{the case for}} harmonisation is more convincing than the case against. Then, the arguments for harmonisation are tested in respect of some national rules that play a pivotal role in national competition law proceedings. Although few antitrust actions are brought, it is suggested that some national rules might not comply with the EU principle of effectiveness. In addition, even if such national rules did comply with this principle, the risk of forum shopping and the problem of excessive disparity of the level playing field are likely to materialise. Thus,harmonisation of private enforcement rules is desirable. ...|$|E

40|$|Air {{transport}} {{is subject}} to various risks. One of them is bird strike hazard. Despite numerous regulations concerning prevention from this type of occurrence, {{it is not possible}} to eliminate them entirely. Bird strikes most often take place during take-off and landing, that is on or in the vicinity of an airport. For that reason airport operators are the first parties that can be made accountable for this occurence. International law imposes numerous responsibilities on airport operators in terms of bird strike hazard prevention on air operations, thus placing airport operators in a “key position” in the system of safety. However, the party that suffers significant damages in the first instance, is the aircraft operator. If a bird strike takes place on or in the vicinity of an airport, an aicraft operator can sue the airport operator for compensation of damages. Generally, the issue of indemnity {{is subject to}} out of court negotiations, however instances in which there is a lack of agreement between the parties, i. e. airport operator, aircraft operator or their insurers, lead to legal <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation.</b> This article attempts to illustrate the relationship between air traffic participants such as airport operators and aircraft operators in connection with their obligations and liability, particulary taking into account the legal obligations of an airport operator...|$|E
