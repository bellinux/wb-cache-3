5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and <b>pinene.</b> Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous. Plant steroids and sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E

25|$|Pepper {{gets its}} spicy heat mostly from piperine derived {{both from the}} outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), <b>pinene</b> (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, which is stripped of the fruit layer. White pepper can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E

500|$|Many animals {{make use}} of {{poisonous}} chemicals for self-defence. These may be concentrated in surface structures such as spines or glands, giving an attacker {{a taste of the}} chemicals before it actually bites or swallows the prey animal: many toxins are bitter-tasting. A last-ditch defence is for the animal's flesh itself to be toxic, as in the puffer fish, danaid butterflies and burnet moths. Many insects acquire toxins from their food plants; Danaus caterpillars accumulate toxic cardenolides from milkweeds (Asclepiadaceae). The bombardier beetle has specialized glands on the tip of its abdomen that allows it to direct a toxic spray towards predators. The spray is generated explosively through oxidation of hydroquinones and is sprayed at a temperature of 100°C. Armoured crickets similarly release blood at their joints when threatened (autohaemorrhaging). Several species of grasshopper including Poecilocerus pictus, Parasanaa donovani, Aularches miliaris, and Tegra novaehollandiae secrete noxious liquids when threatened, sometimes ejecting these forcefully. Spitting cobras accurately squirt venom from their fangs at the eyes of potential predators, striking their target eight times out of ten, and causing severe pain. Termite soldiers in the Nasutitermitinae have a fontanellar gun, a gland on the front of their head which can secrete and shoot an accurate jet of resinous terpenes [...] "many centimeters". The material is sticky and toxic to other insects. One of the terpenes in the secretion, <b>pinene,</b> functions as an alarm pheromone.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to discover new heterogeneous catalysts {{for the production of}} linear dialkylaromatic compounds such as 4, 4 '-dimethylbiphenyl, 4, 4 'diisopropylbiphenyl, 2, 6 -diisopropylnaphthalene and p-cymene.

The second reaction deals with the alkylation of biphenyl and naphthalene with propylene, to shape selectively synthesize 4, 4 '-diisopropylbiphenyl and 2, 6 -diisopropylnaphthalene. It is demonstrated that zeolite beta is an intrinsic shape-selective catalyst for this type of alkylation. Finally, the third reaction uses the classical Ullmann reaction catalyticaly, and couples two p-chlorotoluene molecules to form 4, 4 '-dimethylbiphenyl.

The synergistic effect of metallic catalysts + radical initiators and redox substances + radical initiators on the copolymerization reaction rate was studied. Those reactions were followed by in situ dynamic viscosity measurements. Using in situ viscometry a statistical analysis of the reaction rate reproducibility for the system #alpha#-pinene/styrene was made.
