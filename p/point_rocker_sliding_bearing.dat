40|$|Steel <b>point</b> {{and line}} <b>rocker</b> {{bearings}} {{are used in}} civil engineering, especially in bridge construction. Technical literature does not provide any data of the rolling-off resistance in the rocker parts of such bearings. Therefore the experimental determination of this resistance was the main objective of this research project. Using a special tilting device, tests were conducted on <b>point</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> with pressure contact plates of steel St 52 and stainless steel whereby the level of loading (Hertzian stress in the contact surfaces) and the thickness' of the contact components were varied. The rolling-off resistance at rocker's maximum rotation of tan a= 0. 01 were calculated from the measured results and presented in diagrams. Also permanent deformations of the contact plates were measured. In addition the Hertzian formulas and the material stress' for point contact were described in more detail. Rolling-off and rolling resistance were compared using empirically derived formulas. Test results show the following: The rolling-off resistance is influenced significantly by the Hertzian stress' in the contact surfaces, the material quality, the level of preloading, plastic deformations and thickness of the contact components {{as well as the}} rotation angle. Contrary to present regulations, not only the geometric excentricity but also the rolling-off resistance should be taken into account when Hertzian stress' in the contact surface are significantly higher than those at local yielding of the contact plates. According to the present state of knowledge, the permissible Hertzian stress' given in different standards should be reduced for rocker bearings. As for roller bearings, the permissible contact pressure should be correlated with the amount of the rolling-off resistance. At the tilting angles investigated, the rolling-off resistance of rocker bearings is significantly smaller than the rolling resistance of roller bearings. The rolling-off resistance was experimentally determined {{for the first time with}} the investigations presented here. In view of the numerous factors of influence, several questions could not be answered in a complete and final manner. (orig.)

The author tries to improve the availability of thermoplastic massive <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> with radial realization under different operation conditions.

The wear behavior of thermoplastic massive <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> is determined with run-up and run-out experiments. The experiments concerning to the <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> are realized on special test stands. This considers the fact that proceedings in thermoplastic <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are a part of}} complex tribologic systems. Short-time experiments provide sufficiently exact statements according to specific wear rates. If the thermoplastic <b>sliding</b> <b>bearing</b> works at its maximum load, the chemical degradation of the plastics and a reduction of the durability of the storage material may be observed. An initial lubrication with fat decreases the medium-coefficient of friction, the specific shear rate and storage temperatures. Non lubricated HT thermoplastic sleeve bearings can be used successfully at start-stop operations. In comparison to endurance tests with non lubricated HT thermoplastic sleeve bearings, little medium coefficients of friction and little specific wear rates are established in start-stop operation. Endurance tests with non lubricated sheathed bearings provide little medium coefficients of friction in comparison to non lubricated sleeve bearings. The specific wear rate is higher {{as in the case of}} sleeve bearings. The basic estimations with respect to the endurance tests with non lubricated sleeve bearings are transferable to the start-stop experiments. 114 figs., 37 tabs., 152 refs.
