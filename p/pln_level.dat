40|$|The DNA {{sequence}} of 106 BAC/PAC clones {{in the minimum}} tiling path (MTP) of the long arm of rice chromosome 11, between map positions 57. 3 and 116. 2 × cM, has been assembled to phase 2 or <b>PLN</b> <b>level.</b> This region has been sequenced to 10 × redundancy by the Indian Initiative for Rice Genome Sequencing (IIRGS) and is now publicly available in GenBank. The region, excluding overlaps, has been predicted to contain 2, 932 genes using different software. A gene-by-gene BLASTN search of the NCBI wheat EST database of over 420, 000 cDNA sequences revealed that 1, 143 of the predicted rice genes (38. 9 %) have significant homology to wheat ESTs (bit score ≥ 100). Further BLASTN search of these 1, 143 rice genes with the GrainGenes database of sequence contigs containing bin-mapped wheat ESTs allowed 113 of the genes {{to be placed in}} bins located on wheat chromosomes of different homoeologous groups. The largest number of genes, about one-third, mapped to the homoeologous group 4 chromosomes of wheat, suggesting a common evolutionary origin. The remaining genes were located on wheat chromosomes of different groups with significantly higher numbers for groups 3 and 5. Location of bin-mapped wheat contigs to chromosomes of all the seven homoeologous groups can be ascribed to movement of genes (transpositions) or chromosome segments (translocations) within rice or the hexaploid wheat genomes. Alternatively, it could be due to ancient duplications in the common ancestral genome of wheat and rice followed by selective elimination of genes in the wheat and rice genomes. While there exists definite conservation of gene sequences and the ancestral chromosomal identity between rice and wheat, there is no obvious conservation of the gene order at this level of resolution. Lack of extensive colinearity between rice and wheat genomes suggests that there have been many insertions, deletions, duplications and translocations that make the synteny comparisons much more complicated than earlier thought. However, enhanced resolution of comparative sequence analysis may reveal smaller conserved regions of colinearity, which will facilitate selection of markers for saturation mapping and sequencing of the gene-rich regions of the wheat genome. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prednisolone (PLN) is {{a widely}} used {{corticosteroid}} {{in a variety of}} immune-mediated diseases. Treatment regimes generally consist of empirically derived treatment doses, whereas therapeutic response among patients is highly variable. Drug monitoring of serum <b>PLN</b> <b>levels</b> might support a more rational approach to dose selection, yet is invasive and laborious. In analogy to cortisol, salivary PLN may offer a good alternative for serum PLN, being a representative approximation of free serum PLN. The aims of this study were to evaluate the correlation between free serum and salivary <b>PLN</b> <b>levels</b> and to quantify this relationship within a population pharmacokinetic model. Methods: PLN and prednisone (PN) concentrations were measured in 396 samples from 19 healthy volunteers after oral ingestion of 80 mg PLN. Measurements in serum, ultrafiltrate, and saliva were performed with a recently validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with nonlinear mixed effect modeling using NONMEM. Results: Salivary <b>PLN</b> <b>levels</b> correlated well with free serum <b>PLN</b> <b>levels</b> (r = 0. 931, P < 0. 01). A weaker correlation was found for PN (r = 0. 318, P < 0. 01), which may be explained by the finding that salivary PN levels mainly seemed to consist of PLN enzymatically converted to PN. Total and free serum PLN concentrations decreased over time after drug administration and showed a nonlinear mutual relationship, consistent with concentration-dependent protein binding. Modeled PLN pharmacokinetics corresponded with previous reports. Low to moderate interindividual variability was found for V/F and CL/F (coefficients of variation were 13. 8 % and 14. 6 %, respectively). Free and salivary PLN showed a nonlinear relationship with total PLN. An equation predicting free serum levels from salivary levels was successfully derived from the data. Conclusions: This study is the first to describe the relationship between salivary and (free) serum PLN using a population pharmacokinetic model. Salivary PLN was found to be a reliable predictor of free and total serum PLN in healthy volunteers. The results of this study encourage further exploration of the use of saliva as a noninvasive and feasible method for drug monitoring of PL...|$|R
40|$|Poly-N-acetyllactosamine (PLN) is {{a unique}} glycan {{composed}} of repeating units of the common disaccharide (Galbeta 1, 4 -GlcNAcbeta 1, 3) n. The expression of PLN on glycoprotein core structures minimally requires enzyme activities for beta 1, 4 -galactosyltransferase (beta 4 GalT) and beta 1, 3 -N-acetylglucosminyltransferase (beta 3 GnT). Because beta 4 GalTs are ubiquitous in most cells, PLN expression is generally ascribed to the tissue-specific transcription of eight known beta 3 GnT genes in mice. In the olfactory epithelium (OE), beta 3 GnT 2 regulates expression of extended PLN chains that are essential for axon guidance and neuronal survival. N-glycan branching and core composition, however, can also modulate the extent of PLN modification. Here, we show {{for the first time}} that the beta 1, 6 -branching glycosyltransferase GCNT 2 (formerly known as IGnT) is expressed at high levels specifically in the OE and other sensory ganglia. Postnatally, GCNT 2 is maintained in mature olfactory neurons that co-express beta 3 GnT 2 and PLN. This highly specific co-expression suggests that GCNT 2 and beta 3 GnT 2 function cooperatively in PLN synthesis. In support of this, beta 3 GnT 2 and GCNT 2 co-transfection in HEK 293 T cells results in high <b>levels</b> of <b>PLN</b> expression on the cell surface and on adenylyl cyclase 3, a major carrier of PLN glycans in the OE. These data clearly suggest that GCNT 2 functions in vivo together with beta 3 GnT 2 to determine <b>PLN</b> <b>levels</b> in olfactory neurons by regulating beta 1, 6 -branches that promote PLN extension...|$|R
40|$|Phospholamban (PLN) is a phosphoprotein in cardiac sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) {{that is a}} reversible regulator of the Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA 2 a) {{activity and}} cardiac contractility. Dephosphorylated PLN inhibits SERCA 2 a and PLN phosphorylation, at either Ser 16 by PKA or Thr 17 by Ca 2 +-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), reverses this inhibition. Through this mechanism, PLN is a key modulator of SR Ca 2 + uptake, Ca 2 + load, contractility and relaxation. PLN phosphorylation is also the main determinant of β 1 -adrenergic responses in the heart. Although phosphorylation of Thr 17 by CaMKII contributes to this effect, its role is subordinate to the PKA-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca 2 +, necessary to activate CaMKII. Furthermore, the effects of PLN and its phosphorylation on cardiac function are subject to additional regulation by its interacting partners, the anti-apoptotic HAX- 1 protein and Gm or the anchoring unit of protein phosphatase 1. Regulation of PLN activity by this multimeric complex becomes even more important in pathological conditions, characterized by aberrant Ca 2 +-cycling. In this scenario, CaMKII-dependent PLN phosphorylation {{has been associated with}} protective effects in both acidosis and ischemia/reperfusion. However, the beneficial effects of increasing SR Ca 2 + uptake through PLN phosphorylation may be lost or even become deleterious, when these occur in association with alterations in SR Ca 2 + leak. Moreover, a major characteristic in human and experimental heart failure is depressed SR Ca 2 + uptake, associated with decreased SERCA 2 a levels and dephosphorylation of PLN, leading to decreased SR Ca 2 + load and impaired contractility. Thus, the strategy of altering SERCA 2 a and/or <b>PLN</b> <b>levels</b> or activity to restore perturbed SR Ca 2 + uptake is a potential therapeutic tool for heart failure treatment. We will review here the role of CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of PLN at Thr 17 on cardiac function under physiological and pathological conditions...|$|R
40|$|Heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} modulate many of {{the growth}} factor pathways that drive prostate cancer progression. Prior to being secreted into the extracellular matrix, the covalently attached HS chains are modified by sulfation which {{has been shown to}} increase the affinity of binding growth factors. The specific HSPG that I focus on in this dissertation is Perlecan (Pln). Previously, our group along with collaborators found that 54 percent of prostate cancer tumors had upregulated <b>levels</b> of <b>Pln</b> protein that correlated with increasing Gleason score [93]. The LNCaP-DU 145 -LN 4 cell line series is introduced as a model for this subset of tumors because <b>Pln</b> <b>levels</b> increase 50 -fold as the cells become more metastatic. It was found that three stress-induced transcription factors, HIF 1 ?, NFkB, and ATF 2, all stimulate Pln expression. ChIP analysis reveals that HIF 1 ? and NFkB directly bind the Pln promoter while ATF 2 does not. The ROS-generating NADPH Oxidase and the ROS-inducible p 38 MAPK were also found to induce Pln expression. To address the subset of prostate cancer tumors that reach metastasis without upregulation of Pln, I focused on the 2 -o-sulfotransferase enzyme and its effect on proliferation and invasion in the LNCaP-C 4 - 2 B cell model which does not show upregulation of Perlecan expression. 2 OST RNAi resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation in each line of the series. 2 OST RNAi in highly metastatic C 4 - 2 B cells caused a significant decrease in cell invasion. Cells with decreased levels of 2 OST had increased accumulation of actin and E-cadherin suggesting the possible formation of adherens junctions. I also found that expression of 2 OST increases four-fold as cells become more metastatic. I found HIF 1 ? and ATF 2 act in a direct manner while NFkB acts indirectly to stimulate 2 OST expression. In summary, I have analyzed the effect of cellular stress on the expression of the Pln and 2 OST genes and investigated the phenotype of 2 OST knockdown in metastatic prostate cancer cells. These studies lead me to propose that the tumor stress response is necessary for prostate cancer progression due to the role of stress in the upregulation of extracellular HS that is required for growth factor signaling and metastatic behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Testosterone {{is known}} to induce cardiac {{hypertrophy}} through androgen receptor (AR) -dependent and -independent pathways, but the molecular underpinnings of the androgen action remain poorly understood. Previous work has shown that Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and myocyte-enhancer factor 2 (MEF 2) play key roles in promoting cardiac myocyte growth. In order to gain mechanistic insights into the action of androgens on the heart, we investigated how testosterone affects CaMKII and MEF 2 in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy by performing studies on cultured rat cardiac myocytes and hearts obtained from adult male orchiectomized (ORX) rats. In cardiac myocytes, MEF 2 activity was monitored using a luciferase reporter plasmid, {{and the effects of}} CaMKII and AR signaling pathways on MEF 2 C were examined by using siRNAs and pharmacological inhibitors targeting these two pathways. In the in vivo studies, ORX rats were randomly assigned to groups that were administered vehicle or testosterone (125 mg⋅kg- 1 ⋅week- 1) for 5 weeks, and plasma testosterone concentrations were determined using ELISA. Cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated by measuring well-characterized hypertrophy markers. Moreover, western blotting was used to assess CaMKII and phospholamban (PLN) phosphorylation, and MEF 2 C and AR protein levels in extracts of left-ventricle tissue from control and testosterone-treated ORX rats. Whereas testosterone treatment increased the phosphorylation levels of CaMKII (Thr 286) and phospholambam (PLN) (Thr 17) in cardiac myocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, testosterone-induced MEF 2 activity and cardiac myocyte hypertrophy were prevented upon inhibition of CaMKII, MEF 2 C, and AR signaling pathways. Notably, in the hypertrophied hearts obtained from testosterone-administered ORX rats, both CaMKII and <b>PLN</b> phosphorylation <b>levels</b> and AR and MEF 2 protein levels were increased. Thus, this study presents the first evidence indicating that testosterone activates MEF 2 through CaMKII and AR signaling. Our findings suggest that an orchestrated mechanism of action involving signal transduction and transcription pathways underlies testosterone-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|Personal {{learning}} environments (PLEs) and personal learning networks (PLNs) are well-known concepts. A personal learning network cluster {{is a small}} group of people who regularly interact academically and whose PLNs have a non-empty intersection that includes all the other members. At university <b>level</b> <b>PLN</b> clusters form spontaneously among students and are known to last over an extended period of time. Little is known regarding the workings of these PLN clusters of students. The claim is that these PLN clusters are at the heart of student learning and are aligned with the current trend of a knowledge-pull community of learning. In this paper we investigate the activities and characteristics of PLN clusters in two different fields of study at a South African university, namely mathematics and computer science. We discuss the benefits that these clusters offer, investigate the mashup of activities and tools and we contrast experiences in the two fields of study. It is the commonalities rather than differences that are striking between the two groups of students. Although computer science students lean more towards digital communication, both groups impress with the pride they take in their PLN clusters and are vocal in describing the benefits that these clusters offer.

40|$|Background. The {{subclinical}} pathophysiology of proliferative {{lupus nephritis}} (PLN) {{has not been}} fully elucidated. Myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) is associated with <b>PLN,</b> but prediagnostic <b>levels</b> have not been reported. Methods. We performed a retrospective case-control Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) study comparing MPO-ANCA levels in longitudinal prediagnostic serum samples for 23 biopsy confirmed proliferative lupus nephritis (PLN) patients to DoDSR identified age, sex, race, and age of serum matched healthy and SLE without LN disease controls. We also compared the temporal relationship of MPO-ANCA to anti-double stranded DNA antibodies (dsDNAab). Results. A greater proportion of PLN patients had prediagnostic MPO-ANCA levels above ≥ 3 [*]U/mL and ≥ 6 [*]U/mL compared to SLE without LN (91 % versus 43 %, p< 0. 001; 57 % versus 5 %, p< 0. 001, resp.). In subgroup analysis, the MPO-ANCA threshold of ≥ 3 [*]U/mL was significant at < 1 year (88 % versus 39 %, p= 0. 007) and 1 – 4 years (87 % versus 38 %, p= 0. 009) prior to diagnosis. Statistically significant subclinical MPO-ANCA levels (≥ 3 [*]U/mL) occurred prior to statistically significant dsDNAab ≥ 3 [*]IU/ml (89 % versus 11 %, p= 0. 003). Conclusions. Subclinical MPO-ANCA levels could distinguish future PLN from SLE without LN. MPO-ANCA manifests prior to clinical disease and subclinical dsDNAab {{to suggest that it}} may contribute directly to PLN pathogenicity...|$|R
40|$|IgE and IgG 2 a {{antibody}} {{production and}} interferon (IFN) -gamma secretion were studied in rats {{infected with the}} gut nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis by in vitro cultivation of mononuclear cells obtained from spleen (SPL), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and pulmonary hilar lymph nodes (<b>PLN).</b> The highest <b>levels</b> of IgE were detected in the culture supernatants of MLN cells after infection: IgE levels were modest in PLN and negligible in SPL. In contrast, {{the highest levels of}} IgG 2 a were produced by PLN cells, followed by MLN and SPL cells. These results indicate that the MLN is the most significant site for IgE production in nematode infection, while IgG 2 a production is more marked in PLN. In naive rats, the spontaneous secretion of IFN-gamma was highest in PLN cells, followed by MLN and SPL cells. After the infection, IFN-gamma levels were significantly decreased in MLN and PLN. Suppression of IFN-gamma secretion was also observed in concanavalin A (ConA) -stimulated MLN and PLN cells from infected rats. In MLN, the ratio of CD 4 + to CD 8 + T cells was increased after the infection. Stimulation with an allergen-rich, excretory-secretory (ES) substance of the nematode enhanced ongoing IgE production, and suppressed IFN-gamma secretion by MLN and PLN cells. In contrast, an allergen-poor, adult worm extract potentiated IFN-gamma secretion. These results show that nematode-induced IgE antibody response is associated with the suppressed production and/or secretion of IFN-gamma, particularly in the MLN, and that some molecules in the ES substance may trigger these immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Background. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to review the prognosis and the predictors of renal outcome in patients with membranous lupus nephropathy (MLN) with no or mild mesangial proliferation. Methods. The medical records of patients (ns 66) with biopsy-proven MLN, WHO class VA, and class VB without any past history of proliferative lupus nephropathy (PLN) were reviewed retrospectively. Results. The mean follow-up was 6. 9 " 0. 2 years and renal survival at 5 and 10 years was 97 " 2 and 88 " 6 %. Twenty-nine patients underwent a second renal biopsy during follow-up. Fourteen of these patients (21 %) had lesions of PLN. Among them, four reached end-stage renal disease (ESRD) despite immunosuppressive treatment. The probability of a transition from MLN to PLN at 10 years was 35 " 8 %. Two other patients reached ESRD but did not have repeat renal biopsies and two had biopsy-proven progression to fibrosis. Independent risk factors associated with the doub-ling of creatinine were transition into PLN and the occurrence of a thrombosis during follow-up. The only predictor of ESRD was the haemoglobin <b>level.</b> <b>PLN</b> was not a predictor of ESRD but the efficient treat-ment of this form of lupus nephritis prevented that outcome. Conclusions. With a long follow-up, our study noted a high frequency of transition into PLN in a large cohort of patients with MLN. Steroid usage was not predictive of outcome and did not affect renal survival, a result that must be qualified in light of the highly variable duration of treatments with steroids. The early screening and treatment of PLN is the main benefit of the close follow-up of patients with MLN. Progression to ESRD with only fibrosis remains a rare event...|$|R
40|$|Heart {{failure is}} {{characterized}} by deficiencies in Ca 2 + regulation linked to contraction/relaxation of the affected ventricles and the single cardiac myocytes. Central players of cardiomyocytes Ca 2 + regulation are the Ca-ATPase (SERCA 2 a) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and its negative modulator protein Phospholamban (PLN). The function of the latter two SR proteins {{has been found to}} be critically dysregulated in failing hearts. Therefore, targeting the expression and function of the SERCA 2 a-PLB system by novel gene therapeutic approaches is currently a hot topic in cardiovascular research. In the present work different adenovirale (AdV) and adeno-associated-virus-(AAV) vectors expressing PLN-shRNAs in cardiomyocytes were constructed and tested for their silencing PLN potential. The ultimate goal of this RNA interference approaches was to develop a strategy for improving the Ca 2 +-transporting activity of the SR Ca 2 + pump in settings of heart failure. Initially an almost complete PLN gene silencing could be achieved in primary neonatale rat cardiomyocytes (CM) using the adenovirale vector AdshPLNr. Already with a low vector dose a clear decline of the PLN mRNA expression was observed which was linked to subsequent suppressed PLN protein expression. The silencing affect of this PLN-shRNA was highly specific as verified by the unchanged protein level of other proteins involved in cardiac Ca 2 + regulation. The functional consequence of PLN silencing was an increase Ca 2 + - affinity of the SR Ca 2 + ATPase. In order to use PLN-shRNA for treatment in chronic heart failure in animal models different self complementary (sc) AAV 6 -vector constructs with distinct heart muscle cell tropism were developed. A systematic characterization of these constructs in cell cultures showed a high silencing effectiveness. It was also found that inclusion of an additional polymerase II promoter-depending GFP expression cassette into the viral vector genome reduced both the expression of shPLNr and the silencing efficacy of the respective vector. One out of three extensively characterized scAAV-shPLNr vectors turned out to exhibit the most effective PLN silencing activity. The genomic length of this vector was approx. 1 kb. It did not contain other expression cassettes. The degree of reduction of <b>PLN</b> mRNA <b>levels</b> in cultures neonatal rat cardiomyocytes caused by this vector was similar to the previously characterized AdshPLNr vector. In addition, the PLN-shRNA expressing vector genome was also packed into an AAV 9 capsid. The therapeutic potential of the latter vector was examined in settings of experimental chronic heart failure due to pressure-overload heart hypertrophy in rats. Hemodynamic, echocardiographic as well as morphological examinations in this model revealed for the first time that PLN gene silencing after treatment with scAAV-shPLNr - but also with either AdshPLNr - improved the contractile dysfunctions of the hypertrophied rat hearts and prolonged the survival time of the animals with pressure-overload heart hypertrophy. Furthermore, the applied viral vectors apparently modulated the expression levels of certain microRNAs linked to pathological cardiac hypertrophy. They caused a normalization of the microRNA expression level in comparison to hypertrophied CM controls. Thus, this work shows that the investigated scAAV-vector-based RNA-interference technology is a novel and promising gene therapeutic approach for the treatment of chronic heart failure...|$|R
