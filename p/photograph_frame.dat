60|$|Dulcie {{turned to}} the dresser to get her handkerchief; and then she stopped still, and bit her underlip hard. While looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself, a princess, just {{awakening}} from a long slumber. She had forgotten one that was watching her with sad, beautiful, stern eyes--the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did. Straight and slender and tall, {{with a look of}} sorrowful reproach on his handsome, melancholy face, General Kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt <b>photograph</b> <b>frame</b> on the dresser.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} Brooke {{was off to}} the carpenter's shop. Hence the earnest, {{thoughtful}} expression. His mind was wrestling with certain pieces of wood which he proposed to fashion into <b>photograph</b> <b>frames.</b> There was always a steady demand in the school for <b>photograph</b> <b>frames,</b> and the gifted were {{in the habit of}} turning here and there an honest penny by means of them.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, Howard, {{it is such}} a dear house. I had no {{idea that}} so much could be done with so narrow a front. It's all French, with mirrors and big white panels and satin chairs and sofas, and a carved gilt piano that she got for nothing from a dealer she knows; and church candlesticks. The mirrors give it the effect of being larger than it really is. I've only two criticisms to make: it's too far from Fifth Avenue, and one can {{scarcely}} turn around in it without knocking something down--a <b>photograph</b> <b>frame</b> or a flower vase or one of her spindle-legged chairs. It was only a hideous, old-fashioned stone front when she bought it. I suppose nobody but Reggie Farwell could have made anything out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the marble}} {{of the bureau}} amidst a litter of toilet articles, and bought by Lise for a quarter at the Bagatelle bargain counter, was an oval <b>photograph</b> <b>frame</b> from which the silver wash had begun to rub off, and the band of purple velvet inside the metal had whitened. The frame always {{contained}} the current object of Lise's affections, though the exhibits--as Janet said--were subject to change without notice. The Adonis who now reigned had black hair cut in the prevailing Hampton fashion, very long in front and hanging down over his eyes like a Scottish terrier's; very long behind, too, but ending suddenly, shaved in a careful curve at the neck and around the ears. It had almost {{the appearance of a}} Japanese wig. The manly beauty of Mr. Max Wylie was of the lantern-jawed order, and in his photograph he conveyed the astonished and pained air of one who has been suddenly seized by an invisible officer of the law from behind. This effect, one presently perceived, was due to the high, stiff collar, the [...] "Torture Brand," [...] Janet called it, when she and her sister were engaged in one of their frequent controversies about life in general: the obvious retort to this remark, which Lise never failed to make, was that Janet could boast of no beaux at all.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Massy's stateroom--a narrow, one-berth cabin--smelt {{strongly}} of soap, {{and presented}} {{to view a}} swept, dusted, unadorned neatness, not so much bare as barren, not so much severe as starved and lacking in humanity, like the ward of a public hospital, or rather (owing to the small size) like the clean retreat of a desperately poor but exemplary person. Not a single <b>photograph</b> <b>frame</b> ornamented the bulkheads; not a single article of clothing, {{not as much as}} a spare cap, hung from the brass hooks. All the inside was painted in one plain tint of pale blue; two big sea-chests in sailcloth covers and with iron padlocks fitted exactly in the space under the bunk. One glance was enough to embrace all the strip of scrubbed planks within the four unconcealed corners. The absence of the usual settee was striking; the teak-wood top of the washing-stand seemed hermetically closed, and so was the lid of the writing-desk, which protruded from the partition {{at the foot of the}} bed-place, containing a mattress as thin as a pancake under a threadbare blanket with a faded red stripe, and a folded mosquito-net against the nights spent in harbor. There was not a scrap of paper anywhere in sight, no boots on the floor, no litter of any sort, not a speck of dust anywhere; no traces of pipe-ash even, which, in a heavy smoker, was morally revolting, like a manifestation of extreme hypocrisy; and the bottom of the old wooden arm-chair (the only seat there), polished with much use, shone as if its shabbiness had been waxed. The screen of leaves on the bank, passing as if unrolled endlessly in the round opening of the port, sent a wavering network of light and shade into the place.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} chorus, Lovato begins {{to find more}} strength—represented by the one shot showing her {{standing}} inside a <b>photograph</b> <b>frame.</b> In the bridge, the glass box, with the heart inside, is hit, and the surface breaks. That is followed by more scenes Lovato walking over the broken glass, and as the song fades, the last scene is closes in on Lovato's face.|$|E

40|$|This photo essay updates {{research}} previously {{presented in}} Visual Communication Quarterly about news characterizations of a “Black neighborhood” in Iowa City, Iowa. Shot by preschoolers in the city's Southeast Side, {{the images in}} this essay—peppered with the inadvertent appearance of the photographers' fingers—added to an artistic value that cast life there being other than dangerous, dark, and devious. Whereas hands can often be used to conceal, the fingers in these <b>photographs</b> <b>frame</b> special and specific glimpses of life, ultimately presenting a counternarrative to neighborhood characterizations constructed by news photographs...|$|R
50|$|Ironically, early {{into its}} introduction, the cabinet card {{ushered in the}} {{temporary}} demise of the photographic album which had come into existence commercially with the carte de visite. Photographers began employing artists to retouch photographs by altering the negative before making the print to hide facial defects revealed by the new format. Small stands and <b>photograph</b> <b>frames</b> for the table top replaced the heavy photograph album. Photo album manufacturers responded by producing albums with pages primarily for cabinet cards with a few pages in the back reserved for the old family carte de visite prints.|$|R

Her presents were installed, the pictures and <b>photograph</b> <b>frames</b> and chairs, even Mr. Isham's dining-room table and Cousin Eleanor's piano. The sight of these, and of the engraving which Aunt Mary had sent on, and which all her childhood had hung over her bed in the little room at home, brought the tears once more to her eyes. But she forced them back bravely.|$|R
