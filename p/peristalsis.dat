5|$|Bayliss and Starling {{had also}} used {{vivisection}} on anaesthetized dogs to discover <b>peristalsis</b> in 1899. They {{went on to}} discover {{a variety of other}} important physiological phenomena and principles, many of which were based on their experimental work involving animal vivisection.|$|E
5|$|Order Paleonemertea. Comprises 100 marine species. Their body wall has outer {{circular}} {{and inner}} length-wise muscles. In addition, Carinoma tremaphoros has circular and inner length-wise {{muscles in the}} epidermis; the extra muscle layers seem to be needed for burrowing by <b>peristalsis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. In fish, {{the esophagus}} is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular <b>peristalsis.</b> In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating <b>peristalsis.</b> The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing <b>peristalsis</b> and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with <b>peristalsis,</b> the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by <b>peristalsis</b> into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans {{generally}} move slowly, {{though they}} have occasionally been documented to successfully prey on spiders or insects. Most nemerteans use their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime, some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular <b>peristalsis,</b> and have powerful muscles. Some species of the suborder Monostilifera, whose proboscis have one active stylet, move by extending the proboscis, sticking it to an object and pulling the animal towards the object.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with <b>peristalsis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in <b>peristalsis</b> of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by <b>peristalsis</b> and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} {{persistence of}} symptoms after surgical bypass {{can be traced}} to the remaining prominence of reversed <b>peristalsis</b> in contrast to direct <b>peristalsis,</b> although the precipitating factor (the duodenal compression) has been bypassed or relieved. Reversed <b>peristalsis</b> has been shown to respond to duodenal circular drainage—a complex and invasive open surgical procedure originally implemented and performed in China.|$|E
25|$|Visceral: these muscles {{surround}} the tubes and ducts and produce <b>peristalsis</b> {{as demonstrated in}} the digestive system.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{multiple}} case reports, {{there has}} been controversy surrounding the diagnosis and even the existence of SMA syndrome since symptoms do not always correlate well with radiologic findings, and may not always improve following surgical correction. However, {{the reason for the}} persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms even after surgical correction in some cases has been traced to the remaining prominence of reversed <b>peristalsis</b> in contrast to direct <b>peristalsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other animals move in {{terrestrial}} habitats {{without the aid}} of legs. Earthworms crawl by a <b>peristalsis,</b> the same rhythmic contractions that propel food through the digestive tract.|$|E
25|$|Barium {{fluoroscopic}} examinations {{have some}} advantages over computed tomography and magnetic resonance techniques, such as higher spatial resolution {{and the ability}} to examine bowel <b>peristalsis</b> and distension in real time.|$|E
25|$|Muscularis mucosae – a {{thin layer}} of smooth muscle that aids the passing of {{material}} and enhances the interaction between the epithelial layer and the contents of the lumen by agitation and <b>peristalsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The stomatedeum and proctodeum are invaginations of the {{epidermis}} and {{are lined}} with cuticle (intima). The mesenteron is not lined with cuticle but with rapidly dividing and therefore constantly replaced, epithelial cells. The cuticle sheds with every moult along with the exoskeleton. Food is moved down the gut by muscular contractions called <b>peristalsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Between the two muscle layers is the myenteric plexus. This {{controls}} <b>peristalsis.</b> Activity is {{initiated by}} the pacemaker cells, (myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal). The gut has intrinsic peristaltic activity (basal electrical rhythm) due to its self-contained enteric nervous system. The rate can be modulated {{by the rest of}} the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|In {{humans and}} many other animals, the stomach is located between the {{oesophagus}} and the small intestine. It secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion. The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum where <b>peristalsis</b> takes over to move this {{through the rest of}} the intestines.|$|E
25|$|The whole human GI tract {{is about}} nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy. It is {{considerably}} shorter {{in the living}} body because the intestines, which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone, somewhat like a Slinky that maintains itself in a halfway-tense state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention, <b>peristalsis,</b> and so on.|$|E
25|$|Some animals {{move through}} solids such as soil by {{burrowing}} using <b>peristalsis,</b> as in earthworms, or other methods. In loose solids such as sand some animals, {{such as the}} golden mole, marsupial mole, and the pink fairy armadillo, are able to move more rapidly, 'swimming' through the loose substrate. Burrowing animals include moles, ground squirrels, naked mole-rats, tilefish, and mole crickets.|$|E
25|$|The coordinated contractions {{of these}} layers is called <b>peristalsis</b> and propels the food through the tract. Food in the GI tract {{is called a}} bolus (ball of food) from the mouth down to the stomach. After the stomach, the food is {{partially}} digested and semi-liquid, and {{is referred to as}} chyme. In the large intestine the remaining semi-solid substance is referred to as faeces.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it. As the waste material exits the small intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum {{and then to the}} ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. The unwanted waste material is moved upwards toward the transverse colon by the action of <b>peristalsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{tongue is}} {{skeletal}} muscle {{on the floor}} of the mouth that manipulates food for chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition). It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva. The underside of the tongue is covered with a smooth mucous membrane. The tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing. The tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through <b>peristalsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Complications {{of ovarian}} cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, {{progressive}} function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites {{are the most common}} proximate cause of death. Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the intestinal lumen, or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal <b>peristalsis.</b> Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, food enters {{the mouth and}} mechanical digestion of the food starts {{by the action of}} mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be {{in the form of a}} small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of <b>peristalsis.</b> Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by <b>peristalsis,</b> which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Differentiation between {{proximal}} enteritis {{and small}} intestinal obstruction {{is important to}} ensure correct treatment, and can be assisted {{with the help of}} ultrasound. Horses with small intestinal obstruction will usually have an intestinal diameter of -10nbsp&cm with a wall thickness of 3-5mm. Horses with proximal enteritis usually have an intestinal diameter that is narrower, but wall thickness is often greater than 6mm, containing a hyperechoic or anechoic fluid, with normal, increased, or decreased <b>peristalsis.</b> However, obstructions that have been present for some time may present with thickened walls and distention of the intestine.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation along any {{portion of}} the GI tract can lead to colic. This leads to pain and {{possibly}} stasis of <b>peristalsis</b> (Ileus), which can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. This is a functional rather than mechanical blockage of the intestine, but like the mechanical blockage seen with simple obstructions, it can have serious effects including severe dehydration. Inflammation of the bowel may lead to increased permeability and subsequent endotoxemia. The underlying cause of inflammation {{may be due to}} infection, toxin, or trauma, and may require special treatment in order to resolve the colic.|$|E
25|$|Like {{loperamide}} {{and other}} opioids, morphine acts on the myenteric plexus in the intestinal tract, reducing gut motility, causing constipation. The gastrointestinal effects of morphine are mediated primarily by μ-opioid receptors in the bowel. By inhibiting gastric emptying and reducing propulsive <b>peristalsis</b> of the intestine, morphine decreases {{the rate of}} intestinal transit. Reduction in gut secretion and increased intestinal fluid absorption {{also contribute to the}} constipating effect. Opioids also may act on the gut indirectly through tonic gut spasms after inhibition of nitric oxide generation. This effect was shown in animals when a nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine, reversed morphine-induced changes in gut motility.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam therapy, {{compared}} with other drug therapies, increases risk of death when used for intractable epilepsy {{in an analysis of}} 302 patients. The risk of death from nitrazepam therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with intractable epilepsy. In older children (above 3.4 years), the tendency appears to be reversed in this study. Nitrazepam may cause sudden death in children. It can cause swallowing incoordination, high-peaked esophageal <b>peristalsis,</b> bronchospasm, delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation, and severe respiratory distress necessitating ventilatory support in children. Nitrazepam may promote the development of parasympathetic overactivity or vagotonia, leading to potentially fatal respiratory distress in children.|$|E
25|$|Anatomical {{barriers}} include physical, {{chemical and}} biological barriers. The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that is impermeable to most infectious agents, acting as {{the first line of}} defense against invading organisms. Desquamation (shedding) of skin epithelium also helps remove bacteria and other infectious agents that have adhered to the epithelial surfaces. Lack of blood vessels and inability of the epidermis to retain moisture, presence of sebaceous glands in the dermis provides an environment unsuitable for the survival of microbes. In the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, movement due to <b>peristalsis</b> or cilia, respectively, helps remove infectious agents. Also, mucus traps infectious agents. The gut flora can prevent the colonization of pathogenic bacteria by secreting toxic substances or by competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients or attachment to cell surfaces. The flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestinal}} volvulus {{is thought}} to be caused by a change in local <b>peristalsis,</b> or due to a lesion that the mesentery may twist around (such as an ascarid impaction), and usually involves the distal jejunum and ileum.w It {{is one of the most}} common causes of small intestinal obstruction in foals, possibly because of a sudden change to a bulkier foodstuff. Animals present with acute and severe signs of colic, and multiple distended loops of small intestine, usually seen radiographically in a foal. Small intestinal volvulus often occurs secondary to another disease process in adult horses, where small intestinal obstruction causes distention and then rotation around the root of the mesentery. Surgery is required to resect nonviable sections of bowel, and prognosis is correlated to the length of bowel involved, with animals with greater than 50% of small intestinal involvement having a grave prognosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the stomach through the oesophagus via the lower oesophageal sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin) and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria {{and provides the}} acidic pH of 2 for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called <b>peristalsis</b> – reducing {{the volume of the}} fundus, before looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme within anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours. The average human stomach can comfortably hold about a litre of food.|$|E
25|$|An earthworm's {{digestive}} system {{consists of a}} mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in {{the walls of the}} gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By <b>peristalsis,</b> the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as <b>peristalsis</b> in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E
25|$|An upper {{gastrointestinal}} series, {{also called}} an upper gastrointestinal study or contrast radiography {{of the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, {{is a series of}} radiographs used to examine the gastrointestinal tract for abnormalities. A contrast medium, usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate mixed with water, is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract, and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest. The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film. This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine such that the inside wall lining, size, shape, contour, and patency are visible to the examiner. With fluoroscopy, it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing, <b>peristalsis,</b> or sphincter closure. Depending on the organs to be examined, barium radiographs can be classified into barium swallow, barium meal, barium follow-through, and enteroclysis (small bowel enema). To further enhance the quality of images, air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium, and this procedure is called double-contrast imaging. In this case the gas {{is referred to as the}} negative contrast medium. Traditionally the images produced with barium contrast are made with plain-film radiography, but computed tomography is also used in combination with barium contrast, in which case the procedure is called CT enterography.|$|E
