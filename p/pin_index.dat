Oxygen and other gases were compressed and stored at high pressure in seamless containers constructed from hand-forged steel in 1880. Materials technology has continued to evolve and now medical gas cylinders are generally made of steel alloys or aluminum. The filling pressure as well as capacity has increased considerably while at the same time the weight of cylinders has reduced. Today oxygen cylinder of equivalent size holds a third more oxygen but weighs about 20 kg less. The cylinders are of varying sizes and are color coded. They are tested at regular intervals by the manufacturer using hydraulic, impact, and tensile tests. The top end of the cylinder is fitted with a valve with a variety of number and markings stamped on it. Common valve types include: <b>Pin</b> <b>index</b> valve, bull nose, hand wheel and integral valve. The type of valve varies with cylinder size. Small cylinders have a <b>pin</b> <b>index</b> valve while large have a bull nose type.

40|$|Abstract—Energy {{efficiency}} {{has become}} {{a very important issue}} to be addressed in today’s system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. One way to lower power consumption is to reduce the supply voltage. Multisupply voltage (MSV) is thus introduced to provide flexibility in controlling the power and performance tradeoff. In region-based MSV, circuits are partitioned into “voltage islands” where each island occupies a contiguous physical space and operates at one voltage level. These tasks of island partitioning and voltage level assignment should be done simultaneously in the floorplanning process in order to take those important physical information into consideration. In this paper, we consider this core-based voltage island driven floorplanning problem including islands with power down mode, and propose a method to solve it. Given a candidate floorplan solution represented by a normalized Polish expression, we are able to obtain optimal voltage assignment and island partitioning (including islands with power down mode) simultaneously to minimize the total power consumption. Simulated annealing is used as the basic searching engine. By using this approach, we can achieve significant power saving (up to 50 %) for all datasets, without any significant increase in area and wire length. We compared our approach with the most updated previous work on the same problem, and results show that our approach is much more efficient and is able to save more power in most cases. We have also studied two other approaches to solve the same problem, a simple dynamic programming approach and a lowest possible power consumption approach. Experimental results show that ours can perform the best among these three approaches. Our floorplanner can also be extended to minimize the number of level shifters, to address a minVdd version of the problem and to simplify the power routing step by placing islands close to their corresponding power <b>pins.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Floorplanning, low power, voltage island, voltage scaling.

Information asymmetry can seriously affect firm performance on the stock exchange and firms with a poor informational environment can lose the interest of investors. Reducing information asymmetry can have an important effect on firm performance on the stock exchange. Firms may lack a clear informational environment in the market because of the emerging conditions governing the Tehran Stock Exchange. Because larger and more active firms on the Tehran Stock Exchange provide more information, measuring the informational environment of these firms provides an overview of information asymmetry. The present study calculated the information asymmetry in these firms using the <b>PIN</b> and FE <b>indices.</b> The inconsistent results provided by these indices prompted the authors to offer a new index that is a composite of the PIN and FE that can better explain information asymmetry in developing market such as Asian stock markets.

40|$|Abstract—AA 5083 {{aluminium}} alloy has gathered wide acceptance in the fabrication of light weight structures requiring a high {{strength to weight}} ratio. Compared to the fusion welding processes that are routinely used for joining structural {{aluminium alloy}}s, friction stir welding (FSW) process is an emerging solid state joining {{process in which the}} material that is being welded does not melt and recast. This process uses a non-consumable tool to generate frictional heat in the abutting surfaces. The welding parameters and tool pin profile play major roles in deciding the weld quality. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to understand the effect of tool speed (rpm) and tool pin profile on Friction Stir Processing (FSP) zone formation in AA 5083 aluminium alloy. Friction stir welding between 5083 aluminium alloy plates with a thickness of 2. 5 mm was performed. Five different tool pin profiles (straight cylindrical, tapered cylindrical, triangular, square and cone) have been used to fabricate the joints at three different rotational speeds i. e. 900, 1400 and 1800 rpm under a constant traverse speed of 16 mm/min. The formation of FSP zone has been analysed macroscopically. Tensile properties of the joints have been evaluated and correlated with the FSP zone formation. From this investigation it has been found that the tool pin profiled designs had little effect on heat input and tensile properties, weld properties were dominated by thermal input rather than the mechanical deformation by the tool for the plate thickness of 2. 5 mm. straight cylindrical pin profiled tool produces mechanically sound and metallurgically defect free welds compared to other tool <b>pin</b> profiles. <b>Index</b> Terms — AA 5083 aluminium alloy, friction stir welding, macrostructure, micro-hardness, tensile properties, tool pin profile I...|$|R

As it was a closed fracture with intramedullary pin pre-fixed into {{the fractured}} bone, the fracture was considered stable and no additional post-operative external supportive bandage was required. The dissected tibiae were collected from both the induced- facture and non-fracture limb (control). Five (n[*]=[*] 5) rats were sacrificed at each time point, namely at 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, and 6 th week post-surgery. Gross callus index and callus area size were determined from the dissected fracture tibiae and the control (Greiff, 1978; Otto et al., 1995; Eastaugh-Waring et al., 2009; Aurégan et al., 2013).

40|$|BACKGROUND Left {{ventricular}} (LV) diastolic dysfunction (DD) {{associated with}} a preserved ejection fraction (EF) is a frequent alteration in hypertensive patients, usually considered an impairment of the diastolic phase alone. However, because systole and diastole are strictly correlated to one another, {{it is possible that}} hypertensive patients with isolated DID may also present with initial abnormalities of LV systolic properties, particularly those presenting with a more severe degree of DID. We performed a multiparametric echocardiographic assessment of LV systolic properties in patients without cardiovascular diseases, with preserved EF and different degrees of DID. METHODS We evaluated 1, 073 hypertensive subjects showing EF > 55 % and no overt heart disease. RESULTS A total of 362 patients had normal diastolic function (N), 609 displayed delayed relaxation pattern (DR), and 102 presented a pseudonormal filling pattern (PN). Albeit most of the subjects with DID (DR, <b>PIN)</b> had systolic <b>indexes</b> within normal range, they presented a significant reduction of index stroke volume (SV) (P < 0. 0001) and stroke work (SW) (P < 0. 0001), EF (P < 0. 01), midwall shortening (MFS) (P < 0. 0001), circumferential end-systolic stress-corrected MFS (cESS-MFS) (P < 0. 001), and tissue Doppler (TD) systolic velocity (P < 0. 0001) as compared to the N group, particularly the PN group. After adjustments, the reductions of LV systolic indexes were still significantly related to DID, particularly to PN. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest a relation between LV systolic and diastolic properties in patients with normal EF. They also highlight the early onset of a preclinical reduction of systolic properties in patients with "isolated" DID, which is related to the degree of dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Membrane compositions, {{particularly}} of mitochondria, could be critical {{factors in the}} mechanisms of growth and aging processes, especially during phases of high oxidative stress that result in molecular damage. In the present study, liver and mitochondrial membrane phospholipid (PL) compositions were analyzed in rainbow trout during its four first years of life, a period characterized by rapid growth and high oxidative stress. Specifically, farmed fish of three ages (1 -, 2 - and 4 -years) were studied, and PL compositions of whole liver and liver mitochondria, and fatty acid compositions of individual PL classes were determined. Liver mitochondrial membranes showed a PL composition different {{to that of the}} whole tissue suggesting adaptation of cell and subcellular membranes to specific functions. Individual PL had characteristic fatty acid compositions that were similar in whole liver and mitochondrial membranes. Whole liver and mitochondria showed increased lipid peroxidation with age along with changes in membrane PL fatty acid compositions. Most PL classes showed similar changes in fatty acid composition among the age groups, with reduced proportions of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and, generally, concomitantly increased levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, which together resulted in reduced peroxidation <b>index</b> (<b>PIn).</b> However, total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content did not change significantly with age due to increased eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and, in most PL, increased n− 6 PUFA. These results suggest there may be oxidation of PL DHA with compensatory mechanisms to maintain membrane fluidity and function. However, modification of fatty acid composition of specific PLs, such as cardiolipin, could affect the electron transport chain efficiency and propagate the oxidative reaction throughout the cell. In addition, both the content and fatty acid composition of sphingomyelin, which has been suggested as a possible mediator of cell dysfunction and apoptosis, changed with age differently to the other PL classes. Moreover, these changes showed different trends between mitochondria and whole liver. These data suggest there is marked oxidative stress associated with rapid growth and maturation in rainbow trout. Changes observed in membrane lipids point to their possible participation in the processes involved in this species response to oxidative stress and damage accumulation rate...|$|R
