5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely <b>pubescent</b> spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E
5|$|The Sunrise Dance Ceremony is not {{an ancient}} Yavapai ceremony. Apache and Yavapai often intermarried and adopted {{elements}} of each other's cultures; these two tribes reside together on the Camp Verde and Fort McDowell reservations. The Sunrise Dance is a four-day rite-of-transition for young Apache girls, which typically takes place from March through October. The sunrise dance is an ancient practice, unique to the Apache. It {{is related to the}} myth of the Changing Woman, a powerful figure in Apache culture who is believed to grant longevity. The power of Changing Woman is transferred to the <b>pubescent</b> girl through songs sung by the Medicine Man. A medicine man is joined by other tribal members in singing a series of songs, up to 32 which are believed to have first been sung by Changing Woman.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} socio-demographic characteristics of <b>pubescents</b> living in poor families and the relationships between these characteristics and hopelessness and submissive acts. The sample of the study consists of 280 <b>pubescents,</b> who are living in poor families and attending high schools placing in Adana city Yuregir district during fall semester of 2008. 164 students in the sample are female and 116 students are male. Data is collected from “Socio-demographic Level Scale”, “Beck Hopelessness Scale” and “Submissive Acts Scale”. For statistical analysis, t-test, one way variance analysis (ANOVA), correlation analysis and LSD test are used. At the end of the study, following results are determined: Girls have more submissive acts than boys and boys are more hopeless than girls; the <b>pubescents</b> not born in Adana have more submissive acts and hopelessness than the <b>pubescents</b> born in Adana; there is no significant relationship between submissive acts and age, but there is significant relationship between hopelessness level and age; the <b>pubescents</b> living in low-income families are more hopeless than others; the number of individuals in family is an effective variable only for hopelessness, thus the hopelessness increases with the number of individuals in family; there is no significant difference between the students’ submissive acts and between their hopelessness based on their families’ income levels and jobs; a significant but low relationship at. 01 level is found between hopelessness and submissive acts. <br /...|$|R

The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are <b>pubescent</b> (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E

40|$|My {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} concerned with {{quality of life in}} Children´s homes for children from 10 to 18 years old in Zlín region. In a theoretical part, it deals with a division and characteristics of target group of <b>pubescents</b> and adolescents and describes children's basic needs and needs as such. Moreover, it describes also quality of life, health and circadian rhythms connected to quality of life, institutional care and Children´s home and Children´s home with a school, which fall into institutional care. This thesis briefly mentions a history of Children´s homes and also those in a Zlin region. Furthermore, it focuses on risks of institutional care, deprivation syndrome and also on related subdeprivation. General target of this thesis is to discover quality of life of children living in a Children´s home. Specific target is to discover those children's quality of life in particular fields of quality of life, such as health, satisfaction, and circadian typology. In order to find out data, I used adjusted and translated standardized questionnaire Cummins (1997) ComQoL-S 5 and few questions were selected from circadian typology CIT Harada, Krejčí questionnaire. Considering extensiveness of the questionnaire, only some fields of life were selected for an evaluation, such as health, satisfaction, and circadian typology according to which was quality of life evaluated. Results show that quality of life, concerning health and satisfaction, is the same and positive concerning <b>pubescents</b> and adolescents. Children aged between 10 - 18 evaluate their field of satisfaction as positive. Regarding circadian typology, <b>pubescents</b> incline to an evening type...|$|R
25|$|The {{definition}} of the onset of puberty may depend on perspective (e.g., hormonal versus physical) and purpose (establishing population normal standards, clinical care of early or late <b>pubescent</b> individuals, etc.). A common definition for the onset of puberty is physical changes to a person's body. These physical changes are the first visible signs of neural, hormonal, and gonadal function changes.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about {{pollination}} in Bifrenaria. Apparently the only existing records report the presence of some large species' pollinia observed {{on the back of}} male Eufriesea violacea bees (Euglossinae), and of Bombus brasiliensis (Bombini). Although there are no reports of flower pollination being directly observed, a paper published in 2006 studied the micromorphology of the labellum in Bifrenaria species, looking for substances useful to insects as food. The absence of such substances on the densely <b>pubescent</b> surface of most Bifrenaria labelli seems to indicate possible pollination by large bees as the major mean. Another indicator of this possibility is the strong smell emanated by species like B. tetragona which {{are similar to those of}} plants in other families which are also pollinated by these bees. The smaller <b>pubescent</b> species may be pollinated by smaller bees, while the smooth ones, which have strong colored flowers, as B. aureofulva, might be pollinated by hummingbirds.|$|E

25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. <b>Pubescent</b> boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, <b>pubescent</b> boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys {{are more likely to be}} sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.|$|E
25|$|The words pedophile and pedophilia are {{commonly}} used informally to describe an adult's sexual interest in <b>pubescent</b> or post-pubescent teenagers.

Most of the media labeled Foley a pedophile, which led David Tuller of Slate magazine to state that Foley was not a pedophile but rather an ephebophile.|$|E

25|$|It is a {{medium-sized}} to large deciduous tree, growing to 15–25 m (exceptionally to 38 m) tall, with an elliptical crown of moderate density {{with a smooth}} or rounded outline. The bark is a light gray with thick irregular curling ridges; as the tree matures, the bark tends to become plated. The twigs are slender, somewhat shiny, reddish brown. The terminal buds are sharply pointed, brown and <b>pubescent.</b> The leaves are opposite, simple, palmately lobed and veined, 3–9.5cm long and 3.5–11cm broad, with an entire margin and three or five somewhat rounded lobes, and a 2–8cm long petiole. They are green above and paler and <b>pubescent</b> below. In fall they turn orange and yellow. The flowers are regular, pentamerous, and appear on yellow-green corymbs and are quite small. They hang from puberulent pedicels 2.4–5cm long in clusters of a few flowers, appearing before or with the leaves in early spring. This is about two weeks prior to the maturation of the flowers of Acer saccharum. The tree is generally diecious, though they are often also polygamous, that is having bisexual and unisexual flowers on the same individual. The fruit is a paired samara 1.5–3cm long.|$|E

25|$|In popular usage, {{the word}} pedophilia is often applied to any sexual {{interest}} in children or {{the act of}} child sexual abuse. This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse, and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and <b>pubescent</b> or post-pubescent minors. Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse are sometimes pedophiles, child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, and some pedophiles do not molest children.|$|E

50|$|Hebephilia is {{approximate}} in its {{age range}} because the onset and completion of puberty vary. Partly because of this, some definitions of chronophilias (sexual {{preference for a}} specific physiological appearance related to age) show overlap between pedophilia, hebephilia and ephebophilia; for example, the DSM-5 extends the prepubescent age to 13, the ICD-10 includes early pubertal age in its definition of pedophilia, and some definitions of ephebophilia include adolescents aged 14 to late adolescents. On average, girls {{begin the process of}} puberty at age 10 or 11; boys at age 11 or 12, and it is argued that separating sexual attraction to prepubescent children from sexual attraction to early-to-mid or late <b>pubescents</b> is clinically relevant.|$|R
