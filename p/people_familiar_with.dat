25|$|According {{to the art}} {{historian}} Nicholas Allen, {{the image on the}} shroud was formed by a photographic technique in the 13th century.

To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis, in papers published in several science journals, and in a book. Silver bromide is believed by some to have been used for making the Shroud of Turin as it is widely used in photographic films.|$|E

2500|$|At the trial, White's {{defense team}} argued that his mental {{state at the}} time of the killings was one of diminished {{capacity}} due to depression. They argued, therefore, he was not capable of premeditating the killings, and thus was not legally guilty of first-degree murder. Forensic psychiatrist Martin Blinder testified that White was suffering from depression and pointed to several behavioral symptoms of that depression, including the fact that White had gone from being highly health-conscious to consuming sugary foods and drinks. When the prosecution played a recording of White's confession, several jurors wept as they listened to what was described as [...] "a man pushed beyond his endurance". Many <b>people</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> City Hall claimed that it was common to enter through the window to save time. A police officer friend of White claimed to reporters that several officials carried weapons at this time and speculated that White carried the extra ammunition as a habit that police officers had. The jury found White guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than first-degree murder. Outrage within San Francisco's gay community over the resulting seven-year sentence sparked the city's White Night riots; general disdain for the outcome of the court case led to the elimination of California's [...] "diminished capacity" [...] law. Famed psychiatrist and critic of forensic psychiatry, Thomas Szasz, gave a speech to a large audience in San Francisco in June of 1979 calling the White verdict a “travesty of justice” which he blamed on the diminished capacity defense.|$|E

2500|$|According to Kaneda, the {{two teams}} faced a {{delicate}} balancing act when combining the first-person exploration and user-created mapping of dungeons from Etrian Odyssey with the combat and style of the Persona series, as the two were seen as direct opposites. The two teams were fiercely opposed to making compromises on either side, with them eventually settling on choosing the incorporate the closest paralleling elements from both series. When development first started, the team {{were going to use}} the 3D dungeon design and battle system from the Persona series, but as development progressed, it shifted towards the viewpoint and battle system of Etrian Odyssey. An element carried directly from the Etrian Odyssey series was the FOEs, whose behaviors patterns were designed to be unique to each labyrinth's floors and structures. The battle system was based primarily on that used in Etrian Odyssey, with the most recognizable elements from the Persona series added: these included the Persona systems and elements such as [...] "One More Turn" [...] and exploitable weaknesses. The Sub-Persona system was based on the Etrian Odyssey series' subclass system, some stat-reducing spells were a combination of elements from both Persona and Etrian Odyssey, while the [...] "Boost" [...] feature was an entirely new addition suggested by the staff. Persona Q was the first entry in the Persona series to appear on a Nintendo platform, which offered challenges to both teams. The gameplay systems were ultimately created so that <b>people</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> both series would find common appeal, and multiple comprehensive tutorials were added so players would not be confused by the new features.|$|E
