40|$|The {{threat to}} future {{legislation}} regarding fuel consumption and emission {{has forced the}} automotive industry to develop lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles. The two main objectives of this industry are the reduction in car weight and improvement in safety. To achieve this, most of the panels {{that make up the}} car bodies prefer high strength materials coupled with better formability. The performances of conventional high strength steels are not sufficient. It has been found out that bake hardenable steel sheets are an excellent solution to the above problem. These steels offer good formability (low yield strength for good shape fixability) during press operations and also higher final yield strength during paint baking operations for good dent resistance. <b>Paint</b> <b>bake</b> hardening is essentially the strain aging increment found after forming and aging for 20 minutes at 180 °C.

40|$|Aluminium- Magnesium (Al-Mg) alloys {{have very}} good {{formability}} properties and have been used extensively for interior structural components of automotive Body in White (BIW). The alloys in an annealed temper achieve their strength through work hardening mechanism during press forming process. The strengthening mechanism is due to Mg atoms in solid solution exerting dislocation drag during low temperature plastic straining. However at elevated temperatures, high diffusivity of Mg atoms allows easy dislocations rearrangements which lead to reduction of mechanical strength. This phenomenon is called softening.

40|$|The heat treatable AlMgSi alloys are {{regarded}} as medium strength materials with excellent corrosion properties. To achieve enhanced mechanical properties with the aim to expand the application areas, Cu may be added since this causes a refinement in precipitate dispersion and thereby increases strength, hardness and ductility. However, AlMgSi(Cu) alloys become sensitized to intergranular corrosion (IGC) during thermomechanical treatment, presumably due to precipitation of a continuous, Cu rich film along the grain boundaries which has been detected in several studies. Microgalvanic effects arise between the cathodic film and an adjacent, anodic, precipitate free zone. Cold deformation has been suggested as a measure to improve the IGC resistance of AlMgSi alloys, considering that deformation introduces dislocations, alters the microstructure in favorable ways and may change the precipitation process during ageing. The latter is of highly importance as the precipitates give rise to IGC. The objective of this work {{was to assess the}} effect of cold deformation on IGC susceptibility of AlMgSi alloys and obtain {{a better understanding of the}} corrosion mechanism in deformed materials. Four different AlMgSi alloys, 6005. 40, C 28, 6016 A and 6016 B, were subjected to deformation by rolling or stretching either before or after final ageing treatment, that is either pre- or post-deformation. All alloys were aged to T 6 temper, and a set of 6016 samples was also aged to simulate the <b>paint</b> <b>bake</b> cycle in the automotive industry. Vickers hardness measurements were conducted to evaluate the effect of deformation on hardness. Moreover, accelerated IGC testing according to ISO 11846 (method B) was performed on differently deformed and aged samples. Subsequently, the corroded microstructure of all samples was examined in light microscope to evaluate IGC resistance, and additionally, the uncorroded microstructure of 6005. 40 was studied in scanning and transmission electron microscope to assess the effect of deformation on alloy microstructure and precipitate structure. Results revealed that pre-deformation subsequent to solution heat treatment significantly improved IGC resistance, especially in Cu containing alloys, while maintaining good mechanical properties. It was shown by detailed precipitate examinations in transmission electron microscope that more Cu is incorporated into precipitates in pre-deformed materials compared to in undeformed materials. It is believed that this reduces the amount of Cu available for formation of the Cu rich film on the grain boundaries, thereby reducing IGC susceptibility. A transition to pitting-like corrosion was observed in the pre-deformed alloys. Pre-deformation after pre-baking of alloys for automotive applications proved to be detrimental for corrosion properties. However, it is believed that pre-deformation prior to pre-baking may be advantageous for achieving optimum <b>paint</b> <b>bake</b> response combined with good corrosion properties. The effect of post-deformation on mechanical and corrosion properties was ambiguous. Post-rolling somewhat improved the IGC resistance but did not increase the hardness, whereas post-stretching did not improve the IGC resistance but increased the hardness of the alloys.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Fe, Mn and other trace {{elements}} on the ageing response of Al Mg Si alloy has been investigated. Three alloys were used Al 0. 4 wt 1. 0 wt Si alloy {{with a very}} low level of impurities, Al 0. 4 wt 1. 0 wt Si with 0. 25 wt Fe and 0. 08 Mn and a 6016 commercial alloy containing further elements. Samples were solution heat treated and then quenched in different media. After quenching, samples were artificially aged. Their ageing responses were studied by using microhardness. Differential Scanning Calorimetry DSC was performed in order to investigate their precipitation behavior. Moreover, the morphology of the precipitates and intermetallic compounds were characterised by using Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM and Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM. Result shows that, at the <b>paint</b> <b>bake</b> condition, the 6016 alloy has the largest number density of amp; 61538;, and this correlates {{to the fact that}} 6016 alloy has the fastest ageing response, while the alloy containing Fe and Mn has the slowest. DSC shows that the precipitation behavior after solid solution treatment for 6016 and the alloy containing Fe and Mn is not sensitive to the cooling rates. The presence of Fe and Mn lowers the Si content in the matrix, which is necessary for the formation of amp; 61538; during ageing. On the other hand, the presence of the trace elements promotes the formation of amp; 61538; and increases the hardening rate during ageing despite the fact of the presence of the intermetallic compound...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of self-piercing riveted joints in aluminium sheet (A 5754) at typical automotive crash speeds. Tension, shear and peel joint specimens have been tested over the speed range from low rate (10 − 3 m/s) to high rate (5 m/s), using a high rate servo-hydraulic machine. A heat treatment was applied {{to some of the}} material and joint specimens to simulate the <b>paint</b> <b>bake</b> conditioning applied to a car body in industry. The aluminium sheet material used to form the substrates was tested over the strain rate range from quasi-static (10 − 3 s− 1) to near 500 s− 1, and strain rate dependency on strength was not observed. Although the sheet material tested showed no strain rate dependency, this paper reports a measurable reduction in performance for the tension and shear joint test results at higher rate, which has not been previously reported. Common to all joint types tested in this paper is interlock failure and this is a tension failure mode. A rate dependent empirical model which relates energy to the negative exponential of test speed is shown to be a good fit to the joint tension test results. The same model holds for the relationship between maximum displacement and test speed. After calibration, the model shows a transition in which performance decreases rapidly at higher rate for the joint interlock failure mode. An explanation of the cause is discussed. Critical to the findings reported in this paper is the design of the fixture and force transducer to test U shaped tension specimens over the speed range of interest. A finite element model of the fixture and test measurement system was developed to ensure a near optimal design. Sufficient details of these are given to reproduce the test results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the needs of}} the aviation and automotive markets for structural materials and presents examples of developments of aluminum alloy products to fill these needs. Designers of aircraft desire materials which will allow them to design lightweight, cost-effective structures which have the performance characteristics of durability and damage tolerance. Their needs are being met by new and emerging materials varying from Al-Li alloys for thick structure, high-strength plate and extrusions for wings, and new monolithic and aluminum-fiber laminates for fuselages. Increase in fuel economy because of lighter weight structure is the driving force for aluminum alloys in the automotive market, and cost is extremely important. Mechanical properties for automotive use also depend on the application, and corrosion resistance must be adequate. For "hang-on" components such as fenders and hoods, formability is typically the limiting mechanical property. Strength must be adequate to resist denting at a thickness which offers cost-effective weight savings over steel. Because formability often decreases with increasing yield strength, alloys which are highly formable in the T 4 temper and which age harden during the <b>paint</b> <b>bake</b> operation were developed. Alloys such as 6009 and 6010 are now being challenged by 2008, 6111 and 6016. Body structure components must be made from materials which absorb energy and fail gracefully during a crash. Such components for an automotive space frame are being die cast from an Al-Si-Mg alloy. These ductile die castings are joined to thin 6 XXX extrusions which must combine formability, strength, ductility and the ability to deform plastically on impact. Bumpers must combine strength and adequate formability; in the event that current alloys are inadequate for future needs, a new 7 XXX alloy offers an improved combination of properties...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium (Mg) alloys are {{attractive}} {{materials for the}} automotive industry due to their comparatively low density and high strength to weight ratio. However, the wider applications of Mg alloys, especially in wrought applications, are restricted by the combination of relatively poor corrosion resistance and limited formability. In this work, low-level additions of Zn, Ca, Gd, Sr and Zr were studied as alloying additions to Mg, owing to their beneficial effects on improving the strength and formability. The alloys designed and presented herein are unique to date, owing to: (a) the total alloy loading being relatively low, resulting in the low density and low cost; (b) the microstructures being nominally homogeneous, essential for good formability; (c) the alloys are heat treatable and amenable {{to an increase in}} strength after wrought processing, for example a <b>paint</b> <b>bake</b> cycle (noting that the existing commercial wrought alloys such as the ZK and AZ alloys are not heat treatable). Due the alloy compositions used in this work being new, the electrochemical properties of such alloys were not previously understood. Since the corrosion of Mg alloys depends on the alloying additions, the study herein aims to principally investigate the compositional and processing effects on the corrosion of Mg. To do this, significant aspets of alloy production and processing on the laboratory scale are required. Herein, additions of Zn, Ca, Zr, Gd and Sr to Mg were deliberately made in binary, ternary, quaternary and quinternary combinations to systematically explore the effects of altering bulk chemistry on the corrosion of Mg. Microhardness testing was employed to estimate the strength of Mg alloys. Results were correlated with microstructure analysis. This thesis contributes {{to an understanding of the}} corrosion of Mg alloys with relatively low alloy loadings, which is also lacking in the literature. The results reveal that (i) hardness increased with alloy loading; whilst the corrosion rates did not show clear relationship with alloy loading; (ii) Mg alloys instead had an ultra-sensitivity to the type of alloying additions, and most elements promoted higher corrosion rates than pure Mg due to enhanced cathodic kinetics; (iii) alloys with multiple alloying additions (quaternary and quinternary) tolerated relatively higher alloy loading without much deteriorations on the corrosion resistance. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was used to manage, interpret and disseminate the datasets in a holistic framework...|$|E
