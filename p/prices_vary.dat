Regional retail E85 <b>prices</b> <b>vary</b> widely across the US, with more favorable prices in the Midwest region, where most corn is grown and ethanol produced. Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.|$|E

The {{chancellor of the}} exchequer and M explain that gold <b>prices</b> <b>vary</b> across the world, allowing one to profit by selling bullion internationally. Bond arranges to meet Goldfinger socially at his country club in Kent, and wins a high-stakes golf game against him with a recovered Nazi gold bar at stake. Bond follows him to Switzerland, where Tilly, Jill's sister, makes an unsuccessful attempt at revenge by firing a rifle at Goldfinger.|$|E

25|$|Electricity <b>prices</b> <b>vary</b> {{considerably}} from one distribution company to another. Small (high cost) consumers have high prices and larger (lower cost) consumers have lower prices. This {{is an indication}} that tariffs in El Salvador reflect costs better than those in other countries.|$|E

30|$|We observe {{temporal}} {{price dispersion}} when {{the identity of}} the store offering the lowest (and highest) <b>price</b> <b>varies</b> over time. If stores’ relative positions in the price distribution remain constant, then dispersed prices could simply reflect store heterogeneity. However, if the ranking by <b>prices</b> <b>varies</b> over time then price dispersion might rather be the result of costly consumer search. In this latter case, firms change their prices so that buyers cannot identify the “cheapest” store overall.|$|R

25|$|Bulk {{quantities}} of lower-grade saffron can reach upwards of 500 per pound; retail costs for small amounts may exceed ten times that rate. In Western countries the average retail price is approximately US$1,000 per pound. <b>Prices</b> <b>vary</b> widely elsewhere, but on average {{tend to be}} lower. The high price is somewhat offset by the small quantities needed in kitchens: a few grams at most in medicinal use and a few strands, at most, in culinary applications; there are between 70,000 and 200,000 strands in a pound.|$|E
25|$|Using credits, {{a player}} can buy wares from stations. These wares may be used, or flown to another station {{where they can}} be sold, ideally for a profit. However, <b>prices</b> <b>vary</b> {{depending}} on demand; the less of a ware there is, the higher its price. As such, the X-Universe has a truly dynamic market-driven economy. A player can capitalise on emergent trends, meeting demand to make vast profits, or as easily, can waste money and time on a bad cargo choice. In X3, many NPC ships have the same plan, and the player can easily miss their intended market if another ship arrives first.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{minerals}} {{of the state is}} amber, much of which is 25 million years old, with quality comparable to that found in the Dominican Republic. Chiapan amber has a number of unique qualities, including much that is clear all the way through and some with fossilized insects and plants. Most Chiapan amber is worked into jewelry including pendants, rings and necklaces. Colors vary from white to yellow/orange to a deep red, but there are also green and pink tones as well. Since pre-Hispanic times, native peoples have believed amber to have healing and protective qualities. The largest amber mine is in Simojovel, a small village 130km from Tuxtla Gutiérrez, which produces 95% of Chiapas' amber. Other mines are found in Huitiupán, Totolapa, El Bosque, Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán, Pantelhó and San Andrés Duraznal. According to the Museum of Amber in San Cristóbal, almost 300kg of amber is extracted per month from the state. <b>Prices</b> <b>vary</b> depending on quality and color.|$|E

We are invited to believe that with all that subtle process of calculation made from almost minute to minute throughout the year, the imposition of a duty or demand for £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 for this or that Government, placed suddenly upon the commodity in question as a tax, makes no difference whatever to the cost to the consumer; that it is borne either by the buyer or by the seller, or provided in some magical manner. As a matter of fact, the seller endeavours to transmit the burden to the purchaser, and the purchaser places it upon the consumer as opportunity may occur in relation to the general market situation all over the world.|$|E
