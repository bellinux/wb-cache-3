25|$|Nitrous oxide {{is stored}} as a {{compressed}} liquid; the evaporation {{and expansion of}} liquid nitrous oxide in the intake manifold causes a large drop in intake charge temperature, resulting in a denser charge, further allowing more air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. Sometimes nitrous oxide is injected into (or prior to) the intake manifold, whereas other systems directly inject, right before the cylinder (direct <b>port</b> <b>injection)</b> to increase power.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance used a Renault {{supplied}} OHV 1.4L I4 engine {{from the}} Renault Le Car. Cars sold in 49-states {{came with a}} Renix throttle-body fuel injection, while California emissions standards required the use of multi <b>port</b> <b>injection.</b> This four-cylinder was upgraded with the latest electronics that included an electronically controlled fuel system, a digital ignition system, and a microprocessor to manage the optional three-speed automatic transmission. Although Renault transmissions have been equipped with Renix based electronics and sensor assemblies, the all-new electronic controlled transmission system in the Alliance was an innovation to the U.S. mass-market.|$|E

2500|$|Most Buick LeSabre {{models from}} 1986 until 2005 were powered by Buick's 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine. It {{started out with}} [...] It added balance shafts to become the famous [...] "3800" [...] V6 for 1988, with [...] This engine {{increased}} to [...] in 1991 {{with the addition of}} Tuned <b>Port</b> <b>Injection.</b> The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard. Each year yielded slightly different design changes. 1986 is notable for its sealed-beam headlights, 1987 for the substition of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts. In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank). For 1990 there was a change {{in the design of the}} front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were more or less identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.|$|E

40|$|While {{models have}} {{previously}} {{been developed to}} investigate scroll compressor performance with a single <b>injection</b> <b>port,</b> the model described in this paper explores the effect of multiple <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> {{on the performance of}} a novel rotary spool compressor. The model includes the effects of heat transfer and leakage and is numerically solved to predict the compressor power consumption and mass flow rate. The <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> are modeled assuming that saturated vapor is injected at a specified pressure and the timing of the injection process can be controlled. Running at a speed of 1907 rpm with R- 22 as the working fluid, an evaporating pressure of 391 kPa, an inlet temperature of 7. 6 °C, and a discharge pressure of 1890 kPa, the model predicts that adding a single <b>injection</b> <b>port</b> will provide a 12 % increase in the coefficient of performance (COP) of the cycle. Adding a second <b>injection</b> <b>port</b> increases the COP by an additional 4 % compared to the cycle with a single port, or 16 % over the baseline performance of the cycle without economization. The compressor model is also used to investigate the effect of <b>injection</b> pressure, <b>injection</b> <b>port</b> location, and <b>injection</b> <b>port</b> diameter on economized cycle performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of particle emissions from gasoline <b>port</b> fuel <b>injection</b> engines {{have not been}} fully investigated and established in comparison with those from direct-injection spark ignition engines. This paper aims to evaluate a new measurement system that could potentially be adapted later to allow a much wider examination of particulate production from <b>port</b> fuel <b>injection</b> engines relative to gasoline direct-injection engines. This work presents the morphology of the particles emitted from <b>port</b> fuel <b>injection</b> engines analysed using scanning transmission electron microscopy. The current designs of dilution tunnel used in particle morphology measurements were reviewed, and subsequently a new dilution tunnel was designed, built, tested and optimised for nanoparticle measurements from <b>port</b> fuel <b>injection</b> engines. A new methodology for capturing nanoparticles from <b>port</b> fuel <b>injection</b> engines for morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy was investigated by integrating a nanoparticle impactor with a dilution tunnel. The performance of the dilution tunnel demonstrated that it integrated very well with the impactor and achieved the targets {{in terms of the}} flow rate and the temperature. The widest variety of particle morphologies, including liquid particles, was observed on the transmission electron microscopy grid from impactor plate A. In addition to soot agglomerates, crystalline particles and salt particles were also seen. In contrast with earlier studies, particle fragmentation was also observed...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{and experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of multiple <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> in a two-dimensional, convergentdivergent nozzle, for fluidic thrust vectoring. The concept of multiple <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> was conceived to enhance the thrust vectoring capability of a convergentdivergent nozzle over that of a single <b>injection</b> <b>port</b> without increasing the secondary mass flow rate requirements. The experimental study was conducted at static conditions in the Jet Exit Test Facility of the 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel Complex at NASA Langley Research Center. Internal nozzle performance was obtained at nozzle pressure ratios up to 10 with secondary nozzle pressure ratios up to 1 for five configurations. The computational study was conducted using the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics code PAB 3 D with two-equation turbulence closure and linear Reynolds stress modeling. Internal nozzle performance was predicted for nozzle pressure ratios up to 10 with a secondary nozzle pressure ratio of 0. 7 for two configurations. Results from the experimental study indicate a benefit to multiple <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> in a convergentdivergent nozzle. In general, increasing the number of <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> from one to two increased the pitch thrust vectoring capability without any thrust performance penalties at nozzle pressure ratios less than 4 with high secondary pressure ratios.

40|$|Dynamic {{simulations}} of vapor compression system {{are an important}} field of research since they allow investigation into {{the behavior of a}} system under time-varying conditions, which is essential for development of an effective control strategy for the system. It is particularly important for advanced cycles such as a flash tank vapor injection (FTVI) cycle since additional control parameters, such as injection vapor temperature or flash tank liquid level, are involved in such systems. In this study, a mathematical model for an R 410 A-based FTVI cycle is developed in Simulink. The model is based on an actual system that consists of two sets of heat exchangers, a high-side EEV, a low-side TXV, a flash tank and a scroll compressor with a vapor <b>injection</b> <b>port</b> The <b>injection</b> <b>port</b> can be turned off or on.
