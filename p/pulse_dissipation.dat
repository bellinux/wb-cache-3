40|$|A {{protocol}} {{is discussed}} for preparing a spin chain in a generic many-body {{state in the}} asymptotic limit of tailored non-unitary dynamics. The dynamics require the spectral resolution of the target state, optimized coherent <b>pulses,</b> engineered <b>dissipation,</b> and feedback.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the wave {{propagation}} of generalized thermoelastic medium with voids under the effect of thermal loading due to laser <b>pulse</b> with energy <b>dissipation.</b> The material is a homogeneous isotropic elastic half-space and heated by a non-Gaussian laser beam with the pulse duration of 0. 2 â¯ps. A normal mode method is proposed to analyse the problem and obtain numerical solutions for the displacement components, stresses, temperature distribution and the change in the volume fraction field. The results of the physical quantities have been illustrated graphically by comparison between both types II and III of Green-Naghdi theory for two values of time, as well as with and without void parameters.

It is based on the transition of an RF-driven Josephson junction between two distinct oscillation states near a dynamical bifurcation point.

40|$|The {{traversal}} {{times for}} an electromagnetic pulse traversing {{a slab of}} dispersive and dissipative material with negative dielectric permittivity (ϵ) and magnetic permeability (μ) have been calculated by using the average flow of electromagnetic energy in the medium. The effects of bandwidth of the <b>pulse</b> and <b>dissipation</b> in the medium have been investigated. While both large bandwidth and large dissipation have similar effects in smoothening out the resonant features that appear due to Fabry-Pérot resonances, large dissipation can result in very small or even negative traversal times near the resonant frequencies. We have also investigated the traversal times and Wigner delay times for obliquely incident pulses and evanescent pulses. The coupling to slab plasmon polariton modes in frequency ranges with negative ϵ or μ is shown to result in large traversal times at the resonant conditions. We also find that the group velocity mainly contributes to the delay times for pulse propagating across a slab with n=- 1. We have checked that the traversal times are positive and subluminal for pulses with sufficiently large bandwidths. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures, Submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

An example is considered in conditions of one-dimensional Cauchy problem for conventional string equation in matrix form and its inhomogeneous two-component version. The acoustic and electromagnetic problems are discussed within the restrictions outlined. The projecting operator technique is used to split the solution space and analyze input of a wave monitoring in vicinity of an observation point. The solution space is supplied by $L_ 2 $ norm via the problem conservation law; its finite-dimensional analog {{is used as a}} measure of a given mode presence and information about form.

Some results from earlier studies are included {{to illustrate the}} non-linear effects on the transmission characteristics of duct and nozzle terminations. Investigaiations, both experimental and analytical, were carried out to determine the magnitudes of the effects for high intensity pulse propagation. The results derived from these investigations are presented in this paper. They include {{the effect of the}} sound intensity on the acoustic characteristics of duct and nozzle terminations, the extent of the non-linearities in the propagation of high intensity impulsive sound inside the duct and out into free field, the acoustic energy dissipation mechanism at a termination as shown by flow visualizations, and quantitative evaluations by experimental and analytical means of the influence of the intensity of a sound <b>pulse</b> on the <b>dissipation</b> of its acoustic power...|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency {{inductively coupled plasma}} in a pulse {{modulated}} {{approach was}} generated by a MOSFET inverter supply of high electric efficiency. The plasma torch has an extremely long coil region of 153 mm, which is an attractive feature for advanced materials processing, especially for better and more efficient vaporizing of solids. The operating conditions were: argon flow of 80 or 90 L/m at atmospheric pressure; supply power of 30 kW; and pulse on-time of 10 ms at 67 % duty factor. Spectroscopic measurements were carried out to determine the temporal plasma properties, including the effects of shimmer current level (SCL) upon the spectral intensities. Additionally a time-dependent two-dimensional numerical model was solved for the same operating conditions employed in the experiment to predict and compare the plasma properties. <b>Pulsed</b> plasma <b>dissipation</b> sustained for a minimum SCL of 43 % for 80 L/m gas flow-rate, and at any level below 43 %, the plasma disappeared. Temporal variation of argon line intensities at 751 and 763. 5 nm is similar, though the upper level intensity of the former one was significantly stronger than the latter. Intensified change of intensity is found at lower SCL because of higher change in the coil current and, in turn, in the plasma power. The predicted intensity of the 751 -nm argon line showed similar behavior to the experimental intensity though the response around the instant of on-pulsation is somewhat slowe...|$|R
40|$|A {{particle}} beam feedback system using constant amplitude, 1000 volt, 12 nanosecond pulses {{has been built}} to provide longitudinal and horizontal feedback for stabilizing 14 nanosecond spaced bunches for use in CESR (Cornell Electron Storage Ring). The pulse rate is modulated to obtain proportional amplitude control and the pulse arrival time is modulated to obtain {{both positive and negative}} kicks. The average repetition rate is limited by <b>pulser</b> power <b>dissipation,</b> but the instantaneous rate may be increased to full duty cycle for short periods of time to handle transients. The pulser drives a 50 ohm stripline kicker so the equivalent peak power at 1000 volts is 10 kilowatts. The characteristics of the pulser and its modulator will be described along with the system's operation. Background and System Requirements CESR (Cornell Electron Storage Ring) may store up to 45 bunches each of electrons and positrons in its present operational configuration. The electron and positron beams are arranged in trains of up to 5 bunches with a nominal spacing of 280 ns between lead bunches in a train. The bunches in a train have a minimum spacing of 14 ns. In high current operation the unstable modes of oscillation of the beam must be suppressed using feedback. The feedback system must sense bunch motion and deliver either deflection or acceleration independently to each bunch in order to damp all of the possible dipole multibunch instabilities. The desired peak amplitude for handling transients is approximately 1000 volts. For a system delivering a sinewave into a non-resonant kicker, a 10 kW amplifier would be required. The power available in the present syste...|$|R
40|$|In a {{strongly}} nonlinear viscous granular chain {{under conditions of}} loading that exclude stationary waves (e. g., impact by a single grain) we observe a pulse that consists of two interconnected but distinct parts. One is a leading narrow "primary pulse" with properties similar to a solitary wave in a "sonic vacuum. " It arises from strong nonlinearity and discreteness {{in the absence of}} dissipation, but now decays due to viscosity. The other is a broad, much more persistent shock-like "secondary pulse" trailing the primary pulse and caused by viscous dissipation. The medium behind the primary pulse is transformed from a "sonic vacuum" to a medium with finite sound speed. When the rapidly decaying primary pulse dies, the secondary pulse continues to propagate in the "sonic vacuum," with an oscillatory front if the viscosity is relatively small, until its eventual (but very slow) disintegration. Beyond a critical viscosity there is no separation of the two <b>pulses,</b> and the <b>dissipation</b> and nonlinearity dominate the shock-like attenuating pulse which now exhibits a nonoscillatory front...|$|R
40|$|The melting of a {{phase change}} {{material}} {{in a container}} of rectangular cross-section with multiple discrete heat sources mounted on one side is investigated for electronics cooling by latent heat energy storage. This numerical study focuses on the thermal management issues that arise when electronic components experience sudden surges in power dissipation. The transient response of the energy storage system to short <b>pulses</b> in power <b>dissipation</b> is studied. Convective cooling using air-cooled heat sinks {{on the sides of}} the containment remote from the heat sources provides for heat rejection to ambient air. The analysis is performed under different pulse frequencies. Different aspect ratios for the containment volume as well as different locations for the heat sources are studied in order to identify an optimal arrangement. Conduction and convection in the phase change material as well as conduction through the containment walls are considered in the computations. The constitutive equations are implicitly solved using a fully transient method on fixed orthogonal co-located finite volumes. The system is characterized based on the rate of heat absorption as well as the maximum temperatures experienced at the heat sources. Improvements that can be made in the application of latent heat energy storage to electronics cooling applications are discussed based on the results from the present study...|$|R
40|$|Determination of the {{accuracy}} of commonly used techniques for measuring sap flux density in trees often presents a challenge. We therefore designed and built a verification system for heat-based sap flow sensors typically used at stem level. In the laboratory, a Mariotte's bottle device was used to maintain a constant {{flow rate of water}} through freshly cut stem segments of American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). This verification system was used to determine {{the accuracy}} of three heat-based sap flux density techniques: heat <b>pulse</b> velocity, thermal <b>dissipation</b> and heat field deformation. All three techniques substantially underestimated sap flux density when compared against gravimetric measurements. On average the actual sap flux density was underestimated by 35 % using heat pulse velocity, 46 % using heat field deformation and 60 % using thermal dissipation. These differences were consistent across sap flux densities ranging from 5 to 80 cm(3) cm(- 2) h(- 1). Field measurements supported the relative sensor performance observed in the laboratory. Applying a sensor-specific correction factor based on the laboratory test to the field data produced similar estimates of sap flux density from all three techniques. We concluded that a species-specific calibration is therefore necessary when using any of these techniques to insure that accurate estimates of sap flux density are obtained, at least until a physical basis for error correction can be proposed...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{generalization of}} the stabilized Kuramoto - Sivashinsky (KS) system is presented. It {{is based on}} the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation including dissipation of the generic (Newell [...] Whitehead [...] Segel, NWS) type and gain. The system directly applies to the description of gravity-capillary waves on the surface of a liquid layer flowing down an inclined plane, with a surfactant diffusing along the layer's surface. Actually, the model is quite general, offering a simple way to stabilize nonlinear waves in media combining the weakly- 2 D dispersion of the KP type with gain and NWS dissipation. Parallel to this, another model is introduced, whose dissipative terms are isotropic, rather than of the NWS type. Both models include an additional linear equation of the advection-diffusion type, linearly coupled to the main KP-NWS equation. The extra equation provides for stability of the zero background in the system, opening a way to the existence of stable localized pulses. The consideration is focused on the case when the dispersive part of the system of the KP-I type, admitting the existence of 2 D localized <b>pulses.</b> Treating the <b>dissipation</b> and gain as small perturbations and making use of the balance equation for the field momentum, we find that the equilibrium between the gain and losses may select two 2 D solitons, from their continuous family existing in the conservative counterpart of the model (the latter family is found in an exact analytical form). The selected soliton with the larger amplitude is expected to be stable. Direct simulations completely corroborate the analytical predictions.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} extremely weakly decaying linear and nonlinear modes (i. e. modes immune to dissipation) in the one-dimensional periodic array of identical spatially localized dissipations, where the dissipation width is {{much smaller than the}} period of the array. We consider wave propagation governed by the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in the array of identical Gaussian-shaped dissipations with three parameters, the integral dissipation strength Γ_ 0, the width σ and the array period d. In the linear case, setting σ→ 0, while keeping Γ_ 0 fixed, we get an array of zero-width dissipations given by the Dirac delta-functions, i. e. the complex Kroning-Penney model, where an infinite number of nondecaying modes appear with the Bloch index being either at the center, k= 0, or at the boundary, k= π/d, of an analog of the Brillouin zone. By using numerical simulations we confirm that the weakly decaying modes persist for σ such that σ/d≪ 1 and have the same Bloch index. The nondecaying modes persist also if a real-valued periodic potential is added to the spatially periodic array of dissipations, with the period of the dissipative array being multiple of that of the periodic potential. We also consider evolution of the soliton-shaped pulses in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the spatially periodic dissipative lattice and find that when the pulse width is much larger than the lattice period and its wave number k is either at the center, k= 2 π/d, or at the boundary, k= π/d, a significant fraction of the <b>pulse</b> escapes the <b>dissipation</b> forming a stationary nonlinear mode with the soliton shaped envelope and the Fourier spectrum consisting of two peaks centered at k and -k.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{in vitro}} feasibility {{study for the}} use of a Floating-Electrode Dielectric Barrier Discharge (FE-DBD) plasma source to induce skin disinfection in the context of preventing neonatal sepsis is performed. The FE-DBD is a copper electrode, enclosed in an insulating material and a thin plate of quartz. The quartz is placed parallel above the substrate which is to be disinfected and is used as secondary electrode. Short damping kHz voltage pulses are fed to the electrode, which leads to filamentary microdischarges between the quartz and the substrate. By changing the pulse frequency, pulse width, duty cycle, gap distance and the to be treated surface, the properties of the plasma formed between the quartz and the substrate are affected. For different settings of these five variables, the relative light intensity, maximum voltage in one <b>pulse</b> and power <b>dissipation</b> in the plasma are studied. FTIR spectrometry is used to get quantitative insight in the chemistry in the discharge, but the path length was too short to obtain species densities. The effect of treatment of a FE-DBD on bacteria and skin is investigated. Staphylococcus aureus are placed with small drops on cover glass and treated for different settings. The inactivation of S. aureus is more effective and there is more light emission when the power dissipation in the plasma is higher. Also human skin with S. aureus is treated, the inactivation of bacteria is less effective. The inactivation of S. aureus is compared with the inactivation of three other staphylococci which are also found in neonates with sepsis and it is similar. Treatment of the skin did not show any clear difference in metabolic activity of the skin cells. The growth of the skin cells seems even to be stimulated for a more intense treatment. Histology shows local damage in the skin samples, the damage is very small and are therefore not causing a visible drop in the metabolic activity. The skin samples are not completely flat, a higher part of the skin will have a higher impact of discharges, which will cause this local damage. The detrimental effects on skin are a cause of concerns and the investigation of a plasma source that does not use the neonatal skin as second electrode is recommended based on the outcome of this study.
