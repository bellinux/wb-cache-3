25|$|The Lancaster, Pennsylvania {{facility}} was opened by the U.S. Navy in 1942 {{and operated by}} RCA for the manufacture of radio and microwave tubes. Following World War II, the naval {{facility was}} acquired by RCA. RCA Lancaster, as it became known, was the base for development and production of commercial television products.

40|$|A <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> {{saturation}} indicator {{is formed}} by supplying a supplemental light source, typically a {{light emitting diode}} (LED), adjacent to the <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube.</b> A switch allows the light source to be activated. The light is forwarded to the <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> by an optical fiber. If the probe is properly light tight, then a meter attached to the indicator will register {{the light from the}} LED. If the probe is no longer light tight, and the saturation indicator is saturated, no signal will be registered when the LED is activated. This <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> is used with alpha contamination probes...|$|R
25|$|The <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> is an {{extremely}} sensitive detector of light, which uses the photoelectric effect and secondary emission, rather than thermionic emission, to generate and amplify electrical signals. Nuclear medicine imaging equipment and liquid scintillation counters use <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> arrays to detect low-intensity scintillation due to ionizing radiation.|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{source of}} error in making atmospheric differential absorption lidar ozone measurements is the saturation of the <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> by the strong, near field light return. Some time after the near field light signal is gone, the <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> gate is opened and a noise signal, called signal-induced noise, is observed. Research reported here gives experimental results from measurement of photomultiplier signal-induced noise. Results show that signal-induced noise has several decaying exponential signals, suggesting that electrons are slowly emitted from different surfaces internal to the <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes</b> (photomultipliers or PMTs for short), {{members of}} the class of vacuum tubes, and more {{specifically}} vacuum phototubes, are extremely sensitive detectors of light in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. These detectors multiply the current produced by incident light by as much as 100 million times (i.e., 160 dB), in multiple dynode stages, enabling (for example) individual photons to be detected when the incident flux of light is low.|$|E
25|$|The crystal scintillates in {{response}} to incident gamma radiation. When a gamma photon leaves the patient (who has been injected with a radioactive pharmaceutical), it knocks an electron loose from an iodine atom in the crystal, and a faint flash of light is produced when the dislocated electron again finds a minimal energy state. The initial phenomenon of the excited electron {{is similar to the}} photoelectric effect and (particularly with gamma rays) the Compton effect. After the flash of light is produced, it is detected. <b>Photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes</b> (PMTs) behind the crystal detect the fluorescent flashes (events) and a computer sums the counts. The computer reconstructs and displays a two dimensional image of the relative spatial count density on a monitor. This reconstructed image reflects the distribution and relative concentration of radioactive tracer elements present in the organs and tissues imaged.|$|E
25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes</b> makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E

500|$|Other {{systems may}} be used in {{conjunction}} with the rest of an atomic line filter for practicality. For instance, the polarizers used in the actual Faraday filter don't block most radiation, [...] "because these polarizers only work over a limited wavelength region ... a broad band interference filter is used in conjunction with the Faraday filter". The passband of the interference filter may be 200 times that of the actual filter. <b>Photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes,</b> too, are often used for increasing the intensity of the output signal to a usable level. Avalanche photomultipliers, which are more efficient, {{may be used}} instead of a PMT.|$|E
500|$|Atomic line filters may {{operate in}} the ultraviolet, visible and {{infrared}} regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In absorption-re-emission ALFs, the frequency of light must be shifted {{in order for the}} filter to operate, and in a passive device, this shift must be to a lower frequency (i.e. red shifted) simply because of energy conservation. This means that passive filters are rarely able to work with infrared light, because the output frequency would be impractically low. If <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes</b> (PMTs) are used then the [...] "output wavelength of the ARF should lie in a spectral region in which commercial, large-area, long-lived PMT's [...] possess maximum sensitivity". In such a case, active ALFs would have the advantage over passive ALFs as they would more readily, [...] "generate output wavelengths in the near UV, the spectral region in which well-developed photocathodes possess their highest sensitivity".|$|E

With [...] encouragement from John A. Wheeler, they tried again in 1955, this time using one of the newer, larger 700 MW reactors at the Savannah River Site that emitted a high neutrino flux of 1.2 x 1012 / cm2 sec.

500|$|Liquid argon {{is used as}} {{the target}} for {{neutrino}} experiments and direct dark matter searches. The interaction between the hypothetical WIMPs and an argon nucleus produces scintillation light that is detected by <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes.</b> Two-phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP–nucleus scattering. As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation light yield (about 51 photons/keV), is transparent to its own scintillation light, and {{is relatively easy to}} purify. Compared to xenon, argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile, which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils. [...] On the other hand, its intrinsic beta-ray background is larger due to [...] contamination, unless one uses argon from underground sources, which has much less [...] contamination. Most of the argon in the Earth’s atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long-lived [...] ( [...] + e− → [...] + ν) present in natural potassium within the Earth. [...] The [...] activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through the knockout reaction (n,2n) and similar reactions. [...] The half-life of [...] is only 269years. [...] As a result, the underground Ar, shielded by rock and water, has much less [...] contamination. [...] Dark-matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include DarkSide, WArP, ArDM, microCLEAN and DEAP. [...] Neutrino experiments include ICARUS and MicroBooNE, both of which use high-purity liquid argon in a time projection chamber for fine grained three-dimensional imaging of neutrino interactions.|$|E

2500|$|Since then, various {{detection}} {{methods have been}} used. Super Kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes</b> that watch for the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar, but uses heavy water as the detecting medium, which uses the same effects, but also allows the additional reaction any-flavor neutrino photo-dissociation of deuterium, resulting in a free neutron which is then detected from gamma radiation after chlorine-capture. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created by electron-neutrinos interacting with the original substance. MINOS used a solid plastic scintillator coupled to <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes,</b> while Borexino uses a liquid pseudocumene scintillator also watched by <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes</b> and the NOνA detector uses liquid scintillator watched by avalanche photodiodes.

40|$|Abstract—For gamma {{radiation}} detection, assemblies having scintillation crystals and a <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube,</b> also {{there is a}} preamplifier connected to the detector because the signals from <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> are of small amplitude.

2500|$|<b>Photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes</b> {{typically}} utilize 1000 to 2000 volts {{to accelerate}} electrons within {{the chain of}} dynodes. (See Figure near top of article.) The most negative voltage {{is connected to the}} cathode, and the most positive voltage is connected to the anode. Negative high-voltage supplies (with the positive terminal grounded) are often preferred, because this configuration enables the photocurrent to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage. However, with the photocathode at high voltage, leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted [...] "dark current" [...] pulses that may affect the operation. [...] Voltages are distributed to the dynodes by a resistive voltage divider, although variations such as active designs (with transistors or diodes) are possible. The divider design, which influences frequency response or rise time, can be selected to suit varying applications. Some instruments that use photomultipliers have provisions to vary the anode voltage to control the gain of the system.|$|E
