40|$|Background: <b>Premature</b> <b>aging</b> reduces {{quality of}} human life, leads to {{development}} of “old age diseases” in younger age, and also shortens life expectancy. Aim: Investigation of <b>premature</b> <b>aging</b> markers in women of reproductive age with central untreated hypogonadism {{in association with}} other compensated pituitary deﬁciencies. Materials and methods: Hormonal and biochemical parameters, body mass index (BMI) and body mineral density (BMD) were investigated in 87 women of reproductive age (median – 24 y. o.) with the central untreated hypogonadism in association with other compensated pituitary deﬁciencies (hypopituitarism) and in 52 healthy age-matched controls. Results: Low levels of estrogens as well as androgens (total and free testosterone, DHEA-S) were found in women with hypopituitarism {{as compared to the}} controls. Such markers of <b>premature</b> <b>aging</b> as increased BMI (р= 0, 025), high levels of cholesterol (р<- 2. 5 SD in lumbar vertebra). Correlation analysis elucidated that hypoandrogenemia as well as hypoestrogenemia was pathogenetic basis of <b>premature</b> <b>aging</b> in women with hypopituitarism and untreated hypogonadism. Conclusion: Such markers of <b>premature</b> <b>aging</b> as BMI increase, dislipidemia, increased levels of bone metabolism markers, and low BMD were revealed in women of reproductive age with uncured hypogonadism and other compensated types of hypophysial insufﬁciency.

50|$|The mini-facelift is {{the least}} {{invasive}} type of facelift {{which is similar to}} a full facelift, the only difference is the omission of the neck lift in the mini lift procedure. It is also called the ‘S’ lift because of the shape of the incision that is used or the ‘short-scar’ facelift. This lift is a more temporary solution to the ageing of the face which also has less downtime and is done on people who have deep nasolabial folds, sagging facial structures, yet still have a firm and well-contoured neck. The position of the incision is usually made from the hairline around the ear with scars hidden in the natural crease of the skin. The mini lift can be performed with an endoscope, which is used to reposition the soft tissues. After this, the skin is repositioned by the surgeon with small sutures. This type of lift is a good alternative to the full facelift to people with <b>premature</b> <b>ageing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Reconstitution of {{telomerase}} {{activity is}} proposed {{as a potential}} gene therapy to prevent, or rescue, age-related diseases produced by critical telomere shortening. However, {{it is not known}} whether or not short telomeres are irreversibly damaged. We addressed this by re-introducing telomerase in late generation telomerase-deficient mice, Terc–/–, which have short telomeres and show severe proliferative defects. For this, we have crossed these mice with Terc+/– mice and analyzed telomere length, chromosomal instability and <b>premature</b> <b>aging</b> of the progeny. The Terc–/– progeny had one set of chromosomes with normal telomeres, whereas the other set remained with critically short telomeres; these mice presented chromosomal instability and <b>premature</b> <b>aging.</b> In contrast, Terc+/– progeny showed all chromosomes with detectable telomeres, and did not show chromosomal instability or <b>premature</b> <b>aging.</b> These results prove that critically short telomeres can be rescued by telomerase, and become fully functional, thus rescuing <b>premature</b> <b>aging.</b> This has important implications for the future design of telomerase-based gene therapy of age-related diseases...|$|R

To understand the phenomenon of <b>premature</b> <b>aging,</b> the similarity of aging features in these syndromes to that in normal aging is investigated. Although these three syndromes have different genetic backgrounds, all the patients have abnormal structures of tissues/organs like that in normal aging. Therefore, the abnormality in tissue structure is the common point in <b>premature</b> <b>aging</b> and normal aging. This abnormality links also a defective development and a defective repair, the Misrepair. Defective development {{is a result of}} Mis-construction of the structure of tissues and organs as consequence of genetic mutations. Aging is a result of Mis-reconstructions, the Misrepairs, for maintaining the structure of tissues/organs.
