5|$|French ornithologist Émile Oustalet {{described}} a specimen from Branco {{as a separate}} species <b>Passer</b> brancoensis in 1883, which was recognised as the subspecies <b>Passer</b> iagoensis brancoensis by W. R. P. Bourne, who claimed to observe differences between Iago sparrows from different islands. According to Bourne, birds of <b>Passer</b> iagoensis iagoensis on more wooded islands in the south are darker and larger, and also behave more like house or Spanish sparrows, competing with them better in human-altered habitats. He later wrote that the variations he saw comprised two clinal trends, of increasing darkness towards the south, and of smaller size further from the continental coast. Charles Vaurie, examining differences in plumage and measurements of specimens in major museums, {{did not find any}} significant variation, and neither Vaurie nor Summers-Smith recognised any subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Statistics-wise, Cutler struggled, {{completing}} 3 of 8 {{passes for}} 28 yards with one interception and an 8.3 <b>passer</b> rating, while McCown completed 14 of 20 passes for 204 yards with one touchdown and a 119.6 <b>passer</b> rating.

5|$|According to Tchernov's 1962 paper, <b>Passer</b> predomesticus {{was found}} in the middle Acheulean (middle Pleistocene, {{probably}} more than 400,000 years old) layer E1 of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Wadi Khareitoun near Bethlehem. In 1984, however, Tchernov wrote that P.predomesticus was about 140,000 years old, from the Yabrudian. Layer E1 contained remains of about 40bird species, including a premaxilla Tchernov described as a precursor of the Dead Sea sparrow (<b>Passer</b> moabiticus) and a tarsometatarsus and humerus tentatively allied with the house sparrow. An undetermined Acheulean layer of the same cave also contained fossils Tchernov described as precursors of both the house and Spanish sparrows.|$|E

5|$|Together, quarterbacks Jay Cutler and Josh McCown broke team {{records in}} {{touchdown}} passes, passing yards, completion percentage and <b>passer</b> rating with 32, 4,450, 64.4 and 96.9, respectively. Individually, in eleven games, Cutler completed 63.1 {{percent of his}} passes for 2,621 yards with 19 touchdowns, 12 interceptions and a career-high 89.2 <b>passer</b> rating. In the other five games, McCown completed 66.8 percent of passes for 1,829 yards, 13 touchdowns, an interception and a 109 <b>passer</b> rating, which ranked third in the NFL behind Denver's Peyton Manning and Philadelphia's Nick Foles. Running back Matt Forte had 1,339 rushing yards, a career-high, while wide receivers Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery had 1,200 receiving yards each, as the Bears became {{the first team to}} accomplish the feat since the 2002 Buffalo Bills. Marshall was also ranked the best receiver by Pro Football Focus with a score of 37.8, 13.1 higher than Green Bay's Jordy Nelson. The offensive line was also drastically changed from its 2012 counterpart, allowing the fourth-lowest sacks in the league with 30, compared to allowing the eighth-most in 2012 with 44.|$|E
5|$|Agnolín and Novas (2013) found Archaeopteryx and (possibly synonymous) Wellnhoferia {{to be the}} basalmost avialans (Avialae being {{defined by}} the authors as {{including}} Archaeopteryx lithographica and <b>Passer,</b> their most recent common ancestor {{and all of its}} descendants), with Microraptoria, Unenlagiinae, and the clade containing Anchiornis and Xiaotingia being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae. Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, et al., using a more inclusive matrix than the one from the analysis in the description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna, also found Archaeopteryx {{to be a member of}} Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing <b>Passer</b> domesticus, but not Dromaeosaurus albertensis or Troodon formosus). Archaeopteryx was found to form a grade at the base of Avialae with Xiaotingia, Anchiornis, and Aurornis. Compared to Archaeopteryx, Xiaotingia was found to be more closely related to extant birds, while both Anchiornis and Aurornis were found to be more distantly so.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{receiving}} unit being plagued by injuries, Jay Cutler ended {{the season with}} 3,629 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, 11 interceptions and career highs in <b>passer</b> rating (92.3) and completion percentage (64.4). The eleven interceptions were the lowest in his career and resulted in an interception percentage of 2.3, the lowest in a season when he has started at least 12 games. The 21 touchdowns were his second-most since 2011 and the 3,629 yards were the third-most in his career. On third down, Cutler had a 103.2 <b>passer</b> rating (fourth in the NFL) after completing 91 of 141 passes for 1,242 yards, seven touchdowns and two interceptions. With five lost fumbles, Cutler had a total of sixteen turnovers in 2015, eight fewer than in 2014. In his lone start against the Seahawks, Jimmy Clausen completed 9 of 17 passes for 63 yards, and including sacks, recorded 48 net passing yards, the second time since the 1990 season that the Bears had less than 50 net yards passing. The Bears ended the year with 228.9 passing yards per game, ranked 23rd in the league. The quarterbacking group ended {{the season with a}} combined 63.9 completion percentage and 2.3 interception percentage, both of which ranked third in team history, along with 3,843 gross passing yards and a 42.5 third down percentage (fourth), 3,660 net passing yards (fifth), along with 5,514 total net yards and a 89.7 <b>passer</b> rating (sixth).|$|E
