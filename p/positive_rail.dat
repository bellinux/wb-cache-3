25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 1980s the 1940 {{rolling stock}} fleet was giving {{increasingly}} difficult service. The decision was taken to acquire new vehicles as an extension to a rolling stock acquisition programme on the Central line of London Transport (LT). This required implementation of fourth rail traction current system to maintain consistency with the LT fleet: a new aluminium centre current rail was provided. (The original steel <b>positive</b> <b>rail</b> was replaced by an aluminium one in 2008.) The new vehicles had passenger operated door opening buttons, which were unlikely to be required on the Waterloo & City line.|$|E
30|$|The {{observed}} {{change is}} negative for road and <b>positive</b> for <b>rail</b> and inland waterways. Of interest is discovering what the possible causes are for these changes. To this end we apply a shift-share analysis to decompose the changes into several components.|$|R
50|$|The {{underground}} Mersey Railway {{started an}} electric service on 3 May 1903, electrified by British Westinghouse Electric with equipment from the US. A four-rail DC system was installed, with a <b>positive</b> outer <b>rail</b> and a negative return rail between the running rails.|$|R

50|$|Multilevel {{inverters}} provide {{another approach}} to harmonic cancellation. Multilevel inverters provide an output waveform that exhibits multiple steps at several voltage levels. For example, {{it is possible}} to produce a more sinusoidal wave by having split-rail direct current inputs at two voltages, or positive and negative inputs with a central ground. By connecting the inverter output terminals in sequence between the <b>positive</b> <b>rail</b> and ground, the <b>positive</b> <b>rail</b> and the negative rail, the ground rail and the negative rail, then both to the ground rail, a stepped waveform is generated at the inverter output. This {{is an example of a}} three level inverter: the two voltages and ground.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The London Underground uses a four-rail {{system where}} both {{conductor}} rails are live {{relative to the}} running rails, and the <b>positive</b> <b>rail</b> has twice the voltage of the negative rail. Arcs like this are normal and occur when the electric power collection shoes of a train that is drawing power {{reach the end of}} a section of conductor rail.|$|E
5000|$|Four [...] "Output" [...] are open-collector (O.C.) type (558), {{instead of}} {{push-pull}} (P.P.) type (555). Since the 558 outputs are open-collector, pull-up resistors {{are required to}} [...] "pull up" [...] the output to the <b>positive</b> voltage <b>rail</b> when the output is in a high state. This also means the high state won't be able to source as much current as the low state.|$|R
5000|$|Central {{line with}} tunnels of 11 ft, {{increased}} on curves, reduced to 11 ft near to stations. This makes Central line trains unique on the London Underground system because although the loading gauge {{of the rolling}} stock {{is the same as}} the other 'tube' lines, the smaller size of the tunnel requires that the <b>positive</b> conductor <b>rail</b> is 1.6 in higher than on all other lines.|$|R
5000|$|For instance, if the Schmitt trigger is {{currently}} in the high state, the output {{will be at the}} <b>positive</b> power supply <b>rail</b> (+VS). The output voltage V+ of the resistive summer can be found by applying the superposition theorem: ...|$|R

50|$|The {{traction}} current has no direct earth point, {{but there are}} two resistors connected across the traction supply. The centre tap of the resistors is earthed, establishing the reference point between the positive and negative rails by voltage division. The resistors are large enough to prevent large currents flowing through the earthed infrastructure. The positive resistor is twice as large as the negative resistor, since the <b>positive</b> <b>rail</b> carries twice the voltage of the negative rail.|$|E
50|$|The {{system is}} in {{unstable}} equilibrium if both the inputs and outputs of the comparator are at zero volts. The moment any sort of noise, be it thermal or electromagnetic noise brings {{the output of the}} comparator above zero (the case of the comparator output going below zero is also possible, and a similar argument to what follows applies), the positive feedback in the comparator results in the output of the comparator saturating at the <b>positive</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both {{introduced}} electric {{units on}} the inner circle until later that day a Met multiple unit overturned the <b>positive</b> current <b>rail</b> on the District and the Met service was withdrawn. An incompatibility {{was found between the}} way the shoe-gear was mounted on Met trains and the District track and Met trains were withdrawn from the District and modified. Full electric service started on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from 70 to 50 minutes.|$|R
2500|$|The Board of Trade {{refused to}} allow trains with an {{electric}} locomotive at the head and tail as this would require power lines {{the length of the}} train so thirty-two larger locomotives were ordered, although the CLR only received 28. These were camel backed with four [...] motors mounted on two bogies. Manned in the centre cab by a driver and second man, who would uncouple and couple the locomotive {{at the end of each}} journey, the locomotives took power from a <b>positive</b> centre <b>rail</b> at 500–550VDC.|$|R

50|$|Intuitively, this {{behavior}} can be also understood by realizing that the base-emitter voltage in the bipolar transistor is very insensitive to bias changes, so any change in base voltage is transmitted (to good approximation) directly to the emitter. It depends slightly on various disturbances (transistor tolerances, temperature variations, load resistance, collector resistor if it is added, etc.) since the transistor reacts to these disturbances and restores the equilibrium. It never saturates even if the input voltage reaches the <b>positive</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inputs both logical ones. When all the inputs {{are held}} at high voltage, the base-emitter {{junctions}} of the multiple-emitter transistor are reverse-biased. Unlike DTL, a small “collector” current (approximately 10µA) is drawn {{by each of}} the inputs. This is because the transistor is in reverse-active mode. An approximately constant current flows from the <b>positive</b> <b>rail,</b> through the resistor and into {{the base of the}} multiple emitter transistor. This current passes through the base-emitter junction of the output transistor, allowing it to conduct and pulling the output voltage low (logical zero).|$|E

5000|$|To {{compare the}} two versions, the circuit {{operation}} will be considered at the same conditions as above. If the Schmitt trigger is currently in the high state, the output {{will be at the}} <b>positive</b> power supply <b>rail</b> (+VS). The output voltage V+ of the voltage divider is: ...|$|R
50|$|Overdriven. If {{the input}} {{differential}} voltage changes significantly (more than {{about a hundred}} millivolts), the transistor driven by the lower input voltage turns off and its collector voltage reaches the <b>positive</b> supply <b>rail.</b> At high overdrive the base-emitter junction gets reversed. The other transistor (driven by the higher input voltage) drives all the current. If the resistor at the collector is relatively large, the transistor will saturate. With relatively small collector resistor and moderate overdrive, the emitter can still follow the input signal without saturation. This mode is used in differential switches and ECL gates.|$|R
40|$|A linear CMOS VI-converter {{operating}} in strong inversion with a common-mode input {{range from the}} negative to the <b>positive</b> supply <b>rail</b> is presented. The circuit consists of three linear VI-converters based on the difference of squares principle. Two of these perform the actual V to I conversion, while the third changes the bias currents {{of the first two}} in response to changes in the input common-mode level. The resulting circuit has a large signal transconductance which is constant to within 3 % over the entire common-mode input range. It can operate from a single supply voltage of 2. 2 volt...|$|R
5000|$|In {{some cases}} (e.g., when {{the output of}} a TTL logic gate needs {{to be used for}} driving the input of a CMOS gate), the voltage level of the [...] "totem-pole" [...] output stage at output logical [...] "1" [...] can be {{increased}} closer to VCC by connecting an external resistor between the V3 collector and the <b>positive</b> <b>rail.</b> It pulls up the V5 cathode and cuts-off the diode. However, this technique actually converts the sophisticated [...] "totem-pole" [...] output into a simple output stage having significant output resistance when driving a high level (determined by the external resistor).|$|E
50|$|Class-D {{amplifiers}} {{place an}} additional requirement on their power supply, namely {{that it be}} able to sink energy returning from the load. Reactive (capacitive or inductive) loads store energy during part of a cycle and release some of this energy back later. Linear amplifiers will dissipate this energy away, class-D amplifiers {{return it to the}} power supply which should somehow be able to store it. In addition, half-bridge class D amps transfer energy from one supply rail (e.g. the <b>positive</b> <b>rail)</b> to the other (e.g. the negative) depending on the sign of the output current. This happens regardless of whether the load is resistive or not. The supply should either have enough capacitive storage on both rails, or be able to transfer this energy back.|$|E
50|$|When {{mains voltage}} TRIACs are {{triggered}} by microcontrollers, optoisolators are frequently used; for example optotriacs {{can be used}} to control the gate current. Alternatively, where safety allows and electrical isolation of the controller isn't necessary, one of the microcontroller's power rails may be connected one of the mains supply. In these situations it is normal to connect the neutral terminal to the <b>positive</b> <b>rail</b> of the microcontroller's power supply, together with A1 of the triac, with A2 connected to the live. The TRIAC's gate can be connected through an opto-isolated transistor, and sometimes a resistor to the microcontroller, so that bringing the voltage down to the microcontroller's logic zero pulls enough current through the TRIAC's gate to trigger it. This ensures that the TRIAC is triggered in quadrants II and III and avoids quadrant IV where TRIACs are typically insensitive.|$|E
50|$|The {{analogous}} connection {{used with}} MOS transistors is an open-drain connection. Open-drain outputs {{can be useful}} for analog weighting, summing, and limiting as well as digital logic. An open drain terminal is connected to ground when a high voltage (logic 1) {{is applied to the}} gate, yet presents a high impedance when a low voltage (logic 0) is applied to the gate. This high impedance state occurs because the terminal is at an undefined voltage (floating) thus such a device requires an external pull-up resistor connected to the <b>positive</b> voltage <b>rail</b> (logic 1) in order to provide a logic 1 as output.|$|R
5000|$|Instrumentation Amplifiers {{can also}} be {{designed}} using [...] "Indirect Current-feedback Architecture", which extend the operating range of these amplifiers to the negative power supply rail, {{and in some cases}} the <b>positive</b> power supply <b>rail.</b> This can be particularly useful in single-supply systems, where the negative power rail is simply the circuit ground (GND). Examples of parts utilizing this architecture are MAX4208/MAX4209 and AD8129/AD8130.|$|R
2500|$|All {{electrical}} equipment was shipped from the US, including power system plant equipment. A power station was {{built at the}} Shore Road pumping station and was designed, anticipating extension of the electrification to the Wirral Railway, although this was not to occur until 1938. The conductor rails were fed direct, without any distribution. Four rail 600V DC electrification was installed, the <b>positive</b> outer <b>rail</b> set [...] from the running rail. The new multiple units had British wooden bodies on US bogies; 24 motor cars and 33 trailer cars were provided and trains were initially 2-car or 4-car sets. The driving positions controlled all the motors on the train by the means of a low voltage control signal.|$|R
50|$|Early MOS logic had one {{transistor}} type, {{which is}} enhancement mode {{so that it}} can act as a logic switch. Since suitable resistors were hard to make, the logic gates used saturated loads; that is, to make the one type of transistor act as a load resistor, the transistor had to be turned always on by tying its gate to the power supply (the more negative rail for PMOS logic, or the more <b>positive</b> <b>rail</b> for NMOS logic). Since the current in a device connected that way goes as the square of the voltage across the load, it provides poor pullup speed relative to its power consumption when pulled down. A resistor (with the current simply proportional to the voltage) would be better, and a current source (with the current fixed, independent of voltage) better yet. A depletion-mode device with gate tied to the opposite supply rail is a much better load than an enhancement-mode device, acting somewhere between a resistor and a current source.|$|E
5000|$|The ECL {{circuits}} usually {{operate with}} negative power supplies (positive {{end of the}} supply is connected to ground) in contrast to other logic families in which negative end of the supply is grounded. This is done mainly to minimize {{the influence of the}} power supply variations on the logic levels as ECL is more sensitive to noise on the VCC and relatively immune to noise on VEE. Because ground should be the most stable voltage in a system, ECL is specified with a positive ground. In this connection, when the supply voltage varies, the voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (in the case of emitter constant current source, they do not change at all). As the collector resistors are firmly [...] "tied up" [...] to ground, the output voltages [...] "move" [...] slightly (or not at all). If the negative end of the power supply was grounded, the collector resistors would be attached to the <b>positive</b> <b>rail.</b> As the constant voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (or not at all), the output voltages follow the supply voltage variations and the two circuit parts act as constant current level shifters. In this case, the voltage divider R1-R2 compensates the voltage variations to some extent. The positive power supply has another disadvantage - the output voltages will vary slightly (±0.4 V) against the background of high constant voltage (+3.9 V). Another reason for using a negative power supply is protection of the output transistors from an accidental short circuit developing between output and ground (but the outputs are not protected from a short circuit with the negative rail).|$|E
40|$|The TLV 271 {{operational}} amplifier provides rail−to−rail output operation. The output can swing within 320 mV to the <b>positive</b> <b>rail</b> and 50 mV {{to the negative}} rail. This rail−to−rail operation enables the user to make optimal use of the entire supply voltage range while taking advantage of 3 MHz bandwidth. The TLV 271 can operate on supply voltage as low as 2. 7 V over the temperature range of − 40 °C to 105 °C. The high bandwidth provides a slew rate of 2. 4 V/�s while only consuming 550 �A of quiescent current. Likewise the TLV 271 can run on a supply voltage as high as 16 V making it ideal for {{a broad range of}} battery−operated applications. Since this is a CMOS device it has high input impedance and low bias currents making it ideal for interfacing {{to a wide variety of}} signal sensors. In addition it comes in a small TSOP− 5 package with two pinout styles allowing for use in high−density PCB’s...|$|E
2500|$|Washington, DC, PCCs were unique {{because of}} conduit plows which {{collected}} current from a slot between the rails {{into which the}} plow dipped, contacting <b>positive</b> and negative <b>rails</b> under the street on either side. At the city limits were [...] "plow pits", where the plow was dropped and removed, the trolley pole raised, and the car then continued on its way, utilizing overhead wire; the process was reversed {{in the opposite direction}} into Washington.|$|R
50|$|A MOSFET {{can be made}} {{to operate}} as a resistor, so the whole circuit can be made with {{n-channel}} MOSFETs only. NMOS circuits are slow to transition from low to high. When transitioning from high to low, the transistors provide low resistance, and the capacitive charge at the output drains away very quickly (similar to discharging a capacitor through a very low resistor). But the resistance between the output and the <b>positive</b> supply <b>rail</b> is much greater, so the low to high transition takes longer (similar to charging a capacitor through a high value resistor). Using a resistor of lower value will speed up the process but also increases static power dissipation. However, a better (and the most common) way to make the gates faster is to use depletion-mode transistors instead of enhancement-mode transistors as loads. This is called depletion-load NMOS logic.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the tape}} device the read head signal is fed into an {{operational}} amplifier (1) whose output signal is DC-filtered. Op-amp (2) amplifies and feeds an RC-filter. Op-amp (3) amplifies the signal again {{followed by another}} DC-filter. Op-amp (4) amplifies the signal into clipping the sine formed signal. The <b>positive</b> and negative <b>rails</b> for all op-amps are wired to +5V DC and GND. The clipped signal therefore fits into the TTL electrical level window of the schmitt trigger step that in turn feeds the digital cassette port.|$|R
