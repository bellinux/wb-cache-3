40|$|The {{ability of}} {{mononuclear}} phagocytes (MPh) to manifest procoagulant activity (PCA) {{resulting in the}} formation of fibrin is thought to be a key MPh effector function in tissue repair. The present study addresses the question of whether monocyte PCA is confined to tissue hypersensitivity reactions or is a general correlate of all immune responses. We show here that PCA is not the obligate outcome when the immune system is stimulated. In particular, under in vitro conditions in which a mitogen (phytohemagglutinin) or an antigen (<b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> of <b>tuberculin)</b> elicits good PCA responses, incubation with influenza virus does not result in the generation of PCA, although other parameters of response to the virus appear to be intact. Moreover, influenza virus can cause suppression of PCA when cultures are stimulated with either phytohemagglutinin, <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> of <b>tuberculin,</b> or endotoxin, conditions which would otherwise result in good PCA responses. This lack of PCA persists throughout the culture period and is not caused by an effect of influenza virus on the viability of either MPh or leukocytes in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{effects of}} tuberculin in an organism infected with tubercle bacilli {{are due to}} {{an unknown number of}} different substances, which are present in varying concentrations in different tuberculin preparations. Consequently, the response to tuberculin tests with various products is likely to vary with the biological material, the test technique, the tuberculin dose, etc., and potency estimates of tuberculin products will depend to a considerable extent on how the assessment is made. The present paper describes an experiment in which this dependence was demonstrated in the case of two <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> <b>tuberculin</b> preparations (RT 23 and PPD-Weybridge). The potency ratio of these products was found to vary widely according to whether it was determined in humans by the Pirquet test or in guinea-pigs by the Mantoux test, and the authors therefore conclude that tuberculin products must be assessed under the conditions in which they will subsequently be used...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} the study was to (1) {{determine}} the prevalence of significant abnormalities in routine chest x-rays used to screen for pulmonary tuberculosis in intravenous drug users and (2) evaluate the ability of the purified protein derivative skin test to identify persons with such abnormalities. METHODS. We conducted a cross-sectional screening study on 1314 persons admitted to an opiate detoxification unit in an urban jail. <b>Purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> <b>tuberculin</b> reactivity and the prevalence of abnormalities consistent with tuberculosis on screening chest x-rays were evaluated. The chest x-ray was obtained independent of the skin test. RESULTS. The chest x-rays of 73 of the inmates (5. 6 %) showed abnormalities consistent with tuberculosis. Tuberculin skin testing missed 17 of 26 chest x-rays (65 %) with significant infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS. Purified protein derivative screening is insensitive to chest x-ray abnormalities that require additional diagnostic evaluation for tuberculosis. Routine chest studies should be performed on all intravenous drug users admitted to congregate housing settings...|$|E

Visual acuities were 1. 0 in his right eye and 0. 3 in his left eye. Ophthalmologic examination was normal for the right eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed 2 + cells in the vitreous without anterior chamber reaction in his left eye. Fundus examination revealed occlusive vasculitis and granuloma.

40|$|Delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} (DTH) {{reactions are}} initiated by sensitized T cells. Their progression {{is dependent upon}} the local release of various autacoids, including cytokines and eicosanoids, by T cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and resident tissue cells. 12 (R) -hydroxy- 5, 8, 14 -eicosatrienoic acid [12 (R) -HETrE], an cicosanoid produced by skin and cornea, possesses potent proinflammatory properties at picomolar concentrations including vasodilation, increase in membrane permeability, neutrophil chemotaxis, and angiogenesis. Because DTH reactions are associated with many of these same phenomena, we examined the effect of 12 (R) -HETrE and related 12 -hydroxyeicosanoids on the expression of DTH to <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> of <b>tuberculin</b> in sensitized guinea pigs. In the absence of <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> of <b>tuberculin,</b> none of the eicosanoids evoked erythema or edema after intradermal injection at doses up to 100 pmol. When injected together with <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> of <b>tuberculin,</b> 12 (R) -hydroxy- 5, 8, 10, 14 -eicosatetraenoic acid [12 (R) -HETE], but not its enantiomer 12 (S) -HETE, significantly inhibited macroscopic expression of delayed reactivity (erythema) only at the highest dose tested, 10 pmol. In contrast, 12 (R) -HETrE significantly enhanced expression of DTH at doses between 1 fmol and 1 pmol (50 % and 30 % increases above control, respectively). Its stereoisomer, 12 (S) -HETrE, did not enhance DTH at any tested dose, but was able to block the activity of 12 (R) -HETrE when injected simultaneously. Enhancement or inhibition of visible skin responses {{was not associated with}} qualitative or quantitative changes in cellular infiltrates at the reaction site. 12 (R) -HETrE had no effect on the nonimmunologic inflammatory skin reaction induced by phorbol myristate acetate, suggesting selectivity toward DTH. We conclude that 12 (R) -HETrE enhances DTH via a yet to be determined mechanism and that its stereo-isomer, 12 (S) -HETrE, may be a useful antagonist for studying the inflammatory actions of this eicosanoid...|$|R

Immune lysis of these PPD-sensitized MLV was studied {{in the presence of}} a hyperimmune anti-M. tuberculosis sheep serum using a specific pathogen-free rabbit serum as a source of complement. A 50 % release of encapsulated calcein was observed spectrofluorometrically after 30 min and remained unchanged up to 2 h. The release of calcein in the absence of complement or of anti-H 37 Rv serum or by liposomes which did not contain PPD never exceeded 1 - 2 %. Liposomes formed in PPD solution were more sensitive to anti-H 37 Rv serum than preformed liposomes exposed to PPD. Trials with human sera from ten tuberculous patients revealed the presence of specific lytic immunoglobulins. In the presence of sera from skin test negative, non-tuberculous subjects, calcein release was significantly lower.

40|$|A major {{drawback}} {{of current}} whole-cell vaccines for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis is the interference with diagnostic tests for bovine tuberculosis (TB) and paratuberculosis. The {{current study was}} designed to explore the effects of immunization with a heat-killed whole-cell vaccine (Mycopar) on diagnostic test performance and to characterize host immune responses to vaccination over a 12 -month period. Neonatal dairy calves were assigned to treatment groups consisting of (i) controls, not vaccinated (n = 5), and (ii) vaccinates, vaccinated with Mycopar vaccine (n = 5). The results from this study demonstrated a rapid initiation of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ) in vaccinated calves by 7 days, with robust responses throughout the study. Vaccinated calves also had responses to M. bovis <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (BoPPD) but minimal reactivity to ESAT- 6 /CFP- 10, an M. bovis recombinant fusion protein. The levels of antigen-specific interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and IL- 10 were markedly decreased in vaccinated calves between days 7 and 90 of the study but thereafter were similar to the levels in controls. Vaccinated calves began to seroconvert at 4 months, with 4 / 5 calves having detectable M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis antibody by 6 months. The responses in test platforms for bovine TB were negligible in the vaccinate group, as only one calf had a response, which was in the suspect range of the comparative cervical skin test. Serum antibody responses to M. bovis antigens ESAT- 6, CFP- 10, and MPB 83 were negative on the Vet TB STAT-PAK, DPP VetTB, and DPP BovidTB tests. These results suggest that the Mycopar vaccine will interfere with diagnostic tools for paratuberculosis but result in low interference with the comparative cervical skin test and emerging serologic tests for M. bovis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{association}} of anergic pulmonary tuberculosis with Vδ 2 (+) T cells and related cytokine levels. METHODS: 82 pulmonary tuberculosis patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to their <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> <b>tuberculin</b> skin test (TST) results: 39 with TST-negative anergic pulmonary tuberculosis and 43 with TST-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, while 40 healthy volunteers were used as control. Based on chest X-ray results, the tuberculosis lesions were scored according to their severity, with a score of ≤ 2. 5 ranking as mild, 2. 5 - 6 as moderate and ≥ 6 as severe. The Vδ 2 (+) T cell percentage and their expression levels of the apoptosis-related membrane surface molecule FasL in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were analyzed by flow cytometry, while IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6 and IL- 10 cytokine and γ-interferon (γ-IFN) concentrations in peripheral blood were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Most of the patients with chest X-ray lesion scores higher than 6 belonged to the anergic tuberculosis group (P< 0. 05). Anergic pulmonary tuberculosis patients displayed reduced peripheral blood Vδ 2 (+) T cell counts (P< 0. 05) and higher FasL expression in peripheral blood Vδ 2 (+) T cells (P < 0. 05). The Vδ 2 (+) T cell percentages in the BALF of all tuberculosis patients were lower than in their peripheral blood (P < 0. 05), and IL- 4 and IL- 10 concentrations in peripheral blood of anergic tuberculosis patients were higher than in TST-positive tuberculosis patients and healthy controls (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Anergic pulmonary tuberculosis is accompanied by reduced Vδ 2 (+) T cell percentage, and elevated Vδ 2 (+) T cell FasL expression as well as enhanced IL- 4 and IL- 10 levels in peripheral blood...|$|E

40|$|Currently Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) {{infection}} is diagnosed through indirect tests {{based on the}} immune response induced by the infection. The antigens commonly used in IFN-γ release assays (IGRA) are <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivative</b> <b>tuberculins</b> (PPD).

Ten recombinant proteins were selected as potential candidates for the detection of MAP infection in young goats. They were found to detect 25 to 75 % of infected shedder (IS) and infected non-shedder (INS) kids younger than 10 months of age. In comparison, PPD was shown to detect only 10 % of INS and no IS kids. For seven antigens, Se (21 – 33 %) and Sp (≥ 90 %) of IGRA were shown to be comparable with PPD at 20 months old. Only three antigens were suitable candidates to detect IS adult goats, although Se was lower than that obtained with PPD. In paratuberculosis-free herds, IGRA results were negative in 97 % of indoor goats and 86 % of outdoor goats using the 10 antigens.
