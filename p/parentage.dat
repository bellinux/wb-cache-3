5|$|From {{the point}} of view of taxonomy, hybrids differ {{according}} to their <b>parentage.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} hybrids are {{cultivated}} that have A. cepa <b>parentage,</b> {{such as the}} diploid tree onion or Egyptian onion (A. ×proliferum), and the triploid onion (A. ×cornutum).|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} {{possible}} <b>parentage</b> of Adonis, Apollodorus quotes Hesiod, who postulates that Adonis {{could be the}} child of Phoenix and Alphesiboia. He elaborates no further on this statement.|$|E
5|$|The Guardians of the Galaxy travel {{throughout}} the cosmos and {{struggle to keep}} their newfound family together while helping Peter Quill learn more about his true <b>parentage</b> and facing against new enemies.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{profiling}} is {{also used}} in DNA paternity testing to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent {{of a child with}} the probability of <b>parentage</b> is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare's <b>parentage</b> is unknown; in {{particular}} his relation with his predecessors Menkauhor Kaiu and Nyuserre Ini cannot be ascertained. Djedkare is generally {{thought to have}} been the son of Menkauhor Kaiu, but the two might instead have been brothers and sons of Nyuserre Ini. Another hypothesis suggests that Djedkare and Menkauhor could have been cousins, being sons of Nyuserre and Neferefre respectively.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids with Banksia marginata and B.integrifolia {{have been}} {{recorded}} at Nadgee Nature Reserve, where all three species occur. A study of an area of extensive hybridization between B.robur and B.oblongifolia at Barren Grounds Nature Reserve revealed some plants with morphology suggestive of B.paludosa in their <b>parentage,</b> and requiring further investigation.|$|E
5|$|Lennon started {{visiting the}} Dykins' house in 1951. After {{the death of}} Julia Lennon in 1958, Harriet and Norman Birch were {{appointed}} guardians of Julia and Jackie, ignoring Dykins' <b>parentage,</b> as he had never legally married their mother. Lennon invited the Dykins sisters to visit after {{the success of the}} Beatles, when he was living in Kenwood, Weybridge, with his then-wife, Cynthia Lennon.|$|E
5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} United States that was {{developed}} by crossing Spanish-American type gaited pinto ponies with gaited horse breeds, such as the Tennessee Walking Horse. The result was a colorful, smooth-gaited horse, used in the show ring and for pleasure and trail riding. Two registries have been created for the breed, one in 1979 {{and the other in}} 1985. The two have similar registration requirements, although one has an open stud book and the other is slightly more strict with regard to <b>parentage</b> requirements, having a semi-closed stud book. The Spotted Saddle Horse is a light riding horse, always pinto in color. Solid-colored foals from registered parents may be registered for identification purposes, so their pinto-colored foals have documented <b>parentage.</b> They always perform an ambling gait, rather than a trot, in addition to the gaits of walk and canter, performed by all breeds.|$|E
5|$|The exact <b>parentage</b> of Domentziolus is unclear: Phocas had two known brothers, Comentiolus {{and another}} also named Domentziolus, who has {{sometimes}} been suggested as the younger Domentziolus's father. Shortly after the accession of Phocas, in 603, the younger Domentziolus was raised to the titles of vir gloriosissimus, patricius and curopalates.|$|E
5|$|Whalebone was foaled in 1807 out of {{the mare}} Penelope, who was a {{daughter}} of Prunella. He raced for six years and won the Derby in 1810. He later sired two Derby winners, Lap-dog and Spaniel and Caroline, winner of the Oaks. He {{might have been the}} sire of Derby winner Moses, but Moses' <b>parentage</b> is uncertain due to his dam being covered by two stallions.|$|E
5|$|After Cimon's ostracism, Pericles {{continued}} {{to promote a}} populist social policy. He first proposed a decree that permitted the poor to watch theatrical plays without paying, with the state covering {{the cost of their}} admission. With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the archonship in 458–457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the Heliaia (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after 454BC. His most controversial measure, however, was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian <b>parentage</b> on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Dixon is {{a patron}} of the African-Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT) which is a {{voluntary}} charity, whose main aim {{is to increase the}} number of Black and Mixed <b>Parentage</b> people on the UK Bone Marrow Register. The members of the ACLT freely volunteer their time in attempting to raise awareness in the Black community; enabling potential donors to come forward and be involved in the process of offering hope and a healthy future to someone whose disorder may otherwise prove fatal. Dixon has also backed Nickelodeon's See Something, Say Something campaign, a UK anti-bullying initiative.|$|E
5|$|Edmund's fictitious {{continental}} origins {{were later}} expanded into legends which {{spoke of his}} <b>parentage,</b> his birth at Nuremberg, his adoption by Offa of Mercia, his nomination as successor to the king and his landing at Hunstanton on the North Norfolk coast to claim his kingdom. Other accounts state {{that his father was}} the king he succeeded, Æthelweard of East Anglia, who died in 854, apparently when Edmund was a boy of fourteen.|$|E
5|$|Female {{birds have}} sperm storage {{mechanisms}} that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against {{the possibility of}} infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the <b>parentage</b> of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
5|$|He has {{represented}} England at the under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-20 levels. In 2006, he scored {{what was then}} the fastest goal by a substitute in Premier League history, scoring after being on the pitch for 15 seconds. With an Indian father, he was also the first player of Indian <b>parentage</b> to play and score in the Premier League. A gambling addiction made him fall in severe debt and he had to seek professional help to overcome his addiction.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented the eggs {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based on the large size of the eggs and the largely overlapping distribution. However, the discovery of an oviraptorid embryo inside an elongatoolithid egg cast doubt on this hypothesis. With the discovery of multiple oviraptorosaur-elongatoolithid associations in the late 1990s, the eggs of elongatoolithids came to be accepted as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs. Oviraptorid <b>parentage</b> was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Carolina Marsh Tacky Association was formed. The {{association}} was developed {{through the efforts}} of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy working with owners and breed enthusiasts, with the goal of preserving and promoting the Marsh Tacky breed. The breed registry became a closed registry on August 18, 2010, and is maintained by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy Pedigree Registry. Although closed, outside horses can be registered upon proof of origin, visual inspection and DNA confirmation of <b>parentage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism; the rock has been pressure-cooked. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally sedimentary and igneous rocks with large quantities of quartz and feldspar mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted schist and gneiss, making their original <b>parentage</b> almost unrecognizable. Radiometric dating gives an age of 1700 million years for the metamorphism, placing it in the early part of the Proterozoic eon.|$|E
5|$|Nico di Angelo: The 10-year-old demigod son of Hades {{and older}} sister Bianca di Angelo are rescued from a manticore by Percy, Annabeth, Thalia, and Grover. He is left at camp during the quest, but {{stays in the}} Hermes cabin because his <b>parentage</b> {{has not yet been}} discovered. He leaves camp after hearing Percy broke his promise, letting Bianca die. Before he leaves, he sends an army of {{skeletal}} warriors back to the underworld.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parentage</b> : The Apollodorus {{responsible}} for the Library lists Troilus last of Priam and Hecuba's sons – a detail adopted in the later tradition – but then adds that {{it is said that}} the boy was fathered by Apollo. On the other hand, Hyginus includes Troilus {{in the middle of a}} list of Priam's sons without further comment. In the early Christian writings the Clementine Homilies, it is suggested that Apollo was Troilus' lover rather than his father.|$|E
5|$|Poniatowski {{was born}} on September 15, 1676, {{in the village of}} Chojnik, part of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. He was the son of Franciszek Poniatowski (1640/50 - 1691-95), łowczy podlaski in 1680 and cześnik wyszogrodzki in 1690, and wife (died 1673/74), Helena Niewiarowska, and the {{paternal}} grandson of one Jan Poniatowski, who died before 1676, although rumors regarding his <b>parentage</b> claimed that {{he was the son of}} Hetman Jan Kazimierz Sapieha by an unknown Polish Jewish woman, later adopted by Franciszek.|$|E
5|$|Third ending: The narrator re-appears {{outside the}} house at 16 Cheyne Walk and turns back his pocket watch by fifteen minutes. Events {{are the same as}} in the second-ending version until Charles meets Sarah, when their reunion is sour. The new ending does not make clear the <b>parentage</b> of the child and Sarah expresses no {{interest}} in reviving the relationship. Charles leaves the house, intending to return to the United States, wondering whether Sarah is a manipulative, lying woman who exploited him.|$|E
5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the justification of Heracles's divine <b>parentage,</b> so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E
5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling <b>parentage</b> is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|Another bombshell is {{dropped in}} Dimitri's {{life when he}} finds out that Anton Lang, who he {{believed}} to be the son of two Marick family employees, is really his son with his maid, Corvina Lang (Margaret Sophie Stein). Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father, but Corvina convinces him not to tell Anton the truth right away. Dimitri attempts to forge relationship with Anton so it will ease the shock of the news. Nevertheless, Anton, who had believed Corvina was his sister, doesn't take the news of his <b>parentage</b> well and marries Kendall to throw it in Dimitri's face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the manipulator that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri manage to work things out before Anton leaves town.|$|E
5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of <b>parentage</b> similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Ox, {{catching}} him alone, reveals Georges's true <b>parentage,</b> and persuades him {{to drink}} a magic potion {{that allows him to}} go beyond the limits of the probable and journey through the impossible. Eva, realizing what has happened, takes the potion and drinks some as well, so as not to desert Georges. A family friend, the dancing master Tartelet (from The School for Robinsons), is seduced by the opportunity to travel and drinks his own share of the potion before anyone can stop him. Ox sets off with all three travelers, while Volsius makes secret plans to come along and protect Georges from Ox's influence. Along the way, another Dane, Axel Valdemar, also gets mixed up into the journey and becomes a friend of Tartelet.|$|E
5|$|Her myths emphasise her bad {{temper and}} unhappiness, due to {{rejection}} {{by her father}} Shiva and her husband, and the hatred of her stepmother, Chandi (Shiva's wife, identified with Parvati in this context). In the Puranas, sage Kashyapa {{is considered to be}} her father, and not Shiva, although Lord Shiva is a father figure to her. Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees, but harsh to people who refused to worship her. Denied full godhead by her mixed <b>parentage,</b> Manasa's aim was to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 through 1988, {{while working}} in the CCMB, Singh {{established}} that this Bkm-derived probe {{could be used to}} generate individual specific DNA Fingerprints of humans for forensic investigations; and in 1988, he used that probe {{for the first time to}} solve a case of <b>parentage</b> dispute in India. In 1991, Singh produced the first DNA fingerprinting based evidence in an Indian Court to settle a disputed paternity. This was followed by DNA fingerprinting based resolution of hundreds of civil and criminal cases, including cases such as the assassination case(s) of Beant Singh and Rajiv Gandhi, Naina Sahni Tandoor murder case, Swami Premananda case, Swami Shraddhananda case, and Priyadarshini Mattoo murder case.|$|E
5|$|In 429 BC {{during the}} Plague of Athens, Pericles {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he burst into tears, and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian <b>parentage</b> on both sides. Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5|$|In June 1866 the Claimant {{moved to}} Sydney, {{where he was}} able to raise money from banks {{on the basis of a}} {{statutory}} declaration that he was Roger Tichborne. The statement was later found to contain many errors, although the birthdate and <b>parentage</b> details were given correctly. It included a brief account of how he had arrived in Australia: he and others from the sinking Bella, he said, had been picked up by the Osprey, bound for Melbourne. On arrival he had taken the name Thomas Castro from an acquaintance from Melipilla and had wandered for some years before settling in Wagga Wagga. He had married a pregnant housemaid, Mary Ann Bryant, and taken her child, a daughter, as his own; a further daughter had been born in March 1866.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual <b>parentage.</b> In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E
5|$|In recent history, on 5 January 2004, the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) in Pune was vandalised by 150 {{members of}} the Sambhaji Brigade, an {{organisation}} promoting {{the cause of the}} Marathas. The organisation was protesting against a derogatory remark made by the American author James Laine, on Shivaji's <b>Parentage</b> in his book, Shivaji: A Hindu King in an Islamic Kingdom. BORI was targeted because Srikant Bahulkar, a scholar at BORI, was acknowledged in Laine's book. The incident highlighted the traditionally uncomfortable Brahmin-Maratha relationship. Recently, the same organisation demanded the removal of Dadoji Konddeo from the Statue of Child Shivaji ploughing Pune's Land at Lal Mahal, Pune. They also threatened that if their demands were not met, they would demolish that part of statue themselves.|$|E
5|$|Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji {{was born}} Leon Dudley Sorabji in Chingford, Essex (now Greater London), on 14 August 1892. His father, Shapurji Sorabji, was a civil {{engineer}} of Parsi <b>parentage</b> from Bombay, India, born on 18 August 1863. His mother, Madeleine Marguerite Mathilde Sorabji (née Madeline Matilda Worthy; 13 August 1866– 5 May 1959), was English. She {{is said to have}} been a singer, pianist and organist, but no evidence has been found to support these claims. They married on 18 February 1892. Shapurji Sorabji had married in India in 1880 but, as no record of his first wife's death or his divorce from her has yet been traced, it is possible that he married the composer's mother bigamously.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{was born}} as Ludwig Alexander von Battenberg in Graz, Styria, {{the eldest son}} of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by his morganatic {{marriage}} to Countess Julia von Hauke. Because of his morganatic <b>parentage,</b> Louis was denied his father's rank in the Grand Duchy of Hesse; and, from birth, his style of Illustrious Highness and title of Count of Battenberg instead derived from the rank given to his mother {{at the time of}} her marriage. On 26 December 1858, he automatically became His Serene Highness Prince Louis of Battenberg when his mother was elevated to Princess of Battenberg with the style of Serene Highness, by decree of her husband's brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse.|$|E
