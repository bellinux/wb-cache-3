40|$|In most of {{the process}} industries, high {{pressure}} steam is utilized for many applications. The steam is produced in the boilers and carried through steam pipe lines to the process plants. During their travel through these pipelines, loss may occur due to loss of <b>pressure,</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> insulation failures and loss of temperature. These are known as losses in steam network. This reduces steam efficiency, thus the quality of steam becomes low at the receiving end. Steam Traps are automatic valves designed to trap steam and remove condensate from the steam lines. Thus a perfect steam trap can minimise steam loss and thus maximise the steam efficiency and quality. The project is focused at steam trap analysis and rectification in the industry through a n exhaustive study of steam network. Based on the study, steam loss is calculated. Thus the investment and its payback period for {{the company is also}} calculated. O bv iously, the longer an efficient trap lasts, the more it reduces energy wasted, fuel burned and pollutants released into the air. The benefits are energy savings and a cleaner, improved environment...|$|E

Welding flux constitutes {{nearly half of the}} cost in SAW process. Over the years, development of better welding flux compositions in terms of mechanical properties and productivity, which are economically cost effective too, has caught the eye of many researchers. In the present paper research work carried out by various researchers in the field of welding flux development has been reviewed...|$|R
50|$|The two rock-fill dams {{were built}} {{to the east}} of the mountain´s ridge and a little {{upstream}} of the juncture of the Tungnaá and Kaldakvísl River. The NW-dam runs across the Kaldakvísl River and the SE-dam was constructed over the tail water from the Hrauneyjafoss Power Station. Both dams are around 25m high and have a total length of 1300m (170m and 1100m). The drill and blast headrace tunnel, which is 4 km long, 11,3m wide and 14,7m high, provides the turbines and the power plant with water from the new created intake Sporðalda reservoir. The tunnel transports the water through the mountain to a surge basin on the west side near the Sultartangi Reservoir, afterwards two 60m long steel <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> (steel <b>lined</b> penstocks) are moving the water into the station´s turbines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{the oil and}} gas industry, high <b>pressure</b> long {{distance}} <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> are widely used for efficient and effective movement of natural gas, oil and other petroleum products. The gases are transported at extremely high operating pressures that can range from 200 to 1600 PSI depending on the size and length of the <b>line</b> <b>pipe.</b> For operating safety, Hydrostatic test is used for confirming mechanical integrity of <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> and is applied to check for leakages before putting the <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> in use. The test aims to evaluate the point of failure of the material and assess the structural integrity of a welded pipe. In present work, an experiment is carried out to confirm weld integrity of two X 70 grade carbon steel pipes under the manufacturing process of hot rolling with left and right hand spiral plants. The tests are conducted at pressure in excess of the UTS of the steel / pipes and aimed to sustain the pressure as per API convention. Both the pipes attained the expected results; however the results of theoretical predicted pressure minutely diverge as the thickness variation is not considered...|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{acoustic}} leak monitoring are {{of great}} practical {{interest for the}} safety of <b>pressure</b> vessels and <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> not only at the primary circuit of nuclear power plants. In this report some aspects of acoustic leak localization at complicated three-dimensional topologies for the case of leakage monitoring at the reactor vessel head of a VVER- 440 are discussed. An acoustic method based on pattern recognition is being developed. During the learning phase, the localization classifier is trained with sound patterns that are generated with simulated leaks at all locations endangered by leak. After training unknown leak positions can be recognized through comparison with the training patterns. The sound patterns of the simulated leaks are simultaneously detected with an AE-sensor array and with high frequency microphones measuring structureborne sound and airborne noise, respectively. The initial results show the used classifiers principally to be capable of detecting and locating leaks, but they also show that further investigations are necessary to develop a reliable method...|$|R
40|$|For the {{analysis}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> system with multiple reservoirs, a numerical algorithm for initializing the flow in the system is developed.

Also, it determines the orientation and amount of the flow rate for an arbitrary given <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> system {{and a number of}} reservoirs. By comparing the presented method with a classical three-reservoir problem, it might be said that the proposed method performs a hydraulic head correction in junctions in an inverse way. The method is implemented in the computer code developed for {{the analysis}} of an arbitrary <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Guided wave {{ultrasonic}} is a {{new technology}} for <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> inspection for a long distance {{in a short time}} like Long Range Ultrasonic Test (LRUT). It uses ultrasound wavelet beyond the range of human hearing (10 - 100 KHz) for detecting local metal lost (corrosion) during conventional <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> inspection. The result of LRUT is A-scan which shows relation between signal amplitude and <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> distance. Each high amplitude signals except spurious signals is produced by a <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> feature like weld, flange or a local (external/internal) corrosion. Finding local metal loss is a normal goal in LRUT but during this study the relation between a defined Comparison Factor (Signal/Noise over Attenuation Factor) and <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> internal surface quality (thickness measurement variance in four location around the pipe) is excrementally investigated over a new and old pipeline in the same condition and it causes to introduce a method for predicting extended internal <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> quality.

30|$|To sum up, {{numerous}} studies on pipe and shell have been published. However, those studies {{based on the}} engineering background of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> of the centrifugal compressor are relatively fewer. So for the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> of the centrifugal compressor, free and forced vibration problems should be further discussed. This paper presented the study on the natural characteristics of <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> with SS-SS boundary condition using cylindrical shell model. Based on Sanders’ shell theory, the vibration differential equation was obtained by using the energy method. The displacement shape functions were assumed by beam functions in the axial direction and the trigonometric functions in the circumferential direction. The influences of length to radius ratio, thickness to radius ratio, circumferential wave number and pressure on natural characteristics were analyzed. In the end, the steady responses of the forced vibration for a specific pipe model were obtained and the modal shapes were illustrated to understand the break of the pipe. And the results would be signification {{for the design of}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> in the centrifugal compressor.|$|R

40|$|Performance {{testing of}} direct-tapped PVC <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> was {{conducted}} at the Utah Water Research Laboratory to verify and document its capabilities under cyclic pressure conditions. Twelve samples of nominal six-inch diameter, pressure class 150 PVC pipe, manufactured {{to satisfy the requirements}} of AWWA Standard C 900, were obtained from Uni-Bell Member producers. Five pipe samples were tapped and fitted with ¾ inch corporation stops under a line pressure of 80 +- 5 psi. Another five samples were tapped fitted with one inch corporation stops under a pressure of 150 psi. Only corporation stops complying with AWWA Standard C 800 were used. The remaining two pipe samples were not tapped, for use as controls. All twelve pipe samples were subjected to 1. 5 million pressure cycles ranging from 100 to 200 psi. A continuous record of the pressure cycles was kept and a red dye was added to the water in the test pipes so that even the smallest amount of leakage could easily be detected. These cyclic tests represent an extreme condition that pressure class 150 psi, C 900 PVC <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe,</b> would rarely be subjected to in service. To reach 1. 5 million <b>pressure</b> surges, the <b>pipe</b> would need to be in service 171 years if such surges occurred once every hour on the average. A nearly instantaneous 5. 7 fps flow velocity change would be needed to increment the internal pressure by 100 psi. This velocity change would occur, for example, if a flow rate of 525 gpm were stopped by complete closure of a valve in a nominal six-inch diameter PVC <b>pipe</b> <b>line.</b> No leakage or seepage developed around any of the threaded corporation stops during the testing through 1. 5 million cycles of pressures varying from 100 to 200 psi at two second intervals...|$|R
