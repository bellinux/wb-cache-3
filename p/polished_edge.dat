40|$|In a {{compartment}} fire, the breakage {{and possible}} fallout {{of a window}} glass has {{a significant impact on}} the fire dynamics. The thermal breakage of glass depends on various parameters such as glass type, edge shading, edges conditions and constraints on the glass. The purpose of the present study is to investigate some of the key parameters affecting the thermal breakage of window glass in fire conditions using a recently developed and validated computer tool. Fallout is not within the scope of this study. Different boundary conditions of the glass pane (unconstrained and constrained) subjected to fire radiant heat are investigated. The analysis shows that to prevent glass thermal breakage, it is important to provide enough spacing between the frame and glass pane to accommodate the thermal expansion, and constraints on the glass structure should be avoided. The zones where the glass is likely to crack first are shown. The study also quantifies the effects of glass edge conditions on its thermal breakage in fire conditions; such analysis has not been reported in the literature due to its complexity and the statistical nature of edge flaws. The results show that an ordinary float glass mostly used in windows, with the “as-cut” edge condition would break later and is stronger than a ground edge or <b>polished</b> <b>edge</b> glass for the scenarios investigated. The study demonstrates how a predictive tool could be employed for a better understanding of thermal breakage of window glass in fires and for design guidance...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} thermal cycling on the {{mechanical}} properties of composite materials {{is an important}} issue in engineering, especially in their applications to the space environment. The present study concerned with the experimental study of both the thermal cycling induced matrix cracking and the effect of thermal cycling on the matrix cracking behavior under tensile loading in CFRP laminates. Two kinds of carbon/epoxy systems, T 800 H/ 3631 and T 300 / 2500, are used for the laminate configurations of (0 / 90) s and (90 / 0) s. The specimens are thermally cycled between 196 and 100 C. Thermal cycling tests are performed up to 1000 cycles. The <b>polished</b> <b>edge</b> surfaces of specimens are examined by the replica technique, and then the matrix crack density is measured {{as a function of the}} number of thermal cycles. It is found that the first matrix cracking in (0 / 90) s and (90 / 0) s laminates occurs at almost the same numbers of thermal cycles. It is also found that the matrix crack density increases more rapidly in (0 / 90) s laminates than in (90 / 0) s laminates in both material systems. To investigate the effect of thermal cycling on matrix cracking behavior under tensile loading, a series of tensile tests on thermally cycled specimens are performed. The effect of thermal cycling on matrix cracking under tension is evaluated in terms of the change in the critical energy release rate and the critical stress for matrix cracking.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the work done}} in the period February 1993 through July 1993 on the 'Prediction of Thermal Cycling Induced Cracking In Polymer Matrix Composites' program. An oral presentation of this work was given to Langley personnel in September of 1993. This document was prepared for archival purposes. Progress studies have been performed {{on the effects of}} spatial variations in material strength. Qualitative agreement was found with observed patterns of crack distribution. These results were presented to NASA Langley personnel in November 1992. The analytical methodology developed by Prof. McManus in the summer of 1992 (under an ASEE fellowship) has been generalized. A method for predicting matrix cracking due to decreasing temperatures and/or thermal cycling in all plies of an arbitrary laminate has been implemented as a computer code. The code also predicts changes in properties due to the cracking. Experimental progressive cracking studies on a variety of laminates were carried out at Langley Research Center. Results were correlated to predictions using the new methods. Results were initially mixed. This motivated an exploration of the configuration of cracks within laminates. A crack configuration study was carried out by cutting and/or sanding specimens in order to examine the distribution of cracks within the specimens. These investigations were supplemented by dye-penetrant enhanced X-ray photographs. The behavior of thin plies was found to be different from the behavior of thicker plies (or ply groups) on which existing theories are based. Significant edge effects were also noted, which caused the traditional metric of microcracking (count of cracks on a <b>polished</b> <b>edge)</b> to be very inaccurate in some cases. With edge and configuration taken into account, rough agreement with predictions was achieved. All results to date were reviewed with NASA Langley personnel in September 1993...|$|E
40|$|Interest in tunable {{solid state}} lasers has grown rapidly {{from the initial}} {{demonstration}} of sources based on vibronic transitions broadened by strong electron-phonon coupling, such as those found for many transition metal ions in crystalline hosts. The properties of transition metal ions in insulating matrices have received renewed interest since the first demonstration of the Ti:Al 2 O 3 laser in 1982 [1]. This laser is based on electron transitions that can occur when a Ti 3 + ion is introduced at an octahedral site, presenting well-understood spectroscopic characteristics when uniformly doped in a sapphire crystal during the growth process. The broad fluorescence band, high absorption cross section and short lifetime have been extensively studied. The progress made {{in the understanding of}} the basic optical spectroscopic properties of similar systems provide the basis for technological achievements in the laser field, with new materials covering the near infra-red region. In this paper, the spectroscopic properties of a sapphire crystal locally doped with Ti by thermal indiffusion in an inert atmosphere are presented. The fluorescence spectrum for a diffused sample is found to extend from a wavelength of approximately 600 nm into the near infra-red, with a maximum at around 725 nm, and exhibits significant polarisation dependence. The lifetime of the diffused Ti ions is measured to be 3. 2 ± 0. 25 µs at room temperature. These results compare well with previously published data for bulk doped Ti:Al 2 O 3 [2] Spatially resolving the fluorescence spectrum at a <b>polished</b> <b>edge</b> of the sample shows that the Ti ions are contained within 1 µm of the surface and these results will be discussed {{in the light of the}} Ti diffusion profile obtained by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). These results demonstrate that Ti ions may be introduced into sapphire by thermal indiffusion, and the fluorescence spectrum shows that a significant proportion of the Ti is incorporated in the trivalent state following the diffusion process. Local doping of Ti 3 + by thermal diffusion in a sapphire host has enormous potential for the realisation of a broadly tunable active integrated optical source in a sapphire host...|$|E
40|$|Tensile {{static and}} tension-tension fatigue {{behaviour}} {{has been studied}} in coupon specimens made from continuous fibre reinforced glass/epoxy and carbon/epoxy laminates of various lay-ups, including a series of GFRP and CFRP 0, 90, 0 cross-ply laminates with different 90 ° ply thicknesses and CFRP 0, 90, +/- 45 laminates with different ply stacking sequences. A variety of techniques {{has been used to}} monitor the accumulation of damage; microscopy on the <b>polished</b> <b>edge</b> of coupons, penetrant-enhanced X-radiography for CFRP laminates and visual observations for the transparent GFRP laminates. Under static loading, mechanical properties and damage thresholds are established for the onset of events such as cracking in the 90 ' and 45 ° plies and delamination. The experimentally determined 90 ° ply cracking threshold strains agree with predictions based on fracture mechanics, provided residual thermal strains are taken into account. Fatigue failure data are obtained for the CFRP laminates and plotted as conventional S-logN curves. The fatigue behaviour of the CFRP laminates has also been described qualitatively using a form of fatigue life representation in terms of the predominant damage mechanisms observed during cyclic loading. A detailed study of transverse ply matrix cracking showed that the mode of crack propagation depended on the type of loading. Crack growth across the width of the ply was instantaneous under static loading and at high cyclic stresses. At low cyclic stresses, i. e. below the static cracking threshold, cracks initiated only after a number of cycles (dependent on the stress level) and then grew slowly across the width of the ply throughout the course of loading. Slow crack growth was also observed at high cyclic stresses when the density of full width cracks was high and the crack spacing was small. The crack growth rate was found to be independent of crack length and to depend on crack spacing and hence was strongly influenced by interactions between neighbouring cracks. Fatigue growth of individual cracks was modelled using an approach based on an expression for the stress intensity factor at the tip of a transverse ply crack and a Paris fatigue crack growth relationship...|$|E

40|$|The role of voids in {{composite}} failures has {{not been}} well understood or been characterized. This study presents {{the result of an}} investigation aimed at examining the mechanical behaviour of unidirectional carbon fibre-reinforced polymer matrix materials as used by the wind turbine industry. The experimental program investigates the effect of the void content, different manufacturing methods, type of loading (the three-point bending vs. the four-point bending) on the static strength and fatigue life under a flexural load. The four ply unidirectional carbon/epoxy composites were manufactured using the SPRINT and prepreg manufacturing methods. Manufacturing by these methods has successfully produced the composite materials with varied void contents and the voids are found to concentrate primarily in the area where the adjacent plies meet. The SPRINT materials contain voids in the range of 1. 63 - 2. 89 % while the prepreg laminates have an average void content of 3. 6 % for the debaulked laminates and 6. 8 % for the non-debaulked laminates. The voids in the SPRINT laminate are small and they are distributed inhomogeneously. The majority of the voids are less than 0. 04 mm 2 in size with a shape between a circle and an ellipse. The three point bending tests show that the flexural strength exponentially decrease as much as 6. 4 % for the SPRINT and 6 % for the prepreg for every 1 % increase of the void content. The similar void effect for both materials may be due to their similar microstructures. There is a similar effect on the increase in the void content for the flexural strength and the flexural fatigue sensitivity for both the three and four point bending tests. This means that the voids do not play any large role in the three-point bending as compared to the four point bending. The mechanism of failure is observed using the optical microscopy and the X-ray tomography of the <b>polished</b> <b>edge</b> and cross section of the area near the failure. The voids are found to interact with the cracks in both the static and fatigue failures. The image of the cross section near the failure area of the static test samples seem to suggest that the voids coalesce to each other under loading. By using the acoustic emission, it can be confirmed that a major failure occurs due to the fibre breakage. In addition, the acoustic emission results also show that the failure behaviour of the low and high void content specimens is significantly different.

40|$|International audienceSome {{parts of}} {{electrical}} machines are built from stacks of thin steel sheets, {{for which the}} coarse grain microstructure allows for minimizing magnetic losses. The fabrication process of these parts usually involves punching operations that generate important defects on the edges. Since these alterations {{may result in a}} degradation of the fatigue strength, this study aims at elaborating on a fatigue design strategy for such punched parts. To reach this objective, high cycle fatigue tests are performed on different specimens with either punched or <b>polished</b> <b>edges.</b> The results show a significant decrease of the fatigue strength for punched specimens. Scanning electron microscope observations of specimen facture surfaces reveal that defects on punched edges are at the origin of the fatigue cracks. The influence of temperature is also investigated. Fatigue tests are performed at ambient temperature (20 °C) and at 180 °C. According to the experimental results, no significant influence on the median fatigue strength is observed. Since crack initiation always occur on the edges, additional investigations are performed to characterize how edges are altered by punching operations. Residual stresses are determined on punched edges using x-ray diffraction techniques. As a consequence of punching, important tensile residual stresses exist along the loading direction. In association with the stress concentration caused by geometrical defects, residual stresses promote crack initiation and fast crack propagation. For a better understanding of crack initiation, edge geometries are scanned with a 3 D optical profilometer, allowing us to identify the critical defect.
