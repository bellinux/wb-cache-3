5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, <b>pinto</b> <b>beans,</b> kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E

25|$|In one study, H2S {{concentration}} {{was shown}} to correlate convincingly with perceived bad smell of flatus, followed by MM and DMS. This {{is supported by the}} fact that H2S may be the most abundant VSC present. These results were generated from subjects who were eating a diet high in <b>pinto</b> <b>beans</b> to stimulate flatus production. Others report that MM was the greatest contributor to the smell of flatus in patients not under any specific dietary alterations. It has now been demonstrated that MM, DMS and H2S (described as decomposing vegetables, unpleasantly sweet/wild radish and rotten eggs respectively) are all present in human flatus in concentrations above their smell perception thresholds. It is known that increased dietary sulfur-containing amino acids significantly increases the smell of flatus. It is therefore likely that the smell of flatus is created by a combination of VSC, with minimal contribution from non-sulfur volatiles. Such smell can also be caused by the presence of large numbers of microflora bacteria or the presence of faeces in the rectum. Diets high in protein, especially sulfur-containing amino acids, have been demonstrated to significantly increase the smell of flatus.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the intercropping of corn (Zea mays L.) and bean cultivars (Phaseolus spp.) an experiment {{was carried out in}} a randomized complete block design with three replicaties at Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University during growing season of 2010. The experimental treatments consisted of sole cropping of corn, white bean, bush <b>bean,</b> red <b>bean,</b> <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> and sword bean and 50 : 50 ratio of corn and bean types. In this experiment, the corn-bush bean and corn-pinto bean intercropping had the highest seed yield (5734. 4 and 5674. 3 kg/ha- 1, respectively) and land equivalent ratio (LER= 1. 13 and 1. 21, respectively). Evaluated intercropping indices indicated that red bean (k= 1. 85), <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> (k= 2. 41) and sword bean (k= 2. 80) had the highest crowding coefficient whereas the maximum aggressivity value was belonged to <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> intercropped with corn (A= - 0. 02). Also, both the red <b>bean</b> and <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> (CR= 0. 75 and CR= 0. 98, respectively) had the maximum competitive ratio. Furthermore, the most corn crowding coefficient (K= 1. 15) was belonged to corn and sword bean intercropping and maximum corn aggressivity value was observed in corn intercropped with white bean (A=+ 0. 60) and bush bean (A=+ 0. 69). In conclusion, according to competition indices, intercropping of 50 % corn + 50 % red <b>bean</b> and <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> plants were superior as compared to other combinations.

40|$|Common {{bacterial}} blight (CBB) {{caused by}} Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli reduces common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) yield and quality worldwide. Genetic resistance provides effective disease control; however, {{a high level}} of resistance is difficult to attain and does not exist in <b>pinto</b> <b>bean,</b> the most important dry bean market class in North America. Our objective was to determine if a backcross breeding approach with the aid of molecular markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to CBB in a donor parent could be used to attain higher levels of resistance to CBB in <b>pinto</b> <b>bean.</b> QTL conditioning CBB resistance from the donor parent XAN 159 were introgressed into the recurrent parent ‘Chase’ using classical backcross breeding and intermittent marker-assisted selection. ‘Chase’ <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> is moderately resistant and the breeding line XAN 159 is highly resistant to Xanthomonas campestris. Marker assays confirmed the presence of independent QTL from GN no. 1 Sel 27 and XAN 159 in advanced backcross-derived <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> lines with improved CBB resistance. Agronomic characteristics of ‘Chase’ were fully recovered in the backcross-derived lines. An important QTL for CBB resistance from XAN 159 on linkage group B 6 was not introgressed because tight linkage between this QTL and the dominant V allele that causes an unacceptable black-mottled seed coat color pattern in <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> could not be broken...|$|R

40|$|Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is {{currently}} being introduced for rainfed production in the Dark Brown soil zone in Saskatchewan. Insufficient water {{is one of the}} major factors limiting crop production in this soil zone. Ten <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes (Othello, Agate, GH 196 - 2, 6315, 5325, Earliray, Fiesta, ISB 82 - 354, UI 111 and Nodak) were exposed to drought stress in the field to study their rooting pattern under drought stress. Three <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes (Othello, Agate and GH 196 - 2) with an extensive root system in the deeper soil layers and three (Earliray, Fiesta and ISB 82 - 354) with a less extensive root system were exposed to drought stress and nonstress conditions in the growth room and in the field to study the relationship between rooting pattern and seed yield. In addition, three indeterminate <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes (Othello, Nodak and Fiesta) and three determinate genotypes (Agate, Agassiz and Earliray) were exposed to a soil moisture gradient to study the effects of soil moisture level on seed yield and other agronomic traits. Othello, Agate and GH 196 - 2 had an extensive root system in the deeper soil layers, whereas Earliray, Fiesta and ISB 82 - 354 had a less extensive root system in the deeper soil layers. An extensive root system in the deeper soil layers was associated with increased soil moisture depletion at those depths. Shoot dry mass, total root dry mass, mean root length density and root:shoot ratio were the same for the ten <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes. <b>Pinto</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes with an extensive root system (Othello, Agate and GH 196 - 2) in the deeper soil layers had higher seed yield compared to genotypes with a less extensive root system (Earliray, Fiesta and ISB 82 - 354) in the deeper soil layers in the field and in the growth room. Due to insufficient drought stress in the field, the rooting pattern of the six <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes was the same under irrigation and rainfed conditions. In the growth room, <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes with an extensive root system showed a stronger recuperative ability after a severe drought stress compared to genotypes with a less extensive root system. Root traits were positively correlated with seed yield under adequate soil moisture or where drought stress was relieved before maturity. Soil moisture deficit reduced number of pods per plant, plant height, seed weight, seed yield and seed nitrogen concentration of both determinate and indeterminate <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes. Indeterminate <b>pinto</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes had, on average, higher mean seed yield and showed a greater seed yield response to increasing soil moisture availability compared to determinate genotypes. However, the difference in seed yield of the two groups was small under high drought stress, except in the case of one very early maturing determinate genotype...|$|R
