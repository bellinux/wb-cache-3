50|$|Homo erectus {{migrated}} {{from out of}} Africa via the Levantine corridor and Horn of Africa to Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene, possibly {{as a result of}} the operation of the Saharan <b>pump,</b> <b>around</b> 1.9 million years ago, and dispersed throughout most of the Old World, reaching as far as Southeast Asia. The date of original dispersal beyond Africa virtually coincides with the appearance of Homo ergaster in the fossil record, and about half a million years after the appearance of the Homo genus itself and the first stone tools of the Oldowan industry.Key sites for this early migration out of Africa are Riwat in Pakistan (~2 Ma?), Ubeidiya in the Levant (1.5 Ma) and Dmanisi in the Caucasus (1.81 ± 0.03 Ma, p = 0.05).|$|E
50|$|Historical {{migration}} of human populations {{begins with the}} movement of Homo erectus out of Africa across Eurasia about a million years ago. Homo sapiens appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 70,000 years ago, and had spread across Australia, Asia and Europe by 40,000 years. Early members of the Homo genus, i.e. Homo ergaster, Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis, migrated from Africa during the Early Pleistocene, possibly {{as a result of}} the operation of the Saharan <b>pump,</b> <b>around</b> 1.9 million years ago, and dispersed throughout most of the Old World, reaching as far as Southeast Asia. Modern humans, Homo sapiens, evolved in Africa up to 200,000 years ago and reached the Near East around 70 millennia ago.

50|$|When {{blood vessels}} connect {{to form a}} region of diffuse {{vascular}} supply it is called an anastomosis (pl. anastomoses). Anastomoses provide critical alternative routes for blood to flow in case of blockages. There is a layer of muscle surrounding the arteries and the veins which help contract and expand the vessels.

50|$|The Semitic {{family is}} a member of the larger Afroasiatic family, all of whose other five or more {{branches}} have their origin in North Africa or the Maghreb. Largely for this reason, the ancestors of Proto-Semitic speakers were originally believed by some to have first arrived in the Middle East from North Africa, possibly as part of the operation of the Saharan <b>pump,</b> <b>around</b> the late Neolithic. Diakonoff sees Semitic originating between the Nile Delta and Canaan as the northernmost branch of Afroasiatic. Blench even wonders whether the highly divergent Gurage languages indicate an origin in Ethiopia (with the rest of Ethiopic Semitic a later back migration). Identification of the hypothetical proto-Semitic region of origin is therefore dependent on the larger geographic distributions of the other language families within Afroasiatic, whose origins are also hotly debated. According to Christy G. Turner II, there is an archaeological and physical anthropological reason for a relation between the modern Semitic-speaking populations of the Levant and the Natufian culture.|$|E

5000|$|The screw {{was one of}} {{the last}} of the simple {{machines}} to be invented.

[...] Archimedes was first to study the screw as a machine, so he is sometimes considered the inventor of the screw. Greek philosophers defined the screw as one of the simple machines and could calculate its (ideal) mechanical advantage. For example, Heron of Alexandria (52 AD) listed the screw as one of the five mechanisms that could [...] "set a load in motion", defined it as an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, and described its fabrication and uses,including describing a tap for cutting female screw threads.|$|E

However, this scheme induces a particularly fast and intense photo-darkening, enough to prevent amplification in the short wavelengths region (0. 45 e 0 : 9 mm). To mitigate this effect, we co-dope the fibres with cerium or lanthanum ions. By characterizing the steady state values of photo-darkening and its characteristic times, we demonstrate the beneficial role of Ce and La on the bleaching mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The FCC process {{continues}} {{as one of}} the major refinery technologies despite changes in refinery operations. The main fractionator/vapor recovery systems associated with many FCC units have the potential for significant gains in energy efficiency and product recovery through revamping. Older FCCU designs did not take full advantage of the heat available in the main fractionator. These older designs typically reject large amounts of heat to air or water cooling while using steam to reboil towers in the vapor recovery unit. By selecting the proper location and rates of side <b>pump</b> <b>around</b> streams, heat available in the main column can be used to reboil most or all of the VRU towers. Revamps of this type may be undertaken as stand alone energy conservation projects or {{as part of a larger}} revamp aimed at improving the recovery of marketable products. This paper will give examples of an older design with relatively inefficient heat utilization and a newer design incorporating recent trends in heat recovery. A case study describing an actual revamp of a main fractionator/VRU system will illustrate the potential for increased energy efficiency and improved product recovery...|$|E
40|$|The instant {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a peristaltic pump for critical laboratory or hospital applications requiring precise flow rates {{over an extended period}} of time. Within the cylindrical barrel pump housing is a single-piece, molded, elastometric, cylindrical liner with a multiplicity of flattened helical channels created therein from one end of the liner to the other. Three cylindrical rollers rotate about the center axis of the <b>pump</b> <b>around</b> the inside surface of the liner selectively compressing the liner, and hence the helical channels between the rollers and the barrel housing, creating a pumping action by forcing trapped fluid in the helical channels axially from one end of the liner to the opposite end. The novelty of the invention appears to lie in the provision of the special liner with multiple helical channels as the pumping chamber, rather than the standard single elastomeric tubing which is squeezed repeatedly by rollers to move the liquid through a typical peristaltic pump. Large, repeated deflections on the standard tubing causes a permanent set in the tubing, thus either changing the flow rate, or requiring a new section of tubing to be positioned in the pump head. Further, this configuration minimizes the amount of outflow pulsation which is characteristic of a typical single tubing peristaltic pump...|$|E
