5|$|The uniform was regular SS M43 field-jacket issue, with a divisional collar patch {{showing an}} arm holding a scimitar over a swastika. On {{the left arm}} was a Croatian armshield (red-white {{chessboard}}) and on the right an Edelweiss flower patch. The chessboard armshield was controversial, especially with the imams, who, after crossing the Sava river, removed them. Former SS personnel serving in the division were entitled to wear a Sig Rune badge that {{was attached to the}} left breast <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunic.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E

500|$|Some sponges {{overcome}} this limitation by adopting the [...] "syconoid" [...] structure, {{in which the}} body wall is pleated. <b>The</b> inner <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pleats are lined with choanocytes, which connect to <b>the</b> outer <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pleats by ostia. This increase in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> choanocytes and hence in pumping capacity enables syconoid sponges {{to grow up to}} a few centimeters in diameter.|$|R

25|$|Plain {{black and}} white plastic name tags may be worn above the right breast <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dress and service uniforms only when {{mandated}} by the commanding officer. This is usually seen by instructors at schools or conferences, by recruiters, and by drill instructors or NROTC advisors.|$|E
25|$|Glucose oxidase (GOX) catalyzes the {{oxidation}} of β-D-glucose to D-glucono-δ-lactone {{with the}} simultaneous reduction of enzyme-bound flavin. GOX exists as a homodimer, with each subunit binding one FAD molecule. Crystal structures show that FAD binds {{in a deep}} <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme near the dimer interface. Studies showed that upon replacement of FAD with 8-hydroxy-5-carba-5-deaza FAD, the stereochemistry of the reaction was determined by reacting with the re face of the flavin. During turnover, the neutral and anionic semiquinones are observed which indicates a radical mechanism.|$|E

25|$|P.R.A.Y. has {{developed}} several other awards {{that are not}} specifically recognized by the BSA. Mentors may be recognized by a pin or pendant that may be worn on non-Scouting apparel. There is also a four-star recognition pin for youth who have earned all four levels of their program. Other groups may have similar awards for individuals and units that are not listed through P.R.A.Y. If approved by the local council, they may be worn as temporary insignia on the right <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scout uniform.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} ATP {{competitive}} small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib (Gleevec) in CML, patients rapidly develop resistance. In {{the case of}} erlotinib this typically occurs 8–12 months {{from the start of}} treatment. Over 50% of resistance is caused by a mutation in the ATP binding <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EGFR kinase domain involving substitution of a small polar threonine residue with a large nonpolar methionine residue (T790M). While proponents of the 'gatekeeper' mutation hypothesis suggest this mutation prevents the binding of erlotinib through steric hindrance, research suggests that T790M confers an increase in ATP binding affinity, thereby reducing the inhibitory efficacy of erlotinib.|$|E
25|$|One day, the {{landlord}} leaves his overcoat {{in the living}} room and in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overcoat is the key to Xi'er's cell. Zhang Ershen is determined to help Xi'er. She takes the key and opens the door for Xi'er, and she flees. Shortly, {{the landlord}} finds Xi'er missing, and sends his accomplice, Mu Renzhi, and other men to chase her. Xi'er comes to a river that stops her. She takes off a shoe and leaves it at the river side, and then hides in the bush. Mu Renzhi and his men find the shoe and assume that Xi'er has drowned herself in the river, and they report to the landlord as such.|$|E

25|$|The badge was {{presented}} in a paper packet {{with the name of}} the award printed on the outside. The award document that was to be awarded with it was the common type featuring the recipients name, rank, unit, and the authorizing signature of an officer. The Luftwaffe Panzer Badge was worn on the left <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunic and (as with all badges) could be worn on civilian clothes in miniature stickpin form. Both badge styles were awarded for three combat engagements on three different days. As mentioned above the silver wreathed versions were awarded to Panzer crews, repair crews, and the medical personnel attached to them, while the black wreathed version was awarded to Panzer grenadiers, armoured reconnaissance units, and their medical personnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{melatonin}} receptors {{consist of}} proteins around 40 kDa each. The MT1 receptor encodes 350 amino acids and the MT2 encodes 362 amino acids. The binding of melatonin and its analogues to the receptors {{is not fully}} known. The binding space for melatonin and analogues on the MT1 receptor is smaller than on the MT2. Investigations usually focus on two binding pockets, for the two side-chains. The binding <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5-methoxy group is more investigated than the other pocket. Researchers agree that the oxygen in the group binds to histidine (His) residues in transmembrane 5 (TM5) domain of the receptor with a hydrogen bond; His195 in MT1 and His208 in MT2. Another amino acid, valine 192 (Val), also participates in the binding of the 5-methoxy group by binding to the methyl portion of the group.|$|E
25|$|The Service Khaki uniform {{today is}} {{reserved}} for commissioned officers (grades O-1 through O-10), chief warrant officers (current grades W-2 through W-5, W-1 not in use) and chief petty officers (grades E-7 through E-9). It is a khaki button-up shirt and trousers, worn with a gold belt buckle. The shirt features two front flap pockets and a pointed collar. Ribbons are worn above the left <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shirt, with the warfare insignia above them. A nametag may be worn above the right pocket, and rank insignia is worn on the collar. The regulations for ribbons state the highest three awards, or all ribbons can be worn at once. There {{are two kinds of}} headgear authorized: a khaki combination cap is standard, but a khaki garrison cover is also authorized. Currently black and brown oxford shoes are authorized for all officers and CPOs. However, tradition and social pressure tend to restrict the wearing of brown shoes to members of the aviation community. Females are authorized to wear the same over-blouse as junior enlisted sailors.|$|E

25|$|Through {{methods such as}} X-ray {{crystallography}} and NMR spectroscopy, {{the information}} about 3D structures of target molecules has increased dramatically, and so has structural information about the ligands. This drives rapid development of structure-based drug design. Some of these new drugs target membrane receptors. Current approaches to structure-based drug design {{can be divided into}} two categories. The first category is about determining ligands for a given receptor. This is usually accomplished through database queries, biophysical simulations, and the construction of chemical libraries. In each case, a large number of potential ligand molecules are screened to find those fitting the binding <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receptor. This approach is usually referred to as ligand-based drug design. The key advantage of searching a database is that it saves time and power to obtain new effective compounds. Another approach of structure-based drug design is about combinatorially mapping ligands, which is referred to as receptor-based drug design. In this case, ligand molecules are engineered within the constraints of a binding pocket by assembling small pieces in a stepwise manner. These pieces can be either atoms or molecules. The key advantage of such a method is that novel structures can be discovered.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Fate of Atlantis {{is set in}} 1939, {{on the eve of}} World War II. At the request of a visitor named Mr. Smith, {{archaeology}} professor and adventurer Indiana Jones tries to find a small statue in the archives of his workplace Barnett College. After Indy retrieves the horned figurine, Smith uses a key to open it, revealing a sparkling metal bead inside. Smith then pulls out a gun and escapes with the two artifacts, but he loses his coat in the process. The identity card inside reveals [...] "Smith" [...] to be Klaus Kerner, an agent of the Third Reich. Another <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coat holds an old magazine containing an article about an expedition on which Jones collaborated with a young woman named Sophia Hapgood, who has since given up archeology to become a psychic.|$|E
500|$|Gaiman began {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} the Kirby Sandman series in issue No. 11 (December 1989), including the changes implemented by Roy Thomas. Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher had treated the character, who resembled a superhero, as the [...] "true" [...] Sandman. The Thomas and Gaiman stories revealed that the character's existence was a sham created by two nightmares who had escaped to a <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dreaming. Brute and Glob would later attempt this again on Sanderson Hawkins, sidekick to Wesley Dodds, the Golden Age Sandman. Gaiman gave Jed Walker a surname and made him related to several new characters. The Thomas Sandman was Hector Hall, who married the already-pregnant Fury in the Dreaming in Infinity, Inc. No. 51. It was explained that Dr. Garrett Sanford, the 1970s Simon and Kirby version of the Sandman, had gone insane from the loneliness of the Dream Dimension and taken his own life. Brute and Glob put the spirit of Hector Hall, which had been cast {{out of his own}} body into Sanford's body, and it eventually began to resemble Hall's. Fury, in her civilian guise as Lyta Hall was the only superhero recurring character in the series. Even at that, her powers had come to her via the Fury Tisiphone, and the Furies, under the euphemism, [...] "the Kindly Ones", a translation of [...] "Eumenides", a name they earned during the events of Aeschylus's Oresteia trilogy, are major characters in the series.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from June 25, 1910. It states: [...] "Bill Raymond, a convict, sentenced to a long term, {{is on his way}} to prison, in custody of the sheriff. A little girl [...] is a passenger in the same train. She shows that she feels sorry for the man. He in turn appreciates her sympathy. The train is wrecked, and the sheriff, who is handcuffed to Bill, is killed. Bill takes the key of the handcuffs from the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead man, frees himself, and is about to escape, when he notices that the little girl, abandoned by her nurse, is lying unconscious in the car, which is now on fire. The convict risks his life to save the child, and carries her out in his arms. He takes her to her nurse and is recognized by a policeman and taken in custody, his chance for freedom lost. The child, who is the daughter of the governor, although Bill does not know it, is restored to her parent. The nurse fears to mention the incident, and the governor does not know how his darling's life was saved. Later the governor goes to the state prison on a tour of inspection, and Nell accompanies him. She has some flowers which she wants to give to the prisoners. In her tour of the prison, she recognizes Bill. She tells her father about it, and he pardons the hero-convict on the spot...." ...|$|E
500|$|Each player {{carries a}} {{lacrosse}} stick measuring [...] long (a [...] "short crosse"), or [...] long (a [...] "long crosse"). In most modern circles the word crosse {{has been replaced}} by stick and the terms short stick and long stick or pole are used. The term crosse is still used is in the rulebook and in reference to a [...] "crosse check" [...] (a check where one's hands are spread on the crosse and the checker extends his arms into the checkee). On each team up to four players at a time may use a long crosse: the three defensemen and one midfielder. The crosse is made up of the head and the shaft (or handle). The head is roughly triangular in shape and is loosely strung with mesh or leathers and nylon strings to form a [...] "pocket" [...] that allows the ball to be caught, carried, and thrown. In field lacrosse, the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crosse is illegal if the top of the ball, when placed in the head of the stick, is below the bottom of the stick's sidewall. The head of a crosse may be [...] in length. The maximum width of the head across the top is , for international competition, or [...] according to NCAA regulations. The NCAA instituted stricter specifications to ensure the [...] "safety and integrity of the game." [...] As the shape of the crosse evolved, dislodging the ball from an opponent's crosse became more difficult, and defenders used an increased amount of force when checking. The rule change was intended to reduce injuries, as defenders would need less forceful checks in order to dispossess opponents.|$|E
