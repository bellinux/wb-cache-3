The curriculum in most subjects, including biology, geography and even arithmetic, was altered to change the focus to race. Military education became the central component of physical education and education in physics was oriented toward subjects with military applications, such as ballistics and aerodynamics. Students were required to watch all films prepared by the school division of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Racism, {{especially}} antisemitism, was {{a central}} feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples (the Nordic race) were considered by the Nazis to be the purest branch of the Aryan race and were therefore viewed as the master race. Millions of Jews and other peoples deemed undesirable by the state were murdered in the Holocaust. Opposition to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, <b>population</b> <b>policy,</b> and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.|$|E

25|$|Although family {{planning}} was {{established as a}} national goal in 1964, efforts during the Second Malaysia Plan to promote it were hampered by government neglect. Much of the success achieved by the National Family Planning Board occurred {{during the years of}} the First Malaysia Plan (1966–1970). The Second Malaysia Plan hoped to add 600,000new users of {{family planning}} techniques, but the facilities and personnel provided were inadequate. The topic was viewed as rather sensitive by the government, and thus family planning was mostly ignored. Ironically, in 1984 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad effectively eliminated family planning as a government policy by announcing the National <b>Population</b> <b>Policy,</b> which targeted a 70million population by 2100—up from 12.6million in 1984.|$|E

Such mandates demonstrated the Soviets' fear of spreading panic and their commitment to asserting direct state control over wartime relocations to maintain order. Soviet wartime <b>population</b> <b>policy</b> consisted of two distinct operations: deportation and evacuation. Deportation aimed to clear regions near the front of potentially insidious anti-Soviet elements that could hamper the war effort, while evacuation policy aimed to move Soviet industry and intelligentsia to the rear, where they would be safe.|$|E

Leaders of both groups viewed this as an auspicious time to merge the two organizations, so, in 1937, the Birth Control Council of America, {{under the leadership of}} Sanger, was formed to effect a consolidation.NYU Margaret Sanger Papers Project [...] Retrieved 12 October 2011. The effort eventually led to the merger of the two organizations in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA).Date of merger recorded as 1938 (not 1939) in: O'Connor, Karen (2010), Gender and Women's Leadership: A Reference Handbook, p. 743. O'Connor cites Gordon (1976). Although Sanger continued in the role of president, she no longer wielded the same power as she had {{in the early years of}} the movement, and, in 1942, more conservative forces within the organization changed the name to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a name Sanger objected to because she considered it too euphemistic.Engelman, pp. 178–179.

2500|$|Although the {{official}} {{policy of the}} Nazi regime was in favour of an independent Slovak state dependent on Germany and was opposed to any annexations of Slovak territory, Heinrich Himmler's SS considered ambitious <b>population</b> <b>policy</b> options concerning the German minority of Slovakia, which numbered circa 130,000 people. In 1940, Günther Pancke, head of the SS RuSHA ("Race and Settlement Office") undertook a study trip in Slovak lands where ethnic Germans were present, and reported to Himmler that the Slovak Germans {{were in danger of}} disappearing. Pancke recommended that action should be taken to fuse the racially valuable part of the Slovaks into the German minority and remove the Gypsy and Jewish populations. He stated that this would be possible by [...] "excluding" [...] the Hungarian minority of the country, and by settling some 100,000 ethnic German families to Slovakia. The racial core of this Germanization policy was to be gained from the Hlinka Guard, which was to be further integrated into the SS in the near future.|$|E

The administration also pushed for budget appropriations for family planning and contraceptives, an effort that was eventually stopped {{due to the fact}} that the church condemned it. The administration was also able to implement a piece of its overall Poverty Alleviation Plan, which involved the delivery of social services, basic needs, and assistance to the poor families. The Estrada administration also had limited contributions to Agrarian Reform, perhaps spurred by the acknowledgement that indeed, Agrarian Reform can also address poverty and inequitable control over resources. In that regard, the administration establishes the program [...] "Sustainable Agrarian Reform Communities-Technical Support to Agrarian and Rural Development". As for regional development, however, the administration had no notable contributions or breakthroughs.|$|E

This paper examines the rhetorical construction {{of what it means to}} be a mother in Singapore through the analysis of National Day Rally Speeches. Two themes emerged from this analysis: (1) Motherhood is an expensive experience and, (2) Motherhood required lifestyle changes. By unwittingly painting motherhood as negative experiences, <b>population</b> <b>policies</b> in Singapore could not achieve its goals. Hence, the articulation of <b>population</b> <b>policies</b> should also be considered in order to give women a positive script to performance motherhood...|$|R
