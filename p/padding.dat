5|$|Early in {{the next}} match, Diesel threw Razor Ramon out of the ring, {{allowing}} Michaels to remove the turnbuckle <b>padding.</b> Payton argued with Michaels about his interference, drawing the referee's attention. Michaels {{seized the opportunity to}} attack Ramon behind the referee's back. Diesel used two big boots and a series of submission holds to maintain the advantage. When he tried to throw Ramon into the unprotected turnbuckle, Payton pointed out the missing <b>padding</b> to the referee, who stood in the way to prevent the move. Soon after, Diesel tried to ram Ramon into the turnbuckle, but Ramon escaped and pushed Diesel into the turnbuckle. Ramon kept his momentum by performing a bulldog, a scoop slam, and a superplex. When Michaels tried to get involved again, Payton chased him around the outside of the ring. While the referee was distracted, Michaels entered the ring and tried to perform a superkick while Diesel held Ramon. Ramon moved, causing Michaels to kick Diesel instead. Ramon pinned Diesel to win the match and regain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
40|$|Fundamental {{investigation}} for <b>pad</b> conditioning was studied on CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing). In particular, <b>pad</b> surface roughness {{was focused on}} various <b>pad</b> surface conditions. <b>Pad</b> conditioning under wet condition makes <b>pad</b> surface roughness finer than <b>pad</b> conditioning under dry condition. The <b>pad</b> surface with fine roughness contributes to rapid <b>pad</b> break-in and removal rate　stabilization. In this study, various factors of <b>pad</b> conditioning were verified to clarify the difference of <b>pad</b> conditioning between under wet condition and dry condition. One of major differences of <b>pad</b> conditioning under dry condition against wet condition was the magnitude of friction force between <b>pad</b> and conditioner, which generates stick-slip motion of <b>pad</b> conditioner on a <b>pad.</b> The other was removal efficiency of <b>pad</b> fragment to be scraped away on conditioning <b>pad.</b> <b>Pad</b> fragments disturbs a stable contact between <b>pad</b> and conditioner.

5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950.

In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been <b>padding</b> its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E

30|$|A general {{description}} {{of all the}} remaining mode shapes of draft gear is also necessary to establish {{the correlation between the}} mode shapes of draft <b>pad</b> and draft gear. For the second mode of the draft gear, linear displacement of the interface between <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 in lateral (z) direction is observed causing the draft <b>pads</b> to exhibit modal behaviour close to its second mode shape. The third mode shows linear displacement of the interface between <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 in vertical (y) direction causing the draft <b>pads</b> to exhibit modal behaviour close to its third mode shape. For the fourth mode shape, the interface between <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 remains fixed and the interfaces between <b>pads</b> 1 and 2, 2 and 3 and interfaces between <b>pads</b> 4 and 5, 5 and 6 oscillate about longitudinal (x) axis in opposite sense. As a result, modal behaviour corresponding to the first mode shape of draft <b>pad</b> is observed in some draft <b>pads.</b> Fifth mode shape shows oscillation of the interface between <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 about vertical (y) axis. The results is that some draft <b>pads</b> exhibit second modal behaviour while some exhibit fourth modal behaviour of individual draft <b>pad.</b>|$|R
5|$|The calcium {{carbonate}} or silica spicules of most sponge genera make them too rough for most uses, but two genera, Hippospongia and Spongia, have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes, including <b>padding</b> for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until {{the invention of}} synthetic sponges, they were used as cleaning tools, applicators for paints and ceramic glazes and discreet contraceptives. However, by the mid-20th century, over-fishing brought both the animals and the industry close to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The few {{species of}} demosponge that have entirely soft fibrous skeletons with no hard {{elements}} {{have been used}} by humans over thousands of years for several purposes, including as <b>padding</b> and as cleaning tools.

40|$|Autoantibodies {{directed}} against citrullinated epitopes of proteins are highly diagnostic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and {{elevated levels of}} protein citrullination {{can be found in}} the joints of patients with RA. Calcium-dependent peptidyl-arginine deiminases (<b>PAD)</b> are the enzymes responsible for citrullination. <b>PAD</b> 2 and <b>PAD</b> 4 are enriched in neutrophils and likely drive citrullination under inflammatory conditions. <b>PADs</b> may be released during NETosis or cell death, but the mechanisms responsible for <b>PAD</b> activity under physiological conditions have not been fully elucidated. To understand how <b>PADs</b> citrullinate extracellular proteins, we investigated the cellular localization and activity of <b>PAD</b> 2 and <b>PAD</b> 4, and we report that viable neutrophils from healthy donors have active <b>PAD</b> 4 exposed on their surface and spontaneously secrete <b>PAD</b> 2. Neutrophil activation by some stimulatory agents increased the levels of immunoreactive <b>PAD</b> 4 on the cell surface, and some stimuli reduced <b>PAD</b> 2 secretion.

30|$|Sixth {{mode shape}} shows {{oscillation}} of {{the interface between}} <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 about lateral (z) axis.

The eight mode shape of draft gear is oscillation of all draft <b>pad</b> interfaces about lateral (z) axis. This oscillation results in fifth mode shape for all <b>pads.</b> For the ninth mode shape of draft gear, the interface between <b>pads</b> 3 and 4 remains fixed while the adjacent interfaces (i.e. interface between <b>pads</b> 1 and 2, 2 and 3 and interfaces between <b>pads</b> 4 and 5, 5 and 6) oscillate in opposite direction. This mode thus causes all <b>pads</b> to behave in accordance to first mode shape.
