A survey questionnaire was distributed among renal registry representatives in 38 European countries, and additional data was obtained from the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ESPN/ERA-EDTA) registry. Thirty-two countries with a pediatric RRT program responded. The median percentage of children by country on RRT with a functioning transplant was 62 % (interquartile range 39 - 77). One per million population increase in donation rate from deceased donors was associated with a 5 % increase in the <b>percentage</b> of <b>functioning</b> transplants; the existence of an intermediate and high pediatric priority policy doubled and tripled this percentage, respectively, compared with no priority, whereas an increase in living donor pediatric kidney transplant rate of one per million children was associated with a 14 % higher <b>percentage</b> of <b>functioning</b> transplants.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the functional {{differences between the}} 2 liver lobes in non-cirrhotic patients by using computed tomography/ 99 mTc-galactosyl human serum albumin (CT/ 99 mTc-GSA) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) fusion images. METHODS: Between December 2008 and March 2012, 264 non-cirrhotic patients underwent preoperative liver function assessment using CT/ 99 mTc-GSA SPECT fusion images. Of these, 30 patients, in whom {{the influence of a}} tumor on the liver parenchyma was estimated to be negligible, were selected. Specifically, the selected patients were required to meet either of the following criteria: (1) the presence of an extrahepatic tumor; or (2) presence of a single small intrahepatic tumor. These 30 patients were retrospectively analyzed to calculate the percentage volume (%Volume) and the <b>percentage</b> <b>function</b> (%Function) of each lobe. The ratio between the %Function and %Volume (function-to-volume ratio) of each lobe was also calculated, and the ratios were compared between the 2 lobes. Furthermore, the correlations between the function-to-volume ratio and each of 2 liver parameters [lobe volume and diameter ratio of the left portal vein to the right portal vein (LPV-to-RPV diameter ratio) ] were investigated. RESULTS: The median values of %Volume and %Function were 62. 6 % and 67. 1 % in the right lobe, with %Function being significantly higher than %Volume (P < 0. 01). The median values of %Volume and %Function were 31. 0 % and 28. 7 % in the left lobe, with %Function being significantly lower than %Volume (P < 0. 01). The function-to-volume ratios of the right lobe (1. 04 - 1. 14) were significantly higher than those of the left lobe (0. 74 - 0. 99) (P < 0. 01). The function-to-volume ratio showed no significant correlation between the lobe volume in either lobe. In contrast, the function-to-volume ratio showed significant correlations with the LPV-to-RPV diameter ratio in both lobes (right lobe: negative correlation, rs = - 0. 37, P = 0. 048; left lobe: positive correlation, rs = 0. 71, P < 0. 001). The function-to-volume ratio in the left lobe tended to be higher, and that in the right lobe tended to be lower, in accordance with the increase in the LPV-to-RPV diameter ratio. CONCLUSION: CT/ 99 mTc-GSA SPECT fusion images demonstrated that the function of the left lobe was significantly decreased compared with that of the right lobe in non-cirrhotic livers...|$|E

Where there are significant differences among the three normal subject groups, it is the oldest normal subject group that differs from the two younger subject groups. Significant decreases in performance with increasing age were found for the steadiness tests performed in the supported position, the sensation tests, two or five tests in the Neuro-Psychological Examination and tests requiring fine skilled movements primarily with the dominant hand. It was found that older subjects made fewer errors in coordinated tasks. A normalization technique, expressing performance as a <b>percentage</b> of normal <b>function,</b> was introduced. A method was developed to provide quantitative and meaningful indices of neurological function. The measure is obtained by averaging the <b>percentage</b> of normal <b>function</b> scores over several tests that belong to a primary category of neurological function. Young adult normal subjects do not perform significantly better than normal subjects in the age range of multiple sclerosis patients; however, young adult normal subjects do perform significantly better than normal subjects in the age range of Parkinson's disease patients, especially on tasks requiring fine skilled movements of the dominant hand and coordinated activities of the lower extremities. These results indicate that the performance of multiple sclerosis patients can be expressed as a <b>percentage</b> of the <b>function</b> of either age-matched normal controls or young adult normal controls.

On the other hand, the M-C bond orders increase from 1. 33, 1. 89 to 2. 16 for Ni(CO) 4, Co(CO) 4 (- 1) and Fe(CO) 4 (- 2), which parallel the increase in A(CO 5 -sigma-M-sigma) -B(CO 2 -pi-M-pi) metal bonding functions from 24. 61, 30. 01 to 33. 19, respectively. They are in agreement with our new concept of sigma-pi coordination proposed in the previous paper. This new concept has also been {{used to analyze the}} mechanism of the formation of Ni(CO) 4, Co(CO) 4 (- 1) and Fe(CO) 4 (- 2), and to explain why they can automotively hybridize each other despite the energy differences between 3 d and 4 s, 4 p, which are very large. The effects of metal valence bands have been accounted for on all transition metals (d 1 to d 8), and it is demonstrated that d orbitals increase from the Vd band upward to the Vs band, and s orbitals from the Vs band downward to the Vd band, which is equivalent to a change in orbital potential, and would modify their orbital overlap integrals with the adsorbate M. O. s and the A, B metal bonding functions significantly. The effective potentials and the <b>percentage</b> s, d <b>functions</b> of Vs, Vd and d(occ) bands are the most important factors for determining the effect of the metal valence band. The effects of promoter and support are also altered by changes in the above factors. For Group VIII metals, the valence band provides various s and d orbitals at various potentials, in which a certain number of s and d orbitals can match better with CO adsorbate M. O. s, which explains why CO adsorbed species on Group VIII metals are all stable and adsorption rates are all relatively rapid. The periodic trends of metal A, B, AB and D(c) bonding functions depend on the structures of the metal valence band, i. e. the potential levels and s, d <b>percentage</b> <b>functions</b> of Vs, Vd and d(occ) bands. For 4 d and 5 d metals, the potential levels of the Vs band are high, which cannot form a strong CO 5 -sigma-M sigma bond, but the potential levels of Vd band are higher and the width of the d band is wider than those of 3 d metal, so their B bonding functions are larger, and they can be used to activate saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. In contrast, for 3 d metals, the potentials of the Vs band are lower, which favour formation of strong CO 5 -sigma-M sigma and M-C bonds, i. e. their A and D(c) bonding functions are larger, which can promote coke formation. While ABD(c) D(o) can be used to characterize CO dissociation, B/A can be used to characterize C-C formation. The characteristics of various metal bonding functions on each transition metal are useful for designing catalyst composition.

In linear discriminant analysis, there are two assumptions to be fulfilled i. e. independent variables have to be multivariate normal distributed and variance covariance matrix of the observed two groups are the same. In this graduating paper is applied Beneish M-Score formula and linier discriminant analysis for classification of cases companies manipulators and non-manipulators are listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2013. Linear discriminant function to continue Beneish M-Score formula to predict the classification, {{in order to obtain}} the percentage of fault classification, to determine the size of the performance of linear discriminant <b>function.</b> <b>Percentage</b> of classification error of 2, 70 percent...|$|R
