5000|$|Most Newton {{devices were}} pre-loaded {{with a variety}} of {{software}} to help in personal data organization and management. This included such applications as Notes, Names, and Dates, as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator, conversion calculators (metric conversions, currency conversions, etc.), time-zone maps, etc. In later/2.x versions of the Newton OS these applications were refined, and new ones were added, such as the Works word processor and the Newton Internet Enabler, as well as the inclusion of bundled 3rd party applications, such as the QuickFigure Works spreadsheet (a [...] "lite" [...] version of Pelicanware's QuickFigure Pro), Pocket Quicken, the NetHopper web browser, and the EnRoute email client. Various Newton applications had full import/export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and <b>PIM</b> (<b>Personal</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Manager)</b> application file formats, primarily by making use of Apple's bundled Newton Connection Utilities (or the older Newton Connection Kit, which had been sold separately for Newton devices that used the 1.x versions of the OS).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Nowadays {{smartphones}} play {{a significant}} role in gathering relevant data about their owners. Micro-devices embedded in Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) perform a continuous sensing, the phone call lists, <b>PIM</b> (<b>Personal</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Manager),</b> text messages and so on allow to collect and mine data enough for a high-level description of daily activities of a user. This paper proposes an agent able to perform an automated profile annotation by adopting Semantic Web languages. As a proof of concept, the devised agent has been tested in an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) scenario, i. e., a domotic environment where it interacts with its home counterpart to trigger services best matching the user needs. A toy example is presented as case study aiming to better clarify the proposal while an early experimental evaluation is reported to assess its effectiveness...|$|E
