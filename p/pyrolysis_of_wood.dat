40|$|The <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> {{furniture}} <b>wood</b> {{waste was}} studied {{due to its}} importance as a thermochemical conversion process, and also {{because it is a}} step in the combustion process. Furniture wood contains organic additives and inorganic elements (being noteworthy the high content of Ti). These additives cause changes in the thermal processes. A thermogravimetric analysis <b>of</b> the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> furniture <b>wood</b> waste was carried out in a TGA apparatus using dynamic and dynamic + isothermal runs. The pyrolysis was modeled with acceptable approximation by three independent reactions, according to the decomposition of the main components <b>of</b> the <b>wood</b> (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin). The gaseous products evolved during the pyrolysis were measured by the TG-MS and TG-FTIR techniques. The maximum formation of gases occurs around 360 °C. The CO 2 formation remains until the end of the run, due to the wide range of lignin degradation. In addition, runs to identify the volatile and semi-volatile compounds were also carried out in a laboratory scale tubular reactor at 500 and 850 °C and the results were compared with the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> a cleaner <b>wood.</b> Support for this work was provided by the Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competividad, Research ProjectRETOCTQ 2013 - 41006 -R (Spain), and PROMETEOII/ 2014 / 007 and Gerónimo Forteza FPA/ 2014 / 081 from Generalitat Valenciana (Spain) ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{catalytic}} fast <b>pyrolysis</b> (CFP) <b>of</b> biomass as a {{means of}} producing bio-oil with improved physico-chemical properties, has received a lot of attention. This technique, either by adding catalyst particles to the pyrolysis reactor (in situ) or by ex situ vapour treatment, is meant for removal of the oxygen and cracking of the high molecular weight compounds in the primary pyrolysis vapours. So far, various projects have tried/are trying to push catalytic fast pyrolysis to the pilot scale, or even to the commercial scale, but have met varying levels of success. This work therefore tries to answer various research questions that would improve the future strategies related to this technology. These contain the optimal properties of a catalyst for CFP, the consequences of long-term usage of catalysis, and the presence of biomass originated ash in large scale CFP systems. The objective of this research is to investigate possible beneficial effects on the bio-oil quality, of various catalysts applied inside the pyrolysis reactor or in the vapour-product stream, in relationship with the applied process conditions. The catalysts (in total eight proprietary catalysts) were tested in two dedicated lab-scale reactors (with intakes of 500 g/h and 200 g/h) that allow variation of the catalyst loading and contact times while producing larger samples in continuous operation. The effects of successive catalyst regeneration and the presence of biomass ash in catalytic fast <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> pine <b>wood</b> were investigated, as well.

50|$|A {{wildfire}} {{front is}} the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both {{the surrounding air}} and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 C. Next, the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> at 230 C releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 C or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 C. Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 C, which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from below.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe solar <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> beech <b>wood</b> was {{investigated}} {{with the objective}} of determining the optimal pyrolysis parameters for maximizing the LHVs (lower heating values) of the gas products because they can be further utilized as fuel gas for power generation, heat and production of transportable fuels. The investigated variables were the pyrolysis temperature (600 – 2000 °C), heating rate (5 – 450 °C/s), argon flow rate (6 – 12 NL/min) and pressure (0. 44 – 1. 14 bar). The results indicate that the product yields (liquid, char and gas), gas composition (H 2, CH 4, CO, CO 2 and C 2 H 6) and LHV are strongly influenced by the pyrolysis parameters. The total gas LHV greatly increases with increasing temperature (from 600 to 1200 °C) and increasing heating rate (from 5 to 50 °C/s), which is mainly due to increases in the CO and H 2 yields. The variation in the gas LHV with pressure and argon flow rate is slight.
