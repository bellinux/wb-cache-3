Silastic tubes containing P were inserted s. c. in cyclic rats for 7 or 14 days and in pregnant rats from day 7 to 14, from day 14 to 21 or from day 7 to 21 of pregnancy. 5 -Bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) was infused during the last 24 h of the treatment; the proportion of dividing islet-cells was determined in pancreatic sections, which were immunostained for BrdU. Islet-cell function was determined by measuring glucose and insulin response to a standard intravenous glucose challenge. <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> increased P and 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone (20 alpha-OHP) levels in cyclic rats; in pregnant rats, only the plasma levels of 20 alpha-OHP were elevated.

40|$|Abstract: Zinc {{deficiency}} is {{a common}} constraint for wheat production in the regions with limited precipitation, particularly in the regions {{with high levels of}} available phosphate (P) in soil. Two experiments were conducted using chelator-buffered nutrient solutions to characterize differences in tolerance to Zn deficiency among three winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes and to investigate the relationship between P and Zn nutrition in wheat species. Four indices, Zn efficiency, relative shoot-to-root ratio, total Zn uptake in shoot, and shoot dry weight were used to compare the tolerance to Zn deficiency among three wheat genotypes. The results indicated that the four indices could be used in breeding selection for Zn uptake-efficient genotypes. The genotype H 6712 was the most tolerant to Zn deficient, followed by M 19, and then X 13. Specifically, H 6712 had the highest Zn uptake efficiency among the three genotypes. The addition of P to the growth medium increased Zn uptake and translocation from roots to shoots. Total Zn content of the wheat plant was 43 % higher with 0. 6 mmol/L <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> than that of control with 0 mmol /L <b>P</b> <b>treatment.</b> The Zn translocation ratios from roots to shoots were increased by 16 % and 26 % with 0. 6 mmol/L <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> and 3 mmol/L <b>P</b> <b>treatment,</b> respectively, compared with 0 mmol/L <b>P</b> <b>treatment.</b> In contrast, high Zn concentrations in the growth medium inhibited P translocation from roots to shoots, but the inhibitive effects were not strong. Sixty-six percent of P taken up by wheat plants was translocated to the wheat shoots at 0 μmol/L Zn treatment, while the percent was 60 % at 3 μmol/L Zn treatment.

40|$|Aquatic {{eutrophication}} is {{a serious}} environmental problem that occurs all over the world. To protect surface waters (in particular the Baltic Sea), the regulatory pressure on onsite wastewater treatment (OWT) systems have increased in Sweden. Stringent requirements have led to uncertainties regarding the capability of conventional treatment techniques (soil treatment systems (STS)) to remove phosphorus (P), but they have also stimulated the development and introduction of enhanced <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> techniques. In this thesis the accumulation and mobility of P {{as well as the}} chemical P removal mechanisms were studied in soils and reactive filter media. This knowledge was then used in environmental systems analysis. A model based on life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was developed to evaluate the overall environmental performance of conventional and enhanced <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> systems under various local conditions. The P accumulation in the studied STS varied (320 - 870 g m- 3) and the accumulated P was rather mobile in some soils. Phosphorus compounds were identified in alkaline reactive filter media (calcium phosphates predominated) by means of X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES). In sandy soils from STS aluminium was found to be a key element for P removal, as evidenced by a strong relationship between oxalate-extractable P and Al. The LCA studies indicated that enhanced <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> systems may be beneficial from an eutrophication and P recycling perspective but causes increased impacts in terms of global warming and acidification. Despite the drawbacks, enhanced <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> techniques should be considered suitable substitutes to surface water discharge STS under most conditions. This is because the latter systems have such a strong eutrophication impact. On the other hand, under appropriate conditions, STS with groundwater discharge may be advantageous. These systems generally caused low environmental impacts except for the dispersion of P resources.   QC 20130419 </p...|$|E

RESULTS: MRI revealed that the subcutaneous tumors (STs) significantly increased in volume than hepatic tumors (HTs) 48 hours after CA 4 P (P <. 05). Relative to vehicle controls and treated group at baseline, necrosis ratio, apparent diffusion coefficient, and enhancement ratio changed slightly with the STs but significantly with HTs (P <. 05) after CA 4 <b>P</b> <b>treatment.</b> Vessel density derived from microangiography was significantly lower in STs compared to HTs without CA 4 <b>P</b> <b>treatment.</b> CA 4 <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> resulted in decreased vessel density in HTs, while it did not affect vessel density in STs. MRI and microangiography outcomes were supported by histopathologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: MRI and microangiography allowed quantitative comparison of therapeutic responses to CA 4 P in rats with multifocal tumors. The discovered diverse effects of the same drug on {{tumors of the}} same origin but different locations emphasize the presence of cancer heterogeneity and the importance of individualization of drug delivery...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to advance understanding of phosphorus regulation of Microcystis aeruginosa growth, phosphorus uptake and storage in changing phosphorus (P) conditions as would occur in lakes. We hypothesized that Microcystis growth and nutrient uptake would fit classic models by Monod, Droop, and Michaelis-Menten in these changing conditions. Microcystis grown in luxury nutrient concentrations was transferred to treatments with phosphorus concentrations ranging from 0 - 256 μg P∙L- 1 and luxury nitrogen. Dissolved phosphorus concentration, cell phosphorus quota, P uptake rate and cell densities were measured at day 3 and 6. Results showed little relationship to predicted models. Microcystis growth was asymptotically related to <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> from day 0 - 3, fitting Monod model well, but negatively related to <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> and cell quota from day 3 - 6. From day 0 - 3, cell quota was negatively related to P treatments at < 2 μg∙L- 1, but increased slightly at higher P. Cell quota decreased greatly in low P treatments from day 3 - 6, which may have enabled high growths in low P treatments. P uptake was positively and linearly related to <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> during both periods. Negative uptake rates and increases in measured culture phosphorus concentrations to 5 μg∙L- 1 in the lowest P treatments indicated P leaked from cells into culture medium. This leakage during early stages of the experiment may have been sufficient to stimulate metabolism and use of intracellular P stores in low P treatments for rapid growth. Our study shows P regulation of Microcystis growth can be complex as a result of changing P concentrations, and this complexity may be important for modeling Microcystis for nutrient and ecosystem management...|$|E

Plants were sampled at 5, 10, 15 and 20 days after treatments (DAT). Leaf APA, leaf inorganic P concentration, total P concentration and total dry weight of rice plants were determined. Results showed that there were significantly (p< 0. 05) genotypic variations in P acquisition efficiency (PAE), P use efficiency (PUE) and leaf APA at different plant ages under either sufficient <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> or deficient <b>P</b> <b>treatment.</b> The response of leaf APA to P deficiency varied significantly (p< 0. 05) 8 rice genotypes. Correlation analysis showed that relative leaf APA of rice plants was inversely correlated to relative PAE (p< 0. 01) and was positively correlated to relative PUE (p< 0. 01), suggesting that leaf APA was closely associated with P efficiency for rice plants. Under deficient <b>P</b> <b>treatment,</b> leaf APA was inversely correlated (p< 0. 05) to plant P concentration, including leaf inorganic P concentration and plant total P concentration, for rice plants sampled at 10 DAT and 15 DAT, respectively, whereas {{there was no significant}} correlation between leaf APA and plant P concentration for rice plants sampled at 5 DAT and 20 DAT, respectively.

The relationship between P remobilization from leaves of soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr. cv McCall) during reproductive development and leaf senescence was determined by utilizing soil <b>P</b> <b>treatments</b> that supplied deficient, optimum, and supraoptimum soil P levels. The soil <b>P</b> <b>treatments</b> simulated field conditions, being initiated {{at the time of}} planting with no subsequent addition or removal of P. It was hypothesized that P deficiency would accelerate leaf senescence and that supraoptimum P nutrition would delay the timing or rate of leaf senescence relative to plants grown with optimum P. Supraoptimum soil P led to a two- to fourfold increase in leaf P concentration compared with optimum P, and during senescence there was no net P remobilization from leaves for this <b>treatment.</b> Leaf <b>P</b> concentration was similar for plants grown at optimum or deficient soil P, and there was significant net P remobilization from leaves of both treatments in one of the two experiments. As indicated by changes in leaf N, carbon dioxide exchange rate, ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity, and chlorophyll concentration, leaf senescence patterns were similar for all soil <b>P</b> <b>treatments.</b> Thus, it can be concluded that leaf senescence was not affected by either P deficiency or enhanced leaf P concentration resulting from supraoptimum soil P.

40|$|The {{effects on}} {{phytoplankton}} and limnetics {{of two different}} types of suspended sediments and their interactions with P loading were tested in a small North Carolina Piedmont lake. Limnocorrals were used in a complete, triplicated six-treatment, blocked design. Treatments were loaded with P, kaolinitic clay (K), K+P, montmorillonitic clay (M), and M+P. A 4 caused more turbidity and stayed in suspension longer than K. Consequently, the light-dependent parameters, net community productivity (NCP), chlorophyll concentration, and algal density were lowest in the M and highest in the <b>P</b> <b>treatment.</b> Combined P and clay loading promoted clearing for both sediments and mitigated their effects on algal densities and NCP. Flagellated algae and nonfilamentous cyanophytes dominated the control community. The <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> had blooms ofAnabaena. Without fertilization, both clays resulted in sparse, flagellate-dominated communities. The M+P community, like that of the <b>P</b> <b>treatment,</b> was dominated by Anabaena, but total algal densities were suppressed. In contrast, the K-t-P community lacked Anabaena and was similar to the control in algal quantity and composition. Various mineral substances cause turbid-ity in lakes, including clays of distinct min-eralogies from eroding soils, resuspended bottom sediments, glacial flours, and calcite precipitates. It is unlikely that such a het-erogeneous array could exert uniform influ-ences on lacustrine systems. Differential composition of suspensions may be a source of some of the conflict among investigators’ of the effects of mineral turbidity. Some studies show mineral turbidity to favor flag-ellated algae at the expense of filamentous blue-greens (Hergenrader and Hammer 1971; Avnimelech et al. 1982; Cuker 1987), yet other contrasting reports link blooms of these filamentous blue-greens to loading with suspended clays (Carriker and Taylor 1984; Hart 1987).

ST 104 P is a soluble polysulfated-cyclo-tetrachromotropylene compound with anti-viral and anti-thrombotic activities. However, the functions of ST 104 P in angiogenesis have never been explored. In this study, we investigated the effects of ST 104 P in angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Application of ST 104 P potently suppressed the microvessels sprouting in aortic rings ex vivo. Furthermore, ST 104 <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> significantly disrupted the vessels’ development in transgenic zebrafish in vivo. Above all, repeated administration of ST 104 P resulted in delayed tumor growth and prolonged the life span of mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma.

We investigated how the transfer of carbon between a primary producer, Raphidocelis subcapitata, and a consumer, Daphnia magna, was affected by acute exposure to gamma radiation. In addition to unexposed controls, different treatments were used where: a) only D. magna (Z treatment); b) only R. subcapitata (<b>P</b> <b>treatment)</b> and c) both D. magna and R. subcapitata (ZP treatment) were exposed to one of three acute doses of gamma radiation (5, 50 and 100  Gy). We then compared differences among treatments for three endpoints: incorporation of carbon by D. magna, D. magna growth and R. subcapitata densities. Carbon incorporation was affected by which combination of species was irradiated and by the radiation dose. Densities of R. subcapitata {{at the end of the}} experiment were also affected by which species had been exposed to radiation. Carbon incorporation by D. magna was significantly lower in the Z treatment, indicating reduced grazing, an effect stronger with higher radiation doses, possibly due to direct effects of gamma radiation. Top-down indirect effects of this reduced grazing were also seen as R. subcapitata densities increased in the Z treatment due to decreased herbivory. The opposite pattern was observed in the <b>P</b> <b>treatment</b> where only R. subcapitata was exposed to gamma radiation, while the ZP treatment showed intermediate results for both endpoints. In the P treatments, carbon incorporation by D. magna was significantly higher than in the other treatments, suggesting a higher grazing pressure. This, together with direct effects of gamma radiation on R. subcapitata, probably significantly decreased phytoplankton densities in the <b>P</b> <b>treatment.</b> Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the role of species interactions when assessing the effects of exposure to gamma radiation in aquatic ecosystems...|$|E

METHODS: A total of 82 patients with advanced HCC treated only with TACE served as control group. Another 68 patients with HCC treated with TACE in combination with recombinant adenovirus-p 53 injection served as <b>p</b> 53 <b>treatment</b> group. Patients were followed up for 12 mo. Safety and therapeutic effects were evaluated according to the improvement in clinical symptoms, leukocyte count, Karnofsky and RECIST criteria. Survival rate was calculated with Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The total effective rate was 58. 3 % for <b>p</b> 53 <b>treatment</b> group, and 26. 5 % for control group (P < 0. 05). The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms was lower in <b>p</b> 53 <b>treatment</b> group than in control group (P < 0. 05). The 3 -, 6 - and 12 -mo survival rates were significantly higher for <b>p</b> 53 <b>treatment</b> group than for control group (P < 0. 01). The combination treatment was well tolerated with such adverse events as fever (51. 5 %, P = 0. 006) and pain of muscles and joints (13. 2 %, P = 0. 003), which {{were significantly higher than}} the chemotherapy. Except for these minor adverse effects, no severe vector-related complications were identified. With respect to the efficacy, patients in <b>p</b> 53 <b>treatment</b> group had less gastrointerestinal symptoms (P = 0. 062), better improvement in tumor-related pain (P = 0. 003), less downgrade of leukocyte counts (P = 0. 003) and more upgrade of Karnofsky performance score (P = 0. 029) than those in control group. The total effective rate (CR + PR) for <b>p</b> 53 <b>treatment</b> group and control group was 58. 3 % and 26. 5 %, respectively, with distributions of different effect in two groups (P = 0. 042).
