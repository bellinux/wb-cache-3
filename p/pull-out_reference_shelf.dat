40|$|Clinching is a {{mechanical}} joining technique that involves severe {{local plastic deformation}} {{of two or more}} metal sheet parts resulting in a permanent mechanical interlock. Today, it is a reliable joining technique used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), automotive and general steel constructions whilst still gaining interest. As it is not computationally feasible to include detailed sub models of these type of joints in FE simulations of clinched assemblies during the design stage, this paper proposes a simple methodology to represent these connections with simplified elements. The key point of the method is the use of uncoupled plastic behaviour to model the joint plastic properties. In order to calibrate the parameters governing the equivalent model, a simple shear lap and <b>pull-out</b> <b>reference</b> test of a single clinched joint was used. The presented methodology is validated using a modified Arcan test of a single joint, which enables to exert a combination of shear and pull-out loads. Finally, a peel test is conducted to study the influence of bending moments on the behaviour of the joint. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Atomic {{spectroscopy}} techniques form {{an essential}} part of any elemental analysis laboratory. This book gathers together under one cover the most important techniques of atomic spectroscopy currently available. Each chapter presents the key principles of a technique, describes the associated instrumentation, and discusses representative applications. Atomic Spectroscopy in Elemental Analysis begins with a chapter on method validation relevant to all of the techniques discussed later. Each chapter that follows focuses on a particular technique and was contributed by an expert in that area. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission (ICP-AES), glow discharge optical emission (GD-OES), microwave plasma atomic emission, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), electrothermal atomic absorption, and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy all receive due attention. The final chapter on chemometrics considers experiment design, multivariate statistics, and data analysis as they apply to atomic spectroscopy.

It has a table of Contents, a Preface, a list of Contributors, seven main Sections, 45 chapters, an Appendix, and a comprehensive Index. There are also numerous Tables, a few Figures and a small number of colour photographs.

This is the first study to analyse gender differences with respect to the criterion of grocery product price within an Australian supermarket retail environment.

Results showed that men considered price attributes of products as being significantly lower in importance than did women. Additionally, men displayed lower levels of price nvolvement, reported <b>referencing</b> <b>shelf</b> price to a lesser extent, and gave lesser consideration to promotional tactics focusing on low price. Although men on average buy fewer items than do women, they spend more money for each item they purchase.

Most reference works that one traditionally found on the <b>reference</b> <b>shelves</b> of libraries – dictionaries, encyclopedias, gazetteers etc. – are now curated databases. Since it is now easy to publish databases on the web, there has been an explosion in the number of new curated databases used in scientific research. The value of curated databases lies in the organization and the quality of the data they contain. Like the paper reference works they have replaced, they usually represent the efforts of a dedicated group of people to produce a definitive description of some subject area. Curated databases present a number of challenges for database research. The topics of annotation, provenance, and citation are central, because curated databases are heavily cross-referenced with, and include data from, other databases, and much of the work of a curator is annotating existing data. Evolution of structure is important because these databases often evolve from semistructured representations, and because they have to accommodate new scientific discoveries. Much of the work in these areas is in its infancy, but it is beginning to provide suggest new research for both theory and practice. We discuss some of this research and emphasize the need to find appropriate models of the processes associated with curated databases...|$|R
