Agricultural products constitute some of the most widely traded commodities in existence today and compete internationally in organized competitive markets.

At the same time, electricity generation models based on mathematical programming and game theory have also been developed to determine optimal expansion plans of the generation capacity for long-term horizons. Though these two techniques have both been applied in the literature to assess generation investments in the electricity sector, taking into account, among others, investment, maintenance and operation costs, their mathematical relationships have been rarely reported or even understood.

In a system where maintenance has long been neglected, these measures also turn out to be cheaper than capacity addition and should be given preference in a period of scarcity of funds. Improvement in the use of plants and reduction of technical and non-technical losses are profitable, but these measures are not implemented enough under the present public system in India. We will then briefly link up these findings with some of our earlier works to show that these inefficiencies arise because State Electricity Boards have long relied on technical and administrative procedures that were designed during a period of expansion and not on efficiently decentralised and information-based management as should be the case in the present mature phase...|$|E
