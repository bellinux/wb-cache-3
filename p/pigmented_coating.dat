50|$|Carbon paper (originally {{carbonic}} paper) {{was originally}} paper coated {{on one side}} {{with a layer of}} a loosely bound dry ink or <b>pigmented</b> <b>coating,</b> bound with wax, used for making one or more copies simultaneously with the creation of an original document when using a typewriter or a ballpoint pen. The manufacture of carbon paper was formerly the largest consumer of montan wax. In 1954 the Columbia Ribbon & Carbon Manufacturing Company filed a patent for what became known in the trade as solvent carbon paper: the coating was changed from wax-based to polymer-based. The manufacturing process changed from a hot-melt method to a solvent-applied coating or set of coatings. It was then possible to use polyester or other plastic film as a substrate, instead of paper, although the name remained carbon paper.|$|E

Surface coating of MDF was conducted using epoxy acrylate resin either for clear and pigmented coatings. Titanium dioxide was used for white pigmented coatings.

40|$|Thermally sprayed {{aluminium}} (TSA) {{is widely}} used for corrosion protection on offshore installations. Rapid degradation of the TSA has earlier been discovered, if organic coating is applied {{on top of the}} TSA. In case of coating damages on the TSA, a duplex corrosion mechanism may occur. Due to access limitations with coating equipment or hot work limitations offshore, application of new TSA may be difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a repair coating for TSA in connection with damage. The repair coating must provide corrosion protection without triggering the duplex corrosion mechanism and shall be applied without removing the intact TSA. Eight repair coatings were tested on steel coated with TSA to determine the corrosion behavior in marine environment. Four possible protection mechanisms were considered: (1) cathodic polarization, (2) buffering capacity, (3) ability to release an aggressive environment formed under the coating and (4) electrical conductive coatings. The coatings contained anodic elements such as aluminium, zinc or magnesium, except for an inorganic copolymer coating and an MgO <b>pigmented</b> <b>coating.</b> A cyclic coating test was conducted for 20 cycles according to ISO 20340. Highest amount of corrosion creep for the TSA was seen for the Zn epoxy, the inorganic copolymer coating, the high Zn primer and the modified Zn epoxy. An average corrosion creep of approximately 5. 1 mm was seen for the Zn epoxy. Due to corrosion products, blistering or cracking of the repair coat were seen for these coatings. The Zn-, MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed promising results without blistering after the same test. The Zn silicate showed an average corrosion creep of approximately 0. 6 mm, while the MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed negligible corrosion creep. Coating resistivity was measured by obtaining several electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) over a period of time, and the open circuit potential (OCP) was measured. The zinc containing coatings were exposed for 134 days, while the MgO-, Mg-, Al-silicate and the inorganic copolymer coating were exposed for 81 days. All coatings showed an OCP more negative than - 800 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, except for the inorganic copolymer coating. This coating had an initial potential of - 430 mV vs. Ag/AgCl with decreasing development towards a more negative potential. The coatings that revealed blistering or cracking of the repair coating during the cyclic coating test showed generally higher impedance, compared to the silicate coatings that did not blister. An open coating structure was considered as the most important protection mechanism for a TSA repair coat. The protection mechanisms regarding cathodic polarization, electrical conductive coatings and the buffering effect were assumed less important compared to the open coating structure. Crevice corrosion tests with different crevice designs were performed {{in order to have a}} short-term test for the TSA duplex corrosion mechanism.

The primary objective of this study was: (1) to investigate the synthetic zeolite pigment effects on inkjet ink absorption, dynamic contact angle and printability, and (2) to evaluate these novel synthetic zeolite pigments in replacing the fumed silica pigments in conventional inkjet receptive coatings. In this research study, single <b>pigment</b> <b>coating</b> formulations (in equal P:B ratio) were prepared using microporous synthetic zeolite pigments (5 A, Organophilic and 13 X) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) binder. The laboratory-coated samples were characterized for absorption, air permeance, roughness, drying time, wettability and print fidelity. Based on the rheological data, {{it was found that}} the synthetic zeolite formulated coatings depicted a Newtonian flow behavior at low shear; while the industry accepted fumed silica based coatings displayed a characteristically high pseudoplastic flow behavior. Our coated samples generated using microporous synthetic zeolite pigments produced low absorption, reduced wettability and accelerated ink drying characteristics. These characteristics were caused due to the synthetic zeolite pigments, which resulted in relatively closed surface structure coated samples. The research suggested that no single selected synthetic zeolite coating performed better than the conventional fumed silica based coatings. Experimental data also showed that there was no apparent relationship between synthetic zeolite pigment pore sizes and inkjet ink absorption. For future research, above coated samples should be evaluated for pore size distribution using Mercury Porosimeter, which quantifies surface porosity of coated samples. This presented approach can be easily used for investigating other such microporous <b>coating</b> <b>pigments</b> in formulating inkjet receptive coating. The research findings will benefit the coating formulators, engineers and material science students, in understanding the absorption characteristics of selected synthetic zeolite pigments thereby encouraging them in identifying other such alternative pigments in conventional inkjet receptive coatings...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} coating layer {{properties}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{as a result of}} an emerging demand for novel coated paper-based products and an increasing popularity of new coating application methods. The governing mechanisms of microstructure formation dynamics during consolidation and drying are nevertheless, still poorly understood. Some of the difficulties encountered by experimental methods can be overcome by the utilisation of numerical modelling and simulation-based studies of the consolidation process. The objective of this study was to improve the fundamental understanding of <b>pigment</b> <b>coating</b> consolidation and structure formation mechanisms taking place on the microscopic level. Furthermore, it is aimed to relate the impact of process and suspension properties to the microstructure of the coating layer. A mathematical model based on a modified Stokesian dynamics particle simulation technique was developed and applied in several studies of consolidation-related phenomena. The model includes particle-particle and particle-boundary hydrodynamics, colloidal interactions, Born repulsion, and a steric repulsion model. The Brownian motion and a free surface model were incorporated to enable the specific investigation of consolidation and drying. Filter cake stability was simulated in various particle systems, and subjected to a range of base substrate absorption rates and system temperatures. The stability of the filter cake was primarily affected by the absorption rate and size of particles. Temperature was also shown to have an influence. The consolidation of polydisperse systems, with varying wet coating thicknesses, was studied using imposed pilot trial and model-based drying conditions. The results show that drying methods have a clear influence on the microstructure development, on small particle distributions in the coating layer and also on the mobility of particles during consolidation. It is concluded that colloidal properties can significantly impact coating layer shrinkage as well as the internal solids concentration profile. Visualisations of particle system development in time and comparison of systems at different conditions are useful in illustrating coating layer structure formation mechanisms.

Betanin, being more polar in nature is more prone to degradation by interaction with the electrolyte. In the case of the co-sensitized solar cell, it was observed that both pigments lasted much longer due to a protecting hydrophobic nature of the phytyl tails of chlorophyll. It was also observed that the binding of betanin to TiO 2 is enhanced in the presence of chlorophyll. Although the contribution of chlorophyll towards the efficiency of the betanin–chlorophyll co-sensitized solar cell is less, it appears that in the co-sensitized solar cell, the better performance of betanin as a sensitizer is complemented and stabilized by the presence of chlorophyll.|$|R

The anatase form of TiO 2 is more photoactive than the rutile form, {{and the effect of}} increasing the calcination temperature of the pigment is to reduce photoactivity by boosting the rutile fraction. The concentration dependences of the degradation rates are complex, but can be directly related to the percentage of anatase achieved after calcination.
