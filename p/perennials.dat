5|$|Robinson {{advocated}} {{more natural}} and less formal-looking plantings of hardy <b>perennials,</b> shrubs, and climbers, and reacted against the High Victorian patterned gardening, which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses. He railed against standard roses, statuary, sham Italian gardens, and other artifices common in gardening at the time. Modern gardening practices first introduced by Robinson include: using alpine plants in rock gardens; dense plantings of <b>perennials</b> and groundcovers that expose no bare soil; use of hardy <b>perennials</b> and native plants; and large plantings of <b>perennials</b> in natural-looking drifts.|$|E
5|$|The Cucurbita digitata, C.foetidissima, C.galeotti, and C.pedatifolia species {{groups are}} xerophytes, arid zone <b>perennials</b> with storage roots; the remainder, {{including}} the five domesticated species, are all mesophytic annuals or short-life <b>perennials</b> with no storage roots. The five domesticated species are mostly isolated {{from each other}} by sterility barriers and have different physiological characteristics. Some cross pollinations can occur: C.pepo with C.argyrosperma and C.moschata; and C.maxima with C.moschata. Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae. The buffalo gourd (C.foetidissima), which does not taste good, {{has been used as}} an intermediary as it can be crossed with all the common Cucurbita.|$|E
5|$|The new Memorial Gardens {{incorporate}} the war memorial which was moved from Victoria Square {{as part of}} the project.

5|$|Citygarden's plants, {{including}} various {{grasses and}} wildflowers, were {{selected by the}} Missouri Botanical Garden. Large shade plants were chosen to provide relief in warm and humid weather. At {{the time of its}} opening, Citygarden comprised a total of 240 trees, 1,100 shrubs, 4,000 <b>perennials,</b> 8,000 bulbs, and 13,000 groundcovers. A garden spokesperson later said that hungry rabbits have forced workers to alter some of the plant choices.|$|E
5|$|Member {{species are}} usually annuals or {{herbaceous}} <b>perennials.</b> Flowers are red, pink, or yellow, often in various combinations. A {{large number of}} the Erythranthe species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, {{but many of the}} species now classified as Diplacus are. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Modern cottage gardens include countless {{regional}} and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants {{not seen in}} the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, {{continue to be a}} cottage-garden mainstay — along with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading <b>perennials</b> favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.|$|E

40|$|The {{nutrient}} {{contents of}} <b>perennial</b> ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) are reasonably similar. Despite similarities, the lactation performance of dairy cows fed <b>perennial</b> ryegrass {{has not been}} compared with the lactation performance of dairy cows fed alfalfa. The present study was implemented to compare the performance of lactating cows fed alfalfa or <b>perennial</b> ryegrass silage. Alfalfa and <b>perennial</b> ryegrass were harvested at late bud and boot stages of maturity, respectively, and ensiled in separate 4. 9 - × 18. 3 -m concrete silos. The experimental silages were supplemented with a concentrate mix at 31. 1 % of dietary dry matter and fed to 18 multiparous Holstein cows in early lactation in a crossover experimental design with 28 -d periods. Digestibility and rate of passage of experimental diets were also measured using rare earth markers. The <b>perennial</b> ryegrass contained 3. 0 percentage units more neutral detergent fiber than did alfalfa, but in vitro digestibility of neutral detergent fiber was 8. 8 percentage units higher for <b>perennial</b> ryegrass. In vitro digestibility of dry matter was also higher for <b>perennial</b> ryegrass. Cows fed alfalfa silage produced more milk (31. 8 kg/d) than did cows fed <b>perennial</b> ryegrass silage (30. 2 kg/d). Cows fed <b>perennial</b> ryegrass silage ate less feed (2. 2 kg/d) than did cows fed alfalfa. Because dry matter intake was lower, diet digestibilities were higher, and rate of passage was slower, for cows consuming <b>perennial</b> ryegrass. Based on laboratory evaluations, <b>perennial</b> ryegrass silage has high nutritional quality, but performance of lactating cows indicated that the forage was suboptimal for supporting high milk production when compared with alfalfa. The <b>perennial</b> ryegrass silage was suboptimal {{because it did not}} stimulate high amounts of dry matter intake in lactating cows.

5|$|The English Garden is a {{rectangular}} garden featuring brick paths, a pergola that features cypress {{trees at the}} head of the garden, and a number of statues and garden ornaments. The garden has hundreds of native trees, shrubs, and <b>perennials,</b> most notably azaleas. It also features a wall garden, which was built in 1922. The centerpiece of the garden is a large wisteria arbor.|$|E
5|$|Variety in texture, {{height and}} timing of floral display were equally {{important}} horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone are planted {{with a mixture of}} floribunda roses and herbaceous <b>perennials.</b> Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.|$|E
5|$|Plants are {{classified}} as trees, shrubs, herbaceous <b>perennials,</b> and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to be rough and ready, as is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that some plants are irregular, while the silver fir has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming a circle of roots at a distance all round the trunk.|$|E
50|$|One major {{function}} of <b>perennial</b> plants is {{to restore the}} land and ecosystem. Hordeum brachyantherum is used to restore the native <b>perennial</b> grasslands in California and to reduce the density of non-native annual plants. The <b>perennial</b> plants can rapidly recover the soil microbial biomass in the grasslands due to the carbon supply maintained by the <b>perennial</b> plants. The species diversity and composition is not affected by the restoration, however, the relative proportion of the native plant biomass increased in the restored <b>perennial</b> grassland.|$|R

5|$|The Diversity {{indices of}} the plant species were recorded; they were a {{richness}} of 48, diversity of 0.29 and evenness of 0.47 in summer. In winter, the respective figures were 81, 0.17 and 0.52. Species richness {{was found to be}} different in 48 samples of thin phumdis, 53 samples of thick phumdis and 14 samples on hard ground. The eight plant communities identified during winter and summer were Capillipedium, Leersia hexandra, Oenanthe javanica, Phragmites karka, Kyllinga triceps, Pteridium aquilinum, Zizania latifolia and Persicaria perfoliata. Zizania latifolia recorded the highest productivity with (13.90±5.01)g/m2 for winter and (102.96±26.03)g/m2 for summer. Greater productivity was recorded in summer (65.96g/m2) than winter (15.76g/m2). Variation of productivity of annuals and <b>perennials</b> were noted according to seasons and type of phumdis.|$|E
5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. <b>Perennials</b> which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The addax eat only certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} basil. They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody <b>perennials</b> and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.|$|E
5000|$|Makes crop {{rotation}} more difficult. Crop rotations with <b>perennial</b> systems are possible, but the full rotation will necessarily take longer. For example, a <b>perennial</b> hay crop. like alfalfa is commonly rotated with annual crops or other <b>perennial</b> hay crops after 3-5 years. The slower pace of rotation—compared with annual crops—could allow a greater buildup of pathogens, pests or weeds in the <b>perennial</b> {{phase of the}} rotation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of <b>perennial</b> crops through breeding would help {{deal with the}} multiple issues involving environmental conservation and food security {{in a world of}} shrinking resources. <b>Perennial</b> wheat offers a new solution to the long-standing problems of soil erosion and degradation associated with conventional annual small-grain cropping systems. This paper presents morphological characteristics and cytogenetics analysis of <b>perennial</b> wheat that from crosses between octoploid trititrigia and Thinopyrum intermedium, introduces the important role of <b>perennial</b> wheat at the {{development of}} sustainable agriculture system as well as discusses the significant utilization of <b>perennial</b> wheat in ecological benefits...|$|R

5|$|His most {{significant}} influence was {{the introduction of}} the idea of wild gardening, which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English Flower Garden. The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow, woodand, and waterside is taken for granted today, but was revolutionary in Robinson's time. In the first edition, he happily used any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy <b>perennials</b> and natives {{from other parts of the}} world—thus Robinson's wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson's own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the 'garden' is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson's ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cultivars {{brought into}} {{cultivation}} in Australia {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century are <b>perennials.</b> 'Dargan Hill Monarch' was the first of these, and many more have followed. Profusely flowering, these grow in many colours including white, yellow, orange, bronze, pink, and red. Their commercial lifespans are generally around three years. Queensland-based company Aussie Winners has a range of compact plants ranging from orange to white known as Sundaze. Plants of this series usually have larger leaves. This range won the Gran premio d'oro at the Euroflora exposition in Geneva in 2001, for the best new plant series in the previous three years. 'Florabella Gold', a member of the Florabella series, won the award for best new pot plant (vegetative) in the Society of American Florists' competition of 1999. The Wallaby cultivars are range of taller forms with narrow leaves and white, yellow or pink flowers. Other commercial ranges include the Nullarbor series, and Queensland Federation daisies, including 'Wanetta Sunshine' and 'Golden Nuggets'.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables {{have been}} part of the human diet from time immemorial. Some are staple foods but most are {{accessory}} foodstuffs, adding variety to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time, adding nutrients necessary for health. Some vegetables are <b>perennials</b> but most are annuals and biennials, usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil by loosening it, removing or burying weeds, and adding organic manures or fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young plants; tending the crop while it grows to reduce weed competition, control pests, and provide sufficient water; harvesting the crop when it is ready; sorting, storing, and marketing the crop or eating it fresh from the ground.|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{plants have}} often been shown to possess novel traits {{such as the ability}} to fix nitrogen, access unused {{resource}} pools, or the ability to exude allelopathic chemicals. We describe a case of a successful invasion where the native and non-native species are very similar in most life-history characteristics including their growth forms, lifespan, and degree of summertime activity. Data from permanent transects suggest that exotic <b>perennial</b> grass invaders can establish into intact native-dominated grasslands, achieving cover values from 6 to 71 % over several years. We also established a 4 -year competition experiment to test the effect of each group—the native and non-native <b>perennial</b> grasses—on the other. Competitive interactions were found to consistently favor the non-native grasses: native <b>perennial</b> grass productivity was significantly lower in plots with exotic <b>perennial</b> grasses as compared to plots without exotic <b>perennial</b> grasses. By contrast, productivity of the exotic <b>perennial</b> grasses was not reduced by the presence of the native <b>perennial</b> grasses. These results suggest that competitive ability, rather than a unique trait, has contributed {{to the success of the}} exotic <b>perennial</b> grasses in our system. Management tools to control exotic <b>perennial</b> grass invasions are likely to negatively influence native <b>perennial</b> grass populations, as strategies that succeed against the invasive species may kill or reduce the native species as well...|$|R

5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous <b>perennials</b> and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E

40|$|<b>Perennial</b> kale {{is a rare}} leafy {{vegetable}} and forage crop that is mainly vegetatively propagated and therefore expensive to conserve ex situ. A genebank collection of 47 <b>perennial</b> kales and 34 reference samples from the main Brassica oleracea crop types were characterized with seven microsatellite markers in order to verify potential redundancies and to obtain more insight {{in the position of}} <b>perennial</b> kales within B. oleracea. Based on the obtained results and on data from previous studies, the collection was reduced with 49 % to 24 <b>perennial</b> kales. Considering this level of reduction, it was estimated that the investments made for the final verification by microsatellite analysis are returned after only 4 -year time. A principal coordinate plot clearly separated the <b>perennial</b> kales from the other crop types of B. oleracea, except in one case. This deviating accession of vegetatively preserved <b>perennial</b> kale clustered closely together with the single seed-preserved accession of <b>perennial</b> kale included in the study. These two accessions occupied an intermediate position between the group of vegetatively propagated <b>perennial</b> kales and the group of seed-propagated Brassica accessions, suggesting a hybridization background with another B. oleracea crop type.
