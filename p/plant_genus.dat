5|$|Erythranthe, the monkey-flowers and musk-flowers, is {{a diverse}} <b>plant</b> <b>genus</b> {{with at least}} 111 members (as of 2017) in the family Phrymaceae. Erythranthe was {{originally}} described as a separate genus, then generally regarded as a section within the genus Mimulus, and recently returned to generic rank. Mimulus sect. Diplacus was segregated from Mimulus as a separate genus at the same time. Mimulus remains as a small genus of eastern North America and the Southern Hemisphere. Molecular data show Erythranthe and Diplacus to be distinct evolutionary lines that are distinct from Mimulus as strictly defined.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} and illustrated as Tremella rufa by Nicolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1778. Elias Magnus Fries later (1828) called it Guepinia helvelloides in his Elenchus Fungorum, based on Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's Tremella helvelloides, both being names he sanctioned. This has made Tremella rufa and all names based on it unavailable for use, {{as they are}} conserved. Later, Lucien Quélet erected a separate monotypic genus Phlogiotis for Jacquin's species, whereas Julius Oscar Brefeld placed it (as Gyrocephalus rufa) in Persoon's small genus Gyrocephalus (rejected name for Gyromitra). The proper name for the fungus was debated for some time, as the name Guepinia is a homonym (pointed out by Fries in 1828), {{because it had been}} used by Toussaint Bastard in 1812 for a genus of flowering plants in the Cruciferae family. To further complicate matters, the generic name Teesdalia, originally considered to have priority over the name Guepinia for the <b>plant</b> <b>genus,</b> was later determined to have been validly published after Guepinia, rendering Teesdalia an illegitimate name. In 1982, changes in the International Code for Botanical Nomenclature gave protected status to all names adopted by Fries in the Elenchus Fungorum, and established Guepinia as the correct genus name.|$|E

50|$|It is {{now known}} that this genus is paraphyletic, and that the vittarioid ferns are derived from this larger paraphyletic genus.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} Bachelor thesis is focused on Ferula <b>genus</b> <b>plants,</b> their significance, occurrence and usage. The thesis also deals with their sulfur-containing compounds and the formation pathways of the sulfur compounds occurring in the Allium genus.

25|$|Heliamphora is {{a member}} of the Sarraceniaceae, a New World family in the order Ericales (heathers and allies). Heliamphora is limited to South America, but the family {{contains}} two other genera, Sarracenia and Darlingtonia, which are endemic to the Southeastern United States (with the exception of one species) and California respectively. Sarracenia purpurea subsp. purpurea (the northern pitcher plant) can be found as far north as Canada. Sarracenia is the pitcher <b>plant</b> <b>genus</b> most commonly encountered in cultivation, because it is relatively hardy and easy to grow.|$|E
25|$|Mandragora is a <b>plant</b> <b>genus</b> {{belonging}} to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Members of the genus are known as mandrakes. There are between three and five species in the genus. The one or two species found around the Mediterranean constitute the mandrake of ancient writers such as Dioscorides. Two or three further species are found eastwards into China. All are perennial herbaceous plants, with large tap-roots and leaves {{in the form of}} a rosette. Individual flowers are bell-shaped, whitish through to violet, and are followed by yellow or orange berries.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS) {{decided to}} pilot an Australia-wide {{distribution}} {{study of a}} significant <b>plant</b> <b>genus.</b> Banksia was chosen {{because it was a}} high-profile, widely distributed genus that was easily identified, but for which distribution and habitat was poorly known. The study mobilised over 400 volunteers, collecting over 25,000 field observations over a two-year period. Outcomes included the discovery of two new species, as well as new varieties and some rare colour variants, and discoveries of previously unknown populations of rare and threatened species. The collated data was used to create The Banksia Atlas, which was first published in 1988.|$|E
