RTP is used extensively in communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media, such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC, television services and web-based <b>push-to-talk</b> features.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} BlackBerry device had a {{monochrome display}} while newer models installed color displays. All newer {{models have been}} optimized for [...] "thumbing", the use of only the thumbs to type on a keyboard. The Storm 1 and Storm 2 include a SureType keypad for typing. Originally, system navigation was achieved {{with the use of}} a scroll wheel mounted on the right side of device models prior to the 8700. The trackwheel was replaced by the trackball with the introduction of the Pearl series, which allowed four-way scrolling. The trackball was replaced by the optical trackpad with the introduction of the Curve 8500 series. Models made to use iDEN networks, such as Nextel, SouthernLINC, NII Holdings, and Mike also incorporate a <b>push-to-talk</b> (PTT) feature, similar to a two-way radio.|$|E
50|$|Some systems use DTMF for <b>push-to-talk</b> unit ID. Each {{time the}} <b>push-to-talk</b> is pressed, the radio sends {{a string of}} DTMF digits. Each radio has a unique string of digits. This allows the base station to know who last called or who last pressed the <b>push-to-talk.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Telcel {{began to}} offer <b>push-to-talk</b> {{services}} over go its GSM network, though the main <b>Push-to-talk</b> provider in Mexico, {{as well as}} in other countries, is NII Holdings (Nextel).|$|E
50|$|The AT&T Centro {{also offers}} a <b>Push-To-Talk</b> Walkie-talkie like service not {{available}} on the CDMA device. This allows you to instantly see the availability of your contacts before calling them and make individual or group <b>Push-To-Talk</b> calls.|$|E
50|$|The <b>push-to-talk</b> feature, {{with which}} Nextel has gained popularity, was made {{interoperable}} with the QChat technology on the Sprint network in 2008. Sprint had originally launched its own <b>push-to-talk</b> service, known as ReadyLink, {{which is based}} on SIP. Due to the difference in technology, users of the ReadyLink service were never able to make or receive <b>push-to-talk</b> calls with users of the iDEN technology. By 2009, Sprint began phasing out QChat to again focus on marketing iDEN devices.|$|E
50|$|Nextel {{gained a}} {{significant}} marketing and technological advantage through its <b>push-to-talk</b> technology. In 2003, Verizon Wireless and Sprint PCS each launched <b>push-to-talk</b> features, with Cingular following in 2005; none have gained significant traction. Nextel and Verizon had entered {{a legal battle}} in June 2003 over Verizon's advertising for their <b>push-to-talk</b> feature. The companies reached a settlement in early 2004. Initial advertising for Verizon's service was heavy, but it became almost nonexistent fairly quickly, possibly due to poor reviews of the service.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{possible}} {{measure of}} capacity is system <b>push-to-talk</b> presses. A 187-day study of four Contra Costa County, California Sheriffs Department conventional two-way radio dispatch channels showed {{an average of}} around 2,500 <b>push-to-talk</b> presses per day. The count was within +/-350 a day across all four primary dispatch channels.|$|E
5000|$|QChat - QChat is a cellular/data 2-way <b>push-to-talk</b> voice {{communications}} program. Nextel's original <b>push-to-talk</b> technology {{operates on}} the iDen network, but Qualcomm's Qchat <b>push-to-talk</b> operates on the Evolution-Data Optimized Revision A (EV-DO Rev. A) mobile broadband network. Sprint-Nextel's first Qchat phones were released in June 2008. Both iDen and Qchat handsets are sold under the Nextel brand. On November 29, 2009 Sprint {{issued a statement}} to PhoneNews.com {{that there are no}} new QChat handsets on the product development roadmap, but it will continue supporting its existing QChat subscribers.|$|E
50|$|This {{is similar}} to <b>Push-to-talk</b> {{operation}} for radio phone communications.|$|E
50|$|The {{company has}} enabled its {{existing}} network with <b>Push-to-Talk</b> capabilities in January 2007.|$|E

50|$|<b>Push-to-talk</b> over {{cellular}} (PoC) is {{a service}} option for {{a cellular phone}} network that enables subscribers to use their phones as walkie-talkies with unlimited range. A typical <b>push-to-talk</b> connection connects almost instantly. A significant advantage of PTT is the ability for a single person to reach an active talk group with a single button press; users need not make several telephone calls to coordinate with a group.|$|E

50|$|In two-way radios with headsets, a <b>push-to-talk</b> button may be {{included}} on a cord or wireless electronics box clipped to the user's clothing. In fire trucks or an ambulance a button {{may be present}} where the corded headset plugs into the radio wiring. Aircraft typically have corded headsets and a separate <b>push-to-talk</b> button on the control yoke or control stick. Dispatch consoles often have a hand-operated <b>push-to-talk</b> buttons along with a foot switch or pedal. If the dispatcher's hands are on a computer keyboard, the user can step on the foot pedal to transmit. Some systems have muting so the dispatcher can be on a telephone call and the caller cannot hear what is said over the radio. Their headset microphone will mute if they transmit. This relieves the dispatcher of explaining every radio message to a caller.|$|E
50|$|Some trunked systems queue calls if a user's {{attempt to}} {{transmit}} gets a busy signal. In other words, if someone presses their <b>push-to-talk</b> button and all trunked radio system channels are busy, some systems will wait-list {{users in the}} same order as their busy signals occur. When a channel becomes available, the system notifies the user. There is disagreement about MultiNet's ability to queue calls when all channels are busy. Usually, the control channel is the path allowing wait-listed users to get in line. One publication says MultiNet communicates using low baud rate data multiplexed under voice if all channels are busy. One report says MultiNet users on a live system who got a busy had to either hold their <b>push-to-talk</b> button down continually until the system assigned them a channel or periodically check for an available channel by repeatedly pressing the <b>push-to-talk.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some {{cellular}} telephone networks offer a <b>push-to-talk</b> handset that allows walkie-talkie-like operation over the cellular network, without dialing a call each time. However, the cellphone provider must be accessible.|$|E
50|$|Unlike manual <b>push-to-talk</b> (PTT) operation, VOX isautomatic; {{the user}} can keep {{his or her}} hands free while talking. ButVOX also has some {{significant}} disadvantages that explain why PTT isstill common.|$|E
50|$|<b>Push-to-talk</b> {{cellular}} calls similarly provide half-duplex communications â€” {{while one}} person transmits, the other(s) receive. This combines the operational advantages of PTT with the interference resistance and other virtues of mobile phones.|$|E
50|$|Sprint has {{replaced}} Readylink with Qualcomm's QChat. This technology will run over the Sprint high-speed EV-DO data network, {{giving it the}} closest comparable speeds to Motorola's iDEN Direct-Connect in the <b>push-to-talk</b> industry.|$|E
50|$|Modat {{features}} are programmable {{and could be}} used in any combination desired by the user. For example, some systems use only <b>push-to-talk</b> unit ID or only emergency button. Others may use both. One setting that is adjustable is the length of time from <b>push-to-talk</b> press until the tone sequence starts. This delays the start of the tone sequence to allows systems with long time constants in CTCSS decoders or voting comparators to open an audio path. In addition to Motorola, other companies make add-on encoders that can modify a different brand of radio to work with a Modat system.|$|E
50|$|Recordings show radios were {{programmed}} to send unit ID on tactical channels. Radios accept unit ID on a per-channel basis. When mobile or hand-held radios are programmed, the unit ID encoders should be disabled on all channels where the feature is not used. This saves air time {{for about two}} to three syllables of speech per <b>push-to-talk</b> press. For example, unless the communications van or chief's vehicles had <b>push-to-talk</b> unit ID decoders, or the channels were recorded for later analysis where unit IDs were decoded from the recordings, the encoders should be turned off for tactical channels to reduce air time used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Push-to-talk</b> (PTT), {{also known}} as press-to-transmit, is a method of having conversations or talking on {{half-duplex}} communication lines, including two-way radio, using a momentary button to switch from voice reception mode to transmit mode.|$|E
