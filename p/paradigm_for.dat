5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{relationship between}} ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible {{with the development}} of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication Molecular Ecology in 1992. Molecular ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution. Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Molecular ecology engendered a new research <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology. For example, molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous. In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called phylogeography.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, a new <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> multi-objective {{optimization}} {{based on}} novelty was presented using evolutionary algorithms. This new paradigm searches for novel solutions in objective space (i.e., novelty search on objective space) {{in addition to}} the search for non-dominated solutions. Novelty search is like stepping stones guiding the search to previously unexplored places. It is specially useful in overcoming bias and plateaus as well as guiding the search in many-objective optimization problems. Subpopulation Algorithm based on Novelty is the first algorithm based on this paradigm.|$|E
25|$|Although Oswald Garrison Villard's 1910 {{biography}} of Brown {{was thought to}} be friendly (Villard being the grandson of abolitionist Garrison), he also added fuel to the anti-Brown fire by criticizing him as a muddled, pugnacious, bumbling, and homicidal madman. Villard himself was a pacifist and admired Brown in many respects, but his interpretation of the facts provided a <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> later anti-Brown writers. By the mid-20th century, some scholars were fairly convinced that John Brown was a fanatic and killer, while some African Americans sustained a positive view of the man.|$|E
25|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} foreign aid is what some have called a 'neo-Newtonian' <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> thinking and action. Development and humanitarian problems are frequently dealt with {{as if they}} are simple, linear, and best addressed through the application of 'best practices' developed in Western countries and then applied ad infinitum by aid agencies. This approach has come under sustained criticism in Ben Ramalingam's Aid on the Edge of Chaos. This work advocates that aid agencies should embrace the ideas and principles of complex adaptive systems research in order to improve how they think about and act on development problems.|$|E

25|$|The Soma {{sacrifice}} {{that takes}} twelve-days is called Dvādaśāha {{in which a}} ten-day sequence called dāśa-rātra, is flanked by two intensive day and overnight sacrifices called atirātras as opening and closing days. The Agnistoma serves as the <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> all Soma sacrifices up to those of twelve days duration, the Dvādaśāha soma sacrifice is paradigmatic for Soma sacrifices of twelve days and more. The Aitareya Brahmana and the Kausitaki Brahmana, belong to the Rig Veda, both preserve this Rig Vedic rite. The Aitareya Brahmana (IV.25) calls the Dvādaśāha sacrifice as the 'sacrifice of Prajapati', and the Jaiminiya Brahmana (III.302) calls the stomas of Dvādaśāha as the 'powerful sons of Prajapati'.|$|E
25|$|Doctors were {{nevertheless}} influential. They {{liked to}} write. Compared {{to the number}} of books written, not many have survived; for example, Tiberius Claudius Menecrates composed 150 medical works, of which only a few fragments remain. Some that did remain almost in entirety are the works of Galen, Celsus, Hippocrates and the herbal expert, Pedanius Dioscorides who wrote the 5-volume De Materia Medica. The Natural History of Pliny the Elder became a <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> all subsequent works like it and gave its name to the topic, although Pliny was not himself an observer of the natural world like Aristotle or Theophrastus, whose Enquiry into Plants included a book on their medicinal uses.|$|E
25|$|The report {{illustrates}} {{the usefulness of}} the human security approach, particularly its ability to examine the cause of conflicts that explain and justify humanitarian intervention. In addition, it could also act as a <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> identifying, prioritizing and resolving large transnational problems, one of the fundamental factors that act as a stimulus for humanitarian intervention in the first place. However, human security still faces difficulties concerning the scope of its applicability, as large problems requiring humanitarian intervention usually are built up from an array of socio-political, cultural and economic problems that may be beyond the limitations of humanitarian projects. On the other hand, successful examples of the use of human security principles within interventions can be found.|$|E

25|$|Canadian {{religious}} historian,Barrie Wilson {{has proposed}} a different <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> understanding the relationship of Paul to Jesus, the Jesus Movement led by Jesus' brother James and Judaism. In How Jesus Became Christian, Wilson suggests that Paul's religion differed from that of Jesus in terms of origins, teachings and practices. Paul's was a new religion. His Christ Movement became linked to Jesus, James' Jesus Movement and Judaism in general through the creative historical fiction of the Book of Acts. In Wilson's view, Paul's non-Torah religion supplanted that of Jesus and took the movement well outside the Jewish orbit, focusing {{not so much on}} a Jewish Messiah or the teachings of the historical Jesus but on the worship of a dying-rising savior God-human figure.|$|E
25|$|Nintendo {{released}} Super Mario 64 in 1996. Before then, {{there was}} no established <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> bringing platform games into 3D. Mario 64 set a new standard, and it was imitated by many subsequent 3D platformers. Its gameplay allowed players to explore open 3D environments with greater freedom than any previous attempt at a 3D platform game. To aid this, Nintendo added an analog control stick to its Nintendo 64 controller, something which had not been included in a standard console controller since the Vectrex, and which has since become standard on other controllers. This allowed for the finer precision needed for a free perspective. Players no longer followed a linear path {{to the ends of}} levels, either, with most levels providing objective-based goals. There were a handful of boss levels that offered more traditional platforming.|$|E
