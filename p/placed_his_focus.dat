50|$|Building upon Lancaster's initial vision, each {{successive}} Artistic Director {{has taken the}} Magnus reigns and strengthened the theatre's local and national profile. From 1977 to 1982, Tibor Feheregyhazi created a community-focused company and built the local audience base for mainstage productions. Following Tibor, Brian Richmond took over from 1982 to 1987 and established a high national profile for Magnus by producing new Canadian plays. Other theatres subsequently produced many of these plays across the country, firmly placing Magnus on the Canadian professional theatre map. In 1987, Michael McLaughlin took over and shifted the focus {{back to the community}} as he further established the local audience base. McLaughlin also initiated the successful Theatre in Education program to further develop the strong ties that Magnus and the community share. From 1992 to 2016, Mario Crudo <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>focus</b> on the following areas: strengthening and broadening ties with the community, partnerships, generating new interest in mainstage productions, advancing new play development, and solidifying adult regional touring and other outreach programs.|$|E

5000|$|Being one of Hamlin Garland’s less famous works, no real {{criticism}} for A Member of the Third House exists. However, Garland’s writing style has been thoroughly analyzed throughout the years. Classified as a realist, Garland strongly affirmed distaste {{for the treatment}} of romantic passion in fiction. [...] This notion clearly appears in A Member of the Third House. A host of male characters dominate the story while the few female characters retain a limited role. Garland’s abundant affectionate recollections of male comrades suggest that he was incapable of exploring publicly the importance of heterosexual intercourse. [...] This attitude could, of course, be simply a continuation of the nineteenth-century attitudes of masculine dominance in a society. Although there is a foundation in A Member of the Third House for heterosexual romance, Garland dismisses the opportunity, <b>placing</b> <b>his</b> <b>focus</b> on the real, political issues at stake. Nevertheless, Garland provides countless vivid descriptions of his male characters and their interactions effectively weave together the story.|$|R

Buemi was delighted with the race victory, praising his team for their work and hoped his recent form would continue into the season's following rounds. His team was concerned over his battery overheating; Buemi stated that he drove cautiously {{in the first few}} laps to know where he was and that he had the entire car package under control. Second-place finisher Vergne stated that he was [...] "very happy" [...] because of his team being recently new having had no prior testing of his car and all new personnel and equipment. He said he corrected the problems he had in the season's first two races and felt certain that he would <b>place</b> <b>his</b> <b>focus</b> into winning races: [...] "I think the whole team did a fantastic job, working really, really hard, sometimes many hours overnight and in the end it paid off." [...] Di Grassi, who finished in third, said {{that it was a good}} day for his team although he acknowledged that he was not on the same pace levels as the e.Dams-Renault cars. He revealed that his first car had a large amount of oversteer and stated every smallest change would make a large difference in terms of the championship.|$|R

40|$|Benediktinac Grgur Lazzari bio je dubrovački nadbiskup od 1777. do 1792. Njegova uprava dubrovačkom Crkvom u vrijeme kada je svjetovna vlast Republike sve više gubila dodir sa stvarnošću razmatra se na temelju dvaju pozdravnih govora izrečenih na latinskome prigodom svečanog ustoličenja u katedrali i prigodom posljednjeg ispraćaja u crkvi Sv. Jakova. U svjetlu po vi jesnih izvora iz Državnog arhiva u Dubrovniku Lazzarijev pontifikat dobiva potpuniju ocjenu. The work of Grgur Lazzari, {{archbishop}} of Dubrovnik (1777 - 1792), is elucidated {{on the basis}} of standard archival sources but also from the perspective of two Latin orations in his honour: the first delivered by the Dominican friar Arkanđeo Kalić, at the cathedral ceremony celebrating the archbishop’s solemn entry in the City in March 1778, and the second by the diocesan priest Marko Kordić, who delivered a sermon at the archbishop’s funeral ceremony in St Jacob’s church in February 1792. Although in principle both orators followed the same theoretical pattern established over the centuries to be delivered on similar occasions, they managed to emphasise the themes of their own inclination. Thus Kalić <b>places</b> <b>his</b> <b>focus</b> on the Church-state relationship, while Kordić brings to attention his personal relations and the long friendship with the deceased archbishop. They both awarded him special credit for his considerable contribution as a Benedictine friar to the revival of the withering Mljet congregation. Lazzari’s archbishopric coincided with a difficult period of the Republic’s history, marked by poor crop seasons, droughts, epidemics and wars in the neighbouring lands. Economic crisis gave rise to lack of discipline and faintheartedness among the clergy, which fully relied on the support of the state. Lazzari was credited for his numerous achievements, such as the improvement of the Church’s position and his role in the final solution with regard to the organisation of the city parishes. His results were essentially due to an objective assessment of the possibilities, vast experience acquired through the decades’ governance of monastic property and goods, as well as to his conciliatory attitude towards the Republic government. The latter, in turn, not only supported his construction projects on the archbishop’s palace and in the cathedral, but also sided with him in the conflict with Abbot Fortunat Mavro Krivelja, a former Franciscan, whom Lazzari had personally admitted into the Benedictine Order with the purpose of reinforcing the slack discipline. Unable to achieve his overambitious plans to root out the crisis that had befallen the order, Krivelja wrongfully accused Archbishop Lazzari before the pope for being responsible for all the evil. Despite Krivelja’s attempts to justify his actions before the Senate, he was sentenced to banishment from the state and thus remained the sole unpleasant episode in the career of Archbishop Lazzari. However, by his own example Lazzari showed a complete failure of the Ragusan government policy to find an ideal individual instead of launching a thorough reform to solve the long-lasting crisis...|$|R
500|$|Owen {{launched}} {{a run for}} the Presidency in Oklahoma on May 19, 1919, and undertook a tour of several states, seeking support, in the spring of 1920. [...] He published a number of books during this period, publicizing his involvement in the passage of the Federal Reserve Act and his views on a variety of economic and foreign policy issues (see Works by Robert Latham Owen below). [...] Owen received some indications of support from his fellow-Progressive and long-time ally, the party's three-time standard-bearer William Jennings Bryan, who joined him on his campaign visits to some of the Western states, but Bryan's support for Owen was lukewarm, his influence in the party was past his peak, and he <b>placed</b> much of <b>his</b> <b>focus</b> in 1920 on promoting the cause of prohibition, the main theme of his eventual speech at the convention. [...] Bryan declined to run for the nomination himself for multiple reasons — his health was problematic (he described himself to one journalist as [...] "at the end of life") and he expected the Democrats to go down to defeat — though he privately left open the possibility of accepting the nomination in exceptional circumstances. Owen, for his part, gained few significant endorsements.|$|R

50|$|As {{soon as he}} was appointed, John Fielding {{examined}} the activity of the Bow Street office and the issues that needed to be addressed; the financial contribution from the state was still in <b>place,</b> so <b>his</b> pamphlet <b>focused</b> mainly on the need to tackle violence and highway robbery in particular. At the beginning, Fielding shared his office with Saunders Welch, an energetic former grocer elected High Constable of Holborn, who had led the first group of organized thief-catchers in 1749 and selected his men from former constables, discharged {{at the end of their}} year in office, who were prepared to receive legal training and carry on the work. Eventually, the government agreed to establish a separate magistrate office from which Welch could operate, leaving Fielding as the dominant presence in Bow Street. Over the years, the government subvention raised from the initial £200 to £400 in 1757 and to £600 by 1765, as Fielding managed to persuade the duke of Newcastle, now first lord of the Treasury, of the increasing costs of an active policing and advertising, as well as of the need of recruiting a permanent clerical staff for the office. The administration of the funds was left largely in Fielding's hands. He provided payments to six officers, for investigating and attempting to apprehend offenders, and occasionally to a few assistants.|$|R
