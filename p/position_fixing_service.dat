5000|$|In {{the wide}} estuary, <b>position</b> <b>fixing</b> with {{reference}} to shore objects to be viewed from {{the deck of a}} vessel, is very difficult. In 1983 KoPT introduced the Electronic <b>Position</b> <b>Fixing</b> System [...] "Syledis" [...] for <b>position</b> <b>fixing</b> of the vessels plying in the wide estuary of the Hooghly river. The Shore-based Syledis <b>Position</b> <b>Fixing</b> System was functioning round the clock {{with the help of the}} Syledis Stations located at Haldia, Raichak, Dadanpatra Bar and Frazergunj. The system was effectively utilized for the purpose of hydrographic survey and dredging.KoPT has now replaced the Syledis <b>Position</b> <b>Fixing</b> System by Differential GPS (Differential Global <b>Position</b> <b>Fixing</b> System). This latest state-of the art technology provides improved location accuracy of up to 10 cm.|$|R

A single channel (400 MH_Z band) receiver, HOKUSHIN=MAGNAVOX Satellite Navigation System HX- 902, installed on the ship. The results obtained are as follows; 1) The distribution of the <b>fixed</b> <b>positions</b> {{had a tendency to}} extend east and west. 2) The amount of the <b>position</b> <b>fixing</b> error was about 0. 3 sea miles in day time and in night time. 3) When the satellite didn't take peak elevations between 15 ° and 75 °, the amount of the <b>position</b> <b>fixing</b> error had a tendency to take large magnitude. 4) The interval of the <b>position</b> <b>fixing</b> by NNSS was normally less than 2 hours, but navigators often {{have to pay attention to}} fall into impossibility of <b>position</b> <b>fixing</b> for many hours. 敬天丸が鹿児島港谷山に停泊中,同船に装備されている北辰＝マグナポックス商船用衛星航法システムHX- 902 (400 MH_Z帯 1 波のみの受信装置) により測位実験を行ない次のような知見を得た。 1) 全測位点の偏りは南北方向より東西方向により大きく偏る傾向にあった。 2) 測位精度は昼間・夜間の別にかかわりなく,その誤差の大きさは約 0. 3 海里であった。 3) 衛星を見る最大仰角が 15 度未満の場合,および 75 度をこえた場合誤差が大きく現われた。 4) 測位間隔は 78 %が 2 時間以内であったが, 4 時間以上も 7 %みられ,長時間測位不能に陥いることもあることに注意を払わなければならない...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the course}} of a year, a consumer-grade GNSS {{receiver}} was used to collect data in three forest types in northeastern Georgia (USA). During each visit, fifty <b>position</b> <b>fixes</b> were collected to estimate a horizontal position. Since there has been a significant amount of debate regarding the appropriate number of <b>position</b> <b>fixes</b> to collect to determine a position, this analysis was conducted to understand whether the static horizontal position error (a) changed over the collection period of fifty <b>position</b> <b>fixes,</b> (b) was significantly different than a single <b>position</b> <b>fix</b> collected to estimate the positions, and (c) was a function of forest type. We failed to reject the hypothesis that static horizontal position accuracy does not significantly change with increasing numbers of <b>position</b> <b>fixes</b> collected to determine a position, yet we favor rejecting the hypothesis that trends do not differ by forest type or by density of trees per unit area. The results are not entirely conclusive, and the time (season) of year may influence the results observed within certain forest types (e. g., young coniferous forests). We observed a trend that the static horizontal position accuracy in a young coniferous forest, on average, improved from a position determined by a single <b>position</b> <b>fix</b> to a <b>position</b> determined from the average of fifty <b>position</b> <b>fixes.</b> A much less relevant trend in accuracy was observed in a deciduous forest, and no trend at all was observed in an older coniferous forest...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the Global Positioning System (GPS) and simple interpolation schemes can be utilized to satisfy typical orbit determination demands of applications satellites. The complete GPS consists of 24 satellites and permits a <b>position</b> <b>fix</b> of a user satellite at any arbitrary instant.

A set of possible compromises between these two factors is presented. The Phase I GPS consists of 6 satellites and permits a <b>position</b> <b>fix</b> of a user satellite just 36 % of the time.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the usable time and got <b>position</b> <b>fixes</b> from overseas fixed stations {{for the past}} three years in order to evaluate the positioning accuracy of GPS. We were able to receive positioning signals from only 6 satellites until 1989, but in October 1990, 15 GPS satellites became available. And the orbits of satellites have been corrected. The usable time was 7 ～ 9 hours until 1989, but it came to be more than 18 and a half hours in 1990. Then we were generally able to get <b>position</b> <b>fixes</b> by 3 D (three-dimensional positioning) and the high level of 2 D 3 (two-dimensional positioning with three satellites). Therefore, <b>position</b> <b>fixes</b> of 2 D 2 (two-dimensional positioning with two satellites) became hardly necessary. The accuracy of <b>position</b> <b>fixes</b> went down once in 1989. In 1990, the standard deviations of D. lat (difference of latitude) and Dep (departure) were kept less than 45 meters. We may conclude that in spite of selective availability, the accuracy has been improved owing to the increasing number of GPS satellites and the correction of thier orbits...|$|R

5000|$|A {{practical}} example of obtaining a <b>position</b> <b>fix</b> {{would be for}} a ship to take bearing measurements on three lighthouses positioned along the coast. These measurements could be made visually using a hand bearing compass, or in poor visibility electronically using radar or radio direction finding. Since all physical observations are subject to errors the resulting <b>position</b> <b>fix</b> is also subject to error. Although in theory two lines of position (LOP) are enough to define a point, in practice 'crossing' more LOPs provides greater accuracy and confidence, especially if the lines cross at a good angle to each other. Three LOPs are considered the minimum for a practical navigational fix. The three LOPs when drawn on the chart will in general form a triangle, known as a 'cocked hat'.
