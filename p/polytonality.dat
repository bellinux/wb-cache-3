25|$|The {{harmony of}} Salome {{makes use of}} {{extended}} tonality, chromaticism, {{a wide range of}} keys, unusual modulations, tonal ambiguity, and <b>polytonality.</b> Some of the major characters have keys associated with them, such as Salome and Jochanaan, as do some of the major psychological themes, such as desire and death.|$|E
25|$|Twelve-tone {{technique}} {{was not the}} only new experiment in tonality. Darius Milhaud developed the use of <b>polytonality,</b> that is, music where different instruments play in different keys at the same time. Milhaud wrote 18 string quartets; quartets number 14 and 15 are written so that each can be played by itself, or the two can be played {{at the same time as}} an octet. Milhaud also used jazz idioms, as in his Suite for clarinet, violin and piano.|$|E
25|$|The {{thematic}} {{material of}} Symphony No. 2 {{is designed to}} emulate the sensation of flying. Barber was {{very clear that he}} did not view the symphony as program music. However, in his program notes he mentions that the first movement was meant to capture the excitement of flying while the second movement was inspired by his night flights. The final movement begins with very fast string passages with no barlines to express the sensation of flight. Samuel Barber uses tension and release throughout to create a greater sense of energy. His use of ostinatos, <b>polytonality,</b> dissonance, and angular lines create a work that can be described as one of Barber's most progressive works. Barber would later revise the work and state that the symphony has no programmatic intentions.|$|E
50|$|The opera {{is set in}} Brazil and {{generally}} follows the scenario of the film faithfully although the script is of necessity much reduced. However the libretto respects traditions of opera with many ariosos, ensembles and choruses apt for singing. The music is characterized by “moments of lushness... ear-catching <b>polytonalities</b> and extraordinary susurrating tonal clusters for the chorus”, along with rhythms and suggestions of the samba woven into gluckist memories which reflect the partly South American setting.|$|R
5000|$|Though part of {{the acid}} jazz scene of the early 1990s, D*Note was {{influenced}} by twentieth century French and English classical music and modal jazz. Influences from the jazz world include Miles Davis, Bill Evans, and Keith Jarrett. Classical influences include Maurice Ravel, whose <b>polytonalities</b> {{can be heard in}} D*Note's use of Lydian modes (what are known in the jazz world as “sharp elevens”). Other classical influences are Debussy, Vaugha Williams, and Aaron Copland. Another key influence, who can be heard on [...] "D*Votion" [...] and [...] "Deep Water" [...] on the second album Criminal Justice, is the American minimalist composer Steve Reich. D*Note contributed the [...] "Phased and Konfused" [...] remix to the Steve Reich composition [...] "Piano Phase", featured on the 1999 Reich Remixed album.|$|R
5000|$|Chuck Israels, later a bassist of the Bill Evans Trio, {{speaking}} of Peace Piece on his website: [...] Peace Piece {{is an example}} of the depth of Evans' compositional technique. It is an ostinato piece, composed and recorded long before the more recent superficial synthesis of Indian and American music; in fact, it owes more to Satie and Debussy than to Ravi Shankar. The improvisation starts simply over a gentle ostinato, which quickly fades into the background. Evans allows the fantasy that evolves from the opening motive (an inversion of the descending fifth in the ostinato) more freedom than he would in an improvisation tied to a changing accompaniment. He takes advantage of the ostinato as a unifying element against which ideas flower, growing more lush and colorful as the piece unfolds. <b>Polytonalities</b> and cross rhythms increase in density as the ostinato undulates gently, providing a central rhythmic and tonal reference. The improvisation becomes increasingly complex against the unrelenting simplicity of the accompaniment, until, near the end, Evans gradually reconciles the two elements."Jacques Réda, a poet and jazz critic, has written a poem in French about Peace Piece.|$|R
500|$|Longtime Spielberg {{collaborator}} John Williams, who {{composed the}} film's musical score, described {{the challenge of}} creating one that would generate sympathy for such an odd-looking creature. As with their previous collaborations, Spielberg liked every theme Williams composed and had it included. Spielberg loved the music for the final chase {{so much that he}} edited the sequence to suit it. Williams took a modernist approach, especially with his use of <b>polytonality,</b> which refers to the sound of two different keys played simultaneously. The Lydian mode can also be used in a polytonal way. Williams combined <b>polytonality</b> and the Lydian mode to express a mystic, dreamlike and heroic quality. His theme—emphasizing coloristic instruments such as the harp, piano, celesta, and other keyboards, as well as percussion—suggests E.T.'s childlike nature and his [...] "machine".|$|E
500|$|Three {{major works}} of the 1950s round off Tippett's first period: the Corelli Fantasia (1953), in which [...] Clarke sees, in the alla pastorale section, the composer's {{instrumental}} writing at its best; [...] the mildly controversial Piano Concerto (1955) which Whittall regards {{as one of the}} composer's most intriguing works—an attempt to [...] "make the piano sing"; and the Symphony No. 2 (1957) which Tippett acknowledges as [...] a turning-point in his music. Until this point, says Matthews, Tippett's style had remained broadly tonal. The Second Symphony was his first essay in <b>polytonality,</b> paving the way to the dissonance and chromaticism of subsequent works. Milner, too, recognises the pivotal position of this symphony in Tippett's development [...] which, he says, both sums up the style of the late 1950s and presages the changes to come.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Prokofiev's {{father died}} and Sergei's {{financial}} support ceased. Fortunately {{he had started}} making {{a name for himself}} as a composer and pianist outside the Conservatory, making appearances at the St Petersburg Evenings of Contemporary Music. There he performed several of his more adventurous piano works, such as his highly chromatic and dissonant Etudes, Op. 2 (1909). His performance of it impressed the organisers of the Evenings sufficiently for them to invite Prokofiev to give the Russian premiere of Arnold Schoenberg's Drei Klavierstücke, Op. 11. Prokofiev's harmonic experimentation continued with Sarcasms for piano, Op. 17 (1912), which makes extensive use of <b>polytonality.</b> He composed his first two piano concertos around then, the latter of which caused a scandal at its premiere (23 August 1913, Pavlovsk). According to one account, the audience left the hall with exclamations of [...] "'To hell with this futuristic music! The cats on the roof make better music!'", but the modernists were in rapture.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{characteristics}} that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional <b>polytonality</b> — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; [...] "He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part {{a product of the}} composer's poor health: [...] "the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance [...] "a spirit of practical comradeship... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible".|$|E

2500|$|Practische Beispiele: ein Beitrag zur Geistescultur des Tonsetzers ... begleitet mit philosophisch-practischen Anmerkungen (1803), a didactic {{work that}} {{includes}} 25 sight-reading exercises of extreme difficulty, {{some of which}} were later published separately or in collections such as the 36 fugues. The exercises are divided into three groups: one for polyrhythm, one for <b>polytonality</b> and one that included exercises written on four staves and so required knowledge of the alto and tenor clefs.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Edward Ives ( [...] ; October 20, 1874May 19, 1954) was an American [...] modernist composer. He {{is one of}} {{the first}} American composers of {{international}} renown, though his music was largely ignored during his life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. Over time, he came to be regarded as an [...] "American original". He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including <b>polytonality,</b> polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|The action {{takes place}} in the fictional, African-American {{neighborhood}} of Catfish Row, Charleston, South Carolina. With the exception of several minor speaking roles, all of the characters are African-American. The music combines elements of popular music of the day, with a strong influence of African-American music, of the period, with techniques typical of opera, such as recitative, through-composition and an extensive system of leitmotifs. Porgy and Bess contains some of Gershwin's most sophisticated music, including a fugue, a passacaglia, the use of atonality, <b>polytonality</b> and polyrhythm, and a tone row. Even the [...] "set numbers" [...] (of which [...] "Summertime", [...] "I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'" [...] and [...] "It Ain't Necessarily So" [...] are well known examples) {{are some of the most}} refined and ingenious of Gershwin's compositions. For the performances, Gershwin collaborated with Eva Jessye, whom he picked as the musical director. The work was first performed in 1935; it was a box-office failure in the middle of the Great Depression.|$|E
2500|$|Reicha's output {{during his}} Vienna years was {{prolific}} and included large semi-didactic cycles of {{works such as}} 36 Fugues for piano (in a [...] "new method of fugal writing" [...] which attracted the scorn of Beethoven and anger of Cherubini at the Conservatoire [...] ), L'art de varier (a set of 57 variations on an original theme), and exercises for the treatise Practische Beispiele (Practical Examples). During the later Paris period, however, he focused his attention mostly on theory and produced a number of treatises on composition. Works of this period include 25 crucially important wind quintets which are considered the locus classicus of that genre and are his best-known compositions. None of the advanced ideas he advocated in the most radical of his music and writings (not used in the wind quintets), including polyrhythm, <b>polytonality</b> and microtonal music, were accepted or employed by nineteenth-century composers. Due to Reicha's unwillingness to have his music published (like Michael Haydn before him), he fell into obscurity soon after his death and his life and work {{have yet to be}} intensively studied.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1920s, Cowell toured widely in North America and Europe as a pianist, playing his own {{experimental}} works, seminal explorations of atonality, <b>polytonality,</b> polyrhythms, and non-Western modes. It was {{on one of these}} tours that in 1923, his friend Richard Buhlig introduced Cowell to young pianist Grete Sultan in Berlin. They worked closely togetheran aspect vital to Grete Sultan's personal and artistic development. Cowell later made such an impression with his tone cluster technique that Béla Bartók requested his permission to adopt it. Another novel method advanced by Cowell, in pieces such as Aeolian Harp (ca. 1923), was what he dubbed [...] "string piano"—rather than using the keys to play, the pianist reaches inside the instrument and plucks, sweeps, and otherwise manipulates the strings directly. Cowell's endeavors with string piano techniques were the primary inspiration for John Cage's development of the prepared piano. In early chamber music pieces, such as Quartet Romantic (1915–17) and Quartet Euphometric (1916–19 [...] ), Cowell pioneered a compositional approach he called [...] "rhythm-harmony": [...] "Both quartets are polyphonic, and each melodic strand has its own rhythm," [...] he explained. [...] "Even the canon in the first movement of the Romantic has different note-lengths for each voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Portrait Trilogy" [...] was {{completed}} with Akhnaten (1982–1983, premiered in 1984), a vocal and orchestral composition sung in Akkadian, Biblical Hebrew, and Ancient Egyptian. In addition, this opera featured an actor reciting ancient Egyptian texts {{in the language}} of the audience. Akhnaten was commissioned by the Stuttgart Opera in a production designed by Achim Freyer. It premiered simultaneously at the Houston Opera in a production directed by David Freeman and designed by Peter Sellars. At the time of the commission, the Stuttgart Opera House was undergoing renovation, necessitating the use of a nearby playhouse with a smaller orchestra pit. Upon learning this, Glass and conductor Dennis Russell Davies visited the playhouse, placing music stands around the pit to determine how many players the pit could accommodate. The two found they could not fit a full orchestra in the pit. Glass decided to eliminate the violins, which had the effect of [...] "giving the orchestra a low, dark sound that came to characterize the piece and suited the subject very well." [...] As Glass remarked in 1992, Akhnaten is significant in his work since it represents a [...] "first extension out of a triadic harmonic language", an experiment with the <b>polytonality</b> of his teachers Persichetti and Milhaud, a musical technique which Glass compares to [...] "an optical illusion, such as in the paintings of Josef Albers".|$|E
2500|$|After these operas, Glass {{began working}} on a symphonic cycle, {{commissioned}} by the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who told Glass at the time: [...] "I'm {{not going to let}} you [...] [...] [...] be one of those opera composers who never write a symphony". Glass responded with two 3-movement symphonies ("Low" [...] , and Symphony No. 2 [...] ); his first in an ongoing series of symphonies is a combination of the composer's own musical material with themes featured in prominent tracks of the David Bowie/Brian Eno album Low (1977), whereas Symphony No. 2 is described by Glass as a study in <b>polytonality.</b> He referred to the music of Honegger, Milhaud, and Villa-Lobos as possible models for his symphony. With the Concerto Grosso (1992), Symphony No. 3 (1995), a Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra (1995), written for the Rascher Quartet (all commissioned by conductor Dennis Russel Davies), and Echorus (1994/95), a more transparent, refined, and intimate chamber-orchestral style paralleled the excursions of his large-scale symphonic pieces. In the four movements of his Third Symphony, Glass treats a 19-piece string orchestra as an extended chamber ensemble. In the third movement, Glass re-uses the chaconne as a formal device; one commentator characterized Glass's symphony as one of the composer's [...] "most tautly unified works" [...] The third Symphony was closely followed by a fourth, subtitled Heroes (1996), commissioned the American Composers Orchestra. Its six movements are symphonic reworkings of themes by Glass, David Bowie, and Brian Eno (from their album [...] "Heroes", 1977); as in other works by the composer, it is also a hybrid work and exists in two versions: one for the concert hall, and another, shorter one for dance, choreographed by Twyla Tharp.|$|E
