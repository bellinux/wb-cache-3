40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we propose}} {{the use of}} optical <b>pulse</b> <b>coding</b> {{techniques}} for simultaneous strain and temperature sensing based on spontaneous Brillouin scattering. Optical <b>pulse</b> <b>coding</b> provides a significant receiver signal-to-noise ratio enhancement, allowing for accurate Brillouin intensity and fre-quency shift measurements at low peak power levels. Due to the cross-sensitivity of these two parameters on both temperature and strain, optical <b>pulse</b> <b>coding</b> improves the temperature and strain resolution and sensing range with respect to Brillouin sensors operating with conventional single-pulses at the same peak power level. The proposed technique provides a high-performance cost-effective solution avoiding the use of high peak power levels.

25|$|Today's LIRR {{signal system}} {{has evolved from}} its legacy Pennsylvania Railroad-based system. The {{railroad}} utilizes a variety of wayside railroad signals including position light, color light and dwarf signals. In addition, much of the LIRR {{is equipped with a}} bi-directional <b>Pulse</b> <b>code</b> cab signaling called automatic speed control (ASC), though portions of the railway still retain single direction wayside only signalling. Unlike other railroads which began using color light signals in the 20th century, the LIRR did not begin using signals with color lights on its above ground sections until 2006. Some portions of the railway lack automatic signals and cab signals completely, instead train and track car movements are governed only by timetable and verbal/written train orders.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1920s, the PRR {{installed}} <b>Pulse</b> <b>code</b> cab signaling along certain tracks used by high-speed passenger trains. Information traveled through the rails using track circuits, {{was picked up by}} a sensor on the locomotive, and displayed in the engineer's cab. PRR ultimately installed cab signals on its New York-Washington, Philadelphia-Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh-Indianapolis lines (the latter which was later downgraded by PC and ultimately abandoned by Conrail). PRR also experimented with cab signals without wayside signals, an approach later expanded by Conrail (Conemaugh line) and Norfolk Southern Railway (Cleveland line). Cab signals were subsequently adopted by several other U.S. railroads, especially on passenger lines. This technology, advanced for its time, is still used by Amtrak.|$|E
25|$|Parameters {{measured}} include acceleration, angular velocity, flow rate, position, pressure, temperature, voltage, current, frequency, and others. Sensor signals were {{conditioned by}} amplifiers or converters located in measuring racks. There are four measuring racks in the IU at locations 1, 9, and 15 and twenty signal conditioning modules in each. Conditioned signals were routed to their assigned telemetry channel by the measuring distributor at location 10. There were two telemetry links. In {{order for the}} two IU telemetry links to handle approximately 200 separate measurements, these links must be shared. Both frequency sharing and time sharing multiplexing techniques were used to accomplish this. The two modulation techniques used were <b>pulse</b> <b>code</b> modulation/frequency modulation (PCM/FM) and frequency modulation/frequency modulation (FM/FM).|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental analysis of optical <b>pulse</b> <b>coding</b> techniques applied to distributed optical fiber temperature sensors based on spontaneous Brillouin scattering using the Landau-Placzek ratio (LPR) scheme is presented, quantifying {{in particular the}} impact of Simplex coding on stimulated Brillouin and Raman power thresholds. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement and temperature resolution improvement provided by coding are also characterized. Experimental results confirm that, differently from Raman-based sensors, <b>pulse</b> <b>coding</b> affects the stimulated Brillouin threshold, resulting in lower optimal input power levels; these features allow one to achieve high sensing performance avoiding the use of high peak power pulses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} Brillouin optical-time domain {{analysis}} (BOTDA) sensor combining optimized optical <b>pulse</b> <b>coding</b> with return-to-zero (RZ) modulation format and first-order bi-directional Raman amplification, using a single, shared, high relative-intensity-noise (RIN) pump source. We show that coding provides great benefits in sensing performance, even when employing noisy high-RIN Raman fiber-lasers degrading single-pulse BOTDA-schemes. Combining <b>pulse</b> <b>coding</b> {{with the use of}} a single high-power source for Raman amplification allows us to achieve distributed sensing over 120 km SMF, achieving 2. 3 m spatial resolution with 52 με/ 2. 6 °C strain/temperature resolutions.
