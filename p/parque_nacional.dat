5|$|Conservation of cacti {{can be in}} situ or ex situ. In situ {{conservation}} involves preserving habits through {{enforcement of}} legal protection {{and the creation of}} specially protected areas such as national parks and reserves. Examples of such protected areas in the United States include Big Bend National Park, Texas; Joshua Tree National Park, California; and Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Latin American examples include <b>Parque</b> <b>Nacional</b> del Pinacate, Sonora, Mexico and Pan de Azúcar National Park, Chile. Ex situ conservation aims to preserve plants and seeds outside their natural habitats, often with the intention of later reintroduction. Botanical gardens {{play an important role in}} ex situ conservation; for example, seeds of cacti and other succulents are kept in long-term storage at the Desert Botanical Garden, Arizona.|$|E

25|$|<b>Parque</b> <b>Nacionál</b> Amboró {{is one of}} {{the most}} botanically rich {{national}} parks in the world. The current number of documented plant species totals around 3,000, though this is almost certainly an underestimate. By comparison, the much more thoroughly documented and very biologically rich Hawaiian Island archipelago, which covers about six times the total area of <b>Parque</b> <b>Nacional</b> Amboró, has only about 2,800 native plant species, while the British Isles (covering about 65 times the area of Amboró) have only around 2,000. Even the entire California Floristic Province, one of the world's botanical biodiversity hotspots, contains only 8,000 plant species—about 2.5 times as many as Amboró—though it covers an over 170 times larger. Much of the biodiversity of Amboró is partitioned according to the park's highly dissected topography and the widely varying climatic regimes that accompany the sharp transitions in elevation. Vegetational diversity is equally exceptional within the park, with lowland forests, montane forests, yungas and cloud forest, subpáramo, montane and non-montane scrublands, pampas, cactus forests, palm forests, forests composed almost entirely of treeferns, bromeliad-laden cliffs, epilithic subalpine plant communities, and others. The ecotones between these vegetation types are often sharply delineated according to aspect and elevation, yielding a highly heterogenous landscape that can make traveling in the park a dramatic and surprising experience.|$|E

40|$|The {{leatherback}} turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is an endangered species, and world-wide populations are declining. To understand better the mating structure of this pelagic and fragile species, we investigated paternity in nearly 1000 hatchlings from Playa Grande in <b>Parque</b> Marino <b>Nacional</b> Las Baulas, Costa Rica. We collected DNA samples from 36 adult female leatherbacks and assessed allele frequency distributions for three microsatellite loci. For 20 of these 36 females, we examined DNA from hatchlings representing multiple clutches, {{and in some}} cases assessed up to four successive clutches from the same female. We inferred paternal alleles by comparing maternal and hatchling genotypes. We could not reject the null hypothesis of single paternity in 12 of 20 families (31 of 50 clutches), but we did reject the null hypothesis in two families (eight of 50 clutches). In the remaining six families, the null hypothesis could not be accepted or rejected with certainty because the number of hatchlings exhibiting extra nonmaternal alleles was small, and could thus be a result of mutation or sample error. Successive clutches laid by the same female had the same paternal allelic contribution, indicating sperm storage or possibly monogamy. None of 20 females shared the same three-locus genotype whereas there were two instances of shared genotypes among 17 inferred paternal three-locus genotypes. We conclude that both polyandry and polygyny are part of the mating structure of this leatherback sea turtle population...|$|R
40|$|Hydrolytic {{activity}} was evaluated {{in a mixture}} of supernatants produced by filamentous fungi grown individually on microcrystalline cellulose and empty fruit bunches. The strains that were used correspond to two types of isolates; the first was made from soil samples from a transect of a high andean forest of Colombia, in the <b>Parque</b> Natural <b>Nacional</b> de Los Nevados, where, based on previous studies, we selected the strains B 7, B 11, B 11 M and B 19. The second isolate was obtained from a pool of oil palm empty fruit bunches (Eleaeis guinensis Jacq.) in different states of decomposition on the Unipalma plantation located in the eastern plains; strains TA 1 and TA 2. To perform the hydrolysis of cellulose and empty fruit bunches, the previously obtained supernatants from each of the selected strains were cultivated for 300 hours in cellulose and characterized individually by endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and β-glucosidase activity. Individual supernatants were mixed at a 1 : 1 ratio to form consortia; and hydrolytic {{activity was}} evaluated in the substrates at two hours. The glucose concentration was determined by the 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method. The results show that hydrolysis of empty fruit bunch to glucose was favored by three pools of supernatants, with increases greater than 400 % in comparison with the hydrolysis obtained by individual supernatants, demonstrating the potential to decompose palm empty fruit bunches; thereby contributing to the reduction of decay time of empty fruit bunches and the decrease of environmental and health problem...|$|R

40|$|Nas últimas décadas, a fonte eolielétrica é a que sinaliza maior crescimento mundial dentre as demais. A curva de aprendizagem tecnológica do setor mostra queda do custo entre 15 % a 20 % a cada 3 anos. Países ativos no setor eólico se esforçam pela meta de 12 % de participação na produção elétrica mundial em 2020. A contribuição da geração eolielétrica {{offshore}} é fundamental para essa meta, pela proximidade aos centros de carga, com ganhos de eficiência, de escala e reduzido impacto ambiental e visual. Apesar do crescimento do <b>parque</b> gerador <b>nacional</b> em 2006, há carência na produção no curto prazo. Contraditoriamente, há ventos abundantes para geração eolielétrica e o prévio arcabouço industrial que seria necessário para desenvolver o setor. Apesar do incentivo governamental (PROINFA), o setor eólico brasileiro ainda não decolou como esperado. O objetivo deste trabalho é reforçar o debate sobre a importância da diversificação da matriz, em prol da estratégia de segurança do suprimento energético nacional e da redução da emissão de gases de efeito estufa. Em rumo a esse objetivo, são colocados argumentos com abordagem ampla e com abordagem específica. Na abordagem ampla, esta pesquisa propõe uma maior inserção da fonte eólica na matriz elétrica nacional como uma das opções a serem consideradas de maneira mais relevante nas táticas de diversificação da matriz, a exemplo do que já fazem países com maior abundância de gás natural que o Brasil, como o Reino Unido. Sob um ponto de vista específico, a investigação exemplifica possibilidades de contribuição da fonte eolielétrica, na sua versão offshore, para as táticas de diversificação da matriz nacional que se entendem importantes, a exemplo do já fazem países com maior predominância da fonte hidráulica que o Brasil, como a Noruega. O método utilizado para se alcançar o objetivo desta dissertação envolve os seguintes passos: (1) esclarecer quanto aos principais aspectos do setor energético a nível mundial e o problema ambiental que está vinculado à produção de energia por fontes fósseis; (2) esclarecer quanto aos aspectos do desenvolvimento de sistemas eolielétricos onshore no Brasil e no mundo e também do desenvolvimento de sistemas offshore em países de interesse; (3) explorar exemplos de articulação dos sistemas eólicos offshore com projetos de produção de energia fóssil em ambiente marítimo, como forma de produzir sinergia útil a ambos os setores; (4) analisar e debater sobre as propostas do governo brasileiro para o futuro da matriz elétrica do país; (5) propor algumas possibilidades de desenvolvimento de sistemas eólicos offshore no Brasil, partindo de pequenos projetos-piloto. Caso as propostas deste trabalho se tornem realizadas, os resultados para este país líder em energia limpa e renovável seriam: a criação de valor nas operações offshore de produção de energia fóssil, o ganho de aprendizagem sobre a tecnologia eólica, o alívio parcial da oferta energética para centros litorâneos no curto prazo; a racionalização do uso, transporte e dependência externa do gás natural; a dinamização dos Mecanismos de Desenvolvimento Limpo (CDM / MDL) e de novos mercados e empregos para a indústria. In {{the last}} decade wind power source was the fastest-growing energy source. Technological learning curves for this sector fall down by a 15 % a 20 % rate each 3 years. Countries which are committed with wind power are running after the target of 12 % wind into the worlds electrical production by 2020. The contribution of the offshore wind power (OWP) source is fundamental on covering such target, due to the proximity to load centers, efficiency & scale savings and reduced environmental and visual impact. Although {{the growth of the}} Brazilian power generation system in 2006, there is a gap on fulfilling demand in the short run. Nevertheless, Brazil has abundance of winds suitable for power generation, as a previous industrial framework, necessary on developing this sector. Even that a governmental program has come (PROINFA), wind power sector has not risen as expected yet. The goal of this thesis is to reinforce the debate about the importance on diversifying the Brazilian power matrix, towards the strategy of energy security supply as the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. On reaching such a goal, this thesis states arguments by a generic approach and also by a specific approach. In the generic approach, it proposes a larger share for wind into the Brazilian electrical matrix as one of the options that should be considered in a more relevant manner for the tactics of diversifying the electrical matrix, following the example given by countries with larger abundance than Brazil regarding on natural gas production, as it is the case of the United Kingdom. In the specific approach, this investigation exemplifies possibilities of contributions from the OWP for the tactics of diversifying the matrix, following the example given by a country with higher predominance than Brazil regarding on using large hydropower as the main national power source, which is the case of Norway. The method taken for reaching the thesis goal involves the following steps: (1) to clarify on some aspects regarding energy production and its respective environmental problem related to the greenhouse gases emissions;(2) to clarify some aspects about the development of wind energy systems in Brazil and in the world and also some aspects about the development of OWP projects in selected countries; (3) to explore examples of articulation between OWP systems with offshore fossil energy production systems, in order to argue about the synergy that is possible between them; (4) to analyze and debate about the Brazilian governments proposal for the electrical matrix in the long run; (5) to propose some possibilities of developing OWP systems in Brazil, starting by small-scale pilot projects. If the case the propositions of this thesis come true in the future, the earnings for this country, which a world leader in clean & renewable energy, would be the following: value creation into the offshore fossil energy production; growth of learning about the OWP technologies; the partial relief of power supply for the coastal load centers; rationalization on the use, transport and foreign dependence of natural gas resources; pushing dynamics for Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM), as for industrial markets and employment...|$|R
