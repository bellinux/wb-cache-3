30|$|However, on {{the other}} hand, {{measurement}} of roll error motion requires a long precision mirror, which has the same length as the stroke of the slide. Furthermore, when the stroke of the slide table becomes longer, a disturbance of refractive index in the long optical path influences measurement results. Therefore, {{it is difficult for}} a laser autocollimator to carry out measurement of the roll error motion of a linear slide having a long stroke. Meanwhile, a clinometer is another candidate for measurement of the roll error motion. There are three major types of clinometers; the mechanical pendulum-based type [22, 23], the accelerometer-based type [24], and the fluid-based type [25, 26]. The mechanical pendulum-based clinometers and the accelerometer-based clinometers have advantages of high resolution, large measurement range and small size. Some of those mechanical gravity-based clinometers are designed in a compact size of smaller than 75  mm[*]×[*] 40  mm[*]×[*] 45  mm, while achieving high resolution up to 0.1 arc-second with a good stability [27]. However, they are not suitable for measurement in the manufacturing process of the linear slides since these pendulum-based clinometers have the disadvantages of high cost, and heavy weight owing to its complex mechanism. Meanwhile, {{on the other}} hand, the fluid-type clinometers, which detect the direction of the gravity with a liquid surface [28], has the advantages of low cost, small size, and light weight compared with other <b>types</b> of <b>clinometers.</b> In addition, fluid-based <b>type</b> <b>clinometers</b> are robust against external vibration because of its non-mechanical structure. Therefore, the fluid-based <b>type</b> <b>clinometers</b> are suitable to be applied for the manufacturing process of the linear slides. Differing from the autocollimators, the fluid-based <b>type</b> <b>clinometer</b> does not require a mirror reflector because its angle reference is the level of liquid enclosed inside of the sensor body [27, 28]. By utilizing the feature of the clinometer, a setup for measurement of the roll error motion of the slide table in a long-stroke linear slide can therefore be established in a compact size; this is a great advantage from the viewpoint of the production line of the linear slides.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{measurement}} method {{for evaluation of}} the roll error motion of a precision linear slide by using a high resolution fluid-based <b>type</b> <b>clinometer</b> in the production process of the stage system. The clinometer used in this research is developed based on a commercially-available fluid <b>type</b> <b>clinometer</b> [29], which detects the surface level of the liquid enclosed inside of the sensor body. Since the clinometer detects the absolute angle {{with respect to the}} direction of gravitational vector, clinometer detects not only the roll error motion of a slide table but also external inclination such as tilt angle of a vibration isolation table where the linear slide is mounted. In order to remove the influence of the external inclinations, in this paper, another clinometer is directly mounted on the vibration isolation table. By taking a differential output signal of the two clinometers, the roll error motion of the slide table can be evaluated, while eliminating the influence of the external disturbances mainly from the vibration isolation table. An experimental setup employing the pair of clinometers is developed, and experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.|$|R
40|$|In an {{embedded}} system, it {{is common}} to have several memory areas with different properties, such as access time and size. An access to a specific memory area is usually restricted to certain native <b>pointer</b> <b>types.</b> Different <b>pointer</b> <b>types</b> vary in size and cost. For example, it is typically cheaper to use an 8 -bit pointer than a 16 -bit pointer. The problem is to allocate data and select <b>pointer</b> <b>types</b> in the most effective way. Frequently accessed variables should be allocated in fast memory, and frequently used pointers and pointer expressions should be assigned cheap <b>pointer</b> <b>types.</b> Common practice is to perform this task manually. We present a model for storage allocation that is capable of describing architectures with irregular memory organization and with several native <b>pointer</b> <b>types.</b> This model is used in an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem. An ILP solver is applied to get an optimal solution under the model. We describe allocation of global variables and local variables with static storage duration. A whole program optimizing C compiler prototype was used to implement the allocator. Experiments were performed on the Atmel AVR 8 -bit microcontroller [2] using small to medium sized C programs. The results varied with the benchmarks, with up to 8 % improvement in execution speed and 10 % reduction in code size. 1...|$|R

5000|$|In addition, C, like Ada, {{provides}} unspecified or undefined explicit conversions; {{and unlike}} in Ada, idioms that use these conversions are very common, and {{have helped to}} give C a type-unsafe reputation. For example, the standard way to allocate memory on the heap is to invoke a memory allocation function, such as , with an argument indicating how many bytes are required. The function returns an untyped <b>pointer</b> (<b>type</b> [...] ), which the calling code must explicitly or implicitly cast to the appropriate <b>pointer</b> <b>type.</b> Pre-standardized implementations of C required an explicit cast to do so, therefore the code [...] became the accepted practice. However, this practice is discouraged in ISO C as it can mask a failure to include the header file in which [...] is defined, resulting in downstream errors on machines where the int and <b>pointer</b> <b>types</b> are of different sizes, such as most common implementations of C for the now-ubiquitous x86 64 architecture. A conflict arises in code that is required to compile as C++, since the cast is necessary in that language.|$|R
5000|$|However, in some {{commercial}} and open source Pascal (or derivatives) compiler implementations —like Free Pascal, Turbo Pascal or the Object Pascal in Embarcadero Delphi— a pointer {{is allowed to}} reference standard static or local variables and can be cast from one <b>pointer</b> <b>type</b> to another. Moreover, pointer arithmetic is unrestricted: adding or subtracting from a pointer moves it by that number of bytes in either direction, but using the [...] or [...] standard procedures with it moves the pointer {{by the size of}} the data type it is declared to point to.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} type {{system for a}} {{programming}} language with memory allocation/deallocation primitives, which prevents memory-related errors such as double-frees and memory leaks.

By assigning an ownership to each <b>pointer</b> <b>type</b> constructor (rather than to a variable), our type system can properly reason about list/tree-manipulating programs. Furthermore, thanks {{to the use of}} fractions as ownerships, the type system admits a polynomial-time type inference algorithm, which serves as an algorithm for automatic verification of lack of memoryrelated errors. A prototype verifier has been implemented and tested for C programs. ...|$|R
50|$|The pointer {{is still}} one of the most popular types of {{references}} today. It is similar to the assembly representation of a raw address, except that it carries a static datatype which can be used at compile-time to ensure that the data it refers to is not misinterpreted.

Its successor C++ tried to increase <b>type</b> safety of <b>pointers</b> with new cast operators and smart pointers in its standard library, but still retained the ability to circumvent these safety mechanisms for compatibility.|$|R
5000|$|Casting {{can help}} the {{developer}} identify inconsistencies in type sizing should the destination <b>pointer</b> <b>type</b> change, particularly if the pointer is declared far from the [...] call (although modern compilers and static analysers can warn on such behaviour without requiring the cast).|$|R

A program can probably convert a <b>pointer</b> to any <b>type</b> of data (except a function pointer) to a pointer to void and back to the original type without losing information, which makes these pointers useful for polymorphic functions.
