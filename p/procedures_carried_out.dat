40|$|Introduction. Circumcision is {{a common}} <b>procedure</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> around the world. Due to {{religious}} reasons, it is routinely done in Bangladesh, by both traditional as well as medically trained circumcisers. Complications include excessive bleeding, loss of foreskin, infection, and injury to the glans penis. Myiasis complicating male circumcision appears to be very rare. Case Presentation. In 2010, a 10 -year-old boy presented to the OPD of Dhaka Medical College Hospital with severe pain in his penile region following circumcision 7 -days after. The <b>procedure</b> was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by a traditional circumciser using unsterilized instruments and dressing material. After examination, unhealthy granulation tissue was seen and maggots started coming out {{from the site of}} infestation, indicating presence of more maggots underneath the skin. An emergency operation was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> to remove the maggots and reconstruction was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> at the plastic surgery department. Conclusion. There is scarcity of literature regarding complications following circumcision in developing countries. Most dangerous complications are a result of <b>procedure</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by traditional circumcisers who are inadequately trained. Incidence of such complications can be prevented by establishing a link between the formal and informal sections of healthcare to improve the safety of the procedure...|$|R
