The common guavas are rank and harsh, but the 'strawberry guava,' as it is locally called, has a delicate, subacid flavour not easily equalled. The aguacáte, or alligator-pear (Persea gratissima), which was not 'introduced by the Basel missionaries from the West Indies,' is inferior to the Mexican. Connoisseurs compare its nutty flavour with that of the filbert, and eat it with pepper, salt, and the sauce of Worcester, whose fortune was made by the nice conduct of garlic. The papaw [Footnote: The leaves are rubbed on meat to make it tender, and a drop of milk from the young fruit acts as a vermifuge.] should be cooked as a vegetable and stuffed with forced meat; the flesh of the granadilla, which resembles it, is neglected, while the seeds and their surroundings are flavoured with sherry and sugar. There is an abundance of the Eriobotrya Japonica, in Madeira called the loquat and elsewhere the Japanese medlar: it grows wild in the Brazil, where the people distil from it. [Footnote: I cannot yet decide whether its birthplace is Japan or South America, whose plants have now invaded Western India and greatly altered the vegetation.] ...|$|E
60|$|In fact, I {{think there}} can be but {{little doubt that the}} banana is the very oldest product of human tillage. Man, we must remember, is {{essentially}} by origin a tropical animal, and wild tropical fruits must necessarily have formed his earliest food-stuffs. It was among them of course that his first experiments in primitive agriculture would be tried; the little insignificant seeds and berries of cold northern regions would only very slowly be added to his limited stock in husbandry, as circumstances pushed some few outlying colonies northward and ever northward toward the chillier unoccupied regions. Now, of all tropical fruits, the banana is certainly the one that best repays cultivation. It has been calculated that the same area which will produce thirty-three pounds of wheat or ninety-nine pounds of potatoes will produce 4,400 pounds of plantains or bananas. The cultivation of the various varieties in India, China, and the Malay Archipelago dates, says De Candolle, 'from an epoch impossible to realise.' Its diffusion, as that great but very oracular authority remarks, may go back to a period 'contemporary with or even anterior to that of the human races.' What this remarkably illogical sentence may mean I am at a loss to comprehend; perhaps M. de Candolle supposes that the banana was originally cultivated by pre-human gorillas; perhaps he merely intends to say that before men began to separate they sent special messengers on in front of them to diffuse the banana in the different countries they were about to visit. Even legend retains some trace of the extreme antiquity of the species as a cultivated fruit, for Adam and Eve are said to have reclined under the shadow of its branches, whence Linnæus gave to the sort known as the plantain the Latin name of Musa <b>paradisiaca.</b> If a plant was cultivated in Eden by the grand old gardener and his wife, as Lord Tennyson democratically styled them (before his elevation to the peerage), we may fairly conclude that it possesses a very respectable antiquity indeed.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the ameliorating potentials of cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta (C. esculenta) L.) and unripe plantain (Musa <b>paradisiacae</b> (M. <b>paradisiacae)</b> L.) incorporated feeds on renal and liver growth of STZ induced rats. Methods: The {{blood glucose level}} of all the rats was measured with a glucometer, the protein and glucose levels in the urine samples of the rats were determined using urine assay strips while the specific gravity of the urine samples of all the rats was determined with a urinometer. The assay of the proximate, phytochemical, mineral composition as well as screening for antioxidant activity of the test feeds was carried out using standard techniques. Results: The administration of the test feeds to the diabetic rats in 58. 75 % and 38. 13 % decreases in their hyperglycemia with a corresponding amelioration of their elevated urinary protein, glucose, specific gravity as well as renal and kidney growths. Administration of the cocoyam incorporated feeds to the diabetic rats of group 4, resulted in 2. 71 % increase in body weight with a corresponding 19. 52 % increase in growth rate unlike the diabetic rats of group 5, administered unripe plantain feed that had 5. 12 % decrease in weight with a corresponding 29. 52 % decrease in growth rate but higher than the diabetic control rats that recorded 28. 69 % and 29. 46 % decreases in body weights with a corresponding 248. 9 % and 250. 14 % decreases in growth rates. Analysis revealed that the test feeds contained low quantities of moisture but significant quantities of crude fibre, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, ash, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc, phosphorous as well as considerable amount of energy. In addition, the cocoyam incorporated feeds contained higher quantities of flavonoids, saponin, tannin, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, K, P, crude fibre as well as antioxidant activity but lower quantities of alkaloids than the unripe plantain feed. Conclusions: The use of cocoyam and unripe plantain flours in the dietary management of diabetes mellitus could be a breakthrough {{in the search for}} plants that could prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy...|$|R

Nelas, visualizamos as tradições, o cotidiano de homens que trabalhavam no mar ou na terra, a religiosidade do povo, a história e a paisagem, sobretudo a do norte do país, possibilitando a reconstrução poética de parte do Portugal de Oitocentos. Essa reconstrução poética, obviamente, foi determinada pela memória do sujeito poético, que ora apresenta imagens da criança doce e querida por amas, envolvido numa atmosfera de contos de fadas ou de visões <b>paradisíacas</b> do mundo que o cercava, ora dá a conhecer situações que envolvem o adulto angustiado diante das perdas inevitáveis da vida. Em ambos os casos, avultam (ou sobressaem) evocações impressionistas por meio de recursos sensoriais que sugerem o estado de alma de um ser que valorizou o que é ser português. A análise dos poemas pretende demonstrar como António Nobre constrói e desenvolve poeticamente as imagens da memória e o que delas decorre, ou seja, como trabalha com as evocações, enumerações descritivas, hipotiposes, etc., de modo a constituir a imagem de um sujeito poético apegado à sua terra natal e a imagem da própria terra, representada por aquilo que julga mais típico dela.

50|$|The {{classification}} of cultivated bananas {{has long been}} a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: Musa sapientum for dessert bananas and Musa <b>paradisiaca</b> for plantains.

However, this approach proved inadequate to address the sheer number of cultivars existing in the primary center of diversity of the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names which proved to be synonyms.|$|E

Home gardens that have incorporated plantains tend to exhibit less plant diversity and lower density, and some Cabécar farmers have abandoned traditional indigenous agroecosystems in favor of larger plantain monoculture plots.|$|E
50|$|All modern {{plantain}} cultivars {{have three}} sets of chromosomes (i.e. they are triploid). Many are hybrids derived from the cross of two wild species, Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.

5000|$|The Gānjiāo (甘蕉, lit. [...] "sweet banana/plantain") [...] "banana, Musa <b>paradisiaca,</b> Musa sapientum" [...] entry distinguishes {{two kinds}} of dessert-banana plants and one fiber-banana plant.The Kan-chiao, seen from afar, resembles a tree. The larger plants are over one armspan in circumference. The leaves are ten feet long, or {{sometimes}} seven to eight feet and over one to almost two feet broad. The flowers are {{as big as a}} wine cup, with the shape and color of a lotus. Over one hundred pods are attached together {{at the end of the}} stem, called a fang (房, spathe). They are sweet and palatable and can also be preserved in honey. The roots resemble taro, the largest as big as a carriage wheel. Fruiting follows flowering, and the flowers, which have a cluster of six pods each, develop successively. The pods are not formed simultaneously and the flowers do not drop at the same time. It is also called Pa-chiao 芭蕉 or Pa-chü 巴苴. Removing the peel of the pod, the yellowish-white interior with a taste like the grape appears, sweet and soft. It satisfies hunger also. There are three kinds. The kind with pods the size of a thumb, long and pointed, resembling a sheep's horn in shape, is called Yang-chiao-chiao 羊角蕉 (sheep's horn banana), and is the sweetest and most delicious in taste. Another kind with pods the size of a hen's egg and resembling a cow's udder is called Niu-ju-chiao 牛乳蕉 (cow's udder banana), and is slightly inferior to Yang-chiao-chiao. A third kind is the size of a lotus rootstock; the pods are six to seven inches in length, squarish in shape, not sweet, and considered the most inferior. The stem is separable into fibers, and when treated with lime, can be woven into thin cloth, called Chiao-ko 蕉葛 (banana linen). Although the cloth is soft and good and yellowish-white in color, it is not comparable to the reddish linen. The plant grows in both Chiao and Kuang. According to the San-fu huang-t'u 三輔黃圖, [...] "Wu Ti of Han, in the sixth year of the Yüan-ting period (111 B.C.), conquered Nan-yüeh and built the Fu-Ii Palace to plant the rare plants and strange trees obtained. There are two plants Kan-chiao." [...] (1, tr. Li 1979: 32-33) This detailed description is of great interest for botanists (Needham and Kuhn 1988: 49), but closer observation would have shown that the six fruits in a half-spiral did not come from one ovary (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 453). Since banana plants are all sterile hybrid cultigens, species differentiation is problematic. Musa × <b>paradisiaca</b> includes the previously differentiated M. <b>paradisiaca</b> [...] "cooking/fiber banana; plantain" [...] and M. sapientum [...] " [...] dessert banana". Judging from the Nanfang caomu zhuang account, the two yángjiǎojiāo (羊角蕉 [...] "ram's horn banana") and niúrǔjiāo (牛乳蕉 [...] "cow's milk banana") were of the edible sapientum type, and the unnamed third was of the fibrous <b>paradisiaca</b> type. Xiāngjiāo (香蕉 [...] "fragrant banana") is the common name in Modern Standard Chinese usage.|$|E

50|$|In {{a series}} of papers {{published}} from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus Musa sapientum and Musa <b>paradisiaca</b> were actually cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, both first described by Luigi Aloysius Colla. He recommended the abolition of Linnaeuss species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars - those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of Musa balbisiana, those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of Musa acuminata, and those with characteristics that are {{the combination of the}} two. Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities today, leading to confusion.|$|E
50|$|The banana is an {{edible fruit}} - botanically a berry - {{produced}} by {{several kinds of}} large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains, in contrast to dessert bananas.

The fruits grow in clusters hanging {{from the top of}} the plant. Almost all modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species - Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × <b>paradisiaca</b> for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution.
