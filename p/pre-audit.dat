40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} a firm’s demand for different quality auditors and opportunities for earnings management. In our model, the firm simultaneously chooses the bias it introduces into its <b>pre-audited</b> earnings and the quality of its auditor. We show that firms that choose a highlevel of bias also choose a low-quality auditor, even though the market-maker makes a correction for the level of residual bias in audited reports. Firms that choose a low level of bias choose a high-quality auditor. We also study the effect of changes in the regulatory environment on the market equilibrium. Our analysis shows that stricter regulation leads to more firms choosing low-quality auditors, thus it is not in the interest of high quality auditors to support such measures. </p...|$|R
40|$|Technology is {{advancing}} {{in almost}} all aspects of our everyday life. One interesting aspect is the possibility to conduct elections over the Internet. However, many proposed Internet voting schemes and systems build on unrealistic assumptions about the trustworthiness of the voting environment and other voter-side assumptions. Code voting – first introduced by Chaum [Cha 01] – is one approach that minimizes the voter-side assumptions. The voting scheme Pretty Understandable Democracy [BNOV 13] builds {{on the idea of}} code voting while it ensures on the server-side an arguably practical security model based on a strict separation of duty, i. e. all security requirements are ensured if any two components do not collaborate in order to violate the corresponding requirement. As code voting and strict separation of duty realizations come along with some challenges (e. g. <b>pre-auditing</b> phase, usability issues, clear APIs), the goal of our research was to implement Pretty Understandable Democracy and run a trial election. This paper reports on necessary refinements of the original scheme, the implementation, and a trial election among the different development teams. ...|$|R

30|$|Since the 16 th CPC National Congress, the {{supervision}} of public finances has been made more scientific and meticulous, and financial operations more standardized. First, placing township finances under {{the supervision}} of county governments has enabled refinements to workflow and ensuring basic grassroots units’ management. Second, governments have continuously standardized budget management, established budget compilation workflow mechanisms, and constantly improved dynamic budgets. The central budget stabilization fund was established in 2006, subject to the oversight of the NPC, to make public finances more transparent and make the oversight of public finances more scientific. In 2007, reforms to state-owned capital operations budgets were implemented to promote the reform of state-owned enterprises and the development and standardization of the dual budget system. Reforms to the classification of government revenue and expenditures were also deepened in 2007, and government revenue classifications were unified. A new functional classification system for government expenditures and a new economic classification system for expenditures were established to reflect various concrete government revenue items and the contents and recipients of expenditures. This was done to change the situation in which outsiders cannot evaluate government finances, and to create favorable conditions to improve transparency and strengthen budget oversight. Third, financial supervision mechanisms have been gradually improved. In addition to maintaining the dual system of <b>pre-auditing,</b> continuous monitoring, and post-examination, governments have made efforts to increase supervision, strictly investigate and prosecute financial crimes and preliminarily establish financial supervision mechanisms to implement monitoring, comprehensive inspection, rectification and feedback, and tracking performance. Fourth, the construction of financial management information systems has been steadily advanced. The budget management system, the centralized treasury payment management information system and other e-business systems have been successfully developed and put into use. Databases for budget compilation, centralized payment, asset management and wage payment of administrative institutions have been established. Financial oversight has been improved continuously. Fifth, the performance appraisal of budget management has been actively promoted. Objective-based performance management, third-party assessment, full performance supervision, performance budget of key projects, and others have been developed to improve the comprehensive benefits of public funds. Sixth, efforts have been made to make government budgets and final accounts more open and budgetary work more transparent. First of all, more detailed departmental budgets and final accounts will be made available to the public. Information regarding government agencies’ spending on official overseas trips, official vehicles, and official hospitality will be released to the public online, subject to {{the supervision of}} the entire populace. There will be more openness of budget information at and below the provincial level, as per central-level directives. Seventh, international exchanges and cooperation and strategic dialog and policy coordination have all been strengthened at the center. Efforts have been made to promote real regional cooperation and the economic integration of China with its neighboring countries through the ASEAN[*]+[*] 3 (China, Japan, and Korea) Meeting, the Greater Mekong Sub-regional (GMS) economic cooperation, and other mechanisms. This was done to strengthen China’s international position in financial and monetary issues. This has been accomplished by actively using informal dialogs with Western finance ministers and central bank governors, the Group of Four Finance Ministers’ Meeting, and other multilateral mechanisms and participating in the formulation and coordination of international economic rules through strengthening cooperation with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and other international financial organizations.|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the relationships among}} audit fees and discretionary accruals for non-profit public housing authorities (PHAs).

We find results consistent with prior literature indicating there is economic bonding between auditor and client; auditors constrain the magnitude of discretionary accruals less when they are paid more. We also find results consistent with prior literature indicating auditors provide more services and/or higher quality services with larger magnitude discretionary accruals and higher income-increasing discretionary accruals. These results are true whether you use post-audit or <b>pre-audit</b> data. However, we find in some instances, specifically when testing economic bonding with income-increasing and income-decreasing accruals separately, that the use of post-audit discretionary accruals as the dependent variable (used in prior literature) provides different results than when the more appropriate change in discretionary accruals from pre- to post-audit is used...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Many {{countries}} have noted {{a substantial increase}} in the cesarean section rate (CSR). Several methods for lowering the CSR have been described. Understanding the impact of clinical audits on the CSR may aid in lowering CSR. Thus, our aim is to elucidate the effect of clinical audits on the CSR. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 3781 pregnant women who gave birth in a medical center between January 2008 and January 2011. Pregnant women who delivered between January 2008 and July 2009 were enrolled as the <b>pre-audit</b> group (n = 1592). After August 2009, all cesarean section cases that were audited were enrolled in the audit group (n = 2189). The CSR was compared between groups. Results: The overall CSR (34. 5 % vs. 31. 1 %, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0. 83, p = 0. 008) and the cesarean section rate due to dystocia (9. 6 % vs. 6. 2 %, p < 0. 001) were significantly lower in the audit group than the <b>pre-audit</b> group. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in the rate of operative vaginal delivery between groups. Consensus on the unnecessity for cesarean section was achieved in 16 (8. 2 %) of 195 audit cases in the monthly audit conference. In nulliparous pregnant women (n = 2148), multivariate analysis revealed that clinical audit (OR = 0. 78), maternal age (OR = 1. 10), gestational age at delivery (OR = 0. 80), and fetal body weight at birth (OR = 1. 0005) were independent predictors of cesarean section (all p < 0. 05). Most variables of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality did not differ before and after audits were implemented. Conclusion: Clinical audits appear to be an effective strategy for reducing the CSR. Therefore, we recommend strict monitoring of the indications in dystocia for cesarean section to reduce the CSR...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we argue}} that an {{increased}} economic bonding may develop between an audit partner and the clients when the auditor switches to a new audit firm because the auditor’s incremental payoff expected from switching to the new firm (e. g., promotion, larger share of firm profits, more perks, and more authority and peer respect) is often enhanced {{by the number of}} clients he can bring to the new firm. The auditor and the client can use audit quality as a bargaining tool to divide the incremental payoff generated from the joint auditor-client switch. We thus hypothesize that the turnover audit partners treat follower clients more favorably (by making less downward audit adjustments to <b>pre-audit</b> earnings or allowing greater discretionary accruals) than they treat other clients around the joint auditor-client switches. Using the data in China where engagement-specific audit partner information is available, we find evidence that supports our hypothesis under the condition that both of the signing auditors for the follower client switch to the same successor firm (or come from the same predecessor firm). Our partner-level evidence is consistent with the widespread concern that audit quality is lower when there is a greater level of auditor-client economic bonding. postprintAnnual Meeting of the American Accounting Association (AAA) and Conference on Teaching and Learning in Accounting, New York, N.

The aim of this work is to study the {{possibility}} of integration of a reversible heat pumping system into the existing HVAC system of a “commercial” building (which includes laboratories). A <b>pre-audit</b> of the actual HVAC installation {{is carried out}} and presented. Numerical models of the building and of the coupled HVAC installation are developed and implemented on EES (Engineering Equation Solver, ©F-Chart Software) to run yearly simulations. The main retrofit opportunity is the use of reversible heat pumping, with the extracted air as heat source, to heat the building. Other retrofit possibilities, as “change over” technique or cool thermal energy storage, are also modelled, simulated and analysed. The environmental and economical aspects of each retrofit opportunity are approached. The reversible heat pumping coupled with a change over technique is generally able to satisfy the heating demand of the building. However some interventions of the existing natural gas condensing boilers, as back boosting devices, are sometimes necessary during winter. The economical and environmental studies reveal a quite short payback time and a significant reduction of CO 2 emissions.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{enterprise model}} representing key facets {{of an organization}} {{can be an effective}} tool to consider when planning an enterprise information architecture. For example, a specific organization's quality management business processes and organizational structures can be represented using such a model, and then compared to a reference model of &quot;good&quot; processes and structures, such as the ISO 9000 standards. The specific and reference models can be represented using common entities, attributes, and relationships— comprising general schema or data model—which are then formally defined and constrained. These definitions and constraints can be used as inference rules applied to the models. Hence identification of differences between the models as quality problems can be automatically inferred, as can the analysis and correction of problems. In this paper, the TOVE ISO 9000 Micro-Theory is presented as a formal reference model of quality goodness. ISO 9000 requirements represented as inference rules in the microtheory are applied to facts about an organization's quality management processes and structures, and conformance or nonconformance to requirements is automatically inferred. TOVE Ontologies for Quality Modeling are the common data and logical (formal definitions and constraints) models of the reference and specific organization's models. The example use of the microtheory demonstrates enterprise model use for a <b>pre-audit,</b> which lowers the cost and time for improving quality through achieving ISO 9000 compliance.

40|$|Ninety {{five percent}} of the {{construction}} and demolition waste is recycled in the Netherlands. Most of it is used for low value applications such as road base materials; the use of secondary material in buildings is still less than 3 % 7. In order to recover waste for higher value applications, enhancing selective demolition and waste management practices is of crucial importance. In this study Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing of a demolition project in Almere was carried out to identify the environmental and financial hotspots in the selective demolition and waste management in the Dutch context. Results suggest that (1) the best practice selective demolition and (2) the substitution of virgin concrete aggregate with secondary aggregate processed by Advanced Dry Recovery (ADR) system, will lead to environmental and financial improvements compared to the business as usual practice. On the building level, the advantage is mainly due to connecting the demolition and the re-development projects, which maximizes local reuse of old building components in the new building. The key of success for selective demolition is <b>pre-audit</b> to identify and connect to the market for material reuse. This is a direction that BIM (building information modeling) technology can contribute.

A nine years (June 1995 –June 2004) internal clinical audit of urological management of SCI patients was compared with a similar audit conducted five years later (January 2008 –June 2010). Comparisons were made using chi-square test. A p-value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsA total of 146 patients were compared (89 -pre-audit, 57 -post-audit). The quality of documentation of examination findings worsened over the two study periods (p =  0. 002). Although determination of baseline serum creatinine improved to statistically significant levels (p =  0. 019), no imaging for the kidneys was performed as baseline in the post-audit period (p =  0. 000). Similarly the number of urodynamic studies performed decreased from 11 % to 1. 75 % (p =  0. 045). The number of urological consultations, however, increased from 26 % to 31. 58 % (p =  0. 452). During follow-up, only 17 (19. 1 %) patients in the <b>pre-audit</b> study period and 6 (10. 5 %) in the post-audit study period were voiding spontaneously. ConclusionOur study of two eras clearly demonstrated a worsening trend in quality of patient management, which can be corrected by agreeing upon and implementing standard guidelines for management of SCI patients...|$|E
