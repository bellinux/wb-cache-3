40|$|Reading action verbs is {{associated}} with activity in the motor cortices involved in performing the corresponding actions. Here, we present new evidence that the motor cortex is involved in semantic processing of bodily action verbs. In contrast to previous studies, we used a direct, nonbehavioural index of semantic processing after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Participants saw pairs of hand-related (e. g. to grab-to point) or mouth-related (e. g. to speak-to sing) verbs, whereas semantic priming was assessed using event-related <b>potentials.</b> <b>Presentation</b> <b>of</b> the first verb coincided with rTMS over the participant's cortical-left hand area and event-related brain potentials were analysed time-locked to the <b>presentation</b> onset <b>of</b> the second verb. Semantic integration - indexed by the N 400 brain potential - was impaired for hand-related but not for mouth-related verb pairs after rTMS.

All patients were examined by pediatric endocrinologist and their goiters were classified according to WHO criteria. Total T 4, TSH, T 3 and T 3 RU were measured. Out of the 384 cases that were diagnosed as goiter, 320 were euthyroid (83. 4 %), 49 were hypothyroid (12. 7 %) and 15 were hyperthyroid (3. 9 %). Ninety-three percent of the hyperthyroid patients had graves’ disease and seven percent of them had toxic adenoma. The most common presenting feature in thyrotoxic patients was goiter.

30|$|While NEPL {{appears to}} be similar to EHL (they both use a probe with two {{electrodes}} at the distal end to which electric pulses are applied), their characteristics are fundamentally different. In contrast with EHL, which disintegrates stones by generating a shock wave in liquid, NEPL operates at much higher voltage and an ultrafast discharge time of less than 50  ns in direct contact with the stone. Urinary stones are usually non-conducting, but when the voltage across the stone becomes too great – i.e., if the electrostatic field becomes too intense – the stone will begin to spontaneously conduct current. Furthermore, under such high voltage and fast discharge, the dielectric resistance in the stone is below that of the liquid medium so that the electrical breakdown occurs through the stone and not through the liquid. This phenomenon was discovered in the 1960 s (Vorobyev et al. 1961). The conceptual basis for the electropulse method of material destruction is described in (Semkin et al. 1995;Shuloyakov et al. 1995) and is illustrated by experimental data showing its significant <b>potential.</b> <b>Presentation</b> <b>of</b> the physical basis of the electropulse method is given in (Semkin et al. 1995) where the physical principles of electrical breakdown of solid dielectrics are considered. The so-called dielectric breakdown through the stone leads to tensile thermomechanical stresses in the stone resulting in its fragmentation (Kurets et al. 2002).|$|R

In contrast {{to most of the}} other enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, a deficiency of ECI 1 has yet to be identified in humans. We used wild-type (WT) and Eci 1 -deficient knockout (KO) mice to explore a <b>potential</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> human ECI 1 deficiency. Upon food withdrawal, Eci 1 -deficient mice displayed normal blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (WT 1. 09 mM vs. KO 1. 10 mM), a trend to lower blood glucose levels (WT 4. 58 mM vs. KO 3. 87 mM, P= 0. 09) and elevated blood levels of unsaturated acylcarnitines, in particular C 12 : 1 acylcarnitine (WT 0. 03 mu M vs. KO 0. 09 mu M, P < 0. 01). Feeding an olive oil-rich diet induced an even greater increase in C 12 : 1 acylcarnitine levels (WT 0. 01 mu M vs. KO 0. 04 mu M, P < 0. 01). Overall, the phenotypic <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> Eci 1 -deficient mice is mild, possibly caused by the presence of a second enoyl-CoA isomerase (Eci 2) in mitochondria. Knockdown of Eci 2 in Eci 1 -deficient fibroblasts caused a more pronounced accumulation of C 12 : 1 acylcarnitine on incubation with unsaturated fatty acids (12 -fold, P < 0. 05). We conclude that Eci 2 compensates for Eci 1 deficiency explaining the mild phenotype of Eci 1 -deficient mice. Hypoglycemia and accumulation of C 12 : 1 acylcarnitine might be diagnostic markers to identify ECI 1 deficiency in humans. -van Weeghel, M., te Brinke, H., van Lenthe, H., Kulik, W., Minkler, P.

Dendritic cells(DC) are therefore used in cancer immunotherapy, in prevention of graft rejection, treatment of allergy, autoimmune diseases and certain infectious diseases. Methods: Dendritic cell was generated in two stages. IN the first stage, monocyte cells were converted to immature DC affected GM-CSF and IL- 4. In the second stage, dendritic cells were maturated {{in the presence of}} supernatant skin epithelial cells(A 375) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells(HUVEC) and maturation factors. The ability of phagocytosis, expression phenotype, stimulation of T lymphocytes and cytokines was studied. Results: Mature Dendritic cells decreased their power of phagocytosis and increased expression of their surface markers. The ability of T cells stimulation and cytokine production(IL- 12) increased. Conclusion: Mixture condition medium of epithelial cells and human skin umbilical vein endothelium cells induces maturation of monocyte-derived DCs.
