50|$|The Barry Engine first {{appeared}} in 1904 when it was exhibited at the Stanley Exhibition in London's Burners Hall. Designed by Charles Benjamin Redrup and manufactured in partnership with Alban Williams by the Barry Motor Company, the engine was a two-cylinder supercharged rotary engine. The prototype motorcycle retained the pedals of a conventional cycle and the engine rotated on the <b>pedal</b> <b>shaft</b> between the driver's knees. The driver was protected by a colander-type perforated cage which enabled cooling air to reach the cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|Sprockets {{are used}} in bicycles, motorcycles, cars, tracked vehicles, and other {{machinery}} either to transmit rotary motion between two shafts where gears are unsuitable or to impart linear motion to a track, tape etc. Perhaps {{the most common form}} of sprocket may be found in the bicycle, in which the <b>pedal</b> <b>shaft</b> carries a large sprocket-wheel, which drives a chain, which, in turn, drives a small sprocket on the axle of the rear wheel [...] Early automobiles were also largely driven by sprocket and chain mechanism, a practice largely copied from bicycles.|$|E
50|$|The Forensic {{team was}} led by Dr. Omer Masood Qureshi, Director of Automotive Design and safety lab at the Institute of space technology. The {{findings}} of this report studied {{the structure of the}} bus, suspension components, gauges, speedometers, brake <b>pedals,</b> gear <b>shafts,</b> under microscopic failure analysis techniques and determined that the bus did indeed overturn prior to the accident, However the suspension did not show any signs of pre collision damage prior to overturning. The leafs spring positions also did not indicate that the bus hit a road hump big enough to overturn the bus.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the EMG activity of selected lower limb muscles during cycling, and to define the relationship between <b>pedal</b> <b>shaft</b> width and muscular involvement. This study has particular significance to the female cyclist who by virtue of pelvic width may have a less efficient pedalling force, or an imbalance of applied muscular force. Variables analyzed were hip, knee, ankle range of motion (ROM), biceps femoris(BF), vastus lateralis(VL), rectus femoris(RF), and vastus medialis(VMO) muscle activity. Significant differences among three different <b>pedal</b> <b>shaft</b> widths were determined through use of repeated measures oneway ANOVA, Newman-Keuls post hoc test. The hip ROM, biceps femoris, and vastus medialis EKG activity results of the present study appeared to indicate that different <b>pedal</b> <b>shaft</b> widths had an effect on changes in the ROM and EMG activity. This study indicated that the hip ROM values increased with an increase in the <b>pedal</b> <b>shaft</b> width. In contary, an increase in <b>pedal</b> <b>shaft</b> width significantly decreased the muscle activity in the vastus medialis while two inch <b>pedal</b> <b>shaft</b> width significantly decreased the muscle activity in the biceps femoris.

40|$|A {{new model}} of {{power-assisted}} bicycle has been designed, set up and tested. The main innovative solutions for the pedelec prototype are {{described in the present}} paper: the electric motor position; the new mechanical transmission; the low cost measurement system of the driving torque; the special test rig. Differently from a common approach, in which the electric motor is located on one of the three hubs of the bicycle, the idea of the pedelec prototype consists of an electrical motor in the central position that, by means of a bevel gear, transmits the torque on the central hub. The other innovative solution is represented by the motion transmission from the motor to the <b>pedal</b> <b>shaft,</b> achieved by two different gearboxes: the first one is a planetary gearbox and the second one is a simple bevel gear. The pedelec prototype contains also a new low cost measurement system of the driving torque based on a strain gauge load cell located {{on one side of the}} rear wheel, between the hub and the frame. Moreover, a commercial cycling simulator has been suitably modified in order to properly install the different sensors for the measurement of the performance of the pedelec. The test rig is able to reproduce an aforethought route or paths acquired during road tests, to measure the performance of the e-bike in terms of instantaneous power and speed. The experimental test rig can simulate the resistant torque of a predetermined track and it aims to test and to optimize the control strategy available on the electronic control unit. The authors have also conducted an environmental analysis of the developed pedelec, in particular comparing the e-bike with a thermal moped, in terms of environmental impact...|$|E
