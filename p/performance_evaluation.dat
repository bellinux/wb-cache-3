The petitioner, Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha, {{mentioned}} that his performance was ignored by the committee. Girisha {{claimed to be a}} top contender for the award with 90 points, owing to his silver medal winning act at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the Men's High Jump F42 event. The petition mentioned that the points for Mirza's Grand Slam titles from 2011 until 2015 should not be counted as the events were {{not a part of the}} list of sports events to be considered for the <b>performance</b> <b>evaluation.</b> The court withheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry about the selection process. The Ministry nevertheless presented the award to Mirza on 29 August 2015 amidst the case processing.|$|E

25|$|Performance appraisals, {{also known}} as <b>performance</b> <b>evaluations,</b> are {{assessments}} that many organizations use to measure individuals' productivity, ability and talent in their respective job positions. The goal of these appraisals {{is not only to}} measure each person's performance, but also to align all of the employee's values, goals and motivations and become a better performing organization as a whole. While the implementation of <b>performance</b> <b>evaluations</b> has been characterized as beneficial and even essential for organizational success, many of these <b>performance</b> <b>evaluations</b> have also become more ineffective over time due to both the excessive number of evaluation measures and employee reactivity to these evaluations.|$|R

25|$|Several other <b>performance</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{models in}} the {{academic}} literature also describe performance measurement. What distinguishes performance paradox from these other models is {{that they tend to}} restrict their scopes either to explanations for changing performance criteria or to endorsements of maximizing on a specific, defined set of static criteria. Performance paradox alone predicts that maximizing on a set of predictably shifting criteria generates positive outcomes for organizations, most accurately describing most actual organizations' behavior.|$|E
25|$|Standard cost {{accounting}} can hurt managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's <b>performance</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Increasing inventory requires increased production, {{which means that}} processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.|$|E
25|$|Performance {{appraisal}} or <b>performance</b> <b>evaluation</b> is {{the process}} in which an individual's or a group's work behaviors and outcomes are assessed against managers' and others' expectations for the job. Performance appraisal is frequently used in promotion and compensation decisions, to help design and validate personnel selection procedures, and for performance management. Performance management {{is the process}} of providing performance feedback relative to expectations, and information relevant to improvement (e.g., coaching, mentoring). Performance management may also include documenting and tracking performance information for organizational evaluation purposes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This study investigates employee’s {{perception}} of job security {{in relation to}} <b>performance</b> <b>evaluations</b> in the workplace. Job security can affect many facets of performance and attitude in the workplace. Not all organizations conduct <b>performance</b> <b>evaluations,</b> which can result in adverse outcomes for both them and their employees. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the relationship between <b>performance</b> <b>evaluations</b> and employee’s {{perception of}} job security. In addition, this study seeks to determine if there is a difference in receiving none, below average, average and above average evaluation feedback in terms of job security in <b>performance</b> <b>evaluations</b> being present or not. A one-way ANOVA was performed to evaluate the total score for job security and the performance rating the participants received. There was a significant difference between above average and average ratings (p=. 04). Between the three groups (above average, average, and no performance rating) a significant difference was also found (p=. 012). This indicates how important the evaluation process is while giving feedback to employees...|$|R

25|$|With Nanda, Indjejikian {{argues that}} {{incentive}} problems are a crucial aspect of responsibility accounting. Due to the Ratchet effect, the employer {{would be better}} off if both parties can agree on a multi-period contract without subsequent revisions. Two responsibility center structures are analyzed: Consolidated structures are produced when managers are attributed to multiple activities. These structures imply less ratcheting but at the loss of comparative performance information. Specialized structures mean managers are responsible for one activity thus providing a higher level of comparative performance information but also a higher level of ratcheting. <b>Performance</b> <b>evaluation</b> in firms with specialized structures is more informative because of the use of comparative measurements.|$|E
25|$|The {{capabilities}} of the structural analysis software are a major consideration in the above process as they restrict the possible component models, the analysis methods available and, most importantly, the numerical robustness. The latter becomes a major consideration for structures that venture into the non-linear range and approach global or local collapse as the numerical solution becomes increasingly unstable and thus difficult to reach. There are several commercially available Finite Element Analysis software's such as CSI-SAP2000 and CSI-PERFORM-3D and Scia Engineer-ECtools {{which can be used}} for the seismic <b>performance</b> <b>evaluation</b> of buildings. Moreover, there is research-based finite element analysis platforms such as OpenSees, RUAUMOKO and the older DRAIN-2D/3D, several of which are now open source.|$|E
25|$|All the IITs {{follow the}} credits system of <b>performance</b> <b>evaluation,</b> with {{proportional}} weighting of courses {{based on their}} importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) {{form the basis of}} grades, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks. Sometimes, relative grading is done considering the overall performance of the whole class. For each semester, the students are graded on a scale of 0 to 10 based on their performance, by taking a weighted average of the grade points from all the courses, with their respective credit points. Each semester evaluation is done independently and then the weighted average over all semesters is used to calculate the cumulative grade point average (known as CGPA or CPI—Cumulative Performance Index).|$|E

The House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs held a hearing on preventable patient deaths in VA facilities in September 2013 during which representatives accused the VA of failing to discipline the officials responsible for patient deaths and instead providing performance bonuses. For example, VA regional director Michael Moreland received a bonus of approximately $63,000 and a five-page <b>performance</b> <b>evaluation</b> that made no mention of an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease that led to the deaths of six veterans and illness for 21 others at a Pittsburgh VHA hospital for which Moreland was responsible.|$|E

The relative success of graduates of women's colleges were compared to graduates of coeducational institutions. Ordinary Least Squares analysis was used to evaluate the data. Empirical results indicate that <b>performance</b> <b>evaluations</b> were positively influenced by salary grade, various college majors, and attendance at a women's college. Conversely, the number of women faculty at the college attended adversely affected performance. The results of the promotion rate model show that <b>performance</b> <b>evaluations</b> reduce the time to promo­tion.
