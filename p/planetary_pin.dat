40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{determination of}} the dress roll optimal radius while producing parts having trohoidal profile {{with the help of}} grinding method that presupposes application of grinding disk. In this case disk profile has been cut-in by diamond dressing. Two methods for determination of calculation of the dress roll optimal radius have been proposed in the paper.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} values while forming gear wheels is a material section area S с which is to be removed by a tool in the process of forming a space between two teeth in one pass. Cutting resistance which is proportional  to section area of  the layer to be cut and, correspondingly, a thermodynamic intensity in the polishing zone depend on S с value. The paper proposes relations for calculation of a material section area S с which is to be removed from a blank while forming a space between two teeth of a satellite gear of a <b>planetary</b> <b>pin</b> tooth reducer. Measurements being made in the AutoCAD packet have shown that any corrections of the profile do not make a significant influence on a section area S с. </p...|$|E

Introducing of the compliance of <b>planetary</b> <b>pins</b> and releasing of sun wheel requires complicated differential equations of motion containing new radial coordinates and negative radial stiffness of tooth mesh. Eigen-frequencies of separated gearbox and of three-aggregates-set are ascertain for different values of torsion stiffness of external aggregates.

40|$|Planetary {{gear drives}} have {{important}} advantages over parallel axis gears due to theirs compact design an great torque-to-weight ratio, but dynamic properties of such gearings are {{more complicated and}} they need deep dynamic analysis. For improving load sharing among planet wings, the application of flexible <b>planetary</b> <b>pins</b> or using free central wheel is needed. Presented paper is oriented on mathematical model design. The plane type of gearings with four planetary subsystems and fixed planet carrier has been selected. Used helical gearing has an essential smaller variation of contact stiffness against the direct spur gearings. Therefore this stiffness variability is not taken into account. Frequency and modal spectrums of such a dynamic mathematical model of planetary gearing set is presented and influences of design parameters are analysed...|$|R
40|$|The {{tooth contact}} {{stiffness}} is very often included in dynamic mathematical models of gear drives. It {{is an important}} value for calculation of torsion eigenfrequencies as w ell as the dynamic properties of the whole transmission systems. Planetary gear drives have several advantages over simple parallel axis gears, especially due to theirs compact design and great torque-to-weight ratio caused by multiple parallel paths. However, the dimensional or mounting errors can cause that some planets have the tendency to take more load than the others. One of the ways how to improve load sharing is the application of flexible <b>planetary</b> <b>pins</b> or by using a free central wheel. However in such cases, the wheels motion is defined in one rotation coordinate and two translation coordinates — tangential and radial. The reaction force at radial change of axis distance is usually neglected. The focus of this contribution is to derive the stiffness of this radial connection and to analyse the influence of radial stiffness on planetary gear dynamics...|$|R
