25|$|The Station nightclub fire {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 20, 2003, in West Warwick, Rhode Island, killing 100 people and injuring 230. The fire {{was caused by}} pyrotechnics set off by the tour manager of the evening's headlining band Jack Russell's Great White, which ignited <b>plastic</b> <b>foam</b> used as sound insulation in the walls and ceilings surrounding the stage. A fast-moving fire with intense black smoke engulfed the club in 5½ minutes. Video footage of the fire shows its ignition, rapid growth, the billowing smoke that quickly made escape impossible, and the exit blockage that further hindered evacuation. The toxic smoke, heat, and the resulting human crush toward the main exit killed 100; 230 were injured and another 132 escaped uninjured.

2500|$|The Fauvettes's {{fuselage}} {{is built}} in three parts. [...] The nose section, with a moulded <b>plastic</b> <b>foam</b> shell over a steel frame contains the cockpit, which {{is covered by}} a high, one-piece canopy over the upright seating position, giving the Fauvette a somewhat humpbacked look. [...] The centre section also has a steel frame, covered by moulded polystyrene; wings, cockpit and twin fuselage side towing hooks are attached to this frame. Behind the cockpit the upper fuselage line is formed with a polystyrene fairing which overlaps the conical rear fuselage, made of ply-foam sandwich. [...] The V-tail is straight-tapered with sweep on both edges. [...] The fixed surfaces are ply-foam sandwich structures, carrying fabric covered control surfaces.

[...] The amphibian is a cantilever high-wing monoplane with straight tapered wings; most of the sweep is on the trailing edge. The prototype originally had downturned wing tips but these were replaced with extended upturned tips by 2006 and by early 2011 a later aircraft had winglets which extended both {{above and below the}} tips. [...] There is no dihedral. [...] Its twin engines are placed above and ahead of the wing leading edge, as close to the centre-line as the clearance between propeller and fuselage allows. The prototype was powered by two LOM M337AK air-cooled six-cylinder supercharged inverted inline engines.

2500|$|Breguet's first sailplane, the Type 900 {{had some}} success in {{national}} competitions but failed to impress at the two World Championships of 1950 and 1952, partly because of its short wingspan. [...] The 901 is a development of this aircraft, retaining its mid wing layout and largely wooden construction. The wing of the 901 is straight tapered and built around a single spar, with a leading edge torsion box and fabric covered aft of the spar. On the 901 the torsion box was skinned with a plywood-klegecell (a <b>plastic</b> <b>foam)</b> sandwich rather than the ply of the 900. At 17.32m (57ft8in), its span is 2.97m (9ft9in) greater than the 900, raising the aspect ratio from 12.9 to 20. [...] There are long span, short chord slotted flaps inboard, mid-chord airbrakes and tips finished with small [...] "salmon" [...] fairings. Both designs have plywood skinned fuselages, though that of the 901 is longer in the nose where the cockpit has an extended, single piece canopy.|$|E

It is a Standard Class sailplane with a 15m (49ft3in) span. Like its predecessor, the 905 is a cantilever mid-wing monoplane but the its structure contains glass reinforced plastic, more <b>plastic</b> <b>foam</b> and less fabric. It also has a butterfly tail. It has a wing of straight tapered planform, terminated with small [...] "salmon" [...] fairings at the squared-off wingtips. [...] The major structural component is the main spar plus nose D-box unit, skinned with a plastic foam-filled ("Klegecel") sandwich with 0.6mm (0.024in)-ply outer layers. Ribs, ailerons and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are attached to this torsion box. [...] The whole upper wing surface and outboard lower surface is ply, supported by an internal Klegecell lining, with fabric below, aft of the spar. [...] Slotted ailerons occupy the outer 45% of the trailing edge; there are no flaps. [...] Each complete wing weighs just 34kg (75lb).|$|E
2500|$|In {{radiation}} implosion, {{the burst}} of X-ray energy coming from an exploding primary is captured and contained within an opaque-walled radiation channel which surrounds the nuclear energy {{components of the}} secondary. The radiation quickly turns the <b>plastic</b> <b>foam</b> that had been filling the channel into a plasma which is mostly transparent to X-rays, and the radiation is absorbed in the outermost layers of the pusher/tamper surrounding the secondary, which ablates and applies a massive force (much like an inside out rocket engine) causing the fusion fuel capsule to implode much like the pit of the primary. As the secondary implodes a fissile [...] "spark plug" [...] at its center ignites and provides neutrons and heat which enable the lithium deuteride fusion fuel to produce tritium and ignite as well. The fission and fusion chain reactions exchange neutrons {{with each other and}} boost the efficiency of both reactions. The greater implosive force, enhanced efficiency of the fissile [...] "spark plug" [...] due to boosting via fusion neutrons, and the fusion explosion itself provides significantly greater explosive yield from the secondary despite often not being much larger than the primary.|$|E
2500|$|A severe {{earthquake}} is {{more likely}} to disable the offshore causeway portions of Interstate Highway 80 (the Eastshore Freeway), since it is built on fill placed in the 1930s atop mudflats whose upper layers were deposited in the 19th century as a result of extensive hydraulic gold mining in the distant Sierra Nevada mountain foothills. This soft mud is expected to amplify earthquake shaking, and the mud supporting the heavy fill may liquefy, and so possibly cause major disruption of the highway due to failure by sinking of the highway and by differential movement of large sections. (More modern construction for these conditions employs linked and [...] "floating" [...] – in mud – lightweight concrete and <b>plastic</b> <b>foam</b> box structures to support a road.) Similar conditions underlie the eastern approach roads to the Bay Bridge. Better, but still locally poor soils underlie the portion of Interstate Highway 880 that extends to the South Bay region from the eastern terminus of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. As the bulk of cargo containers from the Port of Oakland travel on these two roads, the disabling of both would cause severe disruption of West Coast import and export goods, owing to the consequent overloading of other West Coast container handling ports.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, <b>plastic</b> <b>foams</b> were {{prepared}} from plant oil resins based on soybean oil and castor oil. Firstly, epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) reacted with acrylic acid using N, N-dimethyl benzyl amine as the catalyst, and castor oil was modified with maleic anhydride, respectively. Acid number {{was used to}} monitor the reaction process, and structures of the resultant acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) and maleate castor oil (MACO) were proved by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) measurements.

Then, <b>plastic</b> <b>foams</b> based on AESO and MACO were synthesized through free radical initiated copolymerization with diluent monomers including styrene and methyl methacrylate.

2500|$|While x-rays would {{normally}} travel {{at the speed}} of light through a low-density material like the <b>plastic</b> <b>foam</b> channel filler between (2) and (3), the intensity of radiation from the exploding primary creates a relatively opaque radiation front in the channel filler, which acts like a slow-moving logjam to retard the passage of radiant energy. [...] While the secondary is being compressed via radiation-induced ablation, neutrons from the primary catch up with the x-rays, penetrate into the secondary, and start breeding tritium via the third reaction noted in the first section above. [...] This Li-6 + n reaction is exothermic, producing 5 MeV per event. [...] The spark plug has not yet been compressed, and, thus, remains subcritical, so no significant fission or fusion takes place as a result. [...] If enough neutrons arrive before implosion of the secondary is complete, though, the crucial temperature differential between the outer and inner parts of the secondary can be degraded, potentially causing the secondary to fail to ignite. [...] The first Livermore-designed thermonuclear weapon, the Morgenstern device, failed in this manner when it was tested as Castle Koon on April 7, 1954. [...] The primary ignited, but the secondary, preheated by the primary's neutron wave, did not; thus, a weapon with a predicted one-megaton yield produced only 110 kilotons (the primary's yield).|$|E
2500|$|The {{space between}} the uranium fusion tamper (also termed pusher; both terms can be used interchangeably) which is the metal {{cladding}} encasing the secondary and the case formed a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the primary to the secondary assembly; the interstage. It {{is one of the}} most closely guarded secrets of a multi-stage thermonuclear weapon. Implosion of the secondary assembly is indirectly driven, and the techniques used in the interstage to smooth the spatial profile (i.e. reduce coherence and nonuniformities) of the primary’s irradiance are of utmost importance. This was done with the introduction of the channel filler – an optical element used as a refractive medium, also called random-phase plate. This [...] "plate" [...] was a polystyrene <b>plastic</b> <b>foam</b> filling, extruded or impregnated with a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon (possibly methane gas), which turned to a low-Z plasma from the X-rays and tamped (not to be confused with the fusion tamper) the sputtering effect that choked the radiation from compressing the secondary. Sputtering is the manifestation of the underdense plasma corona of the ablating hohlraum and the tamper surfaces. It is a problem, also shared by magnetically confined fusion reactors (see Tokamak), that has to do with the ablated particles, the blown-off uranium (or Pb–Bi alloy, depending on the [...] "cocktail", or high-Z element mixture, of the hohlraum design to tailor its opacity), which fly inside the radiation channel and absorb radiation or reflect it, contributing negatively to the radiation mirroring (also termed [...] "ducting" [...] in the TN jargon). The re-emitted X-rays from the radiation case must be deposited uniformly on the outer walls of the secondary’s tamper and ablate it externally, driving the thermonuclear fuel capsule (increasing the density and temperature of the fusion fuel) to the point needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction. (see Nuclear weapon design). This point is above the threshold where the fusion fuel would turn opaque to its emitting radiation, as determined from its Rosseland opacity. After all, for any hydrogen weapon system to work, this radiative equilibrium must be reached together with the compression equilibrium between the fusion tamper and the sparkplug (see below), hence their name equilibrium supers.|$|E
