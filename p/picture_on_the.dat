5|$|The art {{direction}} for the 1988 release was instead put {{in the hands of}} CBS Records' art director Arnold Levine and his staff. They based the cover art on a fin de siècle image of the Cliff House, a restaurant perched on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco, California, built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907. The back cover is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of the <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors.|$|E
5|$|The <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{front cover}} of the {{original}} album was kept for the 2003 reissue. However, the design was altered slightly by graphic designer Rachel Gutek of the design company guppyart. This release contains an expanded booklet written by music journalist Max Bell giving the background to the album. The booklet contains a number of photographs which are credited to Sergeant and Pattinson.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot {{of a little girl}} {{sleeping}} in her bed. As the music starts, rays of light emanate from the bedside radio with cartoon violins playing the music. The sun rises inside a <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall and the girl wakes and starts playing with her doll. A fairy goes around tapping all her toys on the floor and a large, golden teapot comes alive and shoots a rainbow from its spout. A cartoon version of the girl then slides along the rainbow and, interpreting the lyrics of the song, catches a falling star and rides over the moon.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E

25|$|Eakins' lifelong {{interest}} in the figure, nude or nearly so, took several thematic forms. The rowing paintings of the early 1870s constitute the first series of figure studies.

25|$|Boyer {{published}} I Married Wyatt Earp with a <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{cover of}} a woman wearing a sheer gauze peignoir, re-touched to conceal her breasts and nipples.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how a spatial soliton can exist, {{we have to make}} some considerations about a simple convex lens. As shown in the <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, an optical field approaches the lens and then it is focused. The effect of the lens is to introduce a non-uniform phase change that causes focusing. This phase change {{is a function of the}} space and can be represented with , whose shape is approximately represented in the picture.|$|E

25|$|Burton helped train {{a number}} of {{prominent}} water system engineers for nine years, and became the sole consultant engineer for the Sanitary Department of the Home Ministry, planning and managing the water and drainage systems of numerous cities, including Tokyo. His achievements are considered {{the starting point of}} Japan's environmental and sanitary engineering. The sand filtration system he built in Shimonoseki city, Yamaguchi prefecture is still functional today and produces water so pure it is bottled with Burton's <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> label.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{experiencing}} hemimicropsia often {{complain that}} objects in their {{left or right}} visual field appear to be shrunken or compressed. They may also have difficulty appreciating the symmetry of pictures. When drawing, patients often {{have a tendency to}} compensate for their perceptual asymmetry by drawing the left or right half of objects slightly larger than the other. In a case of one person with hemimicropsia asked to draw six symmetrical objects, the size of the <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left half was on average 16% larger than the corresponding right half.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{language}} newspaper periodical, El Diario, in its Friday, July 28, 2006 edition, {{used the}} front page headline title, Otra Imette, with Moore's high school <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front page to compare her murder with John Jay College of Criminal Justice student, Imette St. Guillen, who was murdered earlier on February 25, 2006, allegedly {{by one of the}} bouncers at The Falls bar. Her death was also related to nightlife in general. With Moore's death, some news and media sources such as the New York Post, started article series that focused on nightlife, bars, bouncers, underage drinking and fake I.D's in their newspaper and television stories.|$|E

25|$|The austere {{portrait}} in his normally constrained palette is another Whistler exercise in tonal harmony and composition. The deceptively simple design {{is in fact}} a balancing act of differing shapes, particularly the rectangles of curtain, <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall, and floor which stabilize the curve of her face, dress, and chair. Again, although his mother is the subject, Whistler commented that the narrative was of little importance. In reality, however, it was an homage to his pious mother. After the initial shock of her moving in with her son, she aided him considerably by stabilizing his behavior somewhat, tending to his domestic needs, and providing an aura of conservative respectability that helped win over patrons.|$|E
25|$|As the {{principle}} {{subject matter of}} this work Gleizes chose to represent a group of six or seven rugby football players. The action and contact between the players is palpable. Two of the men are {{holding on to the}} player with the ball (blue jersey) as if a tackle is imminent. In contrast to the impending violence of the sport, Gleizes has painted flowers along with some cubic shapes toward the bottom right of the <b>picture.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> bottom left is a man, possibly a fallen player, holding {{what appears to be a}} round shaped item in his hand. Spectators are seen toward the upper right, while to the left, in the background, Gleizes has painted a town, a bridge and bellowing clouds or smoke.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Scottish {{physicist}} James Clerk Maxwell {{found a new}} way of explaining colours, by the wavelength of their light. He showed that white light could be created by combining red, blue and green light, and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours. His idea, called additive colour or the RGB colour model, is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens. The screen is covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks white. As the screen is scanned from behind with electrons, each pixel creates its own designated colour, composing a complete <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen.|$|E
