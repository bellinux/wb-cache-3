5|$|Doom leverages his {{experience}} into {{a deal with}} the American military, which forces the Fantastic Four to work with Doom. Deducing that the Surfer's board is the source of his power, Reed develops a tachyon <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> that will separate the Surfer from it, while Doom devises a machine whose function he keeps secret. In the Black Forest, the Surfer confronts Sue and reveals he is merely a servant to the destroyer of worlds, and regrets the destruction he causes. The military opens fire on the Surfer, which distracts him and allows the Fantastic Four to fire the pulse, separating the Surfer from his board. The military imprisons the Surfer in Siberia, where they torture him for information. Sue uses her powers to sneak into his cell, where he informs her that his master, known by the people of his world as Galactus, is a massive cloud-like cosmic entity that feeds on life-bearing planets to survive, and that his board is a homing beacon summoning Galactus to the planet. The Silver Surfer has to serve Galactus, who will otherwise destroy the Surfer's planet.|$|E
25|$|High voltage switch for non-coherent keyed power-oscillators These {{modulators}} {{consist of}} a high voltage <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> formed from a high voltage supply, a pulse forming network, and a high voltage switch such as a thyratron. They generate short pulses of power to feed, e.g., the magnetron, a special type of vacuum tube that converts DC (usually pulsed) into microwaves. This technology is known as pulsed power. In this way, the transmitted pulse of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration.|$|E
25|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) uses implantable electrodes to send high-frequency electrical {{signals to}} the thalamus. The electrodes are implanted as described above. The patient uses a hand-held magnet to turn on and turn off a <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> that is surgically implanted under the skin. The electrical stimulation temporarily disables the tremor and can be “reversed,” if necessary, by turning off the implanted electrode. Batteries in the generator last about 5 years and can be replaced surgically. DBS is currently used to treat parkinsonian tremor and essential tremor. It is also applied successfully for other rare causes of tremor.|$|E

They in turn test systems and components for linearity, stability, resolution, pile-up and count rate effects.

25|$|Normal puberty is {{initiated}} in the hypothalamus, with de-inhibition of the <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> in the arcuate nucleus. This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus {{is an ongoing}} active suppression by {{other areas of the}} brain. The signal and mechanism releasing the arcuate nucleus from inhibition {{have been the subject of}} investigation for decades and remain incompletely understood. Leptin levels rise throughout childhood and play a part in allowing the arcuate nucleus to resume operation. If the childhood inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is interrupted prematurely by injury to the brain, it may resume pulsatile gonadotropin release and puberty will begin at an early age.|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} who cannot use a continuous positive airway pressure device, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014 granted pre-market approval for an upper airway stimulation system that senses respiration and delivers mild electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve {{in order to}} increase muscle tone {{at the back of the}} tongue so it will not collapse over the airway. The device includes a handheld patient controller to allow it to be switched on before sleep and is powered by an implantable <b>pulse</b> <b>generator,</b> similar to one used for cardiac rhythm management. Approval for this active implantable neuromodulation device was preceded by a clinical trial whose results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) {{is presently}} the most used method of surgical treatment {{because it does}} not destroy brain tissue, it is reversible, and it can be tailored to individuals at their particular stage of disease. DBS employs three hardware components: a neurostimulator, also called an implanted <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> (IPG), which generates electrical impulses used to modulate neural activity, a lead wire which directs the impulses to a number of metallic electrodes towards the tip of the lead near the stimulation target, and an extension wire that connects the lead to the IPG. The IPG, which is battery-powered and encased in titanium, is traditionally implanted under the collarbone, and is connected by the subcutaneous extension to the lead, which extends from outside the skull under the scalp down into the brain to the target of stimulation. The IPG, or the entire three-component system, are sometimes referred to as a brain pacemaker, due to the precedence and renown of cardiac pacemakers and similarities in the components of both types of systems.|$|E

2500|$|For decades, electron-tube {{designers}} {{tried to}} augment amplifying tubes with electron multipliers {{in order to}} increase gain, but these suffered from short life because the material used for the dynodes [...] "poisoned" [...] the tube's hot cathode. (For instance, the interesting RCA 1630 secondary-emission tube was marketed, but did not last.) However, eventually, Philips of the Netherlands developed the EFP60 tube that had a satisfactory lifetime, and was used in at least one product, a laboratory <b>pulse</b> <b>generator.</b> By that time, however, transistors were rapidly improving, making such developments superfluous.|$|E
