50|$|Pile weave {{is a form}} of textile {{created by}} weaving. <b>Pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> used to be made on {{traditional}} hand weaving machines. The warp ends that are used for the formation of the pile are woven over metal rods or wires that are inserted in the shed (gap caused by raising alternate threads) during weaving. The pile ends lie in loops over the inserted rods. When a rod is extracted the pile ends remain as loops on top of the base fabric. The pile ends lying over the rod may be left as 'loop pile', or cut to form 'cut pile' or velvet.|$|E
50|$|On {{mechanical}} looms {{the technology}} of 'wire weaving' still exists, using modern technology and electronics. This weaving technique allows users to obtain both loop pile and cut pile in the same fabric. Other techniques involve the weaving of two layers of fabric {{on top of each}} other, whereby the warp ends used for the pile are inserted {{in such a way that}} they form a vertical connection between the two layers of fabric. By cutting the pile ends in between the two layers one obtains two separate <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> With this technique only the cut pile effect can be obtained. This is known as 'face-to-face weaving'. Both 'wire weaving' and 'face-to-face' weaving are used for the manufacturing of upholstery and furnishing fabrics as well as in rug making (knotted-pile carpet).|$|E

Thus, an effective nitrogen removal process is needed to reduce effluent nitrogen concentration. We have developed a new nitrogen removal process using non-woven biomass carriers. In this study, we used <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which are products of the local industry in the Wakayama prefecture, instead of non-woven materials as biomass carriers to improve nitrification rates. Several <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> were then used for nitrification and continuous nitrification/denitrification experiments. The specific NOx-N production rate using an acrylic pile fabric was 3. 4 times {{higher than that of}} non-woven carriers. About 75 % nitrification efficiencies were obtained under a T-N loading rate of 0. 5 kg-N/m 3 /day and a HRT of 10 hours during continuous nitrification using acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Furthermore, continuous nitrification/denitrification experiments were carried out using acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> in a base cloth with a mesh structure to improve the diffusion rates. Little biomass accumulated on the pile fabric surfaces so a high diffusion rate through the pile was maintained for long periods. Denitrification efficiencies of 56 and 77 % were achieved at HRTs of 12 and 19 hours, respectively, with influent concentrations of 200 mg/l T-N and 450 mg/lTOC...|$|E

30|$|Current {{residential}} mattresses use a {{wide range}} of tickings, including <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> knits, woven fabrics and jacquard designs. To address issues of physiological comfort, fire safety, and the growing incidence of allergies within the U.S. population, a variety of functional coatings, including water-proof, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and/or flame retardant finishes, are applied to the ticking of the mattress. The majority of modern ticking materials have a high polypropylene and/ or polyester fiber count, with the fiber content varying significantly with the fabric structure and design pattern. While cotton, polyester and polypropylene fibers dominate the ticking industry, blends of luxury fibers, such as wool and silk, are becoming more prevalent. Renewable resources like corn, soybean and bamboo fibers are also gaining popularity as more environmentally friendly alternatives. Viscose rayon derived from bamboo is of particularly high interest because of its inherent anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties and its good breathability and moisture absorption.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of {{e-commerce}} or virtual prototyping of textile fabrics and garments, tactile stimulators could be very pertinent and useful tools for the industry. The challenge is to stimulate the human hand using a tactile device in order to simulate the textile fabric touch. The principle of the tactile device is described. The kinds of fabrics investigated are <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> such as velvet. In this study, the illusion of pile is given when touching the smooth plate of the tactile device by modulating the coefficient of friction between the plate and the finger during an active movement. The control signal is qualitatively designed from some tribological features identified in this study as velvet fabric characteristics. The influence of each tribological feature on the tactile rendering is studied via psychophysical studies comparing real and simulated fabrics. The best rendering needs a simulation with three specific features: a coefficient of friction, which depends on the finger movement direction; a transition phase for the change of movement direction; and small amplitude variations of the coefficient of friction with about one millimeter wavelength...|$|E

Christy's son, the noted collector and ethnologist Henry Christy, discovered the product that would make the company famous. While travelling in Istanbul, he saw an example of the looped <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> that is known today as terry towelling, but which was initially known as the 'Turkish towel'.The company found a method of weaving the looped <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> on an industrial scale using a machine designed by one of their employees Samuel Holt, who patented the design.

30|$|The {{most common}} tickings used in current {{mattresses}} are <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> knits, and jacquard woven fabrics. With an increased focus on allergies, physiological comfort, and fire safety, {{a variety of}} functional coatings (e.g., water-proof, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and/or FR finishes) are now applied to mattress tickings. The majority of modern ticking materials have a high polypropylene and/or polyester fiber count, with the fiber content varying significantly with the fabric structure and design pattern. These tickings are highly flammable, but are not necessarily a greater fire threat, as these synthetic fabrics tend to melt away from the ignition source and self-extinguish. Cotton tickings are often considered “sacrificial”, as they pyrolyze quickly and generate low heat, thereby resulting in little heat transfer to the inner layers of the mattress. While cotton, polyester and polypropylene fibers dominate the ticking industry, blends of luxury fibers (e.g., wool and silk) are becoming more prevalent. Wool and silk are inherently low flammability fibers. Fibers made from renewable resources (e.g., corn, soybean and bamboo) are also gaining popularity as more environmentally friendly alternatives. Viscose rayon derived from bamboo is of particularly high interest because of its inherent anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties and its good breathability and moisture absorption ([Ticking 2005]). However, very {{little is known about}} the flammability of these ‘green’ alternatives.|$|E
40|$|Cloth is {{a common}} {{material}} which exhibits complex, anisotropic reflection behavior. Because cloth is such an important material class in human-centric environments, many models have attempted to describe its appearance. This thesis aims to clarify {{the state of the}} art of cloth rendering by comparing two recent models, by Irawan et al. and by Sadeghi et al., which both describe cloth as woven microcylinders. We fit each of these models to a set of measured fabrics and link the resulting differences to theoretical elements of the models. Through this comparison, we find that Sadeghi's model is able to more closely match the appearance of complex fabrics. Additionally, we present measurements of 8 fabric samples, which exhibit several different structural characteristics. These samples include woven, knitted, nap and <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Sadeghi's model is used to reproduce the appearance of the samples. This both allows us to further evaluate this model, and expands the library of cloth types which Sadeghi's model has been used to describe. We find the model to be largely successful in matching the samples, although we also discover a key limitation inherent to woven cloth models. To address this, we suggest an extension, called the thread direction curve which would further generalize the model. The measurements in this thesis have been included in a supplementary archive...|$|E
40|$|BF-T 9 P, a {{nonwoven}} fiber material, {{can be used}} as {{an effective}} biomass carrier for yeast (UY 7 strain) in the treatment of wastewater generated during the production of seasoned salty plums. However, the cost is a major problem in small and medium scale companies. We investigated the feasibility of using a <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> biomass carrier that can be produced at low cost with existing equipment. The TOC removal rate of E-pile, a polyester <b>pile</b> <b>fabric,</b> was as high as that of the nonwoven material under a volumetric loading rate of 4 to 15 kg-TOC/m 3 /d. A packing ratio of 0. 17 m 3 -carrier/m 3 -reactor was sufficient for TOC removal if the volumetric loading rate was less than 8 kg-TOC/m 3 /d. In a system using a biomass carrier, the decrease in TOC removal caused by a temperature drop from 25 to 5 ℃ was slower and the increase in TOC removal upon raising the temperature to 10 ℃ was faster, compared with a system without a biomass carrier. These results may be attributed to the stable retention of yeast in the reactor by entrapment inside the biomass carrier...|$|R

Richard John Humphries of the Humphries Weaving Company is renown for his expertise on fine silk production for royal regalia and restorations. He told me how he acquired his lathe-turned, teak velvet bobbins. He had salvaged his velvetloom and velvet wire collection from {{the closure of the}} Warners mill in 1971. However, he had no velvet bobbins. One day a person from the War Department approached him with the theory that a cloth could shield the fuselages of aircraft and prevent heat-seeking missiles from locking onto them. The woven fabric would have polyester thread crossed with nickel-plated copper wire. First Richard tried warping with the polyester and inserting copper wire. However, the specifications were extremely exacting and the slight unevenness of the beat exceeded the tolerance level. In a stroke of genius, he switched, wound the wire on made-to-order bobbins, polyester for weft. Success, he wove these anti-radar shields for helicopters for years. Eugene Nicholson, former Keeper of Industrial Technology at the Bradford Industrial Museum, related that the Lister 2 ̆ 7 s Manningham Mills grew to prominence with the advent of its face-to-face velvet powerlooms.

30|$|The fabric {{design and}} {{construction}} can also impact the flammability of soft furnishings. For jacquard woven fabrics, the design can affect the peak heat release rate (PHRR) even if the basic yarn composition within the fabric remains unchanged. For example, design patterns with large motifs may have different burning characteristics than those with small motifs ([Horrocks et al. 2001]). This is extremely important as the PHRR is often a critical performance metric for soft furnishing standards/regulations. One of the approaches to prevent heat transfer through the fabric (to the highly flammable foam core) is to use “pile” fabric structure that have raised fibers on the base <b>fabric.</b> Ignition of <b>pile</b> fibers creates what is called “surface flashing”, {{which is a very}} rapid spread of flames {{across the surface of the}} soft furnishing due to the easy ignitability and rapid consumption of these fibers.

5000|$|A {{latch hook}} {{is both the}} tool and the textile art of latch hooking. Latch hooking differs from {{traditional}} rug hooking and locker hooking by the physical knotting of the yarn to canvas. Latch hook was invented {{in the nineteenth century}} with the latch needle, in the twentieth century the latch needle underwent numerous variations including the hand tool used by artisans and crafters to produce latch hook rugs. While rug hooking uses a base fabric of burlap or hessian, latch hooking uses specially woven rug canvas. Rug canvases range from 3.3 holes per inch (hpi) to 5 hpi. The pattern may be stencilled onto the canvas or worked from a chart similar to a needlepoint pattern. Latch hook yarns may be bough pre-cut (usually 2.5 inch lengths) or in skeins and cut to the desired length.In his book [...] "The Hooked Rug," [...] published in 1930, American writer William Winthrop Kent describes a form of rugmaking [...] "A canvas is used like cross-stitch canvas only coarser, which has every third mesh a large one. It is held on the knee or on a table. The pieces of wool yarn are cut exactly the same length by a gauge. The hook used has a catch or latch on it and is inserted in one hole and out the next in the next row, as follows: The wool is held in the left hand and above the canvas, then doubled and the double end is slipped over the hook, the catch being up or open. The hook is then drawn out through the canvas toward the worker, the cut ends being kept in the left hand. The catch by this action drops down and secures the wool. The tool is next pushed forward through the wool loop and catches the two ends held in the left hand, then the loop is held in the left hand and has the two ends pulled through it with the hook. To pull out hook and draw tight the two cut ends finishes the knot. This is really a <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> and is known as a Turkey Rug but sprang from the hooking process as the earlier hook used was of the crochet hook form." ...|$|R
