40|$|The {{toxicity}} of exposure by inhalation to organic solvents may {{not only be}} related to the total external dose, but also to the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> In this study the impact of the exposure scenario on the behavioural effects of the model solvent toluene in rats was investigated. Rats were exposed for 7. 5 h to either a constant concentration or fluctuating concentrations at total external dose levels of 20, 000 ppm h and 10, 000 ppm h. Different effects on measures of visual discrimination performance were observed in rats exposed to a constant or fluctuating concentrations, and when rats were tested immediately or sometime after the end of exposure to fluctuating concentrations. Motor activity was also differently affected by different exposure scenarios. Physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modelling was used to predict the toxicokinetics of toluene induced by these different exposure scenarios. The model was calibrated by measuring toluene concentrations in blood and brain during and after exposure. The results show that the acute effects of toluene on behaviour do not depend only on the concentration and duration of exposure, but primarily on the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{suggest that}} child well-being and subsequent status attainment are influenced {{not only by}} the overall magnitude <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to family economic disadvantage during childhood, but also by the age <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and significant changes in family economic circumstances. Unfortunately, traditional measures of children's economic deprivation, such as permanent and transitory income, persistent or cumulative poverty, and the number and length of poverty spells, fail to differentiate between exposure to disadvantage at different stages in childhood and largely ignore how family economic circumstances are changing over time. In this paper, the authors propose a new method for assessing economic disadvantage during childhood that captures both children's overall levels <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to economic disadvantage and their <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> This new method, which takes advantage of recent advances in finite mixture modeling, uses a longitudinal latent class model to classify children into a limited number of groups with similar histories <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to family economic disadvantage. Using this new methodology, group membership can be related to both family background characteristics and achievement in childhood and early adulthood, making it possible both to assess how family characteristics affect <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to disadvantage during childhood and directly test alternative theories about the effect <b>of</b> different <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> on achievement.

We mutated, one at a time, 23 residues in and flanking M 3 to cysteine and expressed the mutant receptors heterologously. Ten of these mutants reacted with charged, hydrophilic, lipophobic, sulfhydryl-specific reagents, added extracellularly, and were protected from reaction by a reversible dopamine antagonist. Thus, the side chains of these residues are exposed in the binding-site crevice, which like M 3 extends from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the membrane.
