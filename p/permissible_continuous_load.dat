40|$|The {{increase}} in <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> such as radio transmitters and microprocessors in substations {{has led some}} utilities, including ours, {{to take a closer}} look at the sizing of the stationary batteries that operate those stations when commercial power is lost. Critical functions, such as tripping circuit breakers and conununicating information to dispatch centers, are placed on DC power. When station power is present, that DC power for the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> is supplied by the charger. When conunercial power is lost, however, the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> are carried by the batteries, which must also have the capacity to operate tripping mechanisms. IEEE Standard 485 I is widely accepted as the guideline for sizing of stationary batteries, and its application is discussed. Once a battery is placed in service, its maintenance, monitoring and periodic testing protocols are the next issues that the utility considers. Those practiced by this utility are discussed, including monitoring of the presence of DC power at certain critical points by SCADA equipment. The COIIlIOOnvoltages in electric utility substations are 48 and 120. 48 volt systems are more common, and are the preferred choice when allowable because of their smaller physical size and ease of maintenance. In some stations, however, the physical size of the station requires the higher voltage in order to lower the current and thus the voltage drop. Changes in equipment over the last twenty years have caused an {{increase in}} the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> placed on substation batteries.

While the loading itself {{is based on a}} single slowing step, applying a radio frequency field forces the atoms to repeat this step many times resulting in a so-called Sisyphus cooling.

We study the interplay of the <b>continuous</b> <b>loading</b> and simultaneous Sisyphus cooling in different density regimes.

Results show that at the minute-scale, all the duty cycles investigated, produced 78 % higher power bursts from the MFCs (500 µW) than when under <b>continuous</b> <b>loading</b> (280 µW). These results were recorded from MFCs employing ceramic membranes, whereas the difference in performance for MFCs employing commercially available cation-exchange-membranes was insignificant.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{developed}} for solving the lifting-surface equation for thin wings. The solution requires the downwash equation {{to be in}} the form of Cauchy integrals which can be interpreted as a vortex lattice with the positions of the vortices and control points dictated by the finite sum used to approximate the integrals involved.

Test aerosol is sodium chloride (NaCl) particulates with electrical mobility diameter (EMD) ranging from 41 to 514 nm generated from atomization. Two types of non-woven filters composed of fibers with diameter 1. 8 μm (micro-fibrous) and 300 nm (nano-fibrous) are tested. Most penetrating particle size (MPPS) of clean micro- and nano-fibrous filters are 203 and 103 nm EMD, respectively. Both of them have clean filter filtration efficiencies closely agree with Payet's model. Under <b>continuous</b> aerosol <b>loading,</b> MPPS of both types of filters shift to smaller size. A semi-empirical model is developed to describe pressure drop across a fibrous filter operating in aerodynamic slip regime under <b>continuous</b> <b>loading</b> of sub-micron aerosols. Experimental results of filters with thickness ranging from 1 × 10 - 5 to 1 × 10 - 4 m generally agree with this model.

Although clean micro- and nano-fibrous filters have comparable pressure drop while nano- offers higher filtration efficiency against sub-micron aerosols, which may suggest it as an "absolutely better" filter, experimental results show that the mass holding capacity of nano-fibrous filter is lower than its micro-fibrous counterpart.
