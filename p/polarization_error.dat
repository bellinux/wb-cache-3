40|$|Substantial {{impacts of}} {{aerosols}} on climate {{and public health}} underscore the need for accurate characterization of atmospheric aerosol distributions and microphysical properties. The Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI) combines accurate multispectral, multiangle, and polarimetric technologies in a single instrument that images a wide swath on the Earth's surface to advance aerosol remote sensing capabilities. MSPI is required to have 3 % radiometric uncertainty and 0. 005 degree of linear polarization (DoLP) uncertainty. These are difficult requirements that push the limits of available technologies needed to perform space-based polarimetric imaging. This work examines three topics related to MSPI fabrication and calibration: <b>polarization</b> <b>errors</b> and their correction, achromatic, athermal, quarter wave retarder fabrication, and analysis of a polarization state generator (PSG) for MSPI polarization calibration confirmation. MSPI <b>polarization</b> <b>errors</b> may arise from surface geometry of the optical components, coatings, and quarter wave plates (QWPs). Static <b>polarization</b> <b>errors</b> can be calibrated out, but result in decreased SNR. <b>Polarization</b> <b>errors</b> that drift following calibration cannot be corrected, so a sensitivity analysis is used to set time-varying diattenuation and retardance magnitude tolerances. QWPs are required to work {{in concert with the}} PEMs to modulate the linear component of the Stokes vector. A three-material achromatic, athermalized QWP was designed, fabricated and its performance validated. Analysis indicated that the compound QWP was unlikely to meet the requirements if plates were specified by thickness. To address this, a method for QWP fabrication was developed that involves monitoring retardance during polishing. To verify MSPI performance, a PSG was built and calibrated which outputs weakly linearly polarized light with DoLPs varying from 0. 0005 to 0. 4 with 0. 0005 uncertainty by passing nearly unpolarized light through a tilted plane parallel plate. The PSG was intended to act as a calibration standard based on calculated DoLP, but proved difficult to model. Therefore, the DoLP was instead measured to repeatability of 0. 0005. Finally, example spectropolarimetric image data taken with MSPI was presented. Work on a follow-on prototype continues that will advance the technologies needed to realize the space-based, fully capable MSPI...|$|R

A practical polarimetric beamformer solution that does not require exact knowledge of the array polarimetric response is shown to be equivalent to the optimal solution {{in the sense that}} when the practical beamformers are calibrated, the optimal solution is obtained.

40|$|Real global-scale quantum {{communications}} and {{quantum key distribution}} systems cannot be implemented by the current fiber and free-space links. These links have high attenuation, low polarization-preserving capability or extreme sensitivity to the environment. A potential {{solution to the problem}} is the space-earth quantum channels. These channels have no absorption since the signal states are propagated in empty space, however a small fraction of these channels is in the atmosphere, which causes slight depolarizing effect. Furthermore, the relative motion of the ground station and the satellite causes a rotation in the polarization of the quantum states. In the current approaches to compensate for these types of <b>polarization</b> <b>errors,</b> high computational costs and extra physical apparatuses are required.

40|$|Much {{evidence}} indicates that GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) has {{a major impact on}} the evolution of mammalian genomes. However, a detailed quantification of the process is still lacking. The strength of gBGC can be measured from the analysis of derived allele frequency spectra (DAF), but this approach is sensitive to a number of confounding factors. In particular, we show by simulations that the inference is pervasively affected by polymorphism <b>polarization</b> <b>errors</b> and by spatial heterogeneity in gBGC strength. We propose a new general method to quantify gBGC from DAF spectra, incorporating <b>polarization</b> <b>errors,</b> taking spatial heterogeneity into account, and jointly estimating mutation bias. Applying it to human polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that the strength of gBGC does not differ between hypermutable CpG sites and non-CpG sites, suggesting that in humans gBGC is not caused by the base-excision repair machinery. Genome-wide, the intensity of gBGC is in the nearly neutral area. However, given that recombination occurs primarily within recombination hotspots, 1 %- 2 % of the human genome is subject to strong gBGC. On average, gBGC is stronger in African than in non-African populations, reflecting differences in effective population sizes. However, due to more heterogeneous recombination landscapes, the fraction of the genome affected by strong gBGC is larger in non-African than in African populations. Given that the location of recombination hotspots evolves very rapidly, our analysis predicts that, in the long term, a large fraction of the genome is affected by short episodes of strong gBGC...|$|R

40|$|Compact antenna test ranges {{intended}} for low cross-polarization antenna measurements {{require the use}} of feeds with polarization ratios typically greater than 40 dB across the included angle of the quiet zone as well as across the frequency band of interest. The design for a series of circular corrugated aperture feeds to meet these requirements is presented. The feeds are based on a circular waveguide OMT covering a full waveguide frequency band with interchangeable corrugated apertures to cover three sub-bands. In order to validate the design of this series of scalar feeds, high accuracy cross-polarization data was collected. The primary limiting factor in the measurement of the polarization ratio was the finite polarization ratio of the source antennas. A technique for correcting for the polarization ratio of the source is presented along with measured data on the feeds. The technique begins with the accurate characterization of the linear polarization ratio of the standard gain horns using a three antenna technique, followed by pattern measurements of the feeds, and ends with the removal of the <b>polarization</b> <b>error</b> due to the source antenna from the measured data.

40|$|A compact {{range is}} a {{facility}} {{used for the}} measurement of antenna radiation and target scattering problems. Most presently available parabolic reflectors do not produce ideal uniform plane waves in the target zone. Design improvements are suggested to reduce the amplitude taper, ripple and cross <b>polarization</b> <b>errors.</b> The ripple caused by diffractions from the reflector edges can be reduced by adding blended rolled edges and shaping the edge contour. Since the reflected edge continues smoothly from the parabola onto the rolled surface, rather than being abruptly terminated, the discontinuity in the reflected field is reduced which results in weaker diffracted fields. This is done by blending the rolled edges from the parabola into an ellipse. An algorithm which enables one to design optimum blended rolled edges was developed {{that is based on}} an analysis of the continuity of the surface radius of curvature and its derivatives across the junction. Futhermore, a concave edge contour results in a divergent diffracted ray pattern and hence less stray energy in the target zone. Design equations for three-dimensional reflectors are given. Various examples were analyzed using a new physical optics method which eliminates the effects of the false scattering centers on the incident shadow boundaries. A Gregorian subreflector system, in which both the subreflector and feed axes are tilted, results in a substantial reduction in the amplitude taper and cross <b>polarization</b> <b>errors.</b> A dual chamber configuration is proposed to eliminate the effects of diffraction from the subreflector and spillover from the feed.
