500|$|Both iPhone 6 models {{received}} generally positive reviews. Re/code {{called it}} [...] "the best smartphone you can buy". TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's [...] "brilliant" [...] design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being [...] "smarter and more intuitive than ever", {{along with the}} quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same <b>physical</b> <b>screen</b> size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One, and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone. The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be [...] "simply and cleanly designed" [...] in comparison to the 5s, noting that the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, VoLTE support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered [...] "good, even great, but there’s little about it that’s truly ambitious or truly moving the needle. It’s just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package".|$|E

50|$|When a {{computer}} display resolution is set {{higher than the}} <b>physical</b> <b>screen</b> resolution (native resolution), some video drivers make the virtual screen scrollable over the <b>physical</b> <b>screen</b> thus realizing a two dimensional virtual desktop with its viewport. Most LCD manufacturers do make note of the panel's native resolution as working in a non-native resolution on LCDs {{will result in a}} poorer image, due to dropping of pixels to make the image fit (when using DVI) or insufficient sampling of the analog signal (when using VGA connector). Few CRT manufacturers will quote the true native resolution, because CRTs are analog in nature and can vary their display from as low as 320 × 200 (emulation of older computers or game consoles) to as high as the internal board will allow, or the image becomes too detailed for the vacuum tube to recreate (i.e., analog blur). Thus, CRTs provide a variability in resolution that fixed resolution LCDs cannot provide.|$|E
50|$|CRTs {{made for}} {{computer}} display {{are set to}} underscan with an adjustable border, usually colored black. The border will change size and shape if required {{to allow for the}} tolerance of low precision (although later models allow for precise calibration to minimise or eliminate the border). As such, computer CRTs use less <b>physical</b> <b>screen</b> area than TVs, to allow all information to be shown at all times.|$|E
50|$|Software {{programs}} render {{images to}} the virtual screen {{and then the}} operating system renders the virtual screen onto the <b>physical</b> <b>screen.</b> With a logical PPI of 96 PPI, older programs can still run properly regardless of the actual physical PPI of the display screen, although they may exhibit some visual distortion thanks to the effective 133.3% pixel zoom level (requiring either that every third pixel be doubled in width/height, or heavy-handed smoothing be employed).|$|E

5000|$|Xvnc is the Unix VNC server, {{which is}} based on a {{standard}} X server. To applications, Xvnc appears as an X [...] "server" [...] (i.e., it displays client windows), and to remote VNC users it is a VNC server. Applications can display themselves on Xvnc {{as if it were a}} normal X display, but they will appear on any connected VNC viewers rather than on a <b>physical</b> <b>screen.</b> Alternatively a machine (which may be a workstation or a network server) with screen, keyboard, and mouse can be set up to boot and run the VNC server as a service or daemon, then the screen, keyboard, and mouse can be removed and the machine stored in an out-of-the way location.|$|E
5000|$|The hosting of RPA {{services}} also aligns {{with the}} metaphor of a software robot, with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation, much like a human worker. The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations. Normally all of these actions {{take place in a}} virtual environment and not on screen; the robot does not need a <b>physical</b> <b>screen</b> to operate, rather it interprets the screen display electronically. The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of virtualization technology, without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs. The implementation of RPA in business enterprises has shown dramatic cost savings when compared to traditional non-RPA solutions.http://www.kpmg-institutes.com/content/dam/kpmg/sharedservicesoutsourcinginstitute/pdf/2015/robotics-improve-legacy-sourcing.pdf ...|$|E

50|$|Not {{everyone}} has the physical and mental capacity to dive safely. Professional diving can be physically demanding work, and some diving tasks require considerable strength and stamina, and a sufficient reserve of physical and psychological strength to cope with unexpected situations.The requirements for recreational diving may be less rigorous, but any diver, whether professional or recreational, should have some minimum capabilities in order to dive safely. <b>Physical</b> <b>screening</b> standards which take into account anticipated work demands are commonly used by commercial and military divers, and detailed lists of physical contraindications to diving have been published. These standards can vary widely, but the need for <b>physical</b> <b>screening</b> is generally accepted.|$|R
50|$|In 3D {{computer}} graphics, {{the image}} plane is that {{plane in the}} world which is identified with {{the plane of the}} monitor. It is also referred to as screen space. If one makes the analogy of taking a photograph to rendering a 3D image, the surface of the film is the image plane. In this case, the viewing transformation is a projection that maps the world onto the image plane. A rectangular region of this plane, called the viewing window or viewport, maps to the monitor. This establishes the mapping between pixels on the monitor and points (or rather, rays) in the 3D world. The plane is not usually an actual geometric object in a 3D scene, but instead is usually a collection of target coordinates or dimensions that are used during the rasterization process so the final output can be displayed as intended on the <b>physical</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} encountered {{in the field of}} computer graphics is to represent the real world continuous signal as a discrete set of points on the <b>physical</b> <b>screen.</b> It has been long known that hexagonal sampling grids have several benefits compared to rectangular grids. Peterson and Middleton investigated sampling and reconstruction of wave number limited M dimensional functions and {{came to the conclusion that}} the optimal sampling lattice, in general, is not hexagonal. Russell M. Mersereau developed hexagonal discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and hexagonal finite extent impulse response filters. He was able to show that for circularly bandlimited signals, hexagonal sampling is more efficient than rectangular sampling. Cramblitt and Allebach developed methods for designing optimal hexagonal time-sequential sampling patterns and discussed their merits relative to those designed for a rectangular sampling grid. One of the unique features of a hexagonal sampling grid is that its Fourier transform is still hexagonal. There is also an inverse relationship between the distance between successive rows and columns (assuming the samples are located at the centre of the hexagon). This inverse relationship plays a huge role in minimizing aliasing and maximizing the minimum sampling density.Quantization error is bound to be present when discretizing continuous real world signals. Experiments have been performed to determine which detector configuration will yield the least quantization error. Hexagonal spatial sampling was found to yield the least quantization error for a given resolution of the sensor.|$|E

50|$|Templin {{began writing}} {{at an early}} age and in about fourth grade wrote his first short story, an action-adventure about a dog that saved people from a fire. While in {{elementary}} school, Templin dreamed of becoming a novelist someday. After high school, he served in the US Navy, and during boot camp, he tried out for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training but failed the <b>Physical</b> <b>Screen</b> Test (PST). While assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet, he used his free time to write short stories and train for BUD/S and finally passed the PST. He joined BUD/S Class 143 and became friends with Howard E. Wasdin (who later became a SEAL Team Six sniper). During training, Templin was injured and rolled back to Class 144, where he completed Hell Week, became a rifle and pistol expert, conducted demolitions, and practiced small unit tactics. While training at San Clemente Island, he had a feeling that a career in the SEALs was not his destiny, and he withdrew from training.After the Navy, Templin volunteered to become a missionary and served for two years in Japan. Then he attended Brigham Young University-Hawaii, where he graduated magna cum laude. He returned to Japan and became a tenured professor at Meio University, where he lectured for fourteen years and also studied the martial art aikido. In 2011, he received his PhD in education from Trident University International. Templin continued to write but mostly in the academic genre.During a research trip, while in the LA International Airport, Templin picked up the book Blackhawk Down and noticed his friend Wasdin was involved in the Battle of Mogadishu. Because the book told little about the Navy SEALs’ involvement, Templin looked forward to someday buying Wasdin’s book.Because no book had been published about Wasdin and his involvement in the Battle of Mogadishu, when Templin connected with him on Facebook, they decided to co-author Wasdin’s biography, SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper. The book was scheduled for release in 2011. That same year, on May 2, Osama bin Laden was shot and killed by SEAL Team Six operators, resulting in much publicity for Templin, Wasdin, and the book.|$|E
40|$|Handheld {{projectors}} offer a {{new type}} of display modality, not tied to a <b>physical</b> <b>screen</b> or to a fixed projection area, yet providing a larger display than is available from a handheld device with fixed screen. This paper begins with a review of our prototype handheld projector, and describes our work on interaction using a cursor that can be tracked across the projection. The most immediate use for such a device is to support existing applications like web-browsing. We show examples of this type of application. But there is a broader question too- does a handheld projector support new types of application that are not available with a <b>physical</b> <b>screen</b> or a fixed projection? We describe two applications that illustrate how the combination of handheld projection plus interaction supports ways to interact with the physical world that are much more natural than via conventional displays. ...|$|E
