Objective. — To establish the cell-transfer technique as a viable option for isolating tumor cells from hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) –stained slides. Design. — <b>Molecular</b> <b>testing</b> was performed by using the cell-transfer technique on 97 archived H&E-stained slides {{from a variety of}} different tumors. Results were compared to the conventional method of <b>molecular</b> <b>testing.</b> Results. — Polymerase chain reaction–based <b>molecular</b> <b>testing</b> via the cell-transfer technique was successfully performed on 82 of 97 samples (85 %). This included 39 of 47 cases for EGFR, 10 of 11 cases for BRAF, and 33 of 39 cases for KRAS mutations. Eighty-one of 82 cell-transfer technique samples (99 %) showed agreement with previous standard method results, including 4 mutations and 35 wild-type alleles for EGFR, 4 mutations and 6 wild-type alleles for BRAF, and 11 mutations and 21 wild-type alleles for KRAS. There was only 1 discrepancy: a cell-transfer technique with a false-negative >KRAS result (wild type versus G 12 C).

40|$|Numerous cytologic {{techniques}} {{aimed at}} effectively acquiring patient material for <b>molecular</b> <b>testing</b> have been proposed. Such techniques are becoming ever {{more important in}} an age of personalized medicine. In this commentary, the authors explored some more commonly proposed techniques to aid in the <b>molecular</b> <b>testing</b> of cytologic specimens. These techniques include the use of cell blocks, direct cytologic smears, filter paper storage, frozen samples, and enriched cellular techniques such as ThinPrep and cytospin preparations. Direct‐smeared slides demonstrate excellent preservation of DNA, are easy to prepare, and are amenable to immediate adequacy {{at the time of the}} fine‐needle aspiration (FNA) procedure as well as effective subsequent tumor purity estimation. Cell block methods cannot be assessed at the time of FNA and often demonstrate insufficiency, whereas filter paper and frozen techniques do not allow for the direct assessment of the presence and purity of tumor cells in the sample.

Positive HPV status has been associated with increased response to treatment and improved prognosis in terms of recurrence-free and overall survival. In certain instances, diagnosis is performed through fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma, often demonstrating extensive tumor necrosis. We evaluated the effect of tumor necrosis on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) adequacy for HPV <b>molecular</b> <b>testing.</b> Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of the pathology files at our institution identified cases of {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC) diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) on which HPV DNA <b>molecular</b> <b>testing</b> was performed. The cases were classified according to percent tumor necrosis into three categories (70 % necrosis) and the percentage of cases with adequate HPV DNA for <b>molecular</b> <b>testing</b> in each of the categories was compared. When available, p 16 immunohistochemistry performed on the cases was compared with HPV status by <b>molecular</b> <b>testing.</b> Results: A total of 70 cases from 67 patients were included in the study. Adequate DNA for <b>molecular</b> HPV <b>testing</b> was obtained from samples of 47 cases (67 %) while samples from 23 cases (33 %) were inadequate for <b>molecular</b> <b>testing.</b> Of the adequate samples, 36 (77 %) were positive and 11 (23 %) were negative for high-risk HPV.

40|$|Abstract Background Honduras is a {{tropical}} country {{with more than}} 70 % of its population living {{at risk of being}} infected with either Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium falciparum. Laboratory diagnosis is a very important factor for adequate treatment and management of malaria. In Honduras, malaria is diagnosed by both, microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests and to date, no molecular methods have been implemented for routine diagnosis. However, since mixed infections, and asymptomatic and low-parasitaemic cases are difficult to detect by light microscopy alone, identifying appropriate molecular tools for diagnostic applications in Honduras deserves further study. The present study investigated the utility of different <b>molecular</b> <b>tests</b> for the diagnosis of malaria in Honduras. Methods A total of 138 blood samples collected as part of a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of chloroquine were used: 69 microscopically confirmed P. falciparum positive samples obtained on the day of enrolment and 69 follow-up samples obtained 28 [*]days after chloroquine treatment and shown to be malaria negative by microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of microscopy was compared to an 18 [*]s ribosomal RNA gene-based nested PCR, two single-PCR reactions designed to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections, one single-PCR to detect Plasmodium vivax infections, and one multiplex one-step PCR reaction to detect both parasite species. Results Of the 69 microscopically positive P. falciparum samples, 68 were confirmed to be P. falciparum -positive by two of the <b>molecular</b> <b>tests</b> used. The one sample not detected as P. falciparum by any of the <b>molecular</b> <b>tests</b> was shown to be P. vivax -positive by a reference <b>molecular</b> <b>test</b> indicating a misdiagnosis by microscopy. The reference <b>molecular</b> <b>test</b> detected five cases of P. vivax/P. falciparum mixed infections, which were not recognized by microscopy as mixed infections. Only two of these mixed infections were recognized by a multiplex test while a P. vivax -specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected three of them. In addition, one of the day 28 samples, previously determined to be malaria negative by microscopy, was shown to be P. vivax -positive by three of the <b>molecular</b> <b>tests</b> specific for this parasite.

40|$|Background: Chronic wounds affect {{millions}} of people and cost {{billions of dollars in}} the United States each year. These wounds harbor polymicrobial biofilm communities, which can be difficult to elucidate using culturing methods. Clinical molecular microbiological methods are increasingly being employed to investigate the microbiota of chronic infections, including wounds, as part of standard patient care. However, <b>molecular</b> <b>testing</b> is more sensitive than culturing, which results in markedly different results being reported to clinicians. This study compares the results of aerobic culturing and <b>molecular</b> <b>testing</b> (culture-free 16 S ribosomal DNA sequencing), and it examines the relative abundance score that is generated by the <b>molecular</b> <b>test</b> and the usefulness of the relative abundance score in predicting the likelihood that the same organism would be detected by culture. Methods: Parallel samples from 51 chronic wounds were studied using aerobic culturing and 16 S DNA sequencing for the identification of bacteria. Results: One hundred forty-five (145) unique genera were identified using molecular methods, and 68 of these genera were aerotolerant. Fourteen (14) unique genera were identified using aerobic culture methods. One-third (31 / 92) of the cultures were determined to be < 1 % of the relative abundance of the wound microbiota using <b>molecular</b> <b>testing.</b> At the genus level, <b>molecular</b> <b>testing</b> identified 85 % (78 / 92) of the bacteria that were identified by culture. Conversely, culturing detected 15. 7 % (78 / 497) of the aerotolerant bacteria and detected 54. 9 % of the collective aerotolerant relative abundance of the samples. Aerotolerant bacterial genera (and individual species including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis) with higher relative abundance scores {{were more likely to be}} detected by culture as demonstrated with regression modeling. Conclusion: Discordance between <b>molecular</b> and culture <b>testing</b> is often observed.
