40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for fast surface {{reconstruction}} from large noisy datasets. Given an unorganized 3 D point cloud, our algorithm recreates the underlying surface’s geometrical properties using data resampling and a robust triangulation algorithm in near realtime. For resulting smooth surfaces, the data is resampled with variable densities according to previously estimated surface curvatures. Incremental scans are easily incorporated into an existing surface mesh, by determining the respective overlapping area and reconstructing only the updated part of the surface mesh. The proposed framework is flexible enough to be integrated with additional <b>point</b> <b>label</b> information, where groups of points sharing the same label are clustered together and can be reconstructed separately, thus allowing fast updates via triangular mesh decoupling. To validate our approach, we present results obtained from laser scans acquired in both indoor and outdoor environments. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper extends on {{research}} by the authors together with Alexander Wol# on <b>point</b> <b>label</b> placement using a model where labels can be placed at any position that touches the point (the slider model). Such models {{have been shown to}} perform better than methods that allow only a fixed number of positions per label. The earlier research on slider models is extended here by also respecting other map features that must be avoided by the labels, and by incorporating labels with di#erent height. The result is an e#cient and simple O((n + m) log(n + m)) time algorithm with a performance guarantee for label placement in the slider model. Here n is the number of points to be labeled and m is the combinatorial complexity of the map features that must be avoided. Due to its e#ciency, the algorithm can be used in interactive and on-line mapping. 1 Introduction The automated map labeling problem is a well-known problem for many years for cartographic and GIS researchers.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fast approach to automatic <b>point</b> <b>label</b> de-confliction on interactive maps. The general Map Labeling problem is NP-hard {{and has been}} the subject of much study for decades. Computerized maps have introduced interactive zooming and panning which has intensified the problem. Providing dynamic labels for such maps typically requires a timeconsuming pre-processing phase. In the realm of visual analytics, however, the labeling of interactive maps is further complicated by the use of massive datasets laid out in arbitrary configurations, thus rendering reliance on a pre-processing phase untenable. This paper offers a method for labeling point-features on dynamic maps in real time without pre-processing. The algorithm presented is efficient, scalable, and exceptionally fast; it can label interactive charts and diagrams at speeds of multiple frames per second on maps with tens of thousands of nodes. To accomplish this, the algorithm employs a novel geometric de-confliction approach, the "trellis strategy, " along with a unique label candidate cost analysis to determine the “least expensive” label configuration. The speed and scalability of this approach make it well-suited for visua...|$|E

40|$|The common {{statistical}} methods for supervised classification usually require {{a large amount}} of training data to achieve reasonable results, which is time consuming and inefficient. In many methods, only the features of each point are used, regardless of their spatial distribution within a certain neighborhood. This paper proposes a tensor-based sparse representation classification (TSRC) method for airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) points. To keep features arranged in their spatial arrangement, each LiDAR point is represented as a 4 th-order tensor. Then, TSRC is performed for point classification based on the 4 th-order tensors. Firstly, a structured and discriminative dictionary set is learned by using only a few training samples. Subsequently, for classifying a new point, the sparse tensor is calculated based on the tensor OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) algorithm. The test tensor data is approximated by sub-dictionary set and its corresponding subset of sparse tensor for each class. The <b>point</b> <b>label</b> is determined by the minimal reconstruction residuals. Experiments are carried out on eight real LiDAR point clouds whose result shows that objects can be distinguished by TSRC successfully. The overall accuracy of all the datasets is beyond 80 % by TSRC. TSRC also shows a good improvement on LiDAR points classification when compared with other common classifiers...|$|E

Briefly, blood samples were collected from three individuals both pre- and post-vaccination for seasonal influenza. Samples were collected for sequencing at time points - 8 days, - 2 days, - 1 hour, + 1 hour, + 1 day, + 3 days, + 7 days, + 14 days, + 21 days and + 28 days relative to injection with seasonal influenza vaccine. Library Preparation and Sequencing The original samples from Laserson and Vigneault et al, 2014 (1) were re-sequenced as described in Gupta et al, 2017 (2). Briefly, sequencing libraries were prepared from mRNA using 5 'RACE with addition of 17 -nucleotide unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Amplification was performed using constant region primers specific to IGHA, IGHD, IGHE, IGHG, IGHM, IGKC and IGLC. Sequencing {{was conducted on the}} Illumina MiSeq platform using the 600 cycle kit with 325 cycles for read 1 and 275 cycles for read 2. A 10 % PhiX spike-in was added for sequencing. Data Processing Sequences were processed using the pRESTO (3) and Change-O (4) toolkits as described in Gupta et al, 2017 (2). Note, the provided data has been filtered significantly, including the removal of sequences that fail V(D) J alignment and the exclusion of non-functional sequences. Format Processed sequences are provided in FASTA format annotated using the pRESTO scheme. Annotations included are as follows: 	CONSCOUNT: Raw read count from which UMI consensus sequences were generated, summed over all UMIs for the given unique sequence.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the point-feature cartographic label placement problem (PFCLP) is to give more legibility to an automatic map creation, placing <b>point</b> <b>labels</b> in clear positions.

A conflict graph is initially defined and a mathematical formulation of binary integer linear programming is presented.
