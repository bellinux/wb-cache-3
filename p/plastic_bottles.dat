5|$|Waste {{management}} is handled by Angus Council. There is a kerbside recycling scheme {{that has been}} in operation since May 2004. Cans, glass, paper and <b>plastic</b> <b>bottles</b> are collected on a weekly basis. Compostable material and non-recyclable material are collected on alternate weeks. Roughly two thirds of non-recyclable material is sent to landfill at Angus Council's site at Lochhead, Forfar and the remainder sent for incineration (with energy recovery) outside the council area.|$|E
5|$|With {{contamination}} of the Excedrin at the source having been ruled out, investigators began to focus their investigation on the end-users of the product. The FBI began an investigation into possible product tampering having {{been the source of}} the poison. At the time, Excedrin was packaged in <b>plastic</b> <b>bottles</b> with the mouth of the bottle sealed with foil and the lid secured to the bottle with plastic wrap.|$|E
5|$|A {{recycling}} centre {{is located}} at Cairnie Loan. Items accepted include, steel and aluminium cans, cardboard, paper, electrical equipment, engine oil, fridges and freezers, garden waste, gas bottles, glass, liquid food and drinks cartons, <b>plastic</b> <b>bottles,</b> plastic carrier bags, rubble, scrap metal, shoes and handbags, spectacles, textiles, tin foil, wood and yellow pages. Angus council publishes details of where and how each product is processed. There are also glass banks at Timmergreens Shopping Centre, the Abbeygate Car Park, Morrisons Car Park and East Muirlands Road. The Angus Council area had a recycling rate of 34.7% in 2007/08.|$|E

Initially filling the bottle with water at 40 F, the testers compared changes in temperature using a regular <b>plastic</b> <b>bottle</b> as the control. After five hours, the <b>plastic</b> <b>bottle's</b> water temperature read 79 F while the S'well's water read 41 F. After twenty-four hours, the <b>plastic</b> <b>bottle's</b> water was at 84 F, the S'well's water at 65 F.|$|R

ReaLemon is packaged in <b>plastic</b> <b>bottles</b> {{that includes the}} shape and color of a lemon atop the bottle, and is packaged using a yellow-colored cap. ReaLime is packaged in the same bottle style that includes the shape and color of a lime atop the bottle, and is packaged with a green-colored cap.

ReaLemon is also packaged in single-serving packets.|$|E
5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using <b>plastic</b> <b>bottles</b> with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E
