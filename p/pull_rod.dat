In a report prepared by crash investigators, it was found that Wheldon's death was caused by an impact with the catch fencing around the circuit. Brian Barnhart further rejected claims that the banking had also contributed to the accident, stating that it created two ideal racing lines, and that these lines made the location of cars more predictable for other drivers; {{at the time of the}} accident, all 34 cars had been behaving as expected. The report also revealed that the right front <b>pull</b> <b>rod</b> of the suspension assembly penetrated Wheldon's survival cell, though it did not cause him any injury. The report recommended further investigation of this phenomenon, as it was the first recorded incident of its kind in nine years of the use of the IR03 and later IR05 model chassis, which was being retired at the end of the race. The pull-rod suspension chassis is not being utilised in the DW12.|$|E
2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front <b>pull</b> <b>rod</b> compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and <b>pull</b> <b>rod.</b> When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{horizontal}} boom of {{the tower}} crane in the rotary plane is a cantilever structure with large flexibility. Its stability analysis belongs to critical load problems under double non-conservative forces. In this paper, the second-order theory is used to establish the deflection differential equation in the rotary plane of the horizontal boom. According to the deformation compatibility conditions and the boundary conditions, the exact expression of the deflection equation and the instability characteristic equation in the rotary plane are obtained. The premise of the stability analysis {{is to determine the}} force relationship of the two <b>pulling</b> <b>rods</b> in the horizontal boom with double lifting points, which is a statically indeterminate structure. This paper is aimed at the structural characteristics and the load forms of the general boom. For the calculation of the <b>pulling</b> <b>rod</b> forces in the boom, the general expression is deduced considering the variety of the cross-section, the load and the position of lifting points. A highly efficient method for the stability analysis of the horizontal boom with double <b>pulling</b> <b>rods</b> is provided by the analytic expression of the instability characteristic equation and the internal forces in the statically indeterminate <b>pulling</b> <b>rods.</b> Fig. 1 Horizontal boom model with double lifting points of tower crane...|$|R

30|$|In this study, a {{new type}} of single-axle bogie of {{straddle-type}} monorail vehicle is designed. The tumbler structures are adopted in the vertical suspension system. One end of the tumbler is fixed to the framework, while the other end supports the framework via air springs. In addition, the lateral suspension utilizes the suspender way, with longitudinal force transmitted via single <b>pull</b> <b>rods.</b> Guide wheels and steady wheels are connected to the end support arms of the framework through spindles around the horizontal direction. Rubber springs, the pre-compressed magnitudes of which could be adjusted, are set between the spindles and support arms. The multi-body dynamics software UM is adopted to construct a dynamic model and simulate related dynamic performance. The results of the simulation indicate that this new kind of bogie has a favorable performance when passing through curves and has a greater riding stability. The flexibility factor equation of this new monorail vehicle is deduced, with its flexibility factor obtained.|$|R
50|$|Although most of Queensland's railway {{signalling}} {{is controlled}} by computers, the interlocking system at Charters Towers is still controlled from a McKenzie and Holland low-level duplex tappet signal frame, numbered 21, which was manufactured in Melbourne.

The current 20-lever signal frame manipulates the points and signals of the station. Warning bells sound as a train approaches the station, and staff set the required levers to guide a train through the station or into a siding. The levers operate the points either manually, by long metal <b>pull</b> <b>rods,</b> or by activating an electric motor to change the points, while the semaphore signals are controlled by wires connected to the signal frame.

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{deficiencies}} of conventional high voltage circuit breaker mechanical properties detection methods, a new algorithm based on image block matching with diamond search strategy is presented in this paper. The motion of auxiliary mark on the <b>pull</b> <b>rod</b> or shaft is firstly recorded by a high-speed and high-definition digital camera when the circuit breaker is open or close. Then the motion trajectory is acquired through diamond image block matching method. The mechanical parameters, such as travel and open and close velocity, are calculated according to the travel-time curve of the circuit breaker. Finally, evaluation model is constructed taking mechanical parameters characteristic values as inputs of ELM. Comparing to the existing techniques, our method is a noncontact measurement based on computer vision. It is easy and convenient for practical application since it need not any electrical and mechanical connection to the breaker. Another advantage of our method is that it can obtain the line and angle displacement simultaneously. The experiment results on the circuit breaker of 220 [*]kv show that our method is effective for breaker mechanical properties detection...|$|E
