25|$|A {{reflector}} {{made of a}} grill {{of parallel}} wires or bars oriented in one direction acts as a <b>polarizing</b> <b>filter</b> {{as well as a}} reflector. It only reflects linearly polarized radio waves, with the electric field parallel to the grill elements. This type is often used in radar antennas. Combined with a linearly polarized feed horn, it helps filter out noise in the receiver and reduces false returns.|$|E
25|$|Although now obsolete, CRT {{computer}} displays {{suffered from}} reflection {{by the glass}} envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of circularly polarized light. A circular <b>polarizing</b> <b>filter</b> {{in front of the}} screen allows for the transmission of (say) only right circularly polarized room light. Now, right circularly polarized light (depending on the convention used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same direction of rotation, but now propagation is in the −z direction making the reflected wave left circularly polarized. With the right circular polarization filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected from the glass will thus be in very polarization state that is blocked by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of circular polarization on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed circular polarization in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct circular polarization allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.|$|E

50|$|To present {{stereoscopic}} pictures, {{two images}} are projected superimposed onto the same screen through <b>polarizing</b> <b>filters</b> or presented on a display with <b>polarized</b> <b>filters.</b> For projection, a silver screen is used so that polarization is preserved. On most passive displays every other row of pixels are polarized for one eye or the other. This method {{is also known}} as being interlaced. The viewer wears low-cost eyeglasses which also contain a pair of opposite <b>polarizing</b> <b>filters.</b> As each filter only passes light which is similarly polarized and blocks the opposite polarized light, each eye only sees one of the images, and the effect is achieved.|$|R
2500|$|The four {{cameras are}} paired into groups of two. [...] Each pair focuses {{on one of}} the laser sheets {{in the same manner as}} single-plane {{stereoscopic}} PIV. [...] Each of the four cameras has a <b>polarizing</b> <b>filter</b> designed to only let pass the polarized scattered light from the respective planes of interest. [...] This essentially creates a system by which two separate stereoscopic PIV analysis setups are run simultaneously with only a minimal separation distance between the planes of interest.|$|E
2500|$|Light {{or other}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation from many sources, {{such as the}} sun, flames, and incandescent lamps, consists of short wave trains with an equal mixture of polarizations; this is called unpolarized light. [...] Polarized light can be produced by passing unpolarized light through a <b>polarizing</b> <b>filter,</b> which allows waves of only one polarization to pass through. [...] The most common optical materials (such as glass) are isotropic and do not affect the polarization of light passing through them; however, some materials—those that exhibit birefringence, dichroism, or optical activity—can change the polarization of light. [...] Some of these are used to make polarizing filters. [...] Light is also partially polarized when it reflects from a surface.|$|E
2500|$|The {{phenomenon}} of polarization arises when wave motion can occur simultaneously in two orthogonal directions. Transverse waves can be polarized, for instance. When polarization {{is used as}} a descriptor without qualification, it usually refers to the special, simple case of linear polarization. A transverse wave is linearly polarized if it oscillates in only one direction or plane. In the case of linear polarization, it is often useful to add the relative orientation of that plane, perpendicular to the direction of travel, in which the oscillation occurs, such as [...] "horizontal" [...] for instance, if the plane of polarization is parallel to the ground. Electromagnetic waves propagating in free space, for instance, are transverse; they can be polarized by the use of a <b>polarizing</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Polarizing</b> <b>filters</b> {{reduce the}} light passed {{through to the}} film or sensor by about one to three stops (2-8×) {{depending}} on how much of the light is <b>polarized</b> at the <b>filter</b> angle selected. Auto-exposure cameras will adjust for this by widening the aperture, lengthening the shutter, and/or increasing the ASA/ISO speed of the camera. <b>Polarizing</b> <b>filters</b> can be used deliberately to reduce available light and allow use of wider apertures to shorten depth of field for certain focus effects.|$|R

50|$|Circular polarizers, also {{referred}} to as circular <b>polarizing</b> <b>filters,</b> can be used to create circularly polarized light or alternatively to selectively absorb or pass clockwise and counter-clockwise circularly polarized light.They are used as <b>polarizing</b> <b>filters</b> in photography to reduce oblique reflections from non-metallic surfaces, and are the lenses of the 3D glasses worn for viewing some stereoscopic movies (notably, the RealD 3D variety), where the polarization of light is used to differentiate which image should be seen by the left and right eye.|$|R
2500|$|A Polaroid <b>polarizing</b> <b>filter</b> {{functions}} similarly on {{an atomic}} scale to the wire-grid polarizer. [...] It was originally made of microscopic herapathite crystals. [...] Its current H-sheet form {{is made from}} polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) plastic with an iodine doping. [...] Stretching of the sheet during manufacture causes the PVA chains to align in one particular direction. [...] Valence electrons from the iodine dopant are able to move linearly along the polymer chains, but not transverse to them. [...] So incident light polarized parallel to the chains is absorbed by the sheet; light polarized perpendicularly to the chains is transmitted. The durability and practicality of Polaroid makes it {{the most common type}} of polarizer in use, for example for sunglasses, photographic filters, and liquid crystal displays. It is also much cheaper than other types of polarizer.|$|E

5000|$|The MasterImage 3D MI-CLARITY3D {{system for}} cinemas is a {{polarized}} 3D {{system that is}} based on the projector presenting a spinning <b>polarized</b> <b>filter,</b> which contains alternating segments of circularly polarized material. Mounted in front of the projector lens, this filter is synchronized to the projected images, giving each frame a polarization perpendicular to the previous one, which can be viewed with polarized 3D glasses. The filter wheel can be lowered out of the lens' path for non-3D material. It has been noted that an earlier version of the spinning <b>polarized</b> <b>filter</b> malfunctioned, but the problem has been addressed with an updated replacement filter which was supplied to all theaters using the system. MasterImage 3D offers different types of 3D cinema technology (including those based on a <b>polarized</b> <b>filter</b> disc, as well as solid-state liquid crystal), based on different cinema configurations. The company also produces passive 3D eyewear that is optically matched to their 3D systems.|$|R

Circular <b>polarizing</b> <b>filters</b> cut out linearly polarized light and so can be used to darken skies or remove reflections, but the circular polarized light it passes does not impair through-the-lens systems.|$|R
