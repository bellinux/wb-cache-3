5|$|As the cyclone {{moved closer}} to Madagascar on April2, Radio Madagascar called for {{residents}} of Toamasina to take <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures.</b> At the time, forecasts predicted that Hudah would make landfall in northern Madagascar later that day.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} traversed the Central Atlantic, the United States Weather Bureau {{indicated that the}} storm {{would not be a}} threat to continental land masses due to its isolated position. However, ships in the storm's vicinity and to the northwest of {{the hurricane}} were advised caution. Other shipping lanes in the forecast path of the hurricane were also warned. After recurving in the direction of Bermuda, the British overseas colony was advised to begin prompt <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> against storm surge and strong winds, which were expected from the hurricane. Aircraft from the United States Air Force and Navy stationed in Bermuda were sent to airfields in the United States to avoid the hurricane, while a Navy task force of twelve ships including the escort carrier USS Mindoro (CVE-120) were dispatched from the island. The U.S. naval operating base moved boats from exposed areas into safer parts of the base. Similar <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> were undertaken by the British naval operating base.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{forecast}} that Odile would track westward {{and avoid}} land {{as it would}} curve out to sea. Accordingly, the local governments of southwestern Mexico initially posted minor weather alerts. <b>Precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> on the Baja California Peninsula began in earnest after Odile unexpectedly took a direct course towards the peninsula. Several municipalities {{declared a state of}} emergency, opening 164shelters with a total capacity of 30,000people. Due to the unanticipated threat of Odile, approximately 26,000foreign tourists were stranded on the peninsula at the time of landfall.|$|E
5|$|Then-Philippines {{president}} Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ordered for <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> to {{be undertaken}} by agencies under {{the purview of}} the National Disaster Coordinating Council(NDCC). In response, the German Foreign Office allocated €50,000 (US$67,000) to assist in preparations for Nanmadol. The Spanish Red Cross were forced to maintain relief supplies in the provinces of Aurora and Quezon in addition to managing ongoing relief efforts for regions impacted by Tropical Depression Winnie. Individual Red Cross chapters were tasked with closely monitoring the movement of relief stockpiles during these preparatory measures.|$|E
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E
50|$|The cost-loss model, {{also called}} the cost/loss model or the cost-loss {{decision}} model, is a model used {{to understand how the}} predicted probability of adverse events affects the decision of whether to take a costly <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure</b> to protect oneself against losses from that event. The threshold probability above which it makes sense to take the <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure</b> equals the ratio {{of the cost of the}} preventative measure to the loss averted, and this threshold is termed the cost/loss ratio or cost-loss ratio. The model is typically used in the context of using prediction about weather conditions to decide whether to take a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure</b> or not.|$|R

5|$|In an {{interview}} Lidle gave {{about a month}} earlier, he stated {{he had been a}} pilot for seven months and had flown about 95 solo hours. The crash garnered extra attention because of superficial similarities to the September 11 attacks in New York City, which had occurred five years and one month earlier. U.S. officials said that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George W. Bush was informed about the situation, but that these were <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> only. The FBI quickly announced {{there was no reason to}} suspect that the crash was an act of terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Warnings and {{advisories}} {{declared in}} response to the storm were widely distributed, and approximately 25,000 people in the area evacuated their homes. Officials completed various <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures.</b> Wind gusts along the coast reached up to , and high storm tides were recorded. The hurricane inflicted severe damage; destruction to property was worth an estimated $2 million, with an additional $5 million in damage to crops, notably rice and cotton. Overall, the cyclone killed four people. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a prelude to World War II. Heavy rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result. The inclement weather forced hundreds of military aircraft to move inland for shelter.|$|E
5|$|Widespread <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> {{took place}} across Hawaii as {{forecasts}} indicated {{the potential for}} a Hawaiian landfall as early as August2. Then-governor Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation into effect, and numerous government facilities were closed. Several airlines cancelled flights servicing the archipelago. Upon making landfall, Iselle brought torrential rainfall and caused strong winds which resulted in widespread power outages and downed trees. The storm caused heavy crop damage, estimated at $66million (2014USD), including 60% of the state's papaya that was lost. This was enough to be classified as an agriculture disaster, and was eventually declared a disaster by Federal Emergency Management Agency after initially being denied. The storm also killed one person on Kauai as a result of flooding.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not making}} {{landfall}} on the United States, the hurricane caused widespread damage. Extensive <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> were undertaken across the coast, particularly in New England. The heightened precautions were {{due in part}} to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior. Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey, where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall, peaking at 24in (610mm) in the town of Ewan. This would make the storm the wettest in state history. The resultant floods damaged infrastructure, mostly to road networks. Damage in the state amounted to $4million. Farther north in New England, strong winds were reported, though damage remained minimal. Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada, damage there too was minimal, and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves. Overall, the hurricane caused seven fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|As Kujira {{began to}} track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese {{government}} issued land- and sea-based warnings {{in advance of}} the storm. The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island. Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan, though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April22. This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone-related warnings in Taiwan since 1978. Impacts on the island were expected to be limited to rainfall, though the forecasted precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions. However, mudslides were also a potential impact from the typhoon. The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed a contingency plan for the typhoon and had also undertaken other <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures.</b> Airports on Orchid Island and Green Island were closed. The resultant rainfall from Kujira's outer rainbands would be some of the most significant for the island in several months.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Arthur's arrival, Nova Scotia Power prepared and collected resources {{in case of}} power outages and other impacts in the region. Numerous weekend events were called off throughout the Canadian Maritimes, including the Stan Rogers Folk Festival. Multiple boat-owners and fisherman took extra precautions by battening down hatches and tying extra lines to wharves to keep ships and boats from coming loose in the storm. Environment Canada officials issued high wind warnings in addition to earlier tropical storm warnings for the Maritimes and considered imposing rainfall warnings for western portions of Prince Edward Island as well. Province-managed parks in Nova Scotia, including beaches and camping grounds, were shut down prior to Arthur's arrival, and several airlines waived transfer fees. Officials in Moncton stated that city personnel {{would be prepared to}} respond to potential issues caused by Arthur, such as flooding or fallen trees, while the Canadian Red Cross readied volunteers in case of the need for emergency assistance. The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station took <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> against the storm, with Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission employees deployed to the site.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau {{first began}} cautioning areas of Central America at 1600UTC on September26, advising people {{in areas of}} {{northeast}} Nicaragua and Honduras to take <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures,</b> along with all vessels and small craft in the Gulf of Honduras south to Cabo Gracias a Dios. After Janet began accelerating towards the west-northwest, advisories warned areas in British Honduras and Quintana Roo of hurricane-related impacts. Though no official warnings were issued for areas of Central America, advisories published by the Weather Bureau cautioned interests in the hurricane's path up until landfall. Evacuations took place in several coastal towns in Quintana Roo upon notification of the oncoming storm. People were evacuated to inland hillside shelters. After the hurricane moved through the Yucatán Peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, the Weather Bureau alerted areas in the storm's path {{on the western side}} of Mexico's Gulf Coast. At the time, Janet was expected to make landfall between Veracruz and Tuxpan. Areas were warned of the storm's potential flooding and coastal impacts. The Weather Bureau advised all small craft south of Port O'Connor, Texas to remain in port. Notifications of Janet to potentially affected areas were stopped after the hurricane made landfall.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{was also}} expected to re-strengthen prior to its second landfall in Mexico, though the Weather Bureau also noted {{that there was a}} chance for the storm to affect Texas. Although the possibility never materialized, the agency expected rain bands and rough seas to affect southern Texas, and small watercraft were urged to remain in ports until the hurricane moved inland. On August 21, the cyclone was expected to move ashore between Nautla and Tuxpan, though it eventually made landfall further north near Tampico. Local officials expressed concerns about residents in huts and other vulnerable structures. In the Harlingen Valley region of southern Texas, <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> were taken and Red Cross divisions organized a meeting at the local city hall. City departments and facilities were ready for disposal if the cyclone moved closer to the area. The cyclone's rains were {{also expected to}} impact unpicked cotton plants in the region. In advance of the storm, a Coast Guard plane dropped messages from the air to several vessels, advising them to seek shelter. In Tampico, oil industries erected barriers to protect fields, and authorities planned to evacuate residents from the surrounding low-lying areas. Thousands of residents stayed in refugee centers on elevated ground.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached the United States East Coast on August 31, the United States Weather Bureau advised extreme caution to ships between Cape Hatteras and southern areas of New England. Storm warnings were issued for coastal regions between Wilmington, North Carolina and the Virginia Capes. These warnings were later extended northward to the Delaware Breakwater. Strong winds exceeding gale-force were expected {{for much of}} the East Coast, particularly for Cape Hatteras. On September1, hurricane warnings were ordered for areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Pamlico Sound, while previously issued storm warnings remained in place. On September2, gale warnings extended further north into Nantucket, Massachusetts. In Norfolk, Virginia, city department heads were ordered to stand by for potential emergency duties. United States Coast Guard personnel were also dispatched along the North Carolina coast. United States Navy personnel were detained in New London, Connecticut until the storm passed. In Westhampton, New York, a mass evacuation occurred, involving 10,000residences. Air traffic to and from Mitchel Air Force Base was cancelled, and 100airplanes stationed at the base were fastened to the ground. Police and firemen evacuated a 50mi (80km) stretch of the Rhode Island coastline. This included Roy Carpenter's Beach, where 1,000families were forced to evacuate. In Narragansett Bay, boats were sent back to harbors or towed to shore. The extensive <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> undertaken occurred in part due to fears that the storm would cause similar effects to a destructive hurricane which swept through areas of New England two years prior.|$|E
5|$|Rodrigues {{began to}} {{experience}} the effects of Amara on December20, when strong gusts caused by the tropical cyclone swept across the island. These initial winds uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, resulting in power outage. At the height of power outages, over 12,000households were without power, primarily in Port Sud-Est, Mount Lubin, and Rivière-Cocos. By the afternoon of December22, only 20%of homes had access to electricity. Some of the fallen trees rendered roads impassable. Heavy rains caused some creeks to overflow their banks, and riffles became impassable. The rainfall also caused extensive soil erosion. Amara also triggered a strong storm surge, resulting in coastal flooding. Despite the heavy rainfall, total precipitation amounts remained relatively low, peaking at 78mm (3.07in) in Citronelle. On December21, a wind gust of 152km/h (94mph) {{was reported in the}} locality of Pointe Canon, which was the highest wind measurement recorded in associated with Amara. Another station at Sir Gaëtan Duval Airport reported a similarly strong wind gust clocked at 135km/h (84mph). The strong winds tore metal sheets off of buildings and cut telecommunications between Rodrigues {{and the rest of the}} world. Despite the widespread <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> taken beforehand, Port Mathurin suffered marginal impacts. Following the storm, local police groups and the Special Mobile Force were mobilized in order to assist in relief efforts. Technicians from the Mauritius Central Electricity Board were dispatched to resolve power issues.|$|E
