Conventional harvesting methods {{are not only}} costly, but also affect any later downstream processes {{partly because of the}} metal ions contamination by flocculants. This work constructed an electro-flotation technique including two steps of flocculation by chitosan first and then sequential bubbling flotation by non-sacrificial graphite electrodes. Laboratory work has been carried out to investigate the influences of chitosan dosage, pH value, cell density of algal culture, stirring rate and mixing time on flocculation efficiency, and the voltage and current intensity imposed on electrodes and the space between electrodes on flotation efficiency. Moreover, a 1000 L <b>pilot</b> <b>bench</b> of electro-flotator constructed to harvest Chlorella sp. was tested. Around 90 % of total recovery efficiency and 50 times concentration rate have been reached, and only 23. 7 g chitosan and 0. 43 kWh of electricity are required to harvest 1 kg biomass. Above results proved electro-flotation by graphite electrodes assisted with chitosan is a safe and cost effective approach for microalgae harvesting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract: There {{has been}} a {{recurring}} interest in using Forward Osmosis (FO) process in water treatment and desalination. Despite the promising results from <b>pilot</b> and <b>bench</b> scale experiments the technology is still not commercialized yet. This {{is due to the}} complicated nature of the process which usually involves multiple stages of treatment in addition to the FO membrane process. Unfortunately, most of the recent studies were focused on studying the FO process alone and didn’t provide enough data about the actual cost of the process as whole which includes the osmotic agent regeneration stage/s. This issue resulted in some uncertainties about the total cost of the water treatment by the process. Furthermore, more data are required to evaluate the impact of the osmotic agent losses on the overall cost and efficiency. In case if the draw solution is regenerated by membrane treatment, a suitable membrane should be selected to ensure an optimal salt rejection. For power generation by Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) process, there was an evident progress. However, the process is site specific; i. e. it is dependent of the availability of the draw and donor solution. This suggested that the process is applicable to certain areas but can’t be generalized...|$|R

40|$|North Dakota lignite-fired {{power plants}} {{have shown a}} limited ability to control mercury {{emissions}} in currently installed electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), dry scrubbers, and wet scrubbers (1). This low level of control {{can be attributed to}} the high proportions of Hg{sup 0 } present in the flue gas. Speciation of Hg in flue gases analyzed as part of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) information collection request (ICR) for Hg data showed that Hg{sup 0 } ranged from 56 % to 96 % and oxidized mercury ranged from 4 % to 44 %. The Hg emitted from power plants firing North Dakota lignites ranged from 45 % to 91 % of the total Hg, with the emitted Hg being greater than 85 % elemental. The higher levels of oxidized mercury were only found in a fluidized-bed combustion system. Typically, the form of Hg in the pulverized and cyclone-fired units was dominated by Hg{sup 0 } at greater than 85 %, and the average amount of Hg{sup 0 } emitted from North Dakota power plants was 6. 7 lb/TBtu (1, 2). The overall objective of this Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) project is to develop and evaluate advanced and innovative concepts for controlling Hg emissions from North Dakota lignite-fired power plants by 50 %- 90 % at costs of one-half to three-fourths of current estimated costs.

40|$|Removing {{manganese}} while {{controlling the}} amount of disinfection byproducts formed in a drinking water plant and distribution system is a delicate balancing act. Currently the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule (Stage 2 DBPR), established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is designed to improve drinking water quality and provide additional public health protection from disinfection byproducts. Many drinking water systems {{will not be able}} to comply with the Stage 2 DBPR unless changes are made to their treatment and distribution systems [USEPA, 2007]. With compliance issues threatening, water treatment utilities across the nation are using or at least considering any means necessary to minimize disinfection byproducts. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania like many water utilities experiences elevated levels of iron and manganese in their drinking water. The most common and arguably the most effective means of removing iron and manganese is prefilter chlorination. Here, chlorine is introduced to water at the top of the filter and oxidizes the metals in solution to a solid state, after which, iron and manganese are removed on multimedia filters. The major water treatment utility concern was that prefilter water with elevated amounts of TOC (disinfection byproduct precursor) is being dosed with chlorine before the filters have a chance to remove the excessive organic matter. The least amount of organic matter combined with the lowest chlorine dose necessary for metals removal and disinfection should create the lowest concentration of trihalomethanes. The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) devised and completed <b>bench,</b> <b>pilot</b> and full plant-scale experiments testing alternative methods of manganese removal.

40|$|Anaerobic {{membrane}} bioreactors {{may provide}} a sustainable technological solution for digestion of waste activated sludge due to their capacity to achieve substantial volatile solids (VS) destruction and positive energy balances with reduced digester volumes. However, membrane integrated anaerobic systems may have limitations that are imposed by membrane fouling {{and a decrease in}} biomass activity due to possible exposure of biomass to high shear conditions. This study characterised bioprocess and membrane performance under varying conditions, identified foulant type and origin and mechanism of fouling, and developed fouling control strategies by using low cross flow velocity and pressure anaerobic membrane systems. The study employed a pilot scale anaerobic digester integrated with negative and neutral tubular membranes; <b>pilot</b> and <b>bench</b> scale control digesters supported with bench scale filtration unit parametric studies. The membranes were polyvinylidene difluoride based with an average pore size of 0. 02 micron and were operated at a constant cross flow velocity of 1 ms- 1 and constant trans-membrane pressure of 30 kPa. Four operating conditions consisting of different combinations of HRT and SRT were evaluated. By integrating membranes into the digesters it was possible to simultaneously enhance digestion and increase throughput of the digesters without affecting its performance. The anaerobic membrane digester showed 48 - 49 % volatile solids destruction at 30 days SRT under conventional and higher loadings of 1. 2 ± 0. 4 and 2. 1 ± 0. 6 kg COD m- 3 day- 1. This was a 100 % increase in performance compared to a control digester subjected to higher loading. This result was supported by the associated specific methane generation. The control digesters operated at a relatively higher SRT showed comparable VS destruction and gas generation to the anaerobic membrane running at a similar SRT. However the extra gas generated didn’t compensate heat required to maintain larger volume of the digester. In case of anaerobic membrane digesters due to the high rate feeding, increase biogas production and co-thickening, the energy balance increased by 144 and 200 % under conventional and higher loading conditions respectively. Characterization of membrane performance showed that the average sustainable flux was 23. 2 ± 0. 4 and 14. 8 ± 0. 4 LMH during HRT-SRTs of 15 - 30 and 7 - 15 days respectively. The critical fluxes were in the range of 30 - 40, 16 - 17 and 20 - 22 LM- 2 H- 1 during HRT-SRTs of 15 - 30, 7 - 30 and 7 - 15 days respectively. The decline in membrane performance at a higher loading was associated with the formation of cake layers on the membrane surface that led to reversible fouling. The additional decline in performance at extended SRT was attributed to irreversible fouling. The colloidal fraction of the sludge showed an overall higher fouling propensity during the long term pilot studies and short term filtration tests. The suspended solids fraction of the sludge showed a positive impact at concentration below 15 g/L but resulted in a decrease of membrane performance at higher concentrations. Further studies of foulant origin through a series of microscopic, membrane cleaning and sludge characterization studies showed that the colloidal proteins, soluble carbohydrates and inorganic materials such as iron, calcium and sulfur and their interaction to {{have a significant impact on}} membrane fouling. To control anaerobic membrane fouling by the digested sludge, integration of membrane relaxation techniques in the filtration cycle were found effective. By incorporating a unique relaxation technique to tubular membranes, it was possible to increase the sustainable flux to 29. 2 ± 1. 8 and 34. 5 ± 2. 5 LM- 2 H- 1 for neutral and negative membranes during 15 - 30 HRT-SRT process condition.

IBU, ADR, SMX, NP, E 1 and BPA had moderate to high removals (> 65 %) while CBZ and MEP remained recalcitrant in the three treatment process configurations. The removal of GEM was better in the NAS than in BNR and CAS treatment configurations. The YES assay analyses showed an improvement in estrogenicity removal in the BNR and NAS treatment configurations as compared to the CAS treatment configuration. Comparing the estrogenic responses from the three treatment configurations, the removal efficiencies followed the order of BNR = NAS > CAS and all were greater than 81 %. The removal of estrogenicity in a University of Cape Town- biological nutrient removal (UCT-BNR) wastewater treatment processes was investigated using <b>pilot</b> and <b>bench</b> scale systems, batch experiments and mathematical modeling. In the pilot BNR process, 96 ± 5 % of the estrogenicity exerted by the EDCs in the wastewater was removed by the treatment process. The degradation efficiencies in the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones of the pilot BNR bioreactor were 11 ± 9 %, 18 ± 2 % and 93 ± 10 % respectively. In order to further understand the performance of the BNR process in the removal of EDCs from wastewater, a bench scale BNR process was operated with synthetic wastewater dosed with E 1 and E 2. The removal of estrogenicity in the bench scale system (95 ± 5 %) was comparable to the pilot BNR process and the degradation efficiencies were estimated to be 8 ± 0. 8 %, 38 ± 4 % and 85 ± 22 % in the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones. A biotransformation model developed to predict the fate of E 1 and E 2 in batch tests using the sludge from the BNR process was calibrated using the data from the experiments. The biotransformation rate constants for the transformation of E 2 to E 1 were estimated as 71 ± 1. 5, 31 ± 3. 3 and 1 ± 0. 9 L. gCOD- 1 d- 1 for the aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic batch tests respectively while the corresponding biotransformation rate constants for the transformation of E 1 were estimated to be 7. 3 ± 1. 0, 3 ± 2. 0, and 0. 85 ± 0. 6 L. gCOD- 1 d- 1. A steady state mass balance model formulated to describe the interactions between E 2 and E 1 in BNR activated sludge reasonably described the fate of E 1 and E 2 in the BNR process. A combination of pilot scale biological nutrient removal (BNR) process, batch experiments and modeling exercises were employed to investigate the removal and biotransformation of trimethoprim (TMP) in a BNR activated sludge. The concentrations of the active microbial groups- ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ordinary heterotrophic organism (OHO) and polyphosphate accumulating organism (PAO) in the BNR bioreactor were estimated to be 40, 780 and 2710 g COD/m 3 respectively. TMP was biotransformed in all the redox zones of the BNR bioreactor. The TMP biotransformation efficiencies in the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic sections were 13 ± 12 %, 17 ± 10 % and 24 ± 4 % respectively. Batch tests with and without nitrification inhibition showed that AOB {{played a role in the}} biotransformation of TMP in BNR activated sludge. A pseudo first order model that incorporated the contributions of PAO, OHO and AOB to the overall biodegradation of TMP was found to describe the biodegradation of TMP in batch tests with and without nitrification inhibition. The estimated biotransformation rate constant with respect to PAO, OHO and AOB were 0. 32 ± 0. 06, 0. 58 ± 0. 06 and 13. 7 ± 0. 06 L/gCOD/d respectively. This model showed that PAOs, OHOs and AOBs contributed towards the biotransformation of TMP in BNR activated sludge with the trend AOBs = PAOs > OHOs...|$|R
40|$|Overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} technology platform for cleaning/conditioning the syngas from an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) system at elevated temperatures (500 - 1, 000 F) and gasifier pressures to meet the tolerance limits for contaminants, including H{sub 2 }S, COS, NH{sub 3 }, HCl, Hg, and As. This technology development effort involved progressive development and testing of sorbent/catalytic materials and associated processes through laboratory, <b>bench,</b> <b>pilot,</b> and demonstration testing phases, coupled with a comprehensive systems analysis at various stages of development. The development of the regenerable RTI- 3 desulfurization sorbent - a highly attrition-resistant, supported ZnO-based material - was the key discovery in this project. RTI- 3 's high attrition resistance, coupled with its high reactivity, effectively allowed its application in a high-velocity transport reactor system. Production of the RTI- 3 sorbent was successfully scaled up to an 8, 000 -lb batch by Sued-Chemie. In October 2005, RTI obtained U. S Patent 6, 951, 635 to protect the RTI- 3 sorbent technology and won the 2004 R&D 100 Award for development of this material. The RTI- 3 sorbent formed the basis {{for the development of the}} High-Temperature Desulfurization System (HTDS), a dual-loop transport reactor system for removing the reduced sulfur species from syngas. An 83 -foot-tall, pilot HTDS unit was constructed and commissioned first at ChevronTexaco's gasification site and later at Eastman's gasification plant. At Eastman, the HTDS technology was successfully operated with coal-derived syngas for a total of 3, 017 hrs over a 12 -month period and consistently reduced the sulfur level to < 10 ppmv. The sorbent attrition rate averaged {approx} 31 lb/MM lb of circulation. To complement the HTDS technology, which extracts the sulfur from syngas as SO{sub 2 }, RTI developed the Direct Sulfur Recovery Process (DSRP). The DSRP, operating at high pressure and high temperature, uses a small slipstream of syngas to catalytically reduce the SO{sub 2 } produced in the warm syngas desulfurization process to elemental sulfur. To demonstrate this process at Eastman, RTI constructed and commissioned a skid-mounted pilot DSRP unit. During its 117 -h operation, the DSRP system achieved 90 % to 98 % removal of the inlet sulfur. The DSRP catalyst proved very robust, demonstrating consistent reaction rates in multiple experiments over a 3 -year period. Sorbent materials for removing trace NH{sub 3 }, Hg, and As impurities from syngas at high temperature and high pressure were developed and tested with real syngas. A Li{sub 4 }SiO{sub 4 } sorbent for removal of CO{sub 2 } from syngas at high temperature was also developed and tested. The Li{sub 4 }SiO{sub 4 } material demonstrates excellent CO{sub 2 } removal, but its regeneration was found to be technically challenging. Additionally, reverse-selective polymer membrane materials were investigated for the bulk removal of CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }S from syngas. These materials exhibited adequate separation at ambient conditions for these acid gases. Field testing of these membrane modules with real syngas demonstrated potential use for acid-gas separation from syngas. The HTDS/DSRP technologies are estimated to have a significant economic advantage over conventional gas cleanup technologies such as Selexol{trademark} and Rectisol. From a number of system studies, use of HTDS/DSRP is expected to give a 2 - 3 percentage point increase in the overall IGCC thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in capital cost. Thus, there is significant economic incentive for adaptation of these warm gas cleanup technologies due to significantly increased thermal efficiency and reduction in capital and operating costs. RTI and Eastman are currently in discussions with a number of companies to commercialize this technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this study is {{concerned}} with setting up a reactive distillation process for production of tert-amyl-methyl ether (TAME). This work was linked to the development of etherification technology of Neste Oy. TAME production makes possible to upgrade some low value olefinic components to high value gasoline. Moreover, it has a significant impact in the reduction of the air pollution caused by the cars by introducing oxygen to the gasoline. However {{at the time of the}} study, there was no technology available for production of that component. Reactive distillation (RD) had been applied successfully to the production of the tert-butyl-methyl-ether (MTBE). Thus it seemed worth of trying to apply RD to TAME production as well. The actual work of setting up the process was accomplished using a simulation model of a reactive distillation column. Arrangement of the column and conditions of the experimental runs were determined with the model developed earlier by Aittamaa and Kettunen (1993). The pilot run was successful, so that ethers could be produced as planned and experiments verified with the existence of the operating regimes predicted by the model. The results of this study had a significant impact on the development of the highly successful NExTAME and NExETHERS technologies, even if the final solution was based on the Side Reactor Concept (SRC), i. e. a combination of a distillation column and a reactor connected to the column via side streams, rather than on RD. The second part is the development of a rate-based model of a reactive distillation column including the effects of incomplete lateral mixing on the trays. Most published tests with RD have been performed with small <b>pilot</b> or <b>bench</b> scale columns. In such columns vapour and liquid mixing is nearly complete. However, that is not the case in large industrial columns. On the other hand, making tests with reactive system in columns having diameter of two meter or more is very expensive and practically impossible for most research institutions. Not only the sheer size and utility consumption of such devices are large, but the feed and product volumes are huge even for a short run. With non-reacting systems it is often possible to recycle the products back to the feed, but when reaction takes place, that is much more difficult. If lateral mixing is suspected to have importance in some particular case, a mathematical model is probably the only viable way to estimate its significance before the full-scale plant is built. Two different models for the effects of the lateral concentration profiles on reactive distillation trays were developed. The first model is an eddy diffusion model, the other one is a mixed pool model of reactive distillation trays. The basic principles of both models are known already earlier but both include novel features. Similar models have not been applied earlier to the reactive distillation. The eddy diffusion equations are solved simultaneously and rigorously with the other equations of the equation group describing the column, instead of using solutions of strongly idealized problem as an approximation as has been usual with non-reactive distillation columns separating nearly ideal mixtures. The mixed pool model differs from the ones presented earlier with its ability to take different mixing cases of the vapour phase into account. The normal assumption has been that the vapour is fully mixed between the column trays. Here is presented a simple and efficient method for treating columns with unmixed vapour flow from tray to tray. Two types of the liquid flow are considered – liquid flow to same direction on adjacent trays or liquid flow to contrary directions on adjacent trays. In the third part a development of a combined model for SRC system is presented. When the SRC was found to be very useful in etherification processes, it was considered useful to develop a dedicated modelling tool for it. The part of the model describing the distillation column is in principle an equilibrium stage reactive distillation column model. The part of the model describing the side reactor(s) consists of a series of reactor segments. Each reactor segment is considered internally fully mixed, but using sufficient number of such segments in series, a plug flow reactor can be modelled with good accuracy. There is a significant flexibility in structure of the reactor sequence. The reactor system may operate in vapour or liquid phase or in co-current two-phase mode. Intercoolers or heat flows between surroundings and the reactor segments can be used. As examples of the application of this model a case study of comparing SRC and RD in the production of tert-amyl-methyl-ether (TAME) and diisobutene is presented. The study showed that SRC optimisation of the reaction conditions is of crucial importance to the performance of the process. The developed model was proofed to be an efficient tool for this purpose. The fourth part of this work was a part of development work of a novel tower packing by Sarvis Oy, The packing is continuously manufactured with the name HUFO. The results of the experimental work performed during the development project were used in order to develop an interfacial area correlation for a packed bed. This correlation attempts to take the structural detail of the packing into account by introducing the width of the surface elements of the packing type into the correlation. In most correlations the specific surface and nominal size of the packing have been used for this purpose. However, the development of random packings has gone towards more and more heavily perforated shapes. The actual width of the packing walls interacting with the fluids in a bed consisting of some modern packing of certain nominal size is very different from the nominal diameter. Thus various correlations based on different combinations of the specific surface and of the width of the packing surface elements were tried. The best fit between the correlation and the test results was achieved when only the width of the surface elements was used in the correlation. Another important result for practical chemical engineering is the observation that wettability of the plastic packing, known to be an important factor affecting the efficient interfacial area was greatly improved by the thin film of impurities deposited on the packing surface during the test program. The same thing may happen in industrial applications as well where impurities are common and run times long. Thus in many cases the efficiency correlations developed using brand new packings may be overly conservative. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the impact of solids retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT) {{and the addition of}} FeCl 3 on bioprocess and membrane performance of anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating authentic municipal wastewater. The impact of SRT (40 ~ 100 days) and HRT (8. 5 ~ 12. 5 hours) on bioprocess performance was assessed using one <b>pilot</b> and one <b>bench</b> scale AnMBRs. The results revealed superior permeate quality with respect to concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD) (< 40 mg/L) and 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) (< 10 mg/L) can be achieved in all tests. SRT and HRT did not significantly influence on the COD and BOD 5 removal efficiencies. Extended SRTs had reduced sludge production and enhanced methane production. Oversaturation of dissolved methane in permeate was assumed to be responsible for a consistent lack of mass balance closure in all tests. After calibration of biokinetic coefficients, PetWin 4 (EnviroSim Canada) was found to effectively simulate particulate COD, readily biodegradable COD and acetic acid concentrations over a range of SRTs and HRTs. The long term membrane performance was evaluated when pilot AnMBR operated with varied SRT (100 ~ 40 days) and recovery cleaning. The results revealed reduced SRTs had reduced the fouling propensity of mixed liquor characteristic in terms of TSS concentration and dewaterability as indicated by colloidal COD (cCOD) concentration and capillary suction time (CST). The effect of these parameters corresponded to the short term fouling (i. e. cake accumulation) that was tested by critical flux tests. The recovery cleaning obtained efficient fouling resistance removal on both pilot plant operation and clean water flux tests. However, the long-term fouling rate was observed significantly higher on cleaned membrane than virgin membrane and appeared to be higher after each recovery cleaning regardless the varied mixed liquor characteristics. The mitigated membrane fouling with virgin membrane suggested initial membrane condition might contributed to the lack of consistency between mixed liquor and fouling as the membrane properties might be modified by residual foulants. The study on long-term (90 days) impact of dosing FeCl 3 on the bioprocess performance and membrane performance was evaluated in the pilot AnMBR fed with non-Fe dosed sewage and fed with 26. 0 mgFeCl 3 /L to the sewage. The results showed the addition FeCl 3 enhanced the treatment performance of the pilot AnMBR regarding to the removal efficiencies of COD and BOD 5, but did not generate significant influence on the removal efficiencies of total Kjeldahl nitrogen(TKN) and total phosphorus(TP) and the methane yield. The membrane performance was significantly improved by dosing FeCl 3 which demonstrated by irreversible fouling lower than 5 kPa and no reversible fouling for the first 75 days. The superior membrane performance can be correlated to the shift of particle size distribution to the particulate fraction and the reduced colloidal and soluble substances in the sludge, especially the soluble protein, carbohydrate, Ca and S. The confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) tests showed with the addition of FeCl 3 a thicker foulant layer was developed and the deposition of protein and carbohydrate on the membrane surface was significantly prevented. Therefore a more porous foulant layer was formed and prevented the development of strongly-attached cake layer and pore blocking. The recovery cleaning study indicated FeCl 3 dosing enhanced the efficiency of current recovery cleaning protocol and the foulants formed in the Fe-dosed sludge was more of inorganic origin, as 75 % of the foulant resistance was removed by citric acid. The superior membrane performance during the operation combined with enhanced cleaning efficiency by FeCl 3 dosing would significantly improve the sustainability of AnMBR in municipal wastewater treatment. A transient study was conducted at pilot scale {{to assess the impact of}} Fe dosage on the dynamics of biological and membrane performance of the AnMBR. A transient model of the AnMBR system was employed to assist with interpretation of the measured responses in the mixed liquor under different FeCl 3 dosages. A high dosage (43 mg/L) of FeCl 3 resulted in a significant accumulation of fixed suspended solids (FSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) and reduction of colloidal COD in the mixed liquor. The elevated dosages appeared to reduce the biodegradability of VSS that was present in the raw wastewater. Intermediate dosages of FeCl 3 (21 - 12 mg/L), had less effect on these responses and did not appear to affect VSS biodegradation. Membrane performance was significantly affected by FeCl 3 dosage as indicated by reversible and irreversible resistances. Reversible resistance was closely related to the colloidal COD in the mixed liquor, thus responded quickly to Fe dosage. Irreversible resistance had a delayed response to changes in the colloidal COD concentrations in the mixed liquor and this was attributed to the effect of slow mass transfer of colloidal matter between the mixed liquor and the membrane...|$|R
