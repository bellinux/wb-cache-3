40|$|When {{cellulose}} <b>insulation</b> <b>paper</b> ages, {{its physical}} and chemical properties change, the paper loses its strength and becomes brittle. A study of the accelerated ageing of cellulosic <b>insulation</b> <b>paper</b> in <b>insulation</b> oil has been performed in the temperature range 129 – 166 °C under vacuum. The tensile strength of paper that has been subjected to accelerated ageing as well as of paper retrieved from a retired transformer were measured in the cross machine direction (CMD).

50|$|Since the 1965s, resin {{materials}} {{have been used}} for all types of bushing up to the highest voltages. The flexibility of using a castable form of insulation has replaced <b>paper</b> <b>insulation</b> in many product areas and dominates the existing insulated bushing market.|$|E
50|$|The use of resin (polymer, polymeric, composite) {{insulated}} bushings {{for high}} voltage applications is common, although most high-voltage bushings are usually made of resin impregnated <b>paper</b> <b>insulation</b> around the conductor with porcelain or polymer weather sheds, for the outdoor end and occasionally for the indoor end.|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>paper</b> <b>insulation</b> {{is later}} {{impregnated}} either with oil (historically), or more commonly today with resin.

40|$|Oil-impregnated <b>insulation</b> <b>paper</b> {{has been}} widely used in {{transformers}} because of its low cost and desirable physical and electrical properties. However, research to improve the insulation properties of oil-impregnated <b>insulation</b> <b>paper</b> is rarely found. In this paper, nano-TiO 2 was used {{to stick to the}} surface of cellulose which was used to make <b>insulation</b> <b>paper.</b> After oil-impregnated <b>insulation</b> <b>paper</b> reinforced by nano-TiO 2 was prepared, the tensile strength, breakdown strength, and dielectric properties of the oil-impregnated <b>insulation</b> <b>paper</b> were investigated to determine whether the modified paper had a better insulation performance. The results show that there were no major changes in tensile strength, and the value of the breakdown strength was greatly improved from 51. 13 [*]kV/mm to 61. 78 [*]kV/mm. Also, the values of the relative dielectric constant, the dielectric loss, and conductivity declined. The discussion reveals that nano-TiO 2 {{plays a major role in}} the phenomenon. Because of the existence of nano-TiO 2, the contact interface of cellulose and oil was changed, and a large number of shallow traps were produced.

50|$|As with <b>paper</b> <b>insulation,</b> {{the control}} of {{electric}} stress fields remains important. Resin insulation has greater dielectric strength than paper and requires less stress control at voltages below 25 kV. However, some compact and higher rated switchgear designs, have earthed materials closer to bushings {{than in the past}} and these designs may require stress control screens in resin bushings operating as low as 12 kV Fixing points are often integral with the main resin form, and present fewer problems to earthed materials than the metal flanges used on paper bushings. However, care must be observed in resin insulated bushings designs which use internally cast screens such that the benefit of electrical stress field control is not off set by increasing partial discharge caused by the difficulties of eliminating micro voids in the resin around the screens during the casting process. The need to eliminate voids in resin becomes more sensitive as voltages increases, and it is normal to revert to resin impregnated, foiled <b>paper</b> <b>insulation</b> for bushings rated over 72.5 kV.|$|E

At high dielectric strength, an insulation thickness of merely 0.1 mm may be reached.

50|$|Small {{dry-type}} and liquid-immersed transformers {{are often}} self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these. Large transformers {{are filled with}} transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings. Transformer oil is a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and <b>paper</b> <b>insulation</b> system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that {{the average age of}} failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures. Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure. With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information. This underlines the need to monitor, model, forecast and manage oil and winding conductor insulation temperature conditions under varying, possibly difficult, power loading conditions.|$|E

40|$|Oil-impregnated {{paper is}} widely used in power {{transmission}} equipment as a reliable insulation. However, copper sulphide deposition on oil-paper insulation can lead to insulation failures in power transformers. This paper presents the influences of copper sulfur corrosion and copper sulphide deposition on copper wires and oil-paper insulation in power transformers. Thermal aging tests of paper-wrapped copper wires and bare copper wires in insulating oil were carried out at 130 °C and 150 °C in laboratory. The corrosive characteristics of paper-wrapped copper wires and bare copper wires were analyzed. Dielectric properties of <b>insulation</b> <b>paper</b> and insulating oil were also analyzed {{at different stages of}} the thermal aging tests using a broadband dielectric spectrometer. Experiments and analysis results show that copper sulfide deposition on surfaces of copper wires and <b>insulation</b> <b>paper</b> changes the surface structures of copper wires and <b>insulation</b> <b>paper.</b> Copper sulfur corrosion changes the dielectric properties of oil-paper insulation, and the copper sulfide deposition greatly reduces the electrical breakdown strength of oil-paper insulation.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} {{of a power}} transformer and its capacity to be refurbished is often determined by {{the condition of the}} cellulose insulation materials used to wrap the copper windings.

Here we describe a study of the accelerated ageing of cellulose <b>insulation</b> <b>paper</b> and cotton linter under vacuum at 166 °C. The study indicates that the degradation results in a bimodal distribution in molecular weight of the cellulose, which indicates that the scission of bonds in the cellulose chains is non-random, and bonds near the middle of the chains have a higher probability of bond scission than those near the ends. This has been associated with the rod-like structure of the cellulose molecules...|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} causes for faulty cable insulation when considering solid dielectric or <b>paper</b> <b>insulation.</b> Hence, {{there are various}} test and measurement methods to prove fully functional cables or to detect faulty ones. While paper cables are primarily tested with DC insulation resistance tests the most common test for solid dielectric cable system is the partial discharge test.One needs to distinguish between cable testing and cable diagnosis.While cable testing methods result in a go/no go statement cable diagnosis methods allow judgement of the cable's current condition.With some tests it is even possible to locate {{the position of the}} defect in the insulation before failure. In some cases, Water trees can be detected by tan delta measurement. Interpretation of measurement results can in some cases yield the possibility to distinguish between new, strongly water treed cable. Unfortunately there are many other issues that can erroneously present themselves as high tangent delta {{and the vast majority of}} solid dielectric defects can not be detected with this method. Damages to the insulation and electrical treeing may be detected and located by partial discharge measurement. Data collected during the measurement procedure is compared to measurement values of the same cable gathered during the acceptance-test. This allows simple and quick classification of the dielectric condition of the tested cable. Just like with tangent delta, this method has many caveats but with good adherence to factory test standards, field results can be very reliable.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary winding}} has {{relatively}} few turns of heavy wire. The secondary winding consists {{of thousands of}} turns of smaller wire, insulated from the high voltage by enamel on the wires and layers of oiled <b>paper</b> <b>insulation.</b> The coil is usually inserted into a metal can or plastic case with insulated terminals for the high voltage and low voltage connections. When the contact breaker closes, it allows current from the battery to flow through the primary winding of the ignition coil. The current does not flow instantly because of the inductance of the coil. Current flowing in the coil produces a magnetic field in the core and in the air surrounding the core. The current must flow long enough to store enough energy {{in the field for}} the spark. Once the current has built up to its full level, the contact breaker opens. Since it has a capacitor connected across it, the primary winding and the capacitor form a tuned circuit, and as the stored energy oscillates between the inductor formed by the coil and the capacitor, the changing magnetic field in the core of the coil induces a much larger voltage in the secondary of the coil. More modern electronic ignition systems operate on exactly the same principle, but some rely on charging the capacitor to around 400 volts rather than charging the inductance of the coil. The timing of the opening of the contacts (or switching of the transistor) must be matched to the position of the piston in the cylinder so that the spark may be timed to ignite the air/fuel mixture to extract the most angular momentum possible. This is usually several degrees before the piston reaches top dead center. The contacts are driven off a shaft that is driven by the engine crankshaft, or, if electronic ignition is used, a sensor on the engine shaft controls the timing of the pulses.|$|E
