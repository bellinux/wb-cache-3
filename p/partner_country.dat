5|$|In 2013, {{the energy}} {{consumption}} was 240 billion kilowatt hours. As Turkey imported 72 {{percent of its}} energy in 2013, the government decided to invest in nuclear power to reduce imports. Three nuclear power stations are to be built by 2023. Turkey's first nuclear power plants are planned {{to be built in}} Mersin's Akkuyu district on the Mediterranean coast; in Sinop's İnceburun district on the Black Sea coast; and in Kırklareli's İğneada district on the Black Sea coast. Turkey has the fifth highest direct utilisation and capacity of geothermal power in the world. Turkey is a <b>partner</b> <b>country</b> of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of the Treasury has {{published}} model IGAs which follow two approaches. Under Model 1, financial {{institutions in the}} <b>partner</b> <b>country</b> report information about U.S. accounts to the tax authority of the <b>partner</b> <b>country.</b> That tax authority then provides {{the information to the}} United States. Model 1 comes in a reciprocal version (Model 1A), under which the United States will also share information about the partner country's taxpayers with the <b>partner</b> <b>country,</b> and a nonreciprocal version (Model 1B). Under Model 2, <b>partner</b> <b>country</b> financial institutions report directly to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the <b>partner</b> <b>country</b> agrees to lower any legal barriers to that reporting. Model 2 is available in two versions: 2A with no Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) or Double Tax Convention (DTC) required, and 2B for countries with a pre-existing TIEA or DTC. The agreements generally require parliamentary approval in the countries they are concluded with, but the United States is not pursuing ratification of this as a treaty.|$|E

The authors estimate a gravity equation including some of the main variables found in the reference literature useful to highlight the main factors which influence the bilateral exchanges. The results show that the variables traditionally included in the gravity equation present the expected sign. In particular, Italian agri-food exports towards its neighbouring Mediterranean countries are positively affected by income of <b>partner</b> <b>countries,</b> colonial and historical ties, geographical proximity and the lack of importance of the agricultural sector in some <b>partner</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Partnership for Peace (PfP) is a NATO-led {{program of}} {{practical}} bilateral cooperation between NATO and individual <b>Partner</b> <b>countries.</b> It allows <b>Partner</b> <b>countries</b> {{to build an}} individual relationship with NATO, choosing their own priorities for cooperation. Based on {{a commitment to the}} democratic principles that underpin NATO, the purpose of the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program is to increase stability, diminish threats to peace, and build strengthened security relationships between individual <b>Partner</b> <b>countries</b> and NATO, as well as among <b>Partner</b> <b>countries.</b> The PfP program was launched in 1994 at the Brussels Summit as a “stepping stone” to NATO membership for the former republics of the Soviet Union in central, eastern, and southeastern Europe. Since it was established, 12 former PfP member countries have become full NATO members: Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. During the NATO summit in Riga on November 29, 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia were invited to join PfP after which they joined PfP on December 14, 2006.

30|$|The {{country-specific}} {{analysis shows}} that imports from the TPP nations {{are likely to}} increase across the scenarios (2.1, 1.88 and 3.14 %) led by machinery and equipment and miscellaneous manufacturing from Japan and labour-intensive products such as textile and apparel products from Vietnam. However, the increase in imports will be affected to some extent due {{to a decline in}} imports from NAFTA countries. Similarly, Canada’s trade with new TPP partners would likely displace US and Mexican exports to Canada. As a result, Canada’s bilateral trade with existing <b>partner</b> <b>countries</b> is expected to decline under the TPP agreement. Net Canadian exports to the existing FTA <b>partner</b> <b>countries</b> would decline, e.g. to the USA and Mexico, while imports from these <b>partner</b> <b>countries</b> would also decline.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} that employed bilateral trading data {{in analyzing the}} impact of exchange rate volatility on real trading volume has yielded mixed results. Thus, {{it is possible that}} the effects are non-linear. This paper uses a threshold regression model proposed by Hansen (1999) to examine this impact on bilateral exports between the US and its top 13 trading partners. The estimated results illustrate that the threshold effects exist if the threshold variable is real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of <b>partner</b> <b>countries</b> relative to US GDP per capita. Exchange rate volatility reduces the exports from the US to relative high-income <b>partner</b> <b>countries</b> but increases exports from the US to relative low-income <b>partner</b> <b>countries.</b> exchange rate volatility, bilateral exports, threshold model, panel data,...|$|R
