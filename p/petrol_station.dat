5|$|A {{district}} {{post office}} {{was established in}} 1871 at the railway siding's station house. By 1908 the post office was run from the chapel house in {{the main part of}} the town, and a shop ran from the same building. This building was used for around 70 years as a store, telephone exchange, mail exchange and <b>petrol</b> <b>station.</b> The post office closed in 1977 and has not reopened.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Proliferation of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Maiduguri and Jere has now {{reached a}} level of unimaginable {{nightmare}} with perceived consequences on both {{human health and the}} environment. It is against this the paper evaluates the environmental effects of the <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in their neighbourhoods in Maiduguri and Jere. Specifically, it examined the presence of those <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> vis-a-vis residential houses within 100 m radius of location in the township; hazards associated with their activities/operation; and the perception of residents/petrol stations workers on the effects pose by those <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> Only purposed-built <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> both functional and non-functional as at 2010 were considered in the study. Out of the 138 <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in the study area, 122 (88. 41 %) were functional and 16 (11. 59 %) were non-functional. These <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> are spatially located unevenly across the major road network in the township. Data for the study were therefore obtained through field survey where the functional statuses of those <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> were recorded and GPS (Garmin 76 CSX) devise was equally used to determine their co-ordinates. Three household heads around each of the 35 sampled <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> were randomly sampled to provide information on the activities of the <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> that are either improving on the well-being of the residents or detrimental to their lives.

50|$|The first 7-Eleven in Australia {{opened on}} August 24, 1977, in the Melbourne suburb of Oakleigh. The {{majority}} of stores {{are located in}} metropolitan areas, particularly in central business district areas. Stores in suburban areas often operate as <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> and most are owned and operated as franchises, with a central administration. 7-Eleven bought Mobil's remaining Australian <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in 2010, converting them to 7-Eleven outlets, resulting in an immediate and unprecedented overnight major expansion of the brand. In South Australia all Mobil <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> were sold to Peregrine Corporation and branded as On The Run <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Watford Gap {{services}} are motorway services on the M1 motorway in Northamptonshire, England. They opened on 2 November 1959, {{the same day}} as the M1, making them the oldest motorway services in Britain.

5|$|Cheadle Hulme {{has a large}} {{variety of}} {{businesses}} serving the area. Station Road {{is home to the}} shopping precinct (built in 1962) and contains among other businesses an Oxfam shop, an Asda supermarket, a hairdressing salon, an optician, a pharmacy, some clothing retailers and several restaurants. There are more restaurants and cafés along Station Road as well as solicitors and building societies, and long-running family businesses such as Pimlott's butchers are also prominent. In 2002, a Tesco Express opened on the site of an old <b>petrol</b> <b>station,</b> and in July 2007 Cheadle Hulme became the home of Waitrose's first purpose-built retail outlet in northern England. Other retailers include a Wetherspoons pub, Homebird chic interiors store and Mountain Ski Services, a local ski and snowboard tuning service.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A general {{consensus}} generated from various news articles is that {{violence in the}} workplace {{is on the rise}} and that the workplace is no longer considered safe for many employees. Although some employees such as police officers and prison guards might encounter violence at work to some degree, more and more employees are experiencing the effects of public-initiated violence at work. They include petrol attendants working on the forecourts of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> Recently, Kole (2010) conducted research on the security measures to reduce workplace violence at <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Gauteng and highlighted issues and challenges that <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> face on a daily basis regarding workplace violence. Kole recommended several prevention strategies to reduce violent crimes at <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} add knowledge on this phenomenon by focusing on selected <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Johannesburg, to understand whether they experience similar issues and challenges regarding workplace violence and what strategies they use to prevent these issues and challenges. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five managers and fifteen petrol attendants working at these selected <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Johannesburg in 2015. These interviews focused on violent Type I and non-violent Type II workplace violence that occur at their <b>petrol</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

5|$|One of the town's largest {{employers}} is T & S Stores, {{a subsidiary}} of Tesco plc, whose depot in the town employs approximately 1,000 people. Brownhills was also formerly home to the wirings manufacturer Electrium's last UK-based factory, but this has closed, with manufacturing shifted overseas and commercial staff {{moved to a new}} site in Cannock. In 2006, the site was converted into a mixed-use facility dubbed Toll Point, with Walsall Council among those moving to the site. Many people are also employed at the town's large branch of Tesco which is open 24 hours a day on weekdays and is large enough to have its own <b>petrol</b> <b>station.</b> Before being taken over by Tesco, the store was a branch of Hillards, and an earlier Tesco store in the town had been forced to close as it could not compete with Hillards.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{was built on}} the site of derelict farm buildings. There were different designers for different parts of the service area, with Owen Williams as the coordinating architect. An ornate design for a footbridge by Clough Williams-Ellis was rejected in favour of a more functional and conservative modernist design by Owen Williams. When the services opened the new buildings were incomplete so the food was served from temporary sheds. The original plan had been for trucks to use this service station and for cars to use Newport Pagnell. In practice, however, both service areas were unrestricted. The first owners of the services were Blue Boar Limited, a family company that owned a nearby <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> on the A5. Although the official name has always been Watford Gap, the services were colloquially called Blue Boar for some time after opening.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the station}} was opened, the UERL {{established}} Morden station, the southernmost on the system, as the hub for numerous bus routes heading further into suburban south London and northern Surrey. These routes {{had a significant impact}} on the Southern Railway's main line operations in the area, with the SR estimating in 1928 that it had lost approximately four million passengers per year. The UERL though was able to demonstrate that its passenger numbers on its buses to Sutton station were actually more than double those for Morden. Across the road from the station, the UERL opened its own <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> and garage where commuters with cars could leave their vehicles during the day. The opening of the C and the Wimbledon to Sutton line led to rapid construction of suburban housing throughout the area. The population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed, increased from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E
5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley was {{surprised}} to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.|$|E
5|$|The journalists quickly {{decided they}} needed expert advice on {{ballistics}} and explosives, to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, GC, a retired British Army {{officer who had}} served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March, and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault {{on the day of the}} shootings, after which he walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members' most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities' stated reasons for the shootings. He explained to the journalists that, had Savage's white Renault contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs. Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between the scenes of the shootings and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of the shootings, including ricochet marks that the soldiers' bullets had left on the pumps at the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> where McCann and Farrell were shot.|$|E
