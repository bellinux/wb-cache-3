5000|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that active galactic nuclei {{are capable of}} converting dark matter into high energy protons. Yuri Pavlov and Andrey Grib at the Alexander Friedmann Laboratory for Theoretical Physics at St. Petersburg hypothesize that dark matter particles are about 15 times heavier than protons, {{and that they can}} decay into pairs of heavier virtual particles of a type that interacts with ordinary matter. Near an active galactic nucleus, one of these particles can fall into the black hole, while the other escapes, as described by the Penrose process. Some of those particles will collide with incoming particles; these are very high energy collisions which, according to Pavlov, can form ordinary visible protons with very high energy. Pavlov then claims that evidence of such processes are ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles. Ultra-high energy cosmic ray particles may also be produced by the decay of super-heavy dark matter [...] "X particles" [...] such as Holeums. Such very energetic decay products, carrying a fraction of the mass of the X particle, are believed to be a plausible explanation for the observed ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR). High energy cosmic ray particles traversing intergalactic space suffer the GZK cutoff above 1020 eV due to interactions with cosmic background radiation if the primary cosmic ray particles are protons or nuclei. The <b>Pierre</b> <b>Auger</b> <b>Project,</b> HiRes and Yakutsk Extensive Air Shower Array found the GZK cutoff, while Akeno-AGASA observed the events above the cutoff (11 events in the past 10 years). The result of the Akeno-AGASA experiment is smooth near the GZK cutoff energy. If one assumes that the Akeno-AGASA result is correct and consider its implication, a possible explanation for the AGASA data on GZK cutoff violation would be a shower caused by dark matter particles. A dark matter particle is not constrained by the GZK cutoff, since it interacts weakly with cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements by the <b>Pierre</b> <b>Auger</b> <b>Project</b> have found a correlation between the direction of high energy cosmic ray particles and the location of AGN.|$|E

The nature of the primary cosmic particles, the mechanism of the cosmic acceleration and their locations are totally unknown. The sources {{are assumed to be}} close to our Galaxy, otherwise these particles could not have maintained such high energies due to their interaction with the cosmic microwave background radiation.

50|$|When {{he moved}} to Chicago, he began {{a long series of}} {{experiments}} on particle production at high transverse momentum. With physicist Pierre Piroue and colleagues we learned about many things. These are summarized in Physical Review D, vol 19, page 764 (1977). Following these experiments Cronin took a sabbatical at CERN in 1982-83, where he performed an experiment to measure of the lifetime of the neutral pion (Physics Letters vol 158 B page 81 (1985). He then switched to the study of cosmic rays. The first was a series of measurements looking for point sources of cosmic rays. No sources were found. A summary of the measurements was published in Physical Review D vol 55 page 1714 (1997). In 1998 he joined the faculty at the University of Utah on a half-time basis to work on ultra-high-energy cosmic ray physics and to jumpstart the <b>Pierre</b> <b>Auger</b> Observatory <b>project.</b> His appointment was to last five years, but he left after a year to continue gathering international support for the Observatory with Alan Watson and Murat Boratav.|$|R

40|$|We study {{signatures}} of a structured universe in the multi-pole moments, auto-correlation function, and cluster statistics of ultra-high energy cosmic rays above $ 10 ** 19 eV. We compare scenarios where the sources are distributed homogeneously or {{according to the}} baryon density distribution obtained from a cosmological large scale structure simulation. The influence of extragalactic magnetic fields is studied by comparing the case of negligible fields with fields expected to be produced along large scale shocks with a maximal strength consistent with observations. We confirm that strongly magnetized observers would predict considerable anisotropy on large scales, which is already in conflict with current data. In the best fit scenario only the sources are strongly magnetized, although deflection can still be considerable, of order 20 degrees up to 10 ** 20 eV, and a pronounced GZK cutoff is predicted.
