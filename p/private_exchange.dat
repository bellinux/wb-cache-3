500|$|There was no {{play on the}} {{following}} day, Sunday being a rest day, but on Monday morning, the exchange between Warner and Woodfull was reported in several Australian newspapers.

Fingleton later claimed that Sydney Sun reporter Claude Corbett had received the information from Bradman; for the rest of their lives, Fingleton and Bradman made claim and counter-claim that the other man was responsible for the leak.|$|E

50|$|While both <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> and {{benefits}} administration platforms leverage technology to simplify benefits {{and reduce the}} administrative burden on HR, <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> take a consumer-driven approach to benefits. A benefits administration platform simply allows a transition from paper enrollment to online enrollment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Private</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{and public}} exchanges, {{also known as}} public health {{insurance}} exchanges, both enable the purchase of benefits through an online marketplace. However, <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> are offered by employers for use by active and/or retired employees and include health insurance {{and other types of}} benefits. Public exchanges, on the other hand, were established under the Affordable Care Act to give individuals the opportunity to purchase health insurance, often with a government subsidy if eligible. <b>Private</b> <b>exchanges</b> are operated by private entities such as brokers, carriers and technology companies, while public exchanges are operated by individual states or the federal government or via a federal/state partnership. Finally, <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> typically offer varying degrees of decision support, or ways to guide employees through the benefits selection process, through education and system recommendations. <b>Private</b> <b>exchanges</b> may be accessed by employees throughout the year to review their benefits or make qualifying changes to their coverage, whereas public exchanges currently lack decision support and can only be accessed for Open Enrollment except {{in the case of a}} qualifying event.|$|R
50|$|A defined {{contribution}} {{strategy is}} common on <b>private</b> <b>exchanges,</b> allowing employers {{to control costs}} by setting a defined budget and then letting their employees shop for benefits. In addition, <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> provide meaningful choice through multiple benefit type and plan offerings along with decision support to guide employees through the shopping experience.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the war, the Abkhaz leadership arranged for the redeployment of a Russian airborne battalion from the Baltic states to Sukhumi. According to the Russian historian Svetlana Mikhailovna Chervonnaya, a number of Russian security servicemen also arrived in Abkhazia as [...] "tourists" [...] during that summer: [...] "The main load in the preparation of Abkhazian events was given to staff of the former KGB. Almost all of them got appointments in Abkhazia under cover of neutral establishments, which {{had nothing to do with}} their real activities. To distract attention, various ruses were resorted to, such as the <b>private</b> <b>exchange</b> of apartments, or the necessity of moving one’s place of work to Abkhazia due to a sudden deterioration of health." ...|$|E
2500|$|That Moniz {{began his}} {{experiments}} with leucotomy {{just three months}} after the congress has reinforced the apparent cause and effect relationship between the Fulton and Jacobsen's presentation and the Portuguese neurologist's resolve to operate on the frontal lobes. As the author of this account Fulton, who has sometimes been claimed as the father of lobotomy, was later able to record that the technique had its true origination in his laboratory. Endorsing this version of events, in 1949, the Harvard neurologist Stanley Cobb remarked during his presidential address to the American Neurological Association that, [...] "seldom in the history of medicine has a laboratory observation been so quickly and dramatically translated into a therapeutic procedure." [...] Fulton's report, penned ten years after the events described, is, however, without corroboration in the historical record and bears little resemblance to an earlier unpublished account he wrote of the congress. In this previous narrative he mentioned an incidental, <b>private</b> <b>exchange</b> with Moniz, but {{it is likely that the}} official version of their public conversation he promulgated is without foundation. In fact, Moniz stated that he had conceived of the operation some time before his journey to London in 1935, having told in confidence his junior colleague, the young neurosurgeon Pedro Almeida Lima, as early as 1933 of his psychosurgical idea. The traditional account exaggerates the importance of Fulton and Jacobsen to Moniz's decision to initiate frontal lobe surgery, and omits the fact that a detailed body of neurological research that emerged at this time suggested to Moniz and other neurologists and neurosurgeons that surgery on this part of the brain might yield significant personality changes in the mentally ill.|$|E
