5|$|The abdomen has six segments, {{the first}} five of which bear pleopods, {{although}} these may be absent or vestigial in females. The fourth <b>pleopod</b> is longer than the others in males and has a specialized reproductory function.|$|E
5|$|In most species, {{the sexes}} are {{separate}} {{and there is}} little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between the sexes. Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are sessile and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second <b>pleopod</b> which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special receptacle, a swelling on the oviduct close to the gonopore. Fertilisation only takes place when the eggs are shed soon after a moult, at which time a connection is established between the semen receptacle and the oviduct.|$|E
5|$|The woodlice, {{suborder}} Oniscidea, are {{the most}} successful group of terrestrial crustaceans and show various adaptations for life on land. They are subject to evaporation, especially from their ventral area, and as {{they do not have}} a waxy cuticle, they need to conserve water, often living in a humid environment and sheltering under stones, bark, debris or leaf litter. Desert species are usually nocturnal, spending the day in an underground burrow and emerging at night. Moisture is obtained through food sources or by drinking, and some species can form their paired uropodal appendages into a tube and funnel water from dewdrops onto their pleopods. In many taxa, the respiratory structures on the endopods are internal, with a spiracle and pseudotrachaea, which resemble lungs. In others, the endopod is folded inside the adjoining exopod (outer branch of the <b>pleopod).</b> Both these arrangements help to prevent evaporation from the respiratory surfaces.|$|E

500|$|Mature {{specimens}} of J.lagostoma are typically [...] wide across the carapace on Ascension Island; individuals from [...] are somewhat smaller. In the family Gecarcinidae, species are normally separated by {{the form of}} the first <b>pleopod</b> (gonopod), which is used by males during mating, but there is no difference in the gonopod between J.lagostoma and J.planata. Instead, J.lagostoma differs from other species in the genus by {{the form of the}} third maxilliped; it has a fissure which is a narrow slit, but which gapes open in other species. The third maxilliped is also larger, covering the epistome and the antennules in J.lagostoma but not in other species.|$|E

25|$|The pleon {{is made up}} of six somites, each {{bearing a}} pair of <b>pleopods,</b> and {{terminating}} in a telson. The first somite is narrower than the succeeding somites, and the last pair of <b>pleopods</b> are modified into uropods, which flank the telson. The pleon is usually curled under the thorax, such that only the first three somites are visible from above. The form of the <b>pleopods</b> varies between the sexes. In females, the first one or two pairs are missing, while the remaining pairs are uniramous, and have long setae, to which the eggs can be attached. In males, the first two pairs are formed into gonopods, and are used to transfer the spermatophore to the female during mating; the first pair is often missing. The remaining <b>pleopods</b> can be {{similar to those of the}} females, or reduced in size, or entirely absent. In both sexes, the uropods are biramous.|$|R

50|$|U. sheltoni {{closely resembles}} Munna lundae from {{southern}} Chile, but differs {{in having a}} relatively broader pereon and pleotelson. Differences also exist in the spination {{and shape of the}} apex of the male first <b>pleopod,</b> the relative lengths of the antennular segments, and the shape and spination of the pereiopods. The colour pattern, especially the distinctive cruciform pigmentation of the pleotelson, makes this species easily recognisable.|$|E
40|$|The colour of {{commercial}} cooked black tiger prawns (Penaeus monodon) {{is a key}} quality requirement to ensure product is not rejected in wholesale markets. The colour, due to the carotenoid astaxanthin, can be impacted by frozen storage, but changes in colour or astaxanthin profile, during frozen storage, have not been studied in detail. Subsequently in this study, the aims were to define the astaxanthin (as cis, trans, mono-ester and di-ester forms) content, together with the colour properties, in both <b>pleopods</b> (legs) and abdominal segments. Changes in astaxanthin content and colour properties were further determined during frozen storage (− 20 °C). Total astaxanthin content was seen to decrease in all samples over time, with the rate of degradation being significantly greater (P <  0. 05) in <b>pleopods</b> than abdomen. In both <b>pleopods</b> and abdomen, rate of degradation of esterified forms was significantly greater (P <  0. 05) than non-esterified forms. Hue angle (increase), a* value (decrease) and L value (increase) were all seen to significantly change (P <  0. 05) during storage, with changes being more prevalent in the <b>pleopods.</b> The <b>pleopods</b> are the key indicator of astaxanthin and colour loss in cooked black tiger prawns and preservation strategies are required to preserve astaxanthin and colour during frozen storage...|$|R

50|$|Coleusia is a genus of Indo-Pacific pebble crabs of {{the family}} Leucosiidae. The six species {{currently}} recognised were formerly classed {{as members of the}} genus Leucosia but were separated into Coleusia in 2006 based on the fusing of segments 3-5 on the abdomens of the males and the three times axial coiling of the shaft of the first <b>pleopod</b> which bears a tufted lobe on its distal portion and has an elongated apical process.|$|E
50|$|Asellota is a {{suborder}} of isopod crustaceans {{found in}} marine and freshwater environments. Roughly one-quarter of all marine isopods belong to this suborder. Members of this suborder are readily distinguished from other isopods by their complex copulatory apparatus. Other characteristics include six-jointed antennal peduncle, the styliform uropods (a character shared {{with some other}} isopod groups), the fusion of pleonites 5, 4 and sometimes 3 to the pleotelson, and absence of the first <b>pleopod</b> in females.|$|E
50|$|There are 23 species {{classified}} into 8 subgenera. Body length ranges from 1 to 4 cm. The largest species, like P. eurylepis, P. inflata, are {{found only in}} the Caspian Sea.

5|$|One {{or more of}} the {{abdominal}} segments, starting with the sixth segment, is fused to the telson (terminal section) to form a rigid pleotelson. The first five abdominal segments each bear a pair of biramous (branching in two) <b>pleopods</b> (lamellar structures which serve the function of gas exchange, and in aquatic species serve as gills and propulsion), and the last segment bears a pair of biramous uropods (posterior limbs). In males, the second pair of <b>pleopods,</b> and sometimes also the first, are modified for use in transferring sperm. The endopods (inner branches of the <b>pleopods)</b> are modified into structures with thin, permeable cuticles (flexible outer coverings) which act as gills for gas exchange.

50|$|Reef {{lobsters}} are {{distinguished from}} clawed lobsters (family Nephropidae) by having full chelae (claws) {{only on the}} first pair of pereiopods, {{the second and third}} pairs being only subchelate (where the last segment of the appendage can press against a short projection from the penultimate one). Clawed lobsters have full claws on the first three pereiopods. Males, unlike those of nephropoid lobsters, have an extra lobe on the second <b>pleopod,</b> which is assumed to have some function in reproduction. Reef lobsters have a shallow cervical groove while clawed lobsters have a deep cervical groove.|$|E
50|$|Males {{and females}} {{differ in the}} form of the antennae, and also by the {{presence}} in males of the eighth thoracic appendage, albeit in a reduced form. This is the site of the male gonopore (the female's gonopore is on the sixth thoracic appendage). The first <b>pleopod</b> of the female is greatly enlarged and almost encloses the enlarged carapace. This is assumed to be a chamber in which the eggs are fertilised and retained until hatching. The more streamlined carapace and pleopods of the male make it more hydrodynamic, and so fewer males are caught than females.|$|E
