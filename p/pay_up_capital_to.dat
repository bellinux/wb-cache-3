50|$|A subject-to {{transaction}} is {{a creative}} finance technique where a buyer {{is able to}} take title to property without obtaining a loan in the traditional manner. The transaction usually involves the seller of the property leaving his or her existing financing in place. This process is similar to assuming a loan, but differs because it usually takes place {{without the consent of}} the original lending institution and violates the terms of the loan. This technique is useful because it affords the buyer the ability to obtain financing without the need for transaction costs and does not tie <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> obtain a new loan. The technique also allows the buyer to purchase property quickly without going through the arduous loan origination process.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of central}} disk storage also makes more {{efficient}} use of disk storage. This can cut storage costs, freeing <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> invest in more reliable, modern storage technologies, such as RAID arrays which support redundant operation, and storage area networks which allow hot-adding of storage without any interruption. Further, it means that losses of disk drives to mechanical or electrical failure—which are statistically highly probable events over a timeframe of years, {{with a large number}} of disks involved—are often both less likely to happen (because there are typically fewer disk drives that can fail) and less likely to cause interruption (because they would likely be part of RAID arrays). This also means that the nodes themselves are less likely to have hardware failures than fat clients.|$|R

Turner was concerned in a coal mine at Thatto Heath near St Helens and persuaded his partners to build a furnace at Sutton (there). They also built a forge at Acton Bridge and intended to (but perhaps did not) build another at Dean Mill in Haydock. Baylies moved to Marton near the works. The original capital of £5000 was doubled when the second furnace was planned. Baylies had difficulty in <b>paying</b> <b>up</b> the <b>capital</b> of his share, now reduced to one-sixth, because it was still {{tied up in the}} stock at Coalbrookdale.

Haltom {{noticed that the}} time to start and stop a conventional large monorail train, {{like those of the}} Wuppertal Schwebebahn, meant that a single line could only support between 20 and 40 vehicles an hour. In order to get reasonable passenger movements on such a system, the trains had to be large enough to carry hundreds of passengers (see headway for a general discussion).

50|$|The {{money to}} launch The Irish Press {{was raised in}} the United States during the Irish War of Independence by a bond drive to finance the First Dail. The amount raised was $5 million ($55 million {{adjusted}} for inflation as of 2011). However, 60 percent of this money was left in various banks in New York. Nobody has been able to explain why Éamon de Valera ordered the bulk of the money to be left in New York when he returned to Ireland in late 1920. In 1927, as a result of legal action between the Irish Free State government and de Valera, a court in New York ordered that the bond holders be paid back outstanding money due to them. However de Valera's legal team had anticipated the ruling and had prepared for the outcome. A number of circulars were sent to the bond holders asking them to sign over their holdings to de Valera. The bond holders were paid 58 cents to the dollar. This money was then used as start <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> launch The Irish Press. Following the 1933 Irish General Election de Valera used his Dáil majority to pass a measure allowing the bond holders to be paid the remaining 42 percent of the money still owed.|$|R
