[...] Although Cambodia resumed diplomatic relations with a number of nations, the new government informed the UN General Assembly on October 6, 1975, that it was neutral and economically self-sufficient and would not ask for aid from any country. On September 9, however, the Chinese ambassador arrived in Cambodia, and there were soon reports that China was providing aid to the Khmer Rouge. Estimates of the number of Chinese experts in Cambodia after that time ranged from 500 to 2,000. The <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-reliance</b> also meant that the government organized the entire population into forced-labor groups to work in paddies and on other land to help the country reach its goal of food self-sufficiency.|$|E

From then until 1988 the proportion fluctuated between 29% and 36%.

Households with insufficient labor or little inclination to farm were able to transfer land contracts to familiesthat were interested in cultivation and animal husbandry. Rural workers were permitted to shift from crop cultivation to commercial, service, construction, and industrial activities in rural townships. Capital in rural areas was permitted to move across administrative boundaries, and individuals invested not only in their own farm production but also in business ventures outside their own villages.|$|E

China was angered {{at the lack of}} Soviet assistance against India for supporting Tibetan uprisings in 1959 and granting asylum to the Dalai Lama. The Soviet Union later refused support for China in the Sino-Indian War of 1962. Khrushchev viewed the Sino-Soviet relationship to be one-sided on Soviet assistance toward Chinese military capacities and was unnerved at Mao's relatively nonchalant view on nuclear war. The Soviet Union was also engaged in test ban negotiations with the United States in 1959 in order to relax Soviet-American tensions, directly inhibiting the delivery of a prototype to China. Broader disagreements between Russian and Chinese communist ideologies escalated mutual criticism. Russia responded by withdrawing the delivery of a prototype bomb and over 1,400 Russian advisers and technicians involved in 200 scientific projects in China meant to foster cooperation between the two countries. Project 596 was named after the month of June 1959 in which it was initiated as an independent nuclear project, immediately after Nikita Khrushchev decided to stop helping the Chinese with their nuclear program on June 20, 1959 and Mao shifted toward an overhaul <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-reliance.</b> By January 14, 1964, enough fissionable U-235 had been successfully enriched from the Lanzhou plant.

These goals, {{conceived}} in 1980, were to be fulfilled {{by the end of}} the decade. The fact that these targets were rolled over to the end of the Third Seven-Year Plan is another indication of the disappointing economic performance during the Second Seven-Year Plan. The three <b>policy</b> goals <b>of</b> <b>self-reliance,</b> modernization, and scientification were repeated. Economic growth was set at 7.9% annually, lower than the previous plan. Although achieving the ten major goals of the 1980s was the main thrust of the Third Seven-Year Plan, some substantial changes have been made in specific quantitative targets. For example, the target for the annual output of steel was reduced by a third: from 15 million tons to 10 million tons. The output targets of cement and non-ferrous metals — two major export items — have been increased significantly. The June 1989 introduction of the Three-Year Plan for Light Industry as part of the Third Seven-Year Plan is intended to boost the standard of living by addressing consumer needs.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a comparative analysis of employment past age 65 in the UK and USA {{in the early}} 2000 s, using large-scale government surveys from both countries. In the USA we argue a 'policy logic' of 'self-reliance' was dominant, under which people were expected to time their retirement according to their financial needs. In the UK, on the other hand, a <b>policy</b> logic <b>of</b> 'paternalism' was evident, which assumed that individuals would retire at or before age 65. In the first empirical chapter we examine how demand for labour interacts with policy to shape the job opportunities open to people in their sixties. In the next two chapters we examine whether the poor in the USA {{were more likely to}} work past 65 than the poor in the UK, because <b>of</b> the dominant <b>policy</b> logic <b>of</b> <b>self-reliance</b> in the USA. First, we examine this with reference to marital status and gender, to see if female widows and divorcees, the poorest marital-status groups in both countries, were more likely to work past 65 in the USA than in the UK. Second, we examine the question in relation to wealth, rather than income, and incorporate the influences of health and education into the analysis - as low levels of health and education are likely to act as barriers to employment for the poorest. In the concluding chapter we argue that although moving towards a self-reliance policy logic in the UK would increase employment amongst those aged 65 and over, it would do less to benefit the poorest who have the greatest financial need to work, but are prevented from working by low qualifications and bad health.
