25|$|In 2006, GSA {{estimated}} {{the costs of}} renovating the Hoover Building at between $850 million to $1.1 billion. Additional problems also became apparent that same year. A piece of the concrete façade came loose and fell onto the sidewalk on busy Pennsylvania Avenue NW. A contractor was hired to remove loose concrete from the exterior. Construction netting was hung around the upper floors to prevent additional pieces of concrete from crashing to the ground. The {{total cost of the}} concrete removal and safety netting installation was $5.9 million. In 2007, an architectural design and <b>planning</b> <b>consultant</b> reported that the cost of these renovations and the disruption to FBI work and staff were not justifiable. The consultant recommended building a new FBI headquarters.|$|E

40|$|The divorce {{mediation}} {{field has}} recently seen {{the development of}} several “hybrid ” alternative dispute resolution approaches to child custody disputes. The “settlement-focused parenting plan consultation ” (SFPPC) {{is a form of}} evaluative mediation, conducted by a “parenting <b>plan</b> <b>consultant</b> ” (PPC), who possesses the combined expertise of a mediator and child custody evaluator. This hybrid model is a more expedient and considerably less expensive approach than a child custody evaluation, but preserves the hallmark mediation principle of self-determination.

40|$|This thesis hypothesizes {{that market}} {{dynamics}} obfuscate identification of optimal project delivery mechanisms. In particular, selection of primary <b>planning</b> <b>consultants</b> {{can benefit from}} a rational methodology. Market dynamics reflect changing characteristics of both owner organizations and the projects that they require. The construction industry adapts in response to market change, altering products and services {{in an attempt to}} satisfy precipitated demand. Resultant construction industry dynamics, however, outpace the market's ability to perceive industry changes, due to the market's limited involvement with the construction industry, both temporally and spectrally. Current practice includes a variety of options for planning, program management and project strategizing. This thesis reviews the current market of advice available; various professions are examined to elicit biases inherent in each, contrasting perceptions of the function of initial planning. A qualitative analysis provides insight into desired capabilities of initial <b>planning</b> <b>consultants</b> as...|$|R
