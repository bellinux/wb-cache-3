50|$|On April 13, 1996, The Mutiny were welcomed to Tampa {{with their}} inaugural {{game against the}} New England Revolution. The result was a 3-2 Mutiny victory. There were many stars on the team {{including}} Carlos Valderrama, Steve Ralston <b>and</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>machine</b> Roy Lassiter, who scored a record 26 goals in the season. The team was also coached by Thomas Rongen. As for the season, the Mutiny claimed {{the best record in}} the league at 20-12 and were the first winners of the Supporters' Shield. In the playoffs, they would be taken to a third game by the Columbus Crew before eliminating them. In the conference final, though, the Mutiny's remarkable season would come to an end as they were swept by eventual champions D.C. United.|$|R

5|$|Eleven Ottoman {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} forced to retire, suffering 28,443 casualties; some 12,000 prisoners were captured, 100 guns, <b>and</b> <b>scores</b> of <b>machine</b> guns were also captured. Now the Ottoman Army needed to deploy troops from other theatres to make up for these significant losses. On 15 December the Ottoman 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division arrived in Palestine and became the reserve of the XXII Corps before taking part in the counterattacks of 27 December. The 1st Infantry Division arrived from the Caucasus and moved to Nablus in reserve. A significant consequence of the Ottoman Empire's firm focus on the Levant was that the British recapture of Baghdad and the British offensive in Mesopotamia became more viable and secure.|$|R

In the hierarchical classification, a model learns to distinguish a second level category from all other categories that are within the same top level.

We use Naïve Bayes classifier which has been proved to be effective for web content classification, but has not been previously explored {{in the case of}} hierarchical classification. This paper analyses the feasibility of a web page classifier which exploits the hierarchical structure of categories and studies their recall, precision <b>and</b> F-measure <b>scores.</b> Keywords- <b>Machine</b> learning, web page classification, Naïve Bayes classifier, hierarchical structure I...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{pronunciation}} assessment {{has several}} difficulties. Adequacy in controlling the vocal organs is often estimated from the spectral envelopes of input utterances but the envelope patterns are also affected by other {{factors such as}} speaker iden-tity. Recently, a new method of speech representation was pro-posed where these non-linguistic variations are effectively re-moved through modeling only the contrastive aspects of speech features. This speech representation is called speech struc-ture. However, the often excessively high dimensionality of the speech structure can degrade the performance of structure-based pronunciation assessment. To deal with this problem, we integrate multilayer regression analysis with the structure-based assessment. The results show higher correlation between hu-man <b>and</b> <b>machine</b> <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> also show much higher robustness to speaker differences compared to widely used GOP-based analysis.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of {{the research}} reported on in this paper is to develop a system for automatic assessment of foreign speakers' pronunciation of Dutch. The {{aim of the}} experiment described here was to determine whether pronunciation ratings assigned by human experts could be predicted on the basis of scores calculated by an automatic speech recognizer. To this end 20 native and 60 non-native speakers of Dutch read ten phonetically rich sentences over the telephone. The automatic speech recognizer was trained with read speech of 4019 Dutch subjects with varying regional accents. The results show that the human scores can be accurately predicted, even in the case of telephone speech.

40|$|It {{is widely}} held that children’s {{linguistic}} input underdetermines the correct grammar, and that language learning {{must therefore be}} guided by innate linguistic constraints. Here, we show that a Bayesian model can learn a standard poverty-of-stimulus example, anaphoric one, from realistic input by relying on indirect evidence, without a linguistic constraint assumed to be necessary. Our demonstration does, however, assume other linguistic knowledge; thus, we reduce the problem of learning anaphoric one to that of learning this other knowledge. We discuss whether this other knowledge may itself be acquired without linguistic constraints. Stephani Foraker, Terry Regier, Naveen Khetarpal, Amy <b>Perfors</b> <b>and</b> Joshua Tenenbau...|$|R
