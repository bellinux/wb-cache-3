40|$|Spraying test were {{conducted}} twice before steel slabs {{were put into}} the furnace {{and the effects of}} the oxidation resistance coating were investigated and verified. By comparing the change of slab weight,rolling force of the roughing mill & finishing mill,thickness of oxide film on the surface slabs by an XL- 30 SEM and acid <b>pickling</b> <b>speed</b> of slabs with and without coating,it was found that the oxidization waste in the furnace decreased by 40 percent {{with the use of the}} coating and the corresponding yield capacity could increase by 0. 2 percent at least. Besides,the thickness of oxide scale film on hot rolled products was reduced by 1. 44 micrometers and the acid pickling time was shortened by 6 s with the coating technology,while the total rolling force of RM & FM did not changed. Furthermore,the application prospect of this technology was also discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{equipment}} wear and operator pressure, {{as well as to}} improve the production efficiency of combined continuous pickling line and tandem cold rolling mill units, four sections’ speeds should be automatically optimized to control the three loopers’ abundance, which include the entry loopers’ entry speed, <b>pickling</b> <b>speed,</b> trimming speed, and tandem cold rolling mill entry speed. According to the optimal speed principle, a new optimization algorithm was proposed based on objective function. In this work, Nelder–Mead simplex method is applied to find the optimal solution by minimizing the objective function. In addition, the calculation of four initial speeds is specified, especially the initial tandem cold rolling mill entry speed. The proposed speed optimization algorithm was successfully applied to a 1450 [*]mm continuous pickling line and tandem cold rolling mill. The acceleration and deceleration are smooth and steady when welding, trimming, or roll changing takes place in practice, the three loopers’ abundance are controlled in suitable range. Results show that the continuous pickling line unit could provide the material in maximum capacity to ensure that the tandem cold rolling mill unit’s production is efficient, and the rolling yield is greatly improved due to the {{decrease in the number of}} stops...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{hydrochloric}} acid pickling process which is widely applied in carbon steel <b>pickling</b> ensures high <b>speeds</b> with little pollution. In this research, {{hydrochloric acid}} pickling process was introduced into stainless steel pickling {{to improve the}} surface integrity. Research indicated that the impedance spectrum obtained from 430 SS in HCl solution consisted of a capacitive loop at high frequencies and an inductive loop at low frequencies. As the concentration of hydrochloric acid rose, the radiuses of the capacitive loop decreased. And the corrosion potential of 430 SS in hydrochloric acid solution moved to positive direction with band to a narrow 0. 1 V. And high HCl concentration more markedly influenced the charge-transfer resistance...|$|R
