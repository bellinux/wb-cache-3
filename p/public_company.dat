5|$|For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina {{was not an}} industrialized {{country by}} the {{standards}} of Britain, Germany or the United States. A major hindrance to full industrialisation was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a <b>public</b> <b>company</b> responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{earnings}} management in <b>public</b> and private <b>companies</b> within the Netherlands. Because <b>public</b> <b>companies</b> are exposed to various capital market pressures and share prices of <b>public</b> <b>companies</b> are influenced by reported earnings, I expect that <b>public</b> <b>companies</b> engage more in earnings management than private companies. This study combines the power of two models frequently used to measure earnings management: (1) The earnings distribution model; and (2) The modified Jones model. By applying both models on my sample of financial data of 77 <b>public</b> <b>companies</b> and 3. 105 private companies between 2000 and 2009, I provide strong evidence of earnings management. The two models show evidence that both <b>public</b> and private <b>companies</b> in the Netherlands engage in earnings management. I’m unable to provide convincing evidence that earnings management is applied more in either <b>public</b> or private <b>companies.</b> The earnings distribution model shows mixed results, although the evidence of earnings management in private companies is stronger. The modified Jones model shows overwhelming evidence of more earnings management in <b>public</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the <b>Public</b> <b>Company</b> Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E

5|$|From 1886, Worthington {{began to}} acquire public houses, which {{provided}} a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became a <b>public</b> <b>company</b> in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners. By {{this time the}} company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826–1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was {{in the hands of}} William Posnette Manners (1846–1915), who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879–1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved {{to be more than a}} match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family.|$|E
