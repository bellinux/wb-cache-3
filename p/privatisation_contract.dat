40|$|This study {{surveys the}} {{academic}} and professional literature examining the privatisation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), {{with a focus on}} empirical studies. Privatisation has been instrumental in reducing state ownership in many countries and had a transforming effect on global stock markets, although the role of SOEs in many other countries is similar to what it was two decades ago. Countries have adopted large-scale privatisation programs primarily for two reasons: first, the conclusive evidence that privately-owned firms outperform SOEs and, second, the empirical evidence clearly shows that privatisation significantly (often dramatically) improves the operating and financial performance of divested firms. Governments can also raise significant revenues by selling SOEs. While the choice between privatisation via public share offering versus through asset sales is still imperfectly understood, factors such as firm size, government fiscal condition, and the state of national economic development are important influences. Further, those countries which have chosen the mass (voucher) privatisation route have done so largely out of necessity [...] and face ongoing efficiency problems as a result. Governments have great discretion in pricing the SOEs they sell, especially those being sold via public share offering, and they use this discretion to pursue political and economic ends. Finally, investors who purchase the shares of firms being privatised earn significantly positive excess returns both in the short-run (due to deliberate underpricing of share issues by the government) and over one, three, and five-year investment horizons.

40|$|Introduction: Demand {{for health}} and social care {{services}} in the community will grow {{as a result of}} the ageing of populations across Europe. At present, however, very little is known about the preparedness of national home care systems for changing demand, which is not just quantitative but also qualitative in kind. There is a need for insight into the state of home care, including policy and regulation and aspects of financing, organisation and provision of services. Methods and Materials: EURHOMAP study has developed an extensive set of indicators to map home care systems that focus on: policy and regulation; financing; organisation & service delivery; and clients & informal carers. Data were collected in 31 European countries. We also used the answers of key informants on questions related to four ‘vignettes’ (hypothetical case descriptions of home living people in need of care). Results: Home care systems widely vary in their degree of development and that the structures of governance, regulation and models of provision are very heterogeneous. An aspect of home care that creates challenges at all levels is the mix of social, nursing and health services, which are supposed to be delivered in an integrated way to clients and patients. Cost control in community care is a common issue of most countries, but budgetary and efficiency measures taken and mechanisms developed are very different. Maintaining and improving home care services is a priority in many countries which does not always match with needs to increase efficiency. Conclusion: Although home care is a major point of policy in many countries, it is not heavily regulated. In many countries home care governance is split between different types of care and, consequently, not well integrated. Despite the dominance of public provision, tendencies towards more <b>privatisation,</b> <b>contracting</b> and competition can be identified. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Developing country {{governments are}} {{struggling}} to meet the basic needs and demands of citizens, and especially so for the rural poor. With tightly constrained budgets, these governments have followed the lead of developed countries that have sought to restructure public service delivery through <b>privatisation,</b> <b>contracting</b> out, public private partnerships and similar reforms. Such reforms in service delivery are generally welcomed when {{it is believed that}} private sector partners are better equipped to provide certain services than are governments. With respect to basic and essential services however, a higher degree of uncertainty and apprehension exist, as the focus shifts from simply minimising the costs of delivering services to broadening access to all citizens. Accordingly, the Bill of Rights (section 27 (1) (b)) of the 1996 Constitution, stipulates that everyone has the right to have access to sufficient food and water. Affordable and/or subsidised water, then, is not a privilege but a basic right of all citizens. Citizens elect political representatives to serve in office with their sole mandate being to provide for the needs of the citizenry. As governments pass on, some amount of responsibility for service delivery to private businesses, these governments must be able to exercise control in order to account to the people for the work done by private partners. This paper examines the legislative and policy frameworks as well as the environment within which PPPs take place in South Africa, {{and the extent to which}} accountability can be strengthened in this environment.

40|$|Along with <b>privatisation,</b> <b>contracting</b> out and “new” {{management}} techniques, {{one of the}} important, {{but less}} discussed, manifestations of the way neo-liberal ideology and policies have changed social services is through the requirement that individuals pay for public services that were once offered free of charge. In the UK, for example, over 600 individual services impose user charges. A similar, but alternative, method is to offer a premium service in a given sector (e. g. health, education) at a prescribed cost. As {{an indication of the}} importance of the trend, the OECD has recently offered a definition of user charges which is relatively straightforward: “payments made by consumers to providers of government services”. Moreover, with the change of policy comes an additional change, that of expectations. If people once expected free (at the point of consumption, not production, of course) services, current generations are increasingly accustomed to receiving social services at a cost. Through these relatively small charges, the relationship between the citizen and the state is being transformed. The citizen, we are told, is now the ‘citizen-consumer’, who “expects improved standards from public services, in line with those supplied by the private sector”. Replicating free market services, such charges are seen as part of an overall strategy to “roll back the frontiers of the state”. But if that is the case, where do rights come in? Rights, after all, are “especially sturdy objects to stand upon, a most useful sort of moral furniture”. They have the potential, at the very least, to alter the confines of the debate that would have taken place in their absence. A world without the right to freedom of speech, we assume, would be different from a world in which such a right is granted and respected. Focusing on social services in general, and on health and education in particular, we therefore need to inquire what impact social rights may have on this trend or on its effects...|$|R

40|$|<b>Privatisation</b> and <b>contracting</b> out have {{exacerbated}} the silo effect {{associated with the}} existence of separate government departments and agencies. The gaps created {{by the lack of}} integration between service providers and government have led to a range of solutions known variously as whole of government, connecting government and joined-up government. These are pragmatic solutions. On the one hand they recognise the failure of current agendas to provide coordinated government services, and on the other, the reluctance of western governments to resume traditional service provision. It is significant that the models underlying much of the whole of government response in Australia originate from the joined-up approaches implemented in the UK. These focus on horizontal coordination in a unitary state (Chandler 2000). However, in a federation such as Australia, state governments are constitutionally responsible for important public services. Some of these responsibilities are shared with the federal government. Simply adopting horizontal solutions in Australia threatens to create new gaps. The challenge is to manage the accountability, governance and coordination issues arising from horizontal whole of government initiatives.

40|$|It is now {{commonly}} {{accepted that}} {{a new model of}} public management is firmly in place across all levels of government in Australia. Governments of all political complexions pursue policies of relentless down-sizing, <b>privatisation</b> and <b>contracting</b> out. The role of government as producer and provider of an extensive range of goods and services has been supplanted by the much simpler notion that government should 'steer' rather than 'row'. The Weberian paradigm of bureaucratic organisation that characterised public management in Australia for much of this century is thus distinctly out of favour. Public services at both state and Commonwealth levels are being re-structured to remove those characteristics most closely associated with the discredited bureaucratic model. In all of this, the objective is to make the management of the public sector resemble as much as possible that of the private sector. It would be reasonable, therefore, to expect {{that there should be a}} new model of public sector human resource management to complement the new public management.

40|$|The European COST Action FP 1201 FOREST LAND OWNERSHIP CHANGES IN EUROPE: SIGNIFICANCE FOR MANAGEMENT AND POLICY (FACESMAP) aims {{to bring}} {{together}} the state-of-knowledge in this field across Europe and can build on expertise from 30 participating countries. Drawing on an evidence review across these countries, {{the objectives of the}} Action are as follows: (1) To analyse attitudes and constraints of different forest owner types in Europe and the on-going changes (outputs: literature survey, meta-analyses and maps). (2) To explore innovative management approaches for new forest owner types (outputs: case studies, critical assessment). (3) To study effective policy instruments with a comparative analysis approach (outputs: lit-erature survey, case studies, policy analyses). (4) To draw conclusions and recommendations for forest-related policies, forest management practice, further education and future research. Part of the work of the COST Action is the collection of data into country reports. These are writ-ten following prepared guidelines and to a common structure in order to allow comparisons across the countries. They also stand by themselves, giving a comprehensive account on the state of knowledge on forest ownership changes in each country. The common work in all countries comprises of a collection of quantitative data as well as quali-tative description of relevant issues. The COUNTRY REPORTS of the COST Action serve the following purposes: • Give an overview of forest ownership structures and respective changes in each country and insight on specific issues in the countries; • Provide data for some of the central outputs that are planned in the Action, including the literature reviews; • Provide information for further work in the Action, including sub-groups on specific topics. A specific focus of the COST Action is on new forest owner types. It is not so much about “new forest owners” in the sense of owners who have only recently acquired their forest, but the in-terest is rather on new types of ownership – owners with non-traditional goals of ownership and methods of management. For the purpose of the Action, a broad definition of “new forest owner types” was chosen. In a broad understanding of new or non-traditional forest ownership we in-clude several characteristics as possible determinants of new forest owners. The following groups may all be determined to be new forest owners: (1) individuals or organizations that previously have not owned forest land, (2) traditional forest owner categories who have changed motives, or introduced new goals and/or management practices for their forests, (3) transformed public ownership categories (e. g., through <b>privatisation,</b> <b>contracting</b> out forest management, transfer to municipalities, etc.), and (4) new legal forms of ownership in the countries (e. g. new common property regimes, com-munity ownership), both for private and state land...|$|R
40|$|The {{last two}} decades of the 20 th century saw a {{fundamental}} restructuring {{of the ways in}} which public services were delivered in developed economies. The dominant paradigm for reform over this period, New Public Management (NPM), had a significant focus on introducing greater competition into the provision of services, particularly between public organisations and agencies and the private sector. The promotion of competition was, arguably, the inherent “theory of change” in the reform agenda. The integrating essay for this thesis investigates the promotion of competition as a ”theory of change” as articulated through various forms of privatisation, and in particular, competitive tendering and contracting out. Through a re-examination of my previously published work on two primary national locations, the UK and Australia, and less detailed work on the Asia Pacific Region, I develop a thematic argument about NPM, its implementation and the responses to it. The integrating essay is accompanied by a portfolio of research published between 1991 and 2013 written with three objectives. The first was to engage in public policy debate about the dynamics of the NPM agenda. The second was to formulate and contribute to responses to privatisation and state restructuring by public bodies and agencies (predominantly local government) and by trade unions (nationally and internationally). The third objective was to analyse public management reform as a contributor to the restructuring of the state. This thesis is therefore concerned with the responses to <b>privatisation,</b> <b>contracting</b> out and competitive tendering from two perspectives: local government and organised labour (specifically national and international trade union organisations). Two themes recur: the effects on the quality of public services and the impacts on employment. Both are examined in this thesis as they had been under-researched and were overshadowed in the research literature by an economistic concern with costs and technical efficiency. In the developed economies of the “north” (including the UK and Australia) the labour force that delivers public services is comprised, disproportionately, of women and hence employment impacts of competition and related reforms are experienced, disproportionately by women as is documented in the thesis. By the first decade of the 21 st century, the significance of the NPM paradigm in driving reform has been waning as has the dependence on competition as the major ”theory of change”, even in developed countries which were enthusiastic implementers of the reforms. A case study of Australian urban water services illustrates technical and political barriers to more extensive privatisation. However, while policies to support or reform the “supply side” of service provision are no longer prevalent, the urban water sector displays the structural outcomes of reforms from competition and organisational consolidation in the previous decade. Overall, the empirical work in this submission was documenting the early stages of a transition to a system of public service provision with a diversity of providers, regulated directly and indirectly by the state. Some providers are still publicly owned but most have been radically reformed internally...|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s, the {{privatisation}} {{of government}} service provision {{has become increasingly}} common in Australia.

Since that time, the Government has made major changes to the system, in part along the lines suggested by the analysis in the paper. For example, a ‘floor’ or minimum bid price has been introduced, so as to prevent the lodging of unsustainably cheap bids.

25|$|The common {{heritage}} of humanity principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to {{the tragedy of the}} commons dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by Garrett Hardin in the journal Science in 1968. The article critically analyzes a dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest, ultimately destroy a shared limited resource even when each acknowledges that outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of conscience in achieving justice and equality in society. Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting economic rationalism on such social and ecosystems. Though there are many that point out that as what we are seeking is a social <b>contract,</b> <b>privatisation</b> would actually annihilate any possibility of rational use - the land would simply be in enclosure. Hardin's views are based on malthusian ideas of competition and over population, we have now accepted that it is the nature of man's consumption (not his numbers) that is causing the destruction of the environment. Hardin, like many who criticise principles of commonality, have to rely on long debunked 18th century ideas to make their point.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – In Australia, {{the public}} sector {{represents}} a significant component of the Australian economy and is a major employer across all states and territories. A constant stream of public sector management reforms has occurred over the last decade. These reforms include accrual accounting and budgeting, whole of government reporting, <b>privatisation</b> and <b>contracting</b> out to name a few. This would suggest that accounting graduates applying for positions at government agencies would benefit from some knowledge of these significant reforms. This paper aims to examine the perceptions of accounting academics as to barriers to public sector accounting (PSA) education in Australia and identify strategies for making the accounting curriculum more public sector inclusive. Design/methodology/approach – Two data collection methods were employed in order to attain a comprehensive picture {{of the state of}} PSA education in Australia. Telephone interviews were undertaken with accounting academics across a carefully selected range of universities. This selection ensured representation across the core accounting units to gain an indication of the extent of public sector coverage in the core accounting subjects. In-depth face-to-face interviews were then conducted at five universities across five states of Australia to probe further issues that emanated from the telephone interviews. Findings – The findings suggest that in general, there is very limited teaching of PSA in Australian universities' accounting degree programs. Of the universities studied where issues regarding {{the public sector}} are emphasised, this is mainly due to a few academics who have a research interest in the public sector and so extend this interest into their teaching and the curriculum. Research limitations/implications – There are a number of strategies identified to achieve greater coverage of PSA in the curriculum. However, the findings suggest that unless the professional accounting bodies require PSA to be included in courses as part of the accreditation process, then {{it will be difficult to}} achieve significant improvement in the nature and extent of public sector exposure. Most interviewees argued that a key factor in increasing public sector coverage would be ensuring that the textbook writers for the core accounting units included more PSA examples. Originality/value – The public sector in general, and PSA education is a neglected area of research. This study is significant as it highlights that although major public sector reforms have occurred in Australia and worldwide, this has had little impact on the accounting curriculum taught to students.

This research asked whether the emergence of neoliberal thinking might help explain the contemporary policy approaches to flood risk management. Whilst it may be tempting, to ask how neoliberal policy might affect this sector, the research soon discovered that its influences were pervasive, evident in the <b>privatisation</b> and the <b>contracting</b> out of water and sewerage functions, the re-working of regulatory expertise and changes to local government services. One key outcome of these processes has been a shift away from retaining local knowledge and the build-up of local expertise in favour of alternative forms of management procedures, contracting in technical expertise to achieve flexibility and cost effectiveness. The research revealed conflicting views about whether flood risk knowledge was improving - whilst improvements were clear at the catchment level, the evidence is more mixed at the local level. The other major finding of the research was the level of "uncertainty about uncertainty", in particular {{in terms of how}} experts communicated ideas about flood risk through maps and standards such as protecting against 1 : 100 year flood risk. Adding further complexity was uncertainty around climate change and how this was shaping policy to protect against future flood risk.

With the rise of surface water flooding incidents, where design standards are to protect against 1 : 30 year events, {{it may be time to}} reconsider the current standards. <br...|$|R

Unlike in New Zealand, Britain and the United States, big tax and welfare changes here offset much of the inequality that markets were increasingly producing. Might this have something to do with the economic and political success of Australian reform? Roger Kerr, CEO of New Zealand’s Business Roundtable supported that country’s zealous ‘crash through or crash’ reforming but more recently endorsed Australia’s approach as ‘remarkably consistent, coherent and credible’. But by the end of the ALP’s reign, reform had become formulaic deregulation. Even less imagination, and certainly less application, has been shown by the current government. Most economists agree on three remaining agendas. 1. Some industries still need some old fashioned deregulation - post, pharmacies, newsagents, taxis. But just naming them demonstrates their relative unimportance. 2. We should address ‘poverty traps’ created as welfare is withdrawn and tax is paid as people move from welfare to work. 3. Health and education systems need reform. But though greater choice and competition between providers can help, it could do more harm than good if pursued too mindlessly. And it’s just one part of a large policy jig-saw which includes better accountability structures, and management for results. These are all worthy enterprises but with returns now diminishing, there’s plenty of low hanging fruit on the tree of economic reform. If only we have the imagination to see it and the courage - sometimes we’ll need no more than a little curiosity and goodwill - to pick it. Here are some ideas to whet your appetite. • How about improving employees’ knowledge of the quality of Australia’s workplaces as part of the IR agenda? We should measure and publish the job satisfaction and health and safety performance (workers compensation premiums) of all Australia’s larger workplaces so their competition for employees becomes competition to provide satisfying jobs. • We can apply the same principles widely. Wouldn’t you like to know what students and parents think of their schools and patients of their hospitals and mightn’t it help them improve? Publishing the investment performance of investment advisors would do far more good than most of the regulation we put them through. • Rationalising the management responsibilities of government has been sensible - with <b>privatisation</b> and <b>contracting</b> out for instance - but these policies have shifted risk away from governments which can often manage and bear it better than firms or individuals. We should begin redressing the balance by embracing the idea that governments should, like firms and families, borrow to build assets for the future. • Our system of civil law is a scandal - available to the rich and those poor enough to access legal aid, but only otherwise to those willing to risk their life savings. Legal costs should be commensurate with the magnitude of disputes and this simple microeconomic principle should be reflected in all legal procedure. Either litigant to a dispute should be able to pre-emptively elect a low cost tribunal free from any threat of appeal, except upon their opponent bearing all resulting costs. • In a world of increasing complexity what happens by ‘default’ matters. So we should engineer socially beneficial defaults. To bolster Australians’ inadequate savings we should ensure that employees’ salary sacrifice super contributions slowly rise above the nine percent compulsory rate by default - always subject to their right to opt out. Likewise the authorities already have enough information about Australians’ wage, interest and dividend earnings to relieve them of the burden of filling out their tax return - though of course we should them lodge a return to pick up additional tax deductions to which they are entitled. They’ve implemented both of these ‘sensible default’ ideas in New Zealand. Yet we’re hardly talking about them. • In areas where simple deregulation is neither possible nor desirable - like occupational safety and consumer protection - we can build a less dysfunctional, more responsive approach. We must think of regulation less as the issuing of sovereign commands and more as the management of complex systems. Firms and individuals should have rights to challenge the way regulation has been designed, and rights to alternative means of complying with it. Like other reforms none of these ideas are panaceas. But in their modest way they begin to take economics out of its current comfort zone. As well as helping us run ‘the economy’, these reforms would help us see economic reform as it was by its founder, Adam Smith, as a means of improving quality and security of our lives by improving the fairness and fitness for purpose of our social institutions. • Nicholas Gruen is CEO of Lateral Economics.

40|$|The {{privatisation}} of {{the electricity}} industry {{is one of the}} most unpopular decisions ever made by a government in South Australia. In the introduction to a new book, Power Politics, John Spoehr explains why [...] . AFTER nearly half a century under public ownership and control, the electricity industry in Australia is now subject to the influence of market principles and private interests. Over the last ten years most attempts to privatise electricity assets have failed. As a consequence, only two states in Australia have managed to sell or lease electricity assets - Victoria and South Australia. There is no immediate prospect of other states and territories doing the same. Strong community opposition and the inability to get a parliamentary majority are ensuring this for the time being. However, the struggle over the ownership and control of the industry will continue. Power Politics chronicles the history of one such struggle in South Australia. Few debates have stimulated as intense community and political interest in recent times in South Australia as the privatisation of the state’s electricity industry. The Liberal Government’s policy backflip on privatisation was deeply unpopular in the South Australian community, with the vast majority of South Australians wanting the industry to remain publicly owned and managed. Furthermore, they were skeptical about the claimed benefits of privatisation. Community dissatisfaction with the privatisation of the Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA) undoubtedly contributed to the erosion of the Liberal Party’s slim majority at the 9 February 2002 state election. Ultimately a Labor Government was formed with the support of the independent member for Hammond, Peter Lewis, a disgruntled former Liberal Party member. The seeds {{of the electricity}} crisis in South Australia were sewn in the early 1990 s with the establishment of the National Electricity Market (NEM). The NEM offered the prospect of a more efficient electricity industry with, as a consequence, cheaper power prices. As we show in Power Politics, the NEM is unlikely to deliver on these promises. Indeed it is now clear that the new market-based system has failed so far to deliver on the promises made by the former Liberal Government. While the sale of publicly owned electricity assets was not a requirement of the NEM, the market principles upon which the NEM was based have been used as a pretext for privatisation by a number of governments. In the face of strong community opposition, bold promises were made about the benefits of privatisation. Consumers around Australia were promised lower electricity prices and greater reliability by the architects of the NEM. South Australian households and small businesses are now bracing themselves for a very different outcome as they enter the NEM in 2003. They know that they face similar price hikes to those recently experienced by large businesses in the state. Some estimates suggest the likely initial increase facing households will be around 20 % or $ 178 on the average power bill. Households also remember summer power blackouts in 2000 and they remain alert to the possibility that these are likely to recur. With sections of the electricity industry advocating the introduction of new power meters at a cost of $ 600 to each consumer, South Australian consumers were left with little doubt who the beneficiaries of the NEM and the ETSA privatisation process might be. The NEM is not working well for South Australian consumers and the ETSA privatisation has reduced the state government’s influence over the NEM. South Australians are not alone in grappling with the price crisis in the NEM. Both Queensland and New South Wales sought to delay the entry of domestic and small business consumers into the national market. Fearful of large increases in domestic power prices, they considered the introduction of price caps. However, the same options may not be available to the South Australian Government because of the ETSA privatisation. One of the perverse consequences of the privatisation of ETSA is that the contracts with new private power operators may prevent the government from introducing price caps. The only strategy for price control being seriously canvassed in South Australia has been ‘price justification’, a process whereby industry is asked to justify to regulators whether price increases are fair and reasonable. This is ‘paper tiger’ public policy, reflecting just how impotent the state government has become in the NEM. The NEM experiment has failed the price test set by its designers, and states like South Australia which have privatised their electricity assets are relatively ‘powerless’ to deal with the price crisis unless fundamental reforms to the NEM are introduced. The NEM currently operates too much like a highly speculative stockmarket. This is not an appropriate model for the future development and management of the electricity industry as it is likely to perpetuate wild price fluctuations and under-investment in the development of sustainable energy-generation technologies. The Californian electricity crisis and the recent collapse of the US energy trading giant, Enron, demonstrate the inherent risks associated with over-reliance on market-based electricity systems like the NEM. The collapse of the US energy company giant, NRG Inc. in December 2002 brought this problem closer to home. NRG is the parent company of NRG Flinders which had acquired electricity generation assets in South Australia and Victoria. When NRG Inc. collapsed in the US, the South Australian subsidiary was put into voluntary administration, exposing the South Australian Government to a potential liability of up to $ 140 million due to a government guarantee built into the contract which NRG Flinders signed with the former Liberal Government. Not surprisingly, the new state Labor Government feared the crisis might have wider implications, so it immediately established an inquiry into all the electricity <b>privatisation</b> <b>contracts</b> struck by the previous administration. More rather than less public accountability and engagement in the industry will be necessary to avoid such problems. The NEM will fail the fair and reasonable power price and public accountability test while market ideologues and energy speculators determine the rules governing the industry. The threat of substantial electricity price increases and the NRG crisis are early warning signs to the government that major reform of the South Australian electricity industry will be required if wider public interest and environmental objectives are to be met. South Australia needs a strategy which integrates social, economic and environmental objectives into a comprehensive sustainable energy strategy for the state. By integrating the need for affordable energy with energy demand management and the development of renewable energy, South Australia could lead the nation in the development of a sustainable energy industry. Moreover, this industry of the future has the potential to be a major generator of new jobs and exports. The challenge for the state government is to provide the leadership to develop a policy which adopts a ‘triple bottom line’ approach to energy industry policy, one which focusses on affordability, energy efficiency and the need for renewable energy. An ‘authority for environmentally sustainable energy’ should be established to drive such reform. To begin to meet this challenge it will be necessary to rethink the ‘economics’ of the electricity industry. Over-reliance on marketbased economics will undermine the capacity of the government to ensure that this triple bottom line approach is realised. As noted earlier, the privatisation of the electricity industry in South Australia and its parallel participation in the National Electricity Market have raised concerns in the community about electricity pricing and system reliability. It now appears that the government has less capacity to meet social objectives like affordability and reliability, and environmental objectives such as reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Privatisation of the electricity industry in South Australia has increased the potential for price shocks. In order to maximise proceeds from the sale of electricity assets, new generation initiatives, with the exception of Pelican Point, were not pursued vigorously by the previous state government. Since privatisation the focus of policy has been upon increasing supply through gas- and coal-fired generation capacity and interconnectors. Inadequate attention has been paid to alternative methods of matching supply and demand such as demand-side management measures designed to reduce consumption. The development of renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind power also requires much more attention. A more rational solution which serves the public interest is needed for the development of the Australian electricity industry, one that is consumer- and environment-focussed rather than focussed on short-term speculative gains for the benefit of the energy-trading industry. 1 n 1945 South Australian Premier Tom Playford took an important step down this road by establishing a royal commission into the privately run Adelaide Electric Supply Company. He was concerned that the company was too focussed on shareholders’ interests: that it was seeking higher dividends while resisting the need to increase South Australia’s fuel self-sufficiency and promote industrialisation. At that time the royal commission found that the public interest would be best served by nationalising the Adelaide Electric Supply Company and creating what is now known as the Electricity Trust of South Australia - ETSA. Today we are faced with similar questions about the appropriate role of government in the future development of the industry. The logic of Playford’s response to this challenge in 1945 is just as compelling now- a royal commission would be both a timely and appropriate response. A royal commission has the power and independence to help ensure a fearless and comprehensive inquiry into the Australian electricity industry and the NEM. The foremost objective of the commission would be a review of the structure and operation of the NEM and the provision of advice on the appropriate role of government to ensure fair and reasonable prices, effective demand management and sustainable generation strategies from the industry. Future generations will thank those who have the courage and vision to confront the energy policy problems and challenges this state and nation faces. This book aims to stimulate debate on the need for fundamental reform of the electricity industry in Australia and South Australia. Understanding the origins of the public electricity industry is vital to the creation of a context where industry is more committed and open to the public interest. It is also crucial that the debate on ownership and control of the industry in the twenty-first century is not dominated by those interested in prices and profits but focussed on the many social and environmental imperatives which must be faced if we are to develop a sustainable and socially responsible energy industry for the future. Power Politics providess an overview of the origins of the public electricity industry in South Australia, the emergence of a market-based electricity system and the privatisation of the industry in South Australia. It attempts to demystify the NEM and offer a number of critical perspectives on its rationale and operation. And it outlines a range of ideas for change and reform, including some lessons from overseas and locally on energy efficiency, renewable energy, low-income consumers and reform of the NEM. Importantly, this includes ideas to assist households, industry and government to use energy more efficiently, with the dual aim of reducing demand for energy and meeting environmental objectives. The privatisation of the South Australian electricity industry is likely to remain one of the most unpopular decisions ever made by a government in South Australia. For this reason the momentum for fundamental reform is likely to grow. It may eventually prove to be as overwhelming as it was in 1945 when the premier of the day, Tom Playford, called a royal commission which led to the nationalisation of the industry in 1946. It is highly likely that the eventual privatisation by the Liberal Government in 1998 (despite their 1997 election promise not to do so) contributed to their defeat in 2002. It is also highly likely that the current Labor Government will continue to suffer the repercussions of electricity privatisation in South Australia for a long time to come. It faces the challenge of developing an energy policy which integrates social, economic and environmental objectives in order to reassert the public interest in the face of influential private interests. This is the essence of Power Politics. John Spoehr is executive director of the Centre for Labour Research at the University of Adelaid...|$|R

The Heritage Foundation - the "General Motors" of conservatism, according to one pundit - recently announced plans to double its size. Heritage is already massive, in size and in influence; its red brick headquarters casts a long shadow on Capital Hill three blocks away, but its reach extends well beyond the beltway. Look back over the annals of conservative ideas of the last 30 years and you 2 ̆ 7 ll be hard pressed to find a serious policy initiative - Star Wars, school vouchers, social security <b>privatisation,</b> deregulation, <b>Contract</b> with America, to name but a few - without the Heritage fingerprint on it. The foundation 2 ̆ 7 s thousand-page, multi-volume "Mandate for Leadership" is generally regarded as marching orders for Republican administrations. Two-thirds of the recommendations in the debut, 1980 edition were implemented by the Reagan administration within its first year in office. Heritage is among the largest and best known {{of a new generation of}} conservative think tanks that also includes the American Enterprise Institute, Cato Institute, Manhattan Institute, Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Family Research Council. Beginning in the 1970 s, conservatives, through a coordinated and aggressive funding effort, built up a critical mass of scholars and spokespeople who could articulate a conservative agenda for the country. Modern conservatism was already making a name for itself in the pages of a handful of small publications, most notably William F. Buckley, Jr. 2 ̆ 7 s National Review, but the movement lacked the intellectual authority to challenge the liberal worldview. As Nation columnist Eric Alterman writes, "While it could still win national elections (witness Richard Nixon), the right felt shut out from the larger cultural discourse. " Targeted spending The history of conservative philanthropy has been well documented in recent years, mostly by liberals who have looked on with a mix of horror and envy as the right 2 ̆ 7 s think tank empire grew and solidified. Most of the think tanks 2 ̆ 7 foundation money (which accounts for more than a quarter of the multi-million dollar budgets of places like the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute) comes from a stable cadre of about a dozen conservative philanthropies. The largest four - the John M. Olin, Lynde and Harry Bradley, Sarah Scaife, and Smith Richardson Foundation - contribute so much to the same set of institutions that they are often referred to collectively as the "four sisters. " Unlike their more progressive counterparts, conservative philanthropies have chosen to leverage their resources into nurturing people and organizations capable of steering public debate across a broad swath of issues. The progressive National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy (NCRP), which tracks philanthropic giving to the right, published a study in 1997 which found that between 1992 and 1994, the 12 major conservative foundations poured over 200 million into organizations pursuing an overtly conservative public policy agenda. (For up-to-date tracking of the organizations and issues funded by conservative philanthropies, MediaTransparancy. org does an excellent job of following the money.) Most of the money given was for general support to organizations working at the national level, rather than being earmarked for specific issues or local causes. The strategy paid off: conservative think tanks have succeeded in tipping the balance of power and are now steering public debate. Strategery The left, on the other hand, has remained more issue driven, focusing on problem solving over selling ideology. Grassroots activism is a cherished part of liberal crusades, but the left 2 ̆ 7 s relative lack of institution-building has led to the increasing fragmentation of liberalism as a coherent vision for social change. Without simultaneously advancing the ideological framework that justifies their work, liberals have made their job even more difficult; in the wake of constant conservative attacks to defund progressive social programs, the left is losing ground at the community level as well. As liberal scholars like David Callahan, Karen Pagett, and Michael Shuman have documented, the problem with the left is not that it is underfunded, but that its funding priorities do not allow it to build the organizational capacity it now needs to stand on equal footing with the right. Foundations that support progressive causes actually far surpass conservative ones in terms of total assets, but they have spread their giving wider and thinner, focusing on short-term, local and grassroots campaigns rather than on general support funding for core institutions. The reasons for the left 2 ̆ 7 s spending priorities are not hard to understand: a general mistrust of "top-down" spending, a belief that money is better spent directly in the service of helping people, and a desire to hold grantees accountable for their spending. But, unfortunately, the result is that liberal philanthropies are often reluctant to fund the kind of media and public relations work that would help organizations become more stable and self-sufficient. Moreover, while conservative foundations make no bones about their political leanings, progressive foundations [...] and their corporate boards [...] often shy away from funding overtly political work. All of which makes liberal organizations less willing to engage in ideological debate, and less able to capitalize on it when they do. David Callahan has written, "Most impressive is the way in which conservative policy entrepreneurs have been so skilled and invested so heavily in marketing their grand story of American politics to the media. If national politics can be seen largely as a contest of broad frameworks, there is little question that conservatives have won this game in recent years. " The right 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness in pushing its message is enviable. Every Heritage study is published with a synopsis; every synopsis is turned into an Op-Ed piece, distributed by the foundation 2 ̆ 7 s own syndicating service. Heritage 2 ̆ 7 s "pre-digested" public policy is well suited to the realities of contemporary journalism, which consumes short, punchy newsbites to feed its 24 -hour newscycle. Heritage even runs a seminar called "Thinking and Talking in Soundbites. " Selling the press One measure of the right 2 ̆ 7 s success is the number of times conservative think tanks are mentioned in the mainstream press. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), a liberal media watchdog group, documents how often the work of various think tanks are referenced in newspapers and broadcast media. Not surprisingly, the work of conservative think tanks is highlighted far more frequently than liberal ones. According to FAIR, in 1999 the Heritage Foundation received 1, 419 mentions in the press and AEI 1, 263. The two progressive think tanks receiving the most citations were the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), with 506 and 229 mentions respectively. (The Brookings Institution consistently receives the largest number of media references, with 2, 883 in 1999. Conservatives have long tried to portray Brookings as the largest liberal think tank, but Brookings is resolutely and self-avowedly centrist, describing itself as the "organ of fanatic moderates. " The liberal tag is a victory for conservatives, who use it to rally their supporters for more funds.) Perhaps the most perplexing trait of the conservative movement is that it continues to successfully portray itself as the underdog waging a guerrilla war against the fat and comfortable liberal monolith. Despite the steady rightward march of American political debate, conservatives still rail against the so-called liberal bias in mainstream media. Media watchdog groups - funded by the same set of conservative donors as the think tanks - vigilantly monitor the press, and are quick to chastise journalists who do not provide a sufficiently conservative point of view. As Tracy Lieberman points out in Slanting the Story, "Conservative think tanks [...] . have become masters at cultivating the press, but are just as quick to charge 2 ̆ 7 liberal bias 2 ̆ 7 when the media they 2 ̆ 7 ve so carefully pampered do not stick to the conservative line. " Add the right 2 ̆ 7 s own media empire [...] including The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, Murdoch 2 ̆ 7 s FOX News, and a host of cable t. v. and talk radio outlets [...] to the inherently conservative leanings of an increasingly corporatized and consolidated media, and it 2 ̆ 7 s clear that the media is becoming more conservative as well. The left does not have to play the same game as the right, but it can learn something from the kind of focused institution-building and media courting that conservatives practice. It won 2 ̆ 7 t substitute for compelling ideas and energized leadership. But, as Alterman put it, "The outcome of any contest is a foregone conclusion when one side plays only defense.
