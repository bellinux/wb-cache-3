25|$|Filamentous carbon {{has been}} known since at least 1890, when <b>P.</b> <b>and</b> <b>L.</b> Schützenberger {{observed}} it while passing cyanogen over red-hot porcelain. In the 1950s, {{it was discovered that}} the filaments could be produced by the reactions of gases such as hydrocarbons with metals such as iron, cobalt, and nickel. The first electron micrographs of tubular versions of the filaments appeared in 1952. Between the 1970s and the 1990s, filamentous carbon {{has been the subject of}} a number of research efforts. These studies included studies of the thermodynamic properties of the formation of the allotrope. The most significant study that took place during that time was conducted by Terry Baker in the 1970s and concerned keeping filamentous carbon from growing inside the cooling pipes of nuclear reactors.|$|E

[...] These great circles are related by a simple rotation about the η'x-axis (Figure 8). [...] This rotational symmetry transforms all the orbits of the same energy into one another; however, such a rotation is orthogonal to the usual three-dimensional rotations, since it transforms the fourth dimension η'w. [...] This higher symmetry is characteristic of the Kepler problem and corresponds to the conservation of the LRL vector.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{interpretation}} of the Decad as a standard sequence of training compositions within the Old Babylonian school curriculum is generally accepted by most scholars, the significance of these compositions' being grouped together in catalogues has been disputed. Paul Delnero, for example, has argued that there is no real evidence for distinguishing catalogues (<b>P)</b> <b>and</b> (<b>L)</b> from other, archival catalogues and ascribing to them a curricular function: (<b>P)</b> <b>and</b> (<b>L)</b> share many specific features and grouping devices with archival catalogues; their respective orderings of compositions after the first ten differ widely; and they omit several important Sumerian literary texts that one would expect to find in a school curriculum. Furthermore, compositions belonging to the Decad are listed in different positions in other catalogues. Thus {{it is possible that the}} Decad catalogues had an archival rather than a curricular function.|$|E
