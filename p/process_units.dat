25|$|PAC {{material}} is finer material. PAC {{is made up}} of crushed or ground carbon particles, 95–100% of which will pass through a designated mesh sieve. The ASTM classifies particles passing through an 80-mesh sieve (0.177mm) and smaller as PAC. It is not common to use PAC in a dedicated vessel, due to the high head loss that would occur. Instead, PAC is generally added directly to other <b>process</b> <b>units,</b> such as raw water intakes, rapid mix basins, clarifiers, and gravity filters.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of May 1971, the Communists withdrew {{at the end of}} Campaign 74B; in the <b>process,</b> <b>units</b> of the battle-hardened PAVN 316th Division {{attacked}} Bouamlong from three sides. Pressing in from the north, east, and southwest, the Communists struck with artillery, mortar, and recoilless rifle fire. Sappers attacked the Hmong defenders; the Communists even resorted to tear gas. However, the Hmong manned three 105mm howitzers for counterfire. They also used ground beacons to direct gunship strikes against the attackers. The Vietnamese gave up the siege at the end of May and left. Three Pathet Lao battalions remained to monitor the situation.|$|E

25|$|A unit {{operation}} {{is a physical}} step in an individual chemical engineering <b>process.</b> <b>Unit</b> operations (such as crystallization, filtration, drying and evaporation) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors. On the other hand, a <b>unit</b> <b>process</b> is the chemical equivalent of a {{unit operation}}. Along with <b>unit</b> operations, <b>unit</b> <b>processes</b> constitute a <b>process</b> operation. <b>Unit</b> <b>processes</b> (such as nitration and oxidation) involve the conversion of material by biochemical, thermochemical and other means.

25|$|Of {{primary concern}} {{with respect to}} the Hayward Fault is the huge Chevron Richmond Refinery in Richmond. Although founded on better ground than most of the shoreline, this {{refinery}} has extensive crude oil and finished product docks and pipelines extending into the bay, which could produce catastrophic spills into the bay, with the potential to adversely affect hundreds of miles of sensitive wetlands. Dismantling of high pressure and temperature <b>process</b> <b>units</b> and the consequent fire danger to personnel and equipment could produce substantial economic consequences for the western states. Large liquid storage tanks are protected by berms that are designed to contain the contents should a tank fail under normal conditions. Similar process and product conditions exist at other refineries further inland near Martinez, but mostly these plants are exposed to earthquakes from other faults.|$|E

50|$|Large {{quantities}} of fluid feedstock or product may enter or leave a plant by pipeline, railroad tank car, or tanker truck. For example, petroleum commonly {{comes to a}} refinery by pipeline. Pipelines can also carry petrochemical feedstock from a refinery to a nearby petrochemical plant. Natural gas is a product which comes {{all the way from}} a natural gas processing plant to final consumers by pipeline or tubing. Large {{quantities of}} liquid feedstock are typically pumped into <b>process</b> <b>units.</b> Smaller quantities of feedstock or product may be shipped to or from a plant in drums. Use of drums about 55 gallons in capacity is common for packaging industrial quantities of chemicals. Smaller batches of feedstock may be added from drums or other containers to <b>process</b> <b>units</b> by workers.|$|E

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of process integration {{is to consider}} a {{system as a whole}} (i.e. integrated or holistic approach) in order to improve their design and/or operation.
