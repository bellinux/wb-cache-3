50|$|Power {{generation}} was not originally {{included in the}} <b>project</b> <b>purpose</b> for Norfork Dam. However, this was unacceptable {{to the people of}} Baxter County and the surrounding region. The sparse population of the area did not justify investment, by private companies, in a large network of power lines. It was believed that, if the dam did not include power generation, it could be many years before the region would gain service. While most citizens would have accepted any type of government project to help boost the economy, a large delegation from the region met in Harrison, Arkansas to insist that power generation be included in the <b>project</b> <b>purpose.</b> The Baxter County delegation wanted to pass a resolution that would have expressed opposition to any dam that did not include hydroelectric power facilities. They feared that the cost/benefit ratio would not justify congressional expenditure unless power {{generation was}} included, and the dam would never be built. However, the Batesville, Arkansas delegation was able to convince the assembly that the resolution may be interpreted as general opposition to the dam and it never passed. They believed that the population and economic growth brought by the construction of the dam would make it feasible for power companies to move in. As it happened the citizens of Baxter County need not have worried. Shortly after construction began Congress, under the threat of impending war, authorized construction of the power house and two out of the four generators for Norfork Dam (Messick).|$|E
5000|$|Corner's Field Operations {{headed up}} {{a team that}} won the {{international}} design competition with its [...] "Lifescape" [...] design for the redesign of Fresh Kills Park, a project intended to salvage a massive landfill on Staten Island. The landfill is {{the largest in the}} country at 2200 acre, or {{three times the size of}} Central Park in Manhattan. Today, it is one of the largest publics work projects in the world. The winning design incorporates a World Trade Center memorial, because the landfill was temporarily reopened to accommodate the remains of the towers, as well as a strong, central focus on programs, habitat, and circulation throughout the new park. Fresh Kills Park is reminiscent of Olmsted's massive design for Central Park as far as work load, scale, and <b>project</b> <b>purpose</b> and design. Fresh Kills Park is said to be [...] "one of the most ambitious public works projects in the world," [...] considering 45% of the area is landfill and the remaining land is wetlands and lowlands. The goal of Fresh Kills Park is to create a world class large-scale park which restores the ecological systems, yet allows New York to optimize its local and regional access while reducing traffic congestion. The park will be developed as a setting for a range of outdoor activities, programs, and recreation that are unique to New York.|$|E
