5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E

Through understanding the definition <b>of</b> <b>politicization,</b> the curriculum <b>of</b> Liberal Studies {{as well as the}} teaching and learning of this subject, a proper analysis of concerning the impacts of studying Liberal Studies to student’s political awareness and participations can be reached. In the research, three teachers and twenty eight students were invited to participate into the individual interviews and questionnaire survey for collecting their views towards the politicization in Liberal Studies. By collecting their background information and opinions towards learning, teaching as well as the uses of teaching materials in the lessons, a full and diversified investigation is able to be incorporated in the study. This study points out that there are many factors which are able to affect an individual’s goals and values of the politics and the school’s curriculum such as Liberal Studies is just one of them. Despite it can enhance student’s social and political awareness, there are no any motivation in this subject to encourage students to join into any political movements in society. Thus, it is concluded that whether the politicization happens or not in Liberal Studies actually depends on the focuses in the definition <b>of</b> <b>politicization.</b> published_or_final_versionEducationBachelorBachelor <b>of</b> Education in Liberal Studie...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the epistemological {{value of the}} concept of political theology in thanatopolitics. The concept can be useful if one wants to interpret political usage of death. In addition to blurred boundaries between politics and theology, there is a more general and deeper socially integrative affinity between the two. In addition, there have been various <b>politicizations</b> <b>of</b> salvation in the past and in the present. Every political theology accentuates obedience as an immanent condition of salvation, although interpretation of death in political theology has a different function than in secular ideologies. In the centre of politically theological ideas one can find crosscutting of the divisions between public friend and public enemy from political world with similar divisions from religious world. Finally, beside the theological influence on politics, this paper considers some analogies between theology and the secular judiciary.

40|$|In {{what ways}} do the {{cultural}} fields of aesthetics and politics transform each other, {{and how does}} this relation change under specific historical circumstances? How {{is it possible to}} evaluate the history of activities that occur at the intersection of aesthetics and politics? How can we account for the way in which such practices are able to alter the very criteria by which they might be recognized or judged? This dissertation responds to such questions by tracing the emergence of a distinct field of cultural production in West Germany and Austria in the years leading up to and through 1968, designating this field as "aesthetico-political. " It seeks to determine the various conditions of possibility for these emergent forms of activity, and to examine the different models of political agency, aesthetic experience, and subjectivation they proposed. The analysis focusses on four distinct transformations: <b>politicizations</b> <b>of</b> the aesthetic (a term including but not limited to the arts); aestheticizations of politics, especially through the mediatization of the public sphere; the reorientation of artistic practices away from modernist models; and the ascendance of New Left movements. The dissertation's test cases primarily concern activities that I term "events": durational occurrences taking place in the space between aesthetics and politics...|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the past}} several decades, {{the release of a}} NIE on a {{controversial}} policy have usually resulted in charges that the IC politicized its key findings. Charges <b>of</b> <b>politicization</b> come from both Democrats and Republicans, but normally emerge from the side that does not agree with the policy implications of the analysis. Changes or reversals in NIE assessments over time cause some legislators to question whether the change resulted from newly collected intelligence or whether analysts changed their position to support a specific political agenda.For example, the IC accusation <b>of</b> <b>politicization</b> surfaced after the key judgments of NIEs on the ballistic missile threat to the United States changed between 1993 and 1995. Some Republicans claimed the IC politicized the findings to support President Clinton’s policy against missile defense systems.|$|R

We argue that the mode of negotiation {{to be found in}} the EU decision-making processes is contextually determined. Empirically it is demonstrated that day-to-day negotiations in the EU are to a large extent problem-solving exercises. Under certain circumstances, however, conflictual bargaining occurs. The pattern varies with, therefore, level <b>of</b> <b>politicization</b> and type <b>of</b> policy, and according to the stage in the decision-making process.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to improve}} {{our understanding of the}} political life of Latinos in the U. S., in specific local contexts and historical moments. To that end, I propose to reframe the understanding of politics and the political. Borrowing elements from political philosophy, I propose using the concept <b>of</b> <b>politicization,</b> which is primarily defined by the introduction of innovation in the public realm; the generation of consequences that affect not only those directly involved in a situation but others as well; and the intervention in a public domain that is not limited to state structures. To elaborate on this idea <b>of</b> <b>politicization</b> as well as to bring history, context, and in particular, temporality, to the center of this research, I look at two major events that crystallized the most critical landmarks in the recent political history of Latinos in the Washington D. C. area: the Mount Pleasant Riots of 1991 and "La Marcha" of 2006. In order to disentangle the process <b>of</b> <b>politicization</b> in each <b>of</b> the events analyzed, I examine the interplay of context (including demographic, political, and organizational features of the local Latino community), episodes of contention, attribution of opportunities and threats, social and organizational appropriation, and innovation. I then reconstruct these cases by inscribing them in their contexts and analyzing how, why, and when different consequential actions were performed. Both the Mount Pleasant riots and La Marcha involved the engagement of ordinary people in the Latino community in contentious public acts which led to the emergence of a transformed ethnically-centered political actor. I argue that this actor constitution {{was the result of the}} way in which ordinary people and various collective actors proceeded throughout the exceptional public performances, before, during, and after. My main argument is that the profile and structural location of leading organizations (e. g., dependency on government contracts, foundations' grants, employers, or ordinary people) involved in the events had a decisive impact on the actions adopted by community leaders which, in turn, affected the direction of the political path that the Latino community undertook...|$|R
