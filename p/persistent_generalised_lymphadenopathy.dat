25|$|Lymphadenopathy {{refers to}} one or more {{enlarged}} lymph nodes. Small groups or individually enlarged lymph nodes are generally reactive in response to infection or inflammation. This is called local lymphadenopathy. When many lymph nodes in different areas of the body are involved, this is called <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> <b>Generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> may be caused by infections such as infectious mononucleosis, tuberculosis and HIV, connective tissue diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers, including both cancers of tissue within lymph nodes, discussed below, and metastasis of cancerous cells {{from other parts of the}} body, that have arrived via the lymphatic system.|$|R

40|$|Fever with <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> is {{a common}} {{presentation}} in clinical practice. A degree of lymphadenopathy is frequently a characteristic of established systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but it is rarely the primary presenting feature. A 25 -year-old man presented with night sweats, weight loss and <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> A chest computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of mediastinal, hilar and axillary lymphadenopathy, with bilateral pleural effusions. The double stranded DNA antibody (anti-dsDNA) was absent. Subsequently, there was mild renal impairment and a renal biopsy showed lupus nephritis. Anti-dsDNA was positive using an alternative assay. Treatment with prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil led to considerable clinical improvement. Extensive lymphadenopathy as the first clinical manifestation of SLE is rare and this case also illustrates the variable results obtained from different anti-dsDNA antibody assays...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{haemophilia}} centres {{in northern}} Europe have pooled data on 202 haemophilic {{children who were}} infected with HIV between 1979 and 1986. All cases were under 16 years of age on 1 July 1985. The age at infection ranged from 1 - 15 years. Thirty seven cases (18 %) had progressed to AIDS by 1 July 1991 and 15 of these have died. <b>Persistent</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> has been noted in 102 patients of whom 18 (17 %) have developed AIDS. Twenty three of the remaining patients (23 %) have not. CD 4 + T cell counts have fallen steadily. Of 36 patients who have had shingles since seroconversion, 19 (53 %) had counts below 0. 2 x 10 (9) /l. Thirty five out of 145 patients without shingles (24 %) had similar values. The mean IgA concentration in patients with CD 4 + T cell counts above 0. 5 x 10 (9) /l was 2. 38 g/l, between 0. 2 and 0. 5 was 3. 07 g/l, and in those with CD 4 + T cell counts below 0. 2 x 10 (9) /l the mean IgA concentration was 4. 58 g/l. Treatment patterns have altered between 1989 and 1991, with increased use of zidovudine in patients without AIDS and a marked increase in primary prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia. This {{has been associated with}} a decline in the incidence of pneumocystis as an indicator disease in new AIDS cases from 56 % in 1989 to 20 % in 1991. These observations indicate that <b>persistent</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> does not worsen the outlook, but shingles does. Rising IgA concentrations are markers for disease progression. Modern prophylactic regimens are delaying the onset of indicator disease, but CD 4 values continue to fall steadily...|$|E
40|$|Fifty four sexual {{partners}} of homosexual {{men with the}} acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were studied, of whom 32 were seropositive and 22 seronegative for human T cell lymphotropic virus type III or lymphadenopathy virus (HTLV-III/LAV) antibody, which showed that repeated exposure by anal intercourse does not necessarily lead to seroconversion. Seropositivity to HTLV-III/LAV {{was not associated with}} the absolute number of {{sexual partners}}, receptive anal intercourse, or the use of recreational drugs, but was associated with a history of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), particularly in the year preceding the patient's initial examination. Acquisition of an STD after the date of last sexual contact with a person with AIDS was strongly associated (p less than 0. 001) with the development of <b>persistent</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> (PGL). Concurrent or recent STDs would seem to be an important cofactor in developing antibody to HTLV-III/LAV and in the progression of infection from a person being asymptomatic to having PGL...|$|E
40|$|Thirty one {{homosexual}} {{men with}} antibody to {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) but without major neurological complaints were assessed in a cross sectional study of neurological and neuropsychological function. Eleven patients had AIDS, 10 had <b>persistent</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> (PGL), and 10 had HIV infection without PGL (called "well"). Thirteen age matched homosexual men without antibody to HIV acted as controls. Significant abnormalities were found in six on clinical neurological examination, in eight on nerve conduction studies, in six on electroencephalography, in six on neuropsychological assessment, and in eight on computed tomography of the head. Eighteen patients (nine with AIDS, four with PGL, and five "well") performed abnormally {{in at least one}} section of the assessment. The study highlights the incidence of nervous system dysfunction in HIV infection even in people who do not have AIDS. Prospective evaluation using electrophysiological and imaging techniques is necessary to assess the natural history of such manifestations and the effect of antiviral treatment...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that complement {{is important in}} the host response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was tested. Complement C 4 and Bf allotypes were determined in 26 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for <b>persistent</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> due to HIV, 72 homosexuals who were negative for antibody to HIV, and 185 control subjects drawn from the local population. HLA-A, B, and DR were also typed and the phenotypes examined for the presence of supratypes and C 4 BQ 0. Eleven patients (42 %) had C 4 B null alleles compared with only 13 (18 %) homosexuals who were negative for antibody and 28 (15 %) controls. From estimates of gene frequencies the difference between the patients with lymphadenopathy and the controls was significant after conservative correction. In the patients only a minority (six) of the C 4 B null alleles were contained within ancestral haplotypes. Together with the fact that C 4 null alleles result in partial deficiency of C 4, this finding suggests that products of complement genes are important in infection with HIV or its consequences, or both. A role is proposed for complement and Fc receptors...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{samples from}} 66 {{seropositive}} subjects (56 {{with a history}} of intravenous drug abuse), including asymptomatic carriers and patients with <b>persistent</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> (PGL), AIDS related complex (ARC), and AIDS, were tested by indirect immunofluorescence on rat tissue sections and HEp- 2 cells for the presence of antibodies to nuclei, smooth muscle, intermediate filaments (anti-IMF) and microfilaments (anti-MF). Counterimmunoelectrophoresis was also used to detect antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens. Smooth muscle antibodies with the V pattern or antinuclear antibodies, mainly of the speckled type, or anti-IMF, occurred in 35 cases, being widely distributed in all groups. Such an autoantibody response resembles the "viral" autoimmunity described in various infectious diseases and in particular that of non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis. Autoantibodies may be of some prognostic relevance, as the prevalence of smooth muscle antibodies V increased as the disease progressed (asymptomatic carriers 20 %, those with PGL 29 %, those with ARC 47 %, and those with AIDS 63 %. In the PGL group autoantibody positivity correlated with the presence of skin anergy. The fact that autoantibodies were more frequently detected in patients with circulating immune complexes suggests that these can contain autoantibodies and the corresponding autoantigens...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{function}} {{was measured in}} 169 male patients seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO) in symptom free patients and patients with <b>persistent</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> was normal (greater than 83 % of predicted values). Patients with the AIDS related complex, non-pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma, and non-pulmonary non-Kaposi sarcoma AIDS (that is, opportunist infections affecting other organs) had lower mean values for TLCO (77 %, 70 %, and 70 % of predicted respectively). These values were significantly lower than values for symptom free patients. Lower mean values of 50 % and 63 % predicted TLCO were observed in patients during the acute and recovery phases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. TLCO was also low in patients with lung mycobacterial infection and in a patient with lung Kaposi sarcoma. Forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow, and maximal expiratory flow at 50 % of vital capacity were significantly reduced only in patients with acute pneumocystis pneumonia. This study shows that abnormalities in the results of pulmonary function tests, particularly TLCO, although greatest in patients with pulmonary complications of AIDS, are also present in patients with AIDS but without other evidence of pulmonary disease, and in patients with the AIDS related complex. The predictive and prognostic implications of these findings require further investigation...|$|E

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{determine}} whether the routine measurement of lymphocyte transformation responses to mitogenic stimuli provide any information additional to that available from routine T cell CD 4 and CD 8 analysis in patients with HIV infection. METHODS [...] The case records of 197 immunologically investigated HIV seropositive patients were reviewed. The influence of disease stage on T lymphocyte subsets and lymphocyte transformation responses (LyTR) to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and Pokeweed mitogen was assessed. RESULTS [...] The median CD 3 and CD 4 counts and LyTR to PHA and Pokeweed mitogen were highest in patients with <b>persistent</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> (PGL) and decreased progressively in the order: asymptomatic patients, those with ARC, those with AIDS. LyTR to PHA was preserved in over 70 % of all patients, but the response to Pokeweed mitogen was depressed in 8 % of patients with PGL, 34 % of asymptomatic patients, 68 % of those with ARC and 78 % of those with AIDS. Subnormal values of both CD 4 + T cells and LyTR to Pokeweed mitogen were more common in patients with ARC and AIDS (68 %) than in those who were asymptomatic or had PGL (20 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] CD 4 T cell analysis and LyTR to Pokeweed mitogen, but not to PHA, both correlate with disease states in patients with HIV infection...|$|E

In neither case were micro-organisms isolated from the lesions, and in both patients healing occurred with immunosuppressive agents. Chronic dermal sinus formation secondary to lymph node disease has never before been recorded as a manifestation of histiocytosis X. Histiocytosis X should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of "suppurative" lymphadenopathy so that appropriate treatment may be given without delay...|$|R

40|$|A case of Cryptococcus neoformans {{meningitis}} {{is described}} in an HIV negative patient with undiagnosed systemic sarcoidosis. The patient presented with signs of meningitis together with <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> and hepatosplenomegaly. Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed on lumbar puncture.

Necropsy revealed lesions in the lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, small intestine, and bone marrow consistent with sarcoidosis. Microscopically the lesions contained non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas typical of sarcoidosis. No Schaumann or Hamazaki-Wesenberg bodies were identified. Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis is generally associated with immunosuppressive disorders. As T cell abnormalities have been described in sarcoidosis, {{this could have been}} a case of opportunistic infection.

40|$|Sixteen out of 48 adult African {{patients}} with Kaposi sarcoma {{were found to}} have tumour tissue in lymph nodes. The evidence suggests that there are probably two main types of involvement. One occurs predominantly in younger patients and involves many groups of glands, probably develops in situ, and is associated with a poor prognosis. The other form is the result of metastasis to a node from an aggressive tumour in the neighbourhood. This occurs more commonly in the older patient and carries a much better prognosis than in those with <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> though worse than in {{patients with}} nodular disease without gland involvement.

40|$|Fever and <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> is {{a common}} {{presentation}} {{of a variety of}} diseases and a thorough investigation is often necessary for appropriate diagnosis. We present a 53 -year-old male patient admitted with fever, weight loss of 15 [*]kg in 3 months and abdominal discomfort. Examination was only remarkable for axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Blood tests showed normocytic normochromic anaemia, cholestasis and a previously unknown HIV- 1 infection with lymphocyte CD 4 +count of 239 cells/mm(3) and viral load 3. 172. 370 copies/mL. A body CT scan showed multiple axillary, mediastinal, lumbar, aortic, iliac and pelvic lymphadenopathy as well as hepatosplenomegaly.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To characterise {{the natural}} history of sexually {{transmitted}} HIV-I infection in homosexual and bisexual men. DESIGN [...] Cohort study. SETTING [...] San Francisco municipal sexually transmitted disease clinic. PATIENTS [...] Cohort included 6705 homosexual and bisexual men originally recruited from 1978 to 1980 for studies of sexually transmitted hepatitis B. This analysis is of 489 cohort members who were either HIV-I seropositive on entry into the cohort (n = 312) or seroconverted during the study period and had {{less than or equal to}} 24 months between the dates of their last seronegative and first seropositive specimens (n = 177). A subset of 442 of these men was examined in 1988 or 1989 or had been reported to have developed AIDS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Development of clinical signs and symptoms of HIV-I infection, including AIDS, AIDS related complex, asymptomatic <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> and no signs or symptoms of infection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Of the 422 men examined in 1988 or 1989 or reported as having AIDS, 341 had been infected from 1977 to 1980; 49 % (167) of these men had died of AIDS, 10 % (34) were alive with AIDS, 19 % (65) had AIDS related complex, 3 % (10) had asymptomatic <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> and 19 % (34) had no clinical signs or symptoms of HIV-I infection. Cumulative risk of AIDS by duration of HIV-I infection was analysed for all 489 men by the Kaplan-Meier method. Of these 489 men, 226 (46 %) had been diagnosed as having AIDS. We estimated that 13 % of cohort members will have developed AIDS within five years of seroconversion, 51 % within 10 years, and 54 % within 11. 1 years. CONCLUSION [...] Our analysis confirming the importance of duration of infection to clinical state and the high risk of AIDS after infection underscores the importance of continuing efforts both to prevent transmission of HIV-I and to develop further treatments to slow or stall the progression of HIV-I infection to AIDS...|$|R
