40|$|The {{subject of}} this master thesis is the {{attention}} of general <b>practioners</b> to the domain of meaning (a sense of purpose) in their older patient population. The study aimed to provide knowledge and insights regarding the attention and sensitivity of general <b>practioners</b> to meaning during their work.

The following questions were asked in the study: How does coaches and young <b>practioners</b> of MMA experience that the sport affects the living conditions of individuals? Could MMA act as a protective factor in preventing social problems? What is the <b>practioners</b> point of view on the criticism of MMA and the risks of practioning MMA? The study was conducted through the qualitative research approach. Empirical data was collected through semi-structured interviews with <b>practioners</b> of an MMA club situated in an area with low socioeconomic status. The empirical material was analyzed based on a number of theoretical concepts, in wich the perspective of risk- and protective factors had an significant part. The result show that MMA could affect the living conditions of individuals in many ways, one of them is the coach as a supportive adult to young people. There are a number of social aspects associated to participation in MMA, as to acquire self-esteem and a social context. The young <b>practioners</b> does not agree on the criticism toward MMA of being brutal and adverse, instead they claim that MMA is characterized by humility and respect to your opponent. They admit that there are injuries following the practice of the sport, as in any sports, thus it is the social advantages that keeps them continuing to practice MMA...|$|R

5000|$|Ugo {{lived in}} Venice from 1509 to 1517, mostly working with woodcutting for book illustrations. Venice {{was one of}} the centers where {{printing}} took off, particularly the printing of illustrated books. In 1511, a number of woodcut book illustrations bearing the signature “Ugo” were published in Venice. In July of 1516, Ugo requested a patent from the Venetian senate for what he claimed to be his unique chiaroscuro technique. In his request he described the process as a [...] "new manner of printing light and dark." [...] He requested the copyright for an undefined period of time, and for all designs and woodcuts he had made and would make. Although Ugo was an early Italian <b>practioner</b> of chiarsocuro, there is evidence that this method had been previously used by German and Venetian printers. Ugo moved to Rome in 1517. There was a large print making circle in Rome and high demand for prints of Raphael’s work. There was a circle of engravers working around Raphael, whose prints were issued by a professional publisher, il Baviera. Due to il Baviera's tight control on the copper plates used to print Raphael's engravings, creating copies of Raphael's work became a common activity amongst engravers and printers in Rome. Ugo settled in Rome near Raphael's studio, but he worked independently of il Baviera. He set up a workshop in his house and printed and published blocks in his own shop. In 1518, he received a copyright from Pope Leo X for his four-block print The Death of the Ananias. This work, along with many more of Ugo's chioscuro works from this time period, are considered by scholars to be the best examples of [...] "truly reproductive prints." [...] Although Ugo was focused on reproducing and replicating sketches, engravings, and prints by other artists while in Rome, he began to develop his own unique style. An early example of this is present in Ugo's replications of Raphael's sketches, where he chose colors for his prints dissimilar to the ones used by Raphael.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our essay is to {{investigate}} {{the role of the}} practice period under supervision from a skilled <b>practioner</b> {{as a part of the}} student’s development of knowledge. This essay’s main participants are students who are studying their sixth semester during the spring 2009 at the bachelor program of social work at the University of Gothenburg and active skilled practioners during the autumn of 2008 and spring 2009. The essay has primarily a qualitative approach. Our main method is in-depth interviews towards the students and as a complement a webb-based survey towards the skilled practioners. The results show that the practice period under supervision from skilled <b>practioner</b> major function is to create an integration of theory and practice to the students who undertake the practice period. The practice period give the students an insight that the education establishes a foundation to emerge from when time is due for the student to move ahead to future working life. It is hardly possible to learn everything during the course of studies at the bachelor program of social work in Gothenburg and needed sought-for competence the students can develop when they are working professionally in the field of social work. Answers from our informants show that the practice period under supervision from skilled <b>practioner</b> also has a socializing function for the student where they on a daily base under reflection together with the skilled <b>practioner</b> can be part of an organization culture. The linguistic conceptions also give the students a deeper understanding in comparison to mere theoretical studies. From our study we also conclude that there is a need for reflection concerning both performance in general and also over the use of theory. This is made possible during the practice period under supervision in a deeper sense compared to regular studies the students have accomplished earlier at the University. You cannot reduce the fact that there is a distance between academy and practical social work. Through the practice period under supervision from skilled <b>practioner,</b> it is possible that the student can constitute a stepping-stone between academy and the labour market of social work. The results show this through the fact that students supply the field of social work, in the best of case, with another way of looking at the practice and new theory, which may lead to reflection and transformation of knowledge on the behalf of the skilled <b>practioner.</b> The skilled <b>practioner</b> provide the student with perspectives and experience, which accompanies the student during the rest of the university studies. It is questionable if the interaction between academy and practical social work is sufficient enough. Several informants in both survey-groups point out that there is a division between the academy and practical social work and they see advantages with more ways of collaboration between both parties. Among the student informants the answers in favour towards a longer practice period varies in different directions. Some students bring forward the argument of two practice periods of varied proportion in different fields of social work, to broaden the experience. On the other hand some students sees today’s practice of one semester period under supervision from a skilled <b>practioner</b> sufficient enough. Among the skilled practioners a majority considers that the students should practice more. This result can possibly be related to the fact that a large amount of the skilled practioners considers today’s education in Gothenburg not enough prepares the student in a sufficient manner for the coming working years. Theoretical knowledge ranks highly in both survey groups and they consider that it would not be a positive development if theoretical knowledge should be superseded at the expense of a larger proportion of supervised practice. The is also the case in both survey groups connected to the fact that the bachelor program of social work in Gothenburg is prolonged in 2010. A more important change would perhaps be to look at the educational structure where the theoretical factors more continuously takes turn with own performance among the students, where they are trained in the integration between theory and practice. There is a proposal of redesigning the third semester at the bachelor program in the near future. The intention is to take turn between theory and practice in a greater extent compared with today’s third semester. In this way the students are given an opportunity to integrate theory and practice more regularly during the third semester, taking turn between social theory, practice and philosophy of science together with skilled practioners, teachers and students...|$|E
