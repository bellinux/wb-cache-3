40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Re-engineering is {{an ongoing}} process of change that {{continues}} throughout a person's life. It includes all aspects of life, even your career and lifestyle as you continue to grow as an individual. There is no satisfaction or of self-fulfilment in clinging to a career and its accompanying lifestyle which you have outgrown. To change this, people should approach career planning and management from {{a different point of}} view. The making of a career and lifestyle change is something most people find horrendously difficult. Making effective career and lifestyle changes incorporating your dream and passion should be seen as a challenge. There is a common denominator in this whole discussion which influences the decisions that people make when it comes to choosing their careers. It boils down to wanting to make a success of their lives and the fear of being a failure. But how does one define success? Success can mean different things to different people. For some, monetary reward is a measure of success. Yet others have multiple definitions of success. People should first determine their own definition of success before deciding what career they would like to pursue. Many of us make this decision based on what other people, such as our parents or friends, perceive as success. Exploring career choices should be a positive undertaking for high school students. A thoughtfully constructed career choice process will provide a meaningful, productive and satisfying framework for making quality career choices. Some students do not begin to explore real career possibilities until after graduation. Tertiary education institutions should provide students with relevant information earlier in their studies. Institutions could be more proactive, giving students information that they could test and use in their daily studies and ultimately apply to their choice of career. Young adults turn to their career guidance counsellors in their schools for advice on determining what career paths they should follow. The problem within the South African public educational system currently is that there is inadequate provision for career guidance or assessment of individual learners. The majority of young people leave school with only a vague knowledge of employment opportunities and with little insight concerning the career direction most appropriate to their abilities, interests and personality. Believing that their only chance of future employment is the attainment of some sort of qualification, they are <b>pitch-forked</b> into tertiary education without any consideration given to the appropriateness of their chosen qualification to their abilities, interests and personality. This results in a large percentage of employees who feel trapped in an inappropriate career. This leads to low morale, disinterest and de-motivation, translating into poor performance and bad service levels. In the end unhappy employees either leave of their own free will or need to be dismissed. In either case, the cost to the business is substantial. When it comes to making a career change in order to follow your dream and passion, people are normally shackled by the comfort and security they experience in their current jobs and the fear of failing should they risk following their dream. The decision to make a career change should follow a formal process in order to enable a person to make an informed and responsible career change. The value to the researcher personally is that he will {{have a better understanding of}} why he decided to change his career. Is it a real choice or is it only a pipe dream that will eventually fade away because of the challenges facing him in the future?Master...|$|R

50|$|A linhay (English: , -nee) {{is a type}} of farm {{building}} found particularly in Devon, south-west England. It is characterised as a two-storied building with an open front, with tallet or hay-loft above and livestock housing below. It often has a lean-to roof, and the front generally consists of regularly spaced pillars or columns. Cattle linhays were used to house cattle in the winter with hay storage above. Due to the wide open front hay was easily thrown up into the tallet by use of a <b>pitch-fork</b> by a man standing on a hay-cart for storage after haymaking operations. The hay was kept dry by the roof {{and at the same time}} acted as insulation for the livestock below and was easily fed as daily rations to the cattle below by dropping it through openings in the floor directly into hay racks accessible to the livestock. A cart linhay stored carts and other farm machinery in place of livestock, with hay above. Linhays are now largely obsolete as in England cattle are generally housed in large pole barns with corrugated iron or plastic roofs and are fed silage, either in large round bales or in troughs, chopped up by machinery. These modern structures make possible feeding and mucking-out with large tractors.|$|E

He goes {{on to explain that}} a simple farmer, armed with a <b>pitch-fork</b> and who had lost his wife to the vampires, trekked his way to the temple of the vampires, where he saw many other unfortunate women strapped to tables, waiting for their blood to be drained.

He is unsuccessful as his wife is killed in the fight, but in the chaos, he grabbed a bat-like medallion from around one of the vampire's necks, which he sees as the vampires' life source. Defeated, the farmer flees the temple, but the High Priest orders the vampires after him. After they leave on horseback, the High Priest summons the vampire's former victims: the 'Undead' from their graves to aid the seven vampires. Still carrying the medallion, the farmer places it around a small model of a Jade Buddha. He knocks desperately on the locked village gates, but it is in vain. The vampires and their undead catch up with him and kill him. One of the vampires spies the medallion around the Buddha and goes over to collect it. The moment the vampire touched the Buddha, the creature is destroyed in flames.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Here we {{consider}} stationary states for nonlinear Schrödinger equations with symmetric double well potentials. These stationary states may bifurcate as {{the strength of}} the nonlinear term increases and we observe two different pictures depending on the value of the nonlinearity power: a simple <b>pitch-fork</b> bifurcation, and a couple of saddle points which unstable branches collapse in an inverse <b>pitch-fork</b> bifurcation. In this paper we show that in the semiclassical limit, or when the barrier between the two wells is large enough, the first kind of bifurcation always occurs when the nonlinearity power is less than a critical value (2); in contrast, when the nonlinearity power is larger than such a critical value then we always observe the second scenario. The remarkable fact is that such a critical value is an universal constant {{in the sense that it}} does not depends on the shape of the double well potential.

40|$|Atomic-size vortex beams {{have great}} {{potential}} in probing materials' magnetic moment at atomic scales. However, the limited {{depth of field}} of vortex beams constrains the probing depth in which the helical phase front is preserved. On the other hand, electron channeling in crystals can counteract beam divergence and extend the vortex beam without disrupting its topological charge. Specifically, in this paper, we report atomic vortex beams with topological charge ± 1 can be coupled to the 2 p columnar bound states and propagate for more 50 nm without being dispersed and losing its helical phase front. We gave numerical solutions to the 2 p columnar orbitals and tabulated the characteristic size of the 2 p states of two typical elements, Co and Dy, for various incident beam energies and various atomic densities. The tabulated numbers allow estimates of the optimal convergence angle for maximal coupling to 2 p columnar orbital.

40|$|Abstract. Alfvén {{eigenmodes}} (AEs) {{excited by}} fusion born α particles can degrade the heating efficiency of a burning plasma and throw out αs. To experimentally study {{the effects of}} excitation of AEs and the redistribution of the fast ions, ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) is often used. The distribution function of thermonuclear αs in a reactor is expected to be isotropic and constantly renewed through DT reactions. The distribution function of cyclotron heated ions is strongly anisotropic, and the ICRH do not only renew the distribution function but also provide a strong decorrelation mechanism between the fast ions and the AE. Because of the sensitivity of the AE dynamics on the details of the distribution function, the location of the resonance surfaces in phase space and the extent of the overlapping resonant regions for different AEs, a self-consistent treatment of the AE excitation and the ICRH is necessary. Interactions of fast ions with AEs during ICRH has been implemented in the SELFO code. Simulations are in good agreement with the experimentally observer <b>pitch-fork</b> splitting and rapid damping of the AE as ICRH is turned off. The redistribution of fast ions have been studied in the presence of several driven AEs. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{an elastic}} system that is non-conservative but autonomous, {{subjected}} for example to time-independent loading by a steadily flowing fluid (air or water), a dangerous bifurcation, such as a sub-critical bifurcation, or a cyclic fold, will trigger a dynamic jump {{to one or more}} remote stable attractors. When {{there is more than one}} candidate attractor, the one onto which the structure settles can then be indeterminate, being sensitive to infinitesimally small variations in starting conditions or parameters. In this paper we develop and study an archetypal model to explore the nonlinear dynamic interactions between galloping at an incipient sub-critical Hopf bifurcation of a structure with shell-like buckling behaviour that is gravity-loaded to approach a sub-critical <b>pitch-fork</b> bifurcation. For the fluid forces, we draw on the aerodynamic coefficients determined experimentally by Novak for the flow around a bluff body of rectangular cross-section. Meanwhile, for the structural component, we consider a variant of the propped-cantilever model that is widely used to illustrate the sub-critical pitch-fork: within this model a symmetry-breaking imperfection makes the behaviour generic. The compound bifurcation corresponding to simultaneous galloping and buckling is the so-called Takens-Bodganov Cusp. We make a full unfolding of this codimension- 3 bifurcation for our archetypal model to explore the adjacent phase-space topologies and their indeterminacies...|$|E
