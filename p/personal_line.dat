25|$|Non-directional and hybrid <b>personal</b> <b>line</b> markers {{are used}} to {{indicate}} {{the identity of a}} diver who has passed along the line and has not yet returned to that point. They are attached to the line {{in the same way as}} cave arrows, and are deployed on the way into the cave, usually at critical points such as forks or jumps, and {{are used to}} indicate to other divers that someone is further in along the line. They are marked to identify the diver, and are recovered by the diver on the way out. Cookies (round markers), Rectangular referencing exit markers and clothes pegs are used for this purpose. The round and rectangular markers are attached to the line in the same way as arrows, and may be personalised in any way that the owners can easily recognise. Colour is often used, but as there are a limited number of standard colours available, and they are often poorly distinguishable in the dark, modifications to shape may be used which can be recognised by touch.|$|E

I have another book to put together and transcribe, and then must begin the composition part {{of one or two}} more books, I suppose. I must be ready for printing by the time we go to England, in June. Robert too is much occupied with 'Sordello,'[49] and we neither of us receive anybody till past four o'clock. I mean that when you have read my new book, you put away all my other poems or most of them, and know me only by the new. Oh, I am so anxious to make it good. I have put much of myself in it--I mean to say, of my soul, my thoughts, emotions, opinions; in other respects, there is not a <b>personal</b> <b>line,</b> of course. It's a sort of poetic art-novel. If it's a failure, there will be the comfort of having made a worthy effort, of having done it as well as I could. Write soon to me, and love us both constantly, as we do you.|$|E

5000|$|Soon Drake began {{drilling}} for oil in Titusville, near the shores of Oil Creek, but at first met with little success. He used an old steam engine to drill. Many of his drilling sites only yielded trace amounts of oil. He and his assistant, blacksmith Billy Smith, endured fires, financial setbacks, and the ridicule of the local inhabitants. When the Seneca Oil Company gave up and decided to withdraw its funding, Drake obtained a <b>personal</b> <b>line</b> of credit to continue digging. On August 27, 1859, Drake struck oil at 69 ft below ground, just before his funds ran out. This {{marked the beginning of}} drastic change for the people of Western Pennsylvania.

50|$|Little {{is known}} about Ammonius's role in the {{development}} of Neoplatonism.
