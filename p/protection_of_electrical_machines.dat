40|$|This master's thesis {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} of grounding systems in HV/LV distribution networks, which includes grounding system of distribution substation and transmission lines. Explores the issue and principles for the measurement of parameters, which are important {{for the protection of}} persons and animals in order not to touch exposed conductive part accidentally, <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>machines</b> and equipment against high fault current and dangerous surges while the correct function of the connected electrical equipment is maintained. These parameters include earth potential rise, ground resistance, soil resistivity, touch voltage, step voltage and transferred potential to the LV network. The aim of this work is the preparation, analysis and subsequent evaluation for the real measurement in practice. These earthing-system measurements were carried out at the distribution station and the concrete pole with a section disconnector. Then a numerical model of the grounding system of concrete pole was created in ANSYS. Subsequent evaluation of the results as numerical terms (comparison measurements and simulated results) and evaluation in terms of analytical (measurement results compliance with the standard) including the numerical model of the earthing system is solved in the practical part of the master's thesis...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{overload}} relays are economic electromechanical protection devices which offers reliable protection for electric motors {{in the event}} of overload or phase failure. Presently {{there are two types of}} {{overload relays}} which depend on the temperature characteristics of metals to provide protection by tripping the circuit. These relays lack accuracy as they do not activate the trip circuit at any exact specified temperature. In this paper we introduce a new form of thermal over-load relay actuated by ferrofluid. The ferrofluid has a very accurate transition temperature known as curie temperature. It acts as a ferromagnetic material below the curie temperature and loses the property of ferromagnetism above this temperature. By using this property of the fluid we propose an alternative method for more accurate operation under overload condition. This relay finds application in the <b>protection</b> system <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>machines.</b> Thus, in this paper we present a novel and simple technique for protection against thermal overloading using ferrofluid...|$|R

30|$|Synchronous Generators are the {{majority}} source <b>of</b> commercial <b>electrical</b> energy. The failure of SGs cause severe {{damage to the}} <b>machine,</b> interruption <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> supply, and ensuing economic loss. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} have a protection system that is able to detect and diagnose all credible faults and provide effective protection for the SG to increase their useful life and reliability. Internal faults present a real challenge for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> machines; especially ground faults in case of high impedance grounding as they are not detectable by differential relays, the most commonly devices used for generator protection. Hence, a reliable and accurate diagnosis of internal faults is still a challenging problem in the area of fault diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>machines</b> [1]. This fact has motivated many works over long period to develop various protection techniques [2 – 13] include digital, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other machine learning techniques.|$|R
