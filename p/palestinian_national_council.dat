5|$|From 1977 until 1991, Said was an {{independent}} {{member of the}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (PNC). In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (PNC) {{convened in}} Cairo on 3 February 1969, Yahya Hammuda {{stepped down from}} his {{chairmanship}} of the PLO. Arafat was elected chairman on 4 February. He became Commander-in-Chief of the Palestinian Revolutionary Forces two years later, and in 1973, became {{the head of the}} PLO's political department.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords calling for Palestinian {{administration}} of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Habash {{experienced}} failing health, {{and gradually}} {{began to lose}} influence within the organization. The <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council's</b> (PNC) adoption of a resolution viewed by the PFLP as a two-state solution in 1974, prompted Habash to lead his organization out of active participation in the PLO and to join the Iraqi-backed Rejectionist Front. Only in 1977 would the PFLP opt to rejoin, as the Palestinian factions rallied their forces in opposition to Anwar Sadat's overtures towards Israel, pro-U.S. policies and fragmentation of the Arab world. During the Lebanese Civil War that broke out in 1975, PFLP forces were decimated in battle against Syria. Later, the PFLP would draw close to Syria, as Syria's government shifted, but PFLP involvement in the Lebanese war remained strong until the U.S.-negotiated evacuation of PLO units from Beirut in 1982, and continued {{on a smaller scale}} after that.|$|R
50|$|Met with fierce {{criticism}} by many <b>Palestinian</b> factions, the <b>National</b> <b>Council's</b> first session in nearly 20 {{years had been}} postponed indefinitely. The Executive Committee members who announced their resignation were to continue to hold their positions until the PNC meets.|$|R
50|$|Adnan Ghaleb al-Husayni (عدنان غالب الحسيني) (1947-) is the Palestinian {{governor}} of Jerusalem {{and of the}} Jerusalem Governorate, Waqf supervisor and {{also a member of}} the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> Authority Higher <b>Council</b> of Tourism. He belongs to the well-known al-Husayni clan of Jerusalem, where he was born.|$|R
5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The {{agreement}} called for Palestinian {{administration of the}} Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city.

5|$|As {{a public}} intellectual, Said was a {{controversial}} {{member of the}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples. Said advocated {{the establishment of a}} Palestinian state to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, including the right of return to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the status quo as the remit of the public intellectual who has “to sift, to judge, to criticize, to choose, so that choice and agency return to the individual” man and woman.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of a {{coalition}} of Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored {{by any of the}} involved Arab states, such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and the Palestine Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him staking command of al-Assifa, holding major positions in the PNC, and the Supreme Military Council of the PLO. He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 {{a village}} council was {{established}} to administer local affairs. Its nine members are appointed by the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> Authority. The <b>council</b> maintains a permanent headquarters and owns a waste collection vehicle. Among its responsibilities are building water and electricity networks in al-Jiftlik and providing an ambulance for the village.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{a village}} council was {{established}} to administer Khirbet Abu Falah's civil affair. The council has nine members appointed by the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> Authority. The <b>council</b> is {{also included in the}} Joint Services Council, which is a cooperative board that also includes the villages of al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya, Kafr Malik and al-Mughayyir.|$|R
50|$|Dahlan was a Fatah {{representative}} in negotiations {{which resulted in}} the Fatah-Hamas Mecca Agreement of February 8, 2007, in which both sides agreed to stop the military clashes in Gaza and form a government of national unity. In March 2007, despite objections from Hamas, Dahlan was appointed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to lead the newly re-established <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> Security <b>Council,</b> overseeing all security forces in the Palestinian territories. Dahlan organised paramilitary units of several thousand fighters trained with American assistance in Arab countries, and lobbied Israel to allow Fatah forces in Gaza to receive large shipments of arms and ammunition to fight Hamas.|$|R
5|$|Arafat {{was born}} to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where {{he spent most of}} his youth and studied at the University of King Fuad I. While a student, he embraced Arab {{nationalist}} and anti-Zionist ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Returning to Cairo, he served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956. In the latter part of the 1950s he co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organisation seeking the disestablishment of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. In the latter part of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the PLO and in 1969 was elected chair of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon. There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions.|$|E
25|$|He {{announced}} his resignation {{as leader of}} the PLO on 22 August 2015. As of December 2015, he was still acting as Chairman, pending approval by the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Habash was {{evicted from}} Jordan {{due to the}} key role of the Popular Front in the Black September clashes. In 1974, the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> adopted a {{resolution}} recognizing a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Habash, who opposed this, formed the Rejectionist Front from several other opposition parties.|$|E
50|$|In {{the latest}} {{municipal}} elections in Halhul in 2004, held by <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> Authority, 13 <b>council</b> members were elected {{to replace the}} very long-serving council headed by Mohammed Milhim. The newly elected council members elected engineer Raed al-Atrash who, managed to restructure the municipality and introduce new faces to the serving staff. After Atrash's resignation, the council elected deputy Ziad Abu Yousef as the new mayor. The council has two women in the female seats.|$|R
50|$|The Russia-Hamas {{talks of}} 2006 began on 3 March 2006, when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal {{to discuss the}} future of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process after Hamas became the {{majority}} party of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> Authority Legislative <b>Council,</b> having won a majority of seats in the Palestinian elections. Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and is banned in Jordan.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 February 2007 Saudi-sponsored {{negotiations}} in Mecca produced {{an agreement on}} a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>national</b> unity government. The agreement was signed by Mahmoud Abbas on behalf of Fatah and Khaled Mashal on behalf of Hamas. The new government was called on to achieve <b>Palestinian</b> <b>national</b> goals as approved by the Palestine <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> the clauses of the Basic Law and the National Reconciliation Document (the [...] "Prisoners' Document") {{as well as the}} decisions of the Arab summit.|$|R
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Arab {{countries}} in the Six-Day War prompted fractured Palestinian political and militant groups to give up any remaining hope they had placed in pan-Arabism. In July 1968 armed, non-state actors such as Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine achieved {{the majority of the}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> votes, and on February 3, 1969, at the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> in Cairo, the leader of the Fatah, Yasser Arafat was elected as the chairman of the PLO. From the start, the organization used armed violence against civilian and military targets in the conflict with Israel. The PLO tried to take over the population of the West Bank, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deported them into Jordan, where they began to act against the Jordanian rule (Palestinians in Jordan comprised about 70% of the total population, which mostly consisted of refugees) and from there attacked Israel numerous times, using the infiltration of terrorists and shooting Katyusha rockets. This led to retaliations from Israel.|$|E
2500|$|The All-Palestine Government was {{declared}} in Gaza on 22 September, {{in a way}} as a countermeasure against Jordan. According to Moshe Ma'oz this was [...] "a mere tool to justify Cairo’s occupation of the Gaza Strip". Pre-conference by the Arab League obtained an agreement to have Ahmad Hilmi Pasha preside over the government, while giving al-Husseini a nominal role, devoid of responsibilities. A <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> was convened in Gaza on 30 September 1948, under the chairmanship of Amin al-Husseini. On 30 September, al-Husseini was elected unanimously as President, but had no authority outside the areas controlled by Egypt. The council passed a series of resolutions culminating on 1 October 1948 with a declaration of independence over the whole of Palestine, with Jerusalem as its capital.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase {{has been}} widely cited by {{politicians}} and political activists objecting to Zionist claims, including the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, who stated that [...] "Palestine is not a land without a people for a people without a land!" [...] On 13 November 1974, PLO leader Yasir Arafat told the United Nations, [...] "It pains our people greatly to witness the propagation of the myth that its homeland was a desert until it was made to bloom by the toil of foreign settlers, {{that it was a}} land without a people". In its 14 November 1988 [...] "Declaration of Independence", the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> accused [...] "local and international forces" [...] of [...] "attempts to propagate the lie that 'Palestine is a land without a people.'" [...] Salman Abu Sitta, {{founder and president of the}} Palestine Land Society, calls the phrase [...] "a wicked lie in order to make the Palestinian people homeless". Hanan Ashrawi has called this phrase evidence that the Zionists, [...] "sought to deny the very existence and humanity of the Palestinians".|$|E
5000|$|On 8 February 2007, {{negotiations}} in Mecca brokered by Saudi Arabia produced the Fatah-Hamas Mecca Agreement, {{an agreement to}} form a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>national</b> unity government.

5|$|The two-story IDF outpost sat {{northwest}} of the junction. Two six-story Palestinian blocks (known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments) lay directly behind it. South of the junction, diagonally across from the IDF, there was a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> Security Forces outpost {{under the command of}} Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the Palestine <b>National</b> <b>Council.</b> The concrete wall that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was in front of this building; the spot was less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli outpost.|$|R
2500|$|Al-Hout {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the Palestinian Liberation Front (PLF) in 1961, the Palestinian faction which he {{supported}} throughout his life. Through al-Hawadeth as a platform, al-Hout was able to start the underground political movement and issued a monthly newsletter titled Tariq al-Awda, or [...] "The Path of Return," [...] which until 1964 was printed at al-Hawadeth Printing House. Prior to that, he helped establish the PLF's newspaper Abtal al-Awda ("Heroes of the Return") in 1960. Membership in the PLF increased steadily and according to al-Hout, by 1964 it included [...] "newcomers from the refugee camps in Lebanon, Kuwait, Syria, Jordan, Amman, the West Bank, as well as people belonging to the different Palestinian classes, ranging from simple workers to teachers and engineers." [...] Their stated aim was to struggle for the liberation of Palestine" [...] and emphasize the Arab character of that cause. Al-Hout later served as Deputy Secretary-General of the Arab Journalists Union in 1963 and held this post until 1967. He formed an alliance with Ahmed Shukeiri, the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and attended the first conference by the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (PNC) in Jerusalem in May 1964, becoming an original founder.
