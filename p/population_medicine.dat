40|$|Public health {{measures}} {{are still the}} most important factor in improving Third World health. However, medicines have an important part to play, and it is now generally agreed that for the very poor <b>populations</b> <b>medicines</b> should be restricted to those on an 'essential drugs list' and should be made available as cheaply as possible. A major problem arises, however, in trying to stop these very cheap supplies 'leaking' back into the private sector, and being sold to the public at high prices. This is particularly true as many countries have a large rich urban elite as well as a much larger poor rural population. It is also important to recognise that research into Third World diseases must be financed by profits on the sale of medicines in advanced countries. A 'cheap drug' policy in rich countries can be very harmful to the long-term health even of the less developed countries. medicines essential drugs Third World health economics...|$|R

30|$|Public {{health is}} the science or art of {{preventing}} disease, prolonging life and promoting health and efficiency through organized community effort (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2008). The roles of pharmacists {{in public health}} include but no limited to the following: population-based care; disease prevention and medication safety; health education including patient education programs on safe and effective medication use and other public health-related topics; public health policy development; research and training (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2008 American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 1997). The use of medicines is {{an essential component of}} many public health programs (PHPs) that are designed to improve the health of a target <b>population.</b> <b>Medicines</b> are important because of their capacity to treat and prevent diseases and to support PHPs. They are also important because the confidence of the public in the health policies of their countries is inevitably linked to their confidence in the availability of safe and effective medicines and the measures for ensuring their rational use. This requires a robust pharmacy services component as a fundamental part of all public health programs. Despite this fact, pharmacy services component receives little or no attention in most public health programs in most developing countries.|$|R
