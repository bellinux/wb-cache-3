2500|$|Amongst the {{earliest}} uses of biotechnology in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>manufacturing</b> {{is the use}} of recombinant DNA technology to modify Escherichia coli bacteria to produce human insulin, which was performed at Genentech in 1978. [...] Prior to the development of this technique, insulin was extracted from the pancreas glands of cattle, pigs, and other farm animals. [...] While generally efficacious in the treatment of diabetes, animal-derived insulin is not indistinguishable from human insulin, and may therefore produce allergic reactions. Genentech researchers produced artificial genes for each of the two protein chains that comprise the insulin molecule. [...] The artificial genes were [...] "then inserted... into plasmids... among a group of genes that" [...] are activated by lactose. [...] Thus, the insulin-producing genes were also activated by lactose. [...] The recombinant plasmids were inserted into Escherichia coli bacteria, which were [...] "induced to produce 100,000 molecules of either chain A or chain B human insulin." [...] The two protein chains were then combined to produce insulin molecules.|$|E
