The potential for agricultural input manufacturers to develop an online business-to-business (B 2 B) model may provide {{a new source of}} revenue by reaching an underserved market. Underserved markets are those which a company’s primary brand is not reaching a certain customer base. The following thesis was conducted for a client (Company A) to determine the feasibility of increasing one point of market share in corn seed through an online and phone based sales model. In recent years, consolidation among agricultural seed companies, along with product performance, has driven swings in market share. Gaining one point of market share in corn seed is equivalent to 376, 000 units. Company A believes there is opportunity to gain one percentage <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> in the corn seed industry through online and phone-based sales. FC, an online and phone based seed company, held approximately one percentage <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> before being purchased by Company B in 2007. Company B then retired the FC brand in 2012. FC was once successful in their e-commerce based strategy; however three dominant factors impacted the development of agriculture companies conducting business online. Those factors are: 1) industry structure, 2) product complexity, and 3) the hightouch nature of transactions in agriculture. Research regarding e-commerce in agriculture has been limited over the past few years. With the increase in Internet access through wireless modems and mobile broadband data plans, opportunity exists for agricultural businesses to develop e-commerce B 2 B marketing. Research reported here focused on exploring the feasibility of selling a corn seed brand online and by phone, only. The steps to address the feasibility were to identify the target market and market opportunities and, then, address opportunities and challenges a company could face developing such a business...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of a webGIS service platform dedicated to the management and sharing of climatological data acquired by high elevation stations {{is the core of}} the Station at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE) GeoNetwork project, promoted by the Ev-K 2 CNR Committee. The web platform basically will provide three types of services: structured metadata archive, data and results from high-altitude environments research and projects; access to high-altitude Ev-K 2 CNR stations and creation of a network of existing stations; dedicated webGIS for geo-referenced data collected during the research. High elevation environmental and territorial data and metadata are catalogued in a single integrated platform to get access to the information heritage of the SHARE project, using open-source tools: Geonetwork for the metadata catalogue and webGIS resources, and the open-source Weather and Water Database (WDB), developed by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, for the database information system implementation. The information system is designed to have a main node, with the possibility to install relocated subsystems based on the same technology, named focal <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>SHARE,</b> which will contain metadata and data connected to the main node. In this study, a new structure of metadata for the description of the climatological stations is proposed and WDB adaptation and data preprocessing are described in detail, giving code and script samples...|$|E
40|$|Wear is {{the most}} {{important}} problem of moldboard plowshares. Because of cutting the soil, intensity of wear at the front portion of share is large and the effect of its wear on plow performance is considerable. In this research wear of the front portion of moldboard plowshares with respect to distance worked was studied. Wear of cylindrical specimens which were attached to the front portion of plowshares of a semimounted four-bottom moldboard plow was determined in five equally distance interval. The soil was silty clay loam with 13 - 15 % moisture content and the distance worked was 250 kilometers. Statistical analysis of the data indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} in the amount of wear of the four shares. In other words, they wore down simultaneously. The wear intensity of shares decreased with increasing distance worked i. e., the amount of weight reduction being highest during the initial period of operation. This may be attributed to “work hardening” due to severe plastic deformation during wear. Two mathematical models based on regression analysis were developed for predicting wear in the front portion of plowshare. The relationship of wear with respect to the distance worked can be expressed by an exponential function having a 0. 75 exponent and the relationship of wear at the front edge of shares with respect to distance from <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> by a second order function with determination coefficient of 0. 93 Nearly 75 % of the total wear in the front edges occurred in the 1. 3 length of shares from the tip...|$|E

40|$|Certain {{linguistic}} devices play {{a central}} role in facilitating the exchange of thoughts between the speaker and the listener in natural communication. These devices are designed to control the ebb and flow of knowledge, belief, narration, and assertion during both planned and unplanned discourse. The collection of such devices constitutes what I call the "point-sharing system. " From the speaker's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, the function <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>sharing</b> is realized through point making, because each attempt by the speaker to share his thoughts with his listener involves the making of a "point. " From the listener's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, the function <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>sharing</b> is realized through point using, because the listener takes the points that have been presented by the speaker and uses them to alter his own cognitive structures. When we wish to speak about both point making and point using, we can talk about the overall function <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>sharing.</b> In other papers, Elizabeth Bates and I have examined the development <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>sharing</b> in children (Bates and MacWhinney, 1979) and the theoretical place of functionalist grammar within modern-day psy-cholinguistics (Bates and MacWhinney, 1982 a).

Henry II Jasomirgott was named Duke of Austria in compensation for his loss of Bavaria. As {{part of his}} general policy of concessions of formal power to the German princes and ending the civil wars within the kingdom, Frederick further appeased Henry by issuing him with the Privilegium Minus, granting him unprecedented entitlements as Duke of Austria.
