5|$|In the 1980s, the Conservancy began a {{gene bank}} {{designed}} {{to preserve the}} genetic material of rare breeds.

It maintains a close relationship with the NAGP, including assisting in the collection of genetic material from additional rare breeds. The conservation list published by the Conservancy is also used by the SVF Foundation, an organization that uses cryopreservation to preserve germplasm from rare breeds.

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E

5|$|Recent biographies {{show that}} historians differ about whether Emmeline Pankhurst's militancy helped or hurt the movement; however, {{there is general}} {{agreement}} that the WSPU raised <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the movement in ways that proved essential. Baldwin compared her to Martin Luther and Jean-Jacques Rousseau: individuals who were not {{the sum total of}} the movements in which they took part, but who nevertheless played crucial roles in struggles of social and political reform. In the case of Pankhurst, this reform took place in both intentional and unintentional ways. By defying the roles of wife and mother as the docile companion, Pankhurst paved the way for feminists who would later decry her support for empire and sustainable social values.|$|E

At George Stephenson's insistence new locomotives bought by the L were fitted with handbrakes from 1831.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points out}} that From Russia, with Love was written and published {{at a time when}} tensions between East and West were on the rise and <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the Cold War was high.

The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour, an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers.
