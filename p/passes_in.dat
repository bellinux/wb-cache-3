5|$|Entering {{his senior}} year, many scouts had Croyle ranked {{as high as}} the #2 quarterback in the country behind Joe Mauer, who would go on to play Major League Baseball. However, Croyle's high school career ended {{abruptly}} in the first game of his senior season against Glencoe High School after a hit by an opposing player tore Croyle's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), causing him to miss the remainder of his senior year. When he graduated, he held the Alabama state records for career passing yards with 9,323, and career touchdowns with 105.

5|$|The metal-rich {{white dwarf}} WD 1145+017 {{is the first}} white dwarf {{observed}} with a disintegrating minor planet which transits the star.

5|$|Tittle was {{the fourth}} player to throw seven {{touchdown}} <b>passes</b> <b>in</b> a game, when he did so in 1962 against the Redskins. He followed Sid Luckman (1943), Adrian Burk (1954), and George Blanda (1961). The feat has since been equaled by four more players: Joe Kapp (1969), Peyton Manning (2013), Nick Foles (2013), and Drew Brees (2015). Tittle, Manning and Foles did it without an interception. His 36 touchdown <b>passes</b> <b>in</b> 1963 set a record which stood for over two decades until it was surpassed by Dan Marino in 1984; as of 2016 it remains a Giants franchise record.|$|E

5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing in brightness as one star <b>passes</b> <b>in</b> front of the other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Barman drew on {{data and}} {{measurements}} taken by Heather Knutson, {{a student at}} Harvard University, from the Hubble Space Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in {{the atmosphere of the}} planet. The planet orbits its parent star every three and a half days, and each time it <b>passes</b> <b>in</b> front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.|$|E

To the left of Skeppsholmen are two small islets, which are today merged into the peninsula of Blasieholmen. Behind these islands are Djurgården (right), Östermalm, and Norra Djurgården (left).

In his first game as a college halfback, Chappuis completed seven of eighteen passes for a gain of 80yards, and also rushed for 49yards in a 9–0 win over the Great Lakes Naval Training Station.

5|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Chicago Rockets 41–21 at Chicago's Soldier Field {{to extend the}} team's winning streak to four games. The Browns scored a {{touchdown}} {{in the first quarter}} and two more in the second. The team led 27–0 at the half. Chicago, however, started to come back in the third quarter after Cleveland coach Paul Brown took out most of his first-string players. Graham, Colella, Lew Mayne and Ed Ulinski sat out most of the game. Chicago quarterback Sam Vacanti threw three touchdown <b>passes</b> <b>in</b> the second half to give the Rockets 21 points, but a score by Cleveland's Boedeker and a fumble return for a touchdown by Spiro Dellerba kept the game out of reach. The Rockets' Bill Kellagher intercepted one of Graham's <b>passes</b> <b>in</b> the first quarter, ending Graham's streak of 91 straight pass attempts without an interception, a professional football record at the time. Chicago had the best passing performance against the Browns of any team the Browns had faced in 1947 as Vacanti threw for 195 yards on 11 completions. Groza kicked through two field goals and five extra points in the game, putting him in third place in scoring in the AAFC behind Motley and New York's Spec Sanders. Motley suffered a head injury during a pileup in the second quarter and was taken to the locker room.|$|E

5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object <b>passes</b> <b>in</b> front of the more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E
