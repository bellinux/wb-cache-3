25|$|Sciarid flies {{are common}} <b>pests</b> <b>of</b> {{mushroom}} houses and <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> grown in protected culture, for example herbs, where the warm and moist conditions favour their rapid development. In commercial mushroom houses, sciarid fly larvae tunnel into the stalks of the mushrooms, and feeding damage can sever developing mycelium, causing mushrooms to become brown and leathery. Their faeces may also prevent the mycelium from colonising the casing layer, severely reducing yields. As a <b>pest</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> sciarid larvae {{feed on the}} root system.

Chlorpyrifos is also known as a residential pesticide for killing fire ants, cockroaches and other household pests. Particularly this pesticide has an effect on behavioral, neurological and reproductive function too (Mueller-Beilschmid 1990). Varying concentrations of chlorpyrifos pollution in the environment has become a common phenomenon (Joshi et al. 2003), posing a potential hazard to human health. It has been reported that chlorpyrifos is linked to human genital deformities.|$|R
50|$|Pheromones {{can also}} be used to bait plants that are staples for M. histrionica and trap the insects. M. histrionica are major <b>pests</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> in the Brassicaceae family. In a study {{conducted}} by Ludwig and Kok (2001), researchers tested broccoli, mustard and rape plants for attractiveness to the harlequin bug and found that these plants do not significantly delay development in the bugs. This is what leads to these economically important plants to be targeted by M. histrionica. The study showed that all plants, especially small and young plants even at lower densities of insects, experienced death after being targeted by harlequin bugs, although larger plants could bare more numbers.|$|R
