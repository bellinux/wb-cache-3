30|$|It is not {{possible}} to calculate the precise probability that a person living in a certain location moved, as some of the people previously living in that location will not have filled out a census form 5  years later for various reasons. For example, they may have died, moved overseas, or failed to fill out their census forms in enough detail for their <b>previous</b> <b>addresses</b> to be ascertained. The probabilities that we do calculate (of people moving when we know both their current and <b>previous</b> <b>addresses)</b> are likely to be understated relative to the true probabilities of moves, because the most mobile people are the most likely to be missed or to have an incomplete address record from 5  years ago. We are also not able to identify multiple moves over the 5 -year period.|$|R
