40|$|The general {{population}} may be exposed via guthion-contaminated air, water, or food. However, {{there is little}} potential for high level exposure of the {{general population}} because guthion is a restricted use pesticide. Significant inhalation and/or dermal exposure are likely only near areas where guthion is used. Oral exposure mainly occurs by eating foods containing guthion residue, particularly fruits and vegetables that have been sprayed. Ingestion of contaminated drinking water is expected to be low for the general population. Occupational Populations Occupational exposure may occur at facilities that produce guthion or in working environments where guthion is used as an insecticide. Toxicokinetics Guthion is readily absorbed from the lungs, gastrointestinal system, and skin. Absorbed guthion is rapidly distributed throughout the body, but does not accumulate significantly in body tissues. Guthion is rapidly metabolized by oxidative desulfuration, hydrolysis, and dearylation to form the metabolites dimethylphosphate (DMP), dimethylthio-phosphate (DMTP), and dimethyl <b>phosphorodithioic</b> <b>acid</b> (DMDTP), which are excreted in the urine...|$|E
