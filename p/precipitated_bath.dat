40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} flexible cellulose fibres with a reduced modulus and a reduced {{degree of order}} of nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, intended in particular {{for use in the}} textile industry, said fibres being obtained by extrusion from cellulose solutions in aqueous NMMO through spinning nozzles across an air section into an aqueous and/or alcohol <b>precipitating</b> <b>bath</b> containing NMMO, and by conventional rinsing, aftertreatment and drying at a closeness of 15 and 50 cN/tex, and a process for the production of said fibres. According to the invention, said flexible cellulose fibres have an initial modulus of smaller than 1500 cN/tex and the ratio of the heights of the lines at 88 ppm and 85 ppm is less than or equal 1 across the spectrum base line in the high-esolution -> 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance solid-state spectrum. Moreover, these flexible cellulose are obtained by means of a process by which hydrophile, soluble (in the polymer solution), low-molecular, organic additives containing mainly groupings containing nitrogen are added in defined amounts to both the spinning dope of the cellulose and to the <b>precipitating</b> <b>bath...</b>|$|R

Gelatin also is soluble in most polar solvents. Gelatin solutions show viscoelastic flow and streaming birefringence. Solubility {{is determined by the}} method of manufacture.

Presence of {{ammonium sulphate}} (inorganic) and polyethylene glycol (organic) in optimised quantity in the <b>precipitating</b> <b>bath</b> facilitated {{formation of an}} easily filterable precipitate. Calcination of this precursor at 800 degrees C yielded soft agglomerated nanocrystalline powder (similar to 22 nm). Compaction behaviour of the calcined powder as well as pore size distribution of the compact mass indicated formation of soft agglomerate. Owing to its high sinteractivity, this powder could be sintered to similar to 95 % of its theoretical density (%TD) at temperature as low as 1150 degrees C. At 1200 degrees C, the powder compact densified to > 98 % TD...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is a {{well-known}} window material used for fabrication of second generation thin film solar cells including CdS/CdTe and CdS/CuInGaSe 2. Among the CdS fabrication techniques, electrodeposition is a simple, cost effective and scalable method that has been stepped towards large scale commercialization. However, the presence of <b>precipitates</b> in <b>baths</b> used for electrodeposition of CdS {{has been found to}} be a persistent problem which had produced CdS thin films with poor photovoltaic properties. Hence, an investigation was carried out to identify a set of optimum physiochemical conditions that can produce clear stable electrolyte for electrodeposition of CdS thin film semiconductors using CdCl 2 and Na 2 S 2 O 3 precursor salts. The study revealed that, electrolytes containing 0. 10 mol/L CdCl 2 and 0. 01 mol/L Na 2 S 2 O 3, within the pH range of 1. 50 – 2. 00 and the temperature range of 55 – 65 °C can provide clear and stable electrolytes for electrodeposition of CdS thin films. Further, the results showed that, the electrical, optical, morphological and structural properties of CdS layers electrodeposited from electrolytes within above physiochemical conditions were remarkably better to those electrodeposited from the turbid electrolytic baths formed beyond the ranges of predetermined optimum physiochemical conditions...|$|R

40|$|An {{innovative}} rear contacting {{structure for}} copper indium gallium (di) selenide (CIGS) thin-film solar cells is developed in an industrially viable way and demonstrated in tangible devices. The idea {{stems from the}} silicon (Si) industry, where rear surface passivation layers are combined with micron-sized local point contacts to boost the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and, hence, cell efficiency. However, compared with Si solar cells, CIGS solar cell minority carrier diffusion lengths are several orders lower in magnitude. Therefore, the proposed CIGS cell design reduces rear surface recombination by combining a rear surface passivation layer and nanosized local point contacts. Atomic layer deposition of Al 2 O 3 is used to passivate the CIGS surface {{and the formation of}} nanosphere-shaped <b>precipitates</b> in chemical <b>bath</b> deposition of CdS to generate nanosized point contact openings. The manufactured Al 2 O 3 rear surface passivated CIGS solar cells with nanosized local rear point contacts show a significant improvement in VOC compared with unpassivated reference cells...|$|R

40|$|Hot water {{epilepsy}} (HWE) {{refers to}} {{a specific type of}} reflex epilepsy precipitated by the stimulus of bathing in hot water. HWE {{is considered to be a}} geographically specific epileptic syndrome since it mainly occurs in the Indian community. Spontaneous seizures may also occur later in life. The seizure pattern includes complex partial attacks. Although the pathogenesis of HWE is still unknown, temporal lobe has been thought to take part in the epileptogenesis. This paper reports on a 4 -year-old girl who, at the age of 6 months, experienced complex partial seizures triggered by bathing in hot water. Non-provoked seizures intercritical EEG showed isolated spikes and spike-and-waves in the left parietal region. Brain MRI detected a left parietal focal cortical dysplasia. This is the second patient with HWE in whom a cortical malformation has been observed. The observation present here and data reported in the literature seem to indicate that the sensory cortex might also be involved in triggering seizures <b>precipitated</b> by a <b>bath</b> in hot water. Moreover, the authors believe that MRI examination should be considered for this group of patients...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{stability}} of a gold sulfite plating bath, decomposition behavior and evaluation of stabilizing agents was investigated. Stability can be improved by the inhibition of the disproportionation reaction. The most effective stabilizing agents were 2, 2 '-dipyridine and its derivatives. Addition f 2, 2 '-dipyridine did not influence the hardness of the deposit, and {{the stress of the}} deposited film was significantly decreased. Soft gold plating is used in the electronics industry, especially for semiconductor devices. Most oft gold baths are based on KAu(CN) 2, KH 2 PO 4, potassium citrate, and trace amounts of an additive. 1 However, cyanide-containing electrolytes tend to pene-trate the organic photoresist which is applied to fabricate metal bumps or conductive circuit patterning. Penetrated residues und r the resist cause insulating problems. In comparison, gold sulfite plating processes 2 " 4 are not sensitive to the resist. However, this bath gradually degrades after passing current, and a black colloid is <b>precipitated</b> in the <b>bath.</b> In this paper, we report on an improve-ment to gold sulfite bath stability...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{absorber}} layer thickness below 500 nm in regular Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) solar cells decreases cell efficiency con-siderably, as both short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage are reduced because of incomplete absorption and high Mo/ CIGS rear interface recombination. In this work, an innovative rear cell design is developed to avoid both effects: a highly reflective rear surface passivation layer with nano-sized local point contact openings is employed to enhance rear internal reflection and decrease the rear {{surface recombination velocity}} significantly, as compared with a standard Mo/CIGS rear interface. The formation of nano-sphere shaped <b>precipitates</b> in chemical <b>bath</b> deposition of CdS is used to generate nano-sized point contact openings. Evaporation of MgF 2 coated with a thin atomic layer deposited Al 2 O 3 layer, or direct current magnetron sputtering of Al 2 O 3 are used as rear surface passivation layers. Rear internal reflection is enhanced sub-stantially by the increased thickness of the passivation layer, and also the rear surface recombination velocity is reduced at the Al 2 O 3 /CIGS rear interface. (MgF 2 /) Al 2 O 3 rear surface passivated ultra-thin CIGS solar cells are fabricated, showing an increase in short circuit current and open circuit voltage compared to unpassivated reference cells with equivalent CIGS thickness. Accordingly, average solar cell efficiencies of 13. 5 % are realized for 385 nm thick CIGS {{absorber layer}}s, com-pared with 9. 1 % efficiency for the corresponding unpassivated reference cells. © 2014 The Authors.
