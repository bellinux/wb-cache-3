5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his <b>private</b> <b>correspondence.</b>|$|E

5|$|In early May, the ANZAC {{positions}} had sufficiently stabilised {{such that}} the New Zealand Infantry Brigade was transferred to Cape Helles for operations there. Malone led his battalion during the Second Battle of Krithia, during which he came into conflict with his brigade commander, Colonel Francis Johnston, who had taken over command of the brigade from Walker. Johnston ordered a bayonet charge by the Wellington Battalion although Malone pointed out to Johnston the lack of flanking support for such a charge. Johnston was a British Army officer seconded to the NZEF, and in his <b>private</b> <b>correspondence,</b> Malone was beginning to express frustration at the inflexibility of such officers {{in the face of}} a fluid battlefield situation. Malone was later mentioned in dispatches for his work at Cape Helles.|$|E
5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both <b>private</b> <b>correspondence</b> and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E

The division suffered heavy losses on 12 October: about 845 men were killed and a further 1,900 wounded in the worst defeat in New Zealand military history. Although Russell blamed himself for {{the outcome of the}} attack and wrote to politicians in New Zealand stating so, in his <b>private</b> <b>correspondence</b> {{he made it clear that}} planning and preparation by Godley and his staff at II ANZAC Corps was inadequate and did not take into account the poor ground conditions at Passchendaele.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, Cope (then 52years old) {{was granted}} expense money for field {{work from the}} Texas Geological Survey. With his {{finances}} improved, {{he was able to}} publish a massive work on the Batrachians of North America, which was the most detailed analysis and organization of the continent's frogs and amphibians ever mastered, and the 1,115-page The Crocodilians Lizards and Snakes of North America. In the 1890s, his publication rate increased to an average of 43articles a year. His final expedition to the West took place in 1894, when he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The same year, Julia was married to William H. Collins, a Haverford astronomy professor. The couple's ages—Julia was 28 and the groom 35—were past the conventions of Victorian marriage. After their European honeymoon, the couple returned to Haverford. While Annie moved to Haverford, as well, Cope did not. His official reason was the long commute and late lectures he gave in Philadelphia. In <b>private</b> <b>correspondence,</b> however, Osborn wrote that the two had essentially separated, though they remained on amiable terms.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Wallace {{published}} the book Island Life as {{a sequel to}} The Geographical Distribution of Animals. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently {{been part of a}} continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like Madagascar) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased glaciation, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages. Island Life was considered a very important work {{at the time of its}} publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in <b>private</b> <b>correspondence.</b>|$|E
40|$|This is {{a reading}} of the work of Mary Martha Sherwood, the Victorian Evangelist and Children’s Author (and pupil at the Abbey School, Reading). Based upon {{research}} on Sherwood’s <b>private</b> <b>correspondences</b> and diary conducted at UCLA {{with the aid of a}} Mitzi Myers (this before my arrival at Reading), the essay offers a radical reinterpretation of her work. Previously understood in terms of a rigid, if self-contradictory and ‘anxious’, Evangelism, the essay reads the diary through Sherwood’s little known Biblical scholarship. Through this I argue that Sherwood grants her own writing the status of Biblical truth precisely because of its contradictions and ‘anxiety’...|$|R

5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in <b>private</b> <b>correspondence</b> as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in <b>private</b> <b>correspondence,</b> for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.|$|E

40|$|Authors’ private letters play a {{significant}} role in Henry James’s fiction, literary criticism and in his literary and authorial legacy. They are privileged discursive objects activating fundamental issues of privacy and publicity, canonicity and the material condition of literature. The letter is a contested discursive object in James’s work, since it is at one and the same time a potent figure for authenticity and interiority, and consequently poses a threat to the author’s desire to control his own literary corpus and his privacy. In this article, James’s personal and private investment in designing his literary testament (his private letters and his definitive collected edition) is discussed in the context of his ethical and aesthetic concerns with reading the publications of authors’ <b>private</b> <b>correspondences...</b>|$|R

If by any accident her correspondence with such persons chanced to be observed or discovered, which she took all possible pains to prevent, it was represented as a mere intercourse of society, having no reference to politics; an answer with which even the prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, was compelled to remain satisfied, when he discovered that the Queen had given a private audience to Pulteney, afterwards Earl of Bath, his most formidable and most inveterate enemy.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} how the {{presence}} of American missionaries in China between the years 1890 through 1901 affected the response {{by the international community}} immediately following the suppression of the Boxer Uprising. The impact that published missionary writings had on the American public has been well documented, but this study will focus on the differences between published missionary writings and <b>private</b> <b>correspondences</b> in how the missionaries perceived their immediate environment. One of the most striking contrasts between public and private writing comes through in the amount of religious content the <b>private</b> <b>correspondences</b> lack, while publications for American readership focuses on the religious state of the Chinese. It was the public construction of the Chinese people and the state by missionaries that resulted in the brutal international response towards the Ch'ing government and punishment aimed directly at the Chinese people. What this paper seeks to clarify is how missionaries played important political and cultural roles as the mediators between the Chinese and Americans by studying the known relationships between missionary writing and American perceptions of China in the context of <b>private</b> <b>correspondences.</b> To compare public and private missionary writings, various sources were utilized ranging from published studies on missionaries in China and the Boxer Uprising to private letters archived at the Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia. The volume of works included is just a small volume of the available primary resources that exist. Despite the breadth of material, persistent themes emerge especially in the public writings. Many public journals and letters published in periodicals contain aggressive and religious language that contrasts sharply with the secular and personal perspectives the private letters and journals contain. The motive for this discrepancy appears to be the need for missionaries to justify the expense of their activities abroad, which is funded in part by the Western public reading missionary writings back in the United States and Europe. Although they serve as the direct intermediaries between the Chinese people and Euroamerica, missionaries in fact knew very little about their potential converts. Both public and private writings reveal this ignorance, but again, the motives differ. In public writings, missionaries express little interest in knowing about the Chinese culture and people because those were the main subjects that needed civilizing. Private writings, in contrast, reveal a reluctance by missionaries towards interacting with the Chinese due to a fear of the culture and a desire for Western contact. Missionaries remained isolated from their immediate environment, but it did little to inhibit the publication of their superficially authoritative and knowledgeable observations on China in the late-nineteenth century. The significance of analyzing the differences between the public and private missionary writings rests on the events that follow immediately after the Boxers siege the capital city of Peking. As punishment, the Western powers and Japan support the looting and destruction of villages throughout northern China that were already weakened by Boxer activity. This frenzy of violence was a message to the Chinese state and the people that their actions against missionaries would be taken personally. The missionary writings that the Western audiences read influenced Euroamericans into believing that violent and personal retribution was the only suitable solution to the Boxer Uprising...|$|R
