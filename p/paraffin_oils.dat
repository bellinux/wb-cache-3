50|$|Coatings are {{sometimes}} applied to copper. Clear coatings preserve the natural color, warmth, and metallic tone of copper alloys. Oils exclude moisture from copper roofs and flashings and simultaneously enhance their appearance by bringing out a rich luster {{and depth of}} color. The most popular oils are lemon oil, U.S.P., lemongrass oil, Native E.I., <b>paraffin</b> <b>oils,</b> linseed oil, and castor oil. On copper roofing or flashing, reapplication once every three years can effectively retard patina formation. In arid climates, the maximum span between oilings may be extended up to five years. Opaque paint coatings are primarily applied over copper when substrate integrity and longevity are desired but a specific color other than the naturally occurring copper hues is required. Lead-coated copper coatings are used when the appearance of exposed lead is desired or where water runoff from uncoated copper alloys would ordinarily stain lighter-colored building materials, such as marble, limestone, stucco, mortar, or concrete. Zinc-tin coatings are an alternative to lead coatings since they have approximately the same appearance and workability.|$|E

40|$|Paraffins {{have been}} widely used in {{analogue}} modelling of geological processes. Petrolatum and <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil</b> are commonly used to lubricate model boundaries and to simulate weak layers. In this paper, we present rheological tests of petrolatum, <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil</b> and several homogeneous mixtures of the two. The results show that petrolatum and all petrolatum-paraffin oil mixtures are strain, strain rate and temperature dependent under typical experimental strain rates (10 - 3 - 10 - 1 s- 1). For the same conditions, pure <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil</b> is a slightly temperature-dependent, linear, Newtonian fluid. All mixtures have yield stress and flow stress (strain softening) values that decrease with decreasing shear rate, and with increasing relative amounts of <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil.</b> The degree of strain rate dependence (shear thinning) also decreases with increasing <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil</b> content. Because these materials have rheologies that can be characterized and controlled, they are suitable for use in a large number of analogue model settings, either as a lubricant or to simulate weak layers.

The metabolic abilities of this strain could be used for the bioremediation of complex mixtures of mono- and poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons even when dissolved in oil phases.

40|$|Objective:Functional {{constipation}} is {{a common}} and challenging problem in pediatrics. Fecal disimpaction prior to maintenance therapy is recommended to ensure successful treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the efficacy and patients compliance of the two methods of <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil</b> administration (oral and rectal route) with the purpose of disimpaction in treatment of children with functional constipation. Methods:A total of 80 children (49 males and 31 females) aged 1 - 12 years, with functional constipation according to Rome III criteria, whose rectal examination confirmed fecal impaction were divided into two groups randomly. Group I received 3 ml/kg/day <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil</b> orally and group II received 3 ml/kg/day <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil</b> rectally during 3 consequent days. Successful treatment was defined as no detectable fecal impaction in rectal examination after at most 72 hours. Patient compliance and family satisfaction also was evaluated using a scored questionnaire. Findings:Response to the treatment in both groups was with 92. 5 % and 82. 5 % in group I and II, respectively. So, there was no significant difference between the two methods of therapy. Family satisfying and compliance were obviously more achieved in group 1 (87. 5 % vs 57. 5 %) than in Group 2 (P< 0. 001). No parents in group I complained about type of treatment while 12. 5 % of parents in group II were unsatisfied with the mode of <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil</b> administration. The most common side effect of <b>paraffin</b> <b>oil</b> in both groups was anal oil seepage (27. 5 %). Nausea and abdominal pain were more common side effects in group 1 and 2 respectively.

Cu-BTA explores the nanomechanics of sphere geometry functions as a rolling medium for friction lower. BTA nanoparticles functions as a protector from oxidation of the Cu nanoparticles in various test circumstances. Tribological experiments were conducted using a pin-on-disk (ASTM G 99) test for the wear scar diameter, friction coefficient, and morphology of worn surfaces.
