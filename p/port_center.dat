50|$|At the time, the Turkish Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, was touring Germany. A {{visit to}} the Dutch town of Hengelo, close to the German border, had already been scheduled. On 11 March, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service {{received}} information that Kaya would try to reach Rotterdam by car. She could freely cross the border because of the Schengen Treaty. A crisis centre was established on the twenty-third floor of the Rotterdam World <b>Port</b> <b>Center</b> to coordinate police actions. Earlier, the Turkish consul in Rotterdam had indicated to the Mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, {{that there were no}} plans for such a visit. It now proved impossible to contact the consul, which gave Aboutaleb the conviction that the consul knew of Kaya's attempt. A motorcade was intercepted but the car with the minister managed to drive away. It reached a small yard {{at the rear of the}} Turkish consulate. The Dutch police stopped Betül Sayan Kaya's entourage just metres from the Turkish consulate building. About twenty police officers, forming a special forces unit, the Dienst Speciale Interventies, masked and equipped with body armour and automatic weapons, arrested ten members of Kaya's bodyguard, on suspicion of illegally carrying firearms. A German source had indicated they had obtained a German weapons permit. No arms were discovered. Two other men were also arrested, who later proved to be the Deventer Turkish consul and the chargé d'affaires of the Turkish embassy. They in principle enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The twelve arrested men were detained for two hours and their passports were seized. A stand-off ensued for several hours in which the Turkish minister refused to leave the car. Just after midnight, a special heavy tow truck, a lift flatbed, was driven into the yard and prepared to vertically hoist the 3.5 tonne car on the flatbed, with the minister still in it, to transport her back to Germany. The minister now left the car and demanded entrance to the consulate invoking the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The Dutch police had orders to arrest the minister if necessary. Ultimately, she gave in to the police demands to leave the country. At the time, many news sources assumed that she had been declared persona non grata. She was, loudly protesting, taken to another car, a black armoured Mercedes, by masked Dutch police officers who accompanied her to a police station at Nijmegen near the Dutch-German border. Her passport was seized. She was not allowed to leave the station for one and a half hours, while being reunited with the ten bodyguards. She returned to Germany under German escort. Sporadic rioting occurred among the about a thousand pro-Erdoğan protesters who had come to the Turkish consulate. They were met by Dutch riot police, who arrested twelve people for violent assault and not following police instructions. Kaya's passport was returned on 12 March, 18:00, to the Turkish consul. In April 2017, Kaya's lawyer said they would file a complaint against the Dutch government at court claiming that her expulsion from the Netherlands was illegal because she was not given a written statement of the reasons for the expulsion. However, on 2 May the case was dropped when it transpired that Kaya had never been formally declared persona non grata and that from a judicial point of view she had left the Netherlands voluntarily.|$|E
40|$|Objectives Intrathecal {{drug therapy}} is being {{utilized}} increasingly {{for the treatment}} of chronic refractory pain. However, performing the regular pump refill procedures caries the potential risk of medication injection into the subcutaneous tissue. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the accuracy of this template-guided refill technique by means of fluoroscopic evaluation. Materials and Methods In 23 patients, the difference between the identification of the reservoir fill <b>port</b> <b>center</b> using the manufacturer's template and fluoroscopic guidance was assessed on four consecutive refill procedures by a two physicians. A distance surpassing that between the center and the margin of the port (3. 5 mm) was considered a clinically relevant deviation. Analyses were performed with a one-sample t-test, with p < 0. 05 indicating statistical significance. Results The mean difference distance between identification markings of the target with fluoroscopic guidance and with the template was 8. 2 -mm, with limited variance (2. 7 -mm). For all individual refill procedures, the <b>port</b> <b>center</b> identification accuracy differed significantly from zero (all p < 0. 001) and from the clinically relevant cut-off point of 3. 5 -mm (all p < 0. 001). Only seven attempts (6. 4 %) were within the margins of the fill port. Conclusions Our results suggest poor accuracy of insertion point identification using the template. This highlights the potential risk of errors related to identification of the puncture site using the template-guided technique...|$|E

40|$|Abstract] This study aims {{to examine}} {{international}} student participants’ evaluation in their interaction in Japanese language support situations. Both fieldwork and follow-up interview were used in this investigation of the university’s international students sup <b>port</b> <b>center.</b> As a result, the evaluation is classified into three levels: the evaluatio n for verbal activities (Verbal evaluation), the evaluation for the substantial activitie s (Substantial evaluation), and the evaluation for the overall communication with tutors (Overall evaluation). And then, I built up a hypothesis that simultaneous appearance of evaluation {{is caused by the}} influence of interest. So, I analyzed each participants’ Interest and the relation between their Interest and evaluation. The Interest ha s been studied by classifying it into superficial interest and in-depth interest. In case of the Verbal evaluation, negative and neutral evaluation were observed according to the deviations from communication norms. Positive and negative evaluation were found in the Substantial evaluation, depending on the success of support, whic h means the pract ice of the super ficial or in-depth interest. To talk of overal l evaluation, it onlyhad the positive evaluation, based on the experiences of in-depth interest practices. Also, it can be assumed that the overal l evaluation is th e aggregation of Verbal evaluation and Substantial evaluation...|$|E
40|$|In Vessel Traffic System (VTS) function, AIS {{can detect}} {{a larger number}} of targets without {{considering}} the shadow effect and can provide more voyage information for <b>port</b> <b>center.</b> For radar system can detect target actively even buoys or rock no matter ship size or fitted equipment. But even radar can detect all targets, it is cannot give full information as AIS. AIS can give full information such as types of ship, size, name, MMSI number and etc. The vessel can be divided into two which is SOLAS and NON SOLAS vessel. SOLAS vessel required fitting AIS in their ship and the NON SOLAS vessel does not required fitted AIS in their vessel such as a fishing boat, leisure boat and navy boat. In effect of that, VTS required to use radar to detect this NON SOLAS vessel. AIS and radar system is very important in the VTS to control ship in and out at the port area. They have to use two different computers, which is one computer for AIS and another computer is for radar systems. In effect of that, the collision might occur due to incorrect judgment from the officer. By integrating AIS and radar, the officer can control port with more accurate and systematic. This project will focus on integration of AIS and Radar for managing the movement of vessels in port for safety purpose by taking Port Tanjung Pelepas (PTP) as a case study...|$|E
