40|$|PAZ PIWI domain (<b>PPD)</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{together}} with the RNA cleavage products of Dicer, form ribonucleoprotein complexes called RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). RISCs mediate gene silencing through targeted messenger RNA cleavage and translational suppression. The PAZ domains of PPD and Dicer proteins were originally thought to mediate binding between <b>PPD</b> <b>proteins</b> and Dicer, although no evidence exists to support this theory. Here we show that PAZ domains are not required for PPD protein–Dicer interactions. Rather, a subregion of the PIWI domain in <b>PPD</b> <b>proteins,</b> the PIWI-box, binds directly to the Dicer RNase III domain. Stable binding between <b>PPD</b> <b>proteins</b> and Dicer was dependent on the activity of Hsp 90. Unexpectedly, binding of <b>PPD</b> <b>proteins</b> to Dicer inhibits the RNase activity of this enzyme in vitro. Lastly, we show that <b>PPD</b> <b>proteins</b> and Dicer are present in soluble and membrane-associated fractions, indicating that interactions between {{these two types of}} proteins may occur in multiple compartments...|$|E

The ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila encodes numerous <b>PPD</b> <b>proteins</b> exclusively of the Piwi clade. We {{show that the}} three Tetrahymena Piwi family proteins (Twis) preferentially expressed in growing cells differ in their genetic essentiality and subcellular localization. Affinity purification of all eight distinct Twi proteins revealed unique properties of their bound sRNAs. Deep sequencing of Twi-bound and total sRNAs in strains disrupted for various silencing machinery uncovered an unanticipated diversity of 23 - to 24 -nt sRNA classes in growing cells, each with distinct genetic requirements for accumulation. Altogether, Twis distinguish sRNAs derived from loci of pseudogene families, three types of DNA repeats, structured RNAs, and EST-supported loci with convergent or paralogous transcripts. Most surprisingly, Twi 7 binds complementary strands of unequal length, while Twi 10 binds a specific permutation of the guanosine-rich telomeric repeat. These studies greatly expand the structural and functional repertoire of endogenous sRNAs and RNPs. © 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{number is}} an {{important}} determinant of final organ size. In the leaf, {{a large proportion of}} cells are derived from the stomatal lineage. Meristemoids, which are stem cell-like precursor cells, undergo asymmetric divisions, generating several pavement cells adjacent to the two guard cells. However, the mechanism controlling the asymmetric divisions of these stem cells prior to differentiation is not well understood. Here, we characterized PEAPOD (<b>PPD)</b> <b>proteins,</b> the only transcriptional regulators known to negatively regulate meristemoid division. <b>PPD</b> <b>proteins</b> interact with KIX 8 and KIX 9, which act as adaptor proteins for the corepressor TOPLESS. D 3 -type cyclin encoding genes were identified among direct targets of PPD 2, being negatively regulated by PPDs and KIX 8 / 9. Accordingly, kix 8 kix 9 mutants phenocopied PPD loss-of-function producing larger leaves resulting from increased meristemoid amplifying divisions.

Furthermore, we found that the N-terminal 263 aa of PP (PPN- 263) determined its shut-off activity using the expression of truncated proteins. However, the same domain of the FCV strain F 9 <b>PP</b> <b>protein</b> failed to inhibit gene expression. A comparison between strains 2280 and F 9 indicated that Val 27, Ala 96 and Ala 98 were key sites for the inhibition of host gene expression by strain 2280 PPN- 263, and PPN- 263 exhibited the ability to shut off host gene expression as long as it contained any two of the three amino acids. Because the N-terminus of the <b>PP</b> <b>protein</b> is required for its proteinase and shut-off activities, we investigated the ability of norovirus 3 C-like proteins (3 CLP) from the GII. 4 - 1987 and - 2012 isolates to interfere with host gene expression. The results showed that 3 CLP from both isolates was able to shut off host gene expression, but 3 CLP from GII. 4 - 2012 had a stronger inhibitory activity than that from GII. 4 - 1987. Finally, we found that 2280 PP and 3 CLP significantly repressed reporter gene transcription but did not affect mRNA translation.

40|$|AbstractPlanar {{polarity}} {{development in}} the Drosophila wing is {{under the control of}} the frizzled (fz) pathway [1 – 3]. Recent work has established that the planar polarity (<b>PP)</b> <b>proteins</b> become localized to either the distal, proximal, or both sides of wing cells [4 – 9]. Fz and Dsh distal accumulation is thought to locally activate the cytoskeleton to form a hair [4, 10, 11]. Planar polarity effector (PPE) genes such as inturned (in) are not required for the asymmetric accumulation of <b>PP</b> <b>proteins,</b> but they are required for this to influence hair polarity [1, 2, 8, 9, 12 – 14]. in mutations result in abnormal hair polarity and are epistatic to mutations in the PP genes [12 – 15]. We report that In localizes to the proximal side of wing cells in a PP-dependent and PP-instructive manner. We further show that the function of two other PPE genes (fuzzy and fritz) is essential for In protein localization, a finding consistent with previous genetic data that suggested these three genes function in a common process. These data indicate that accumulation of proteins at the proximal side of wing cells is a key event for the distal activation of the cytoskeleton to form a hair...|$|R

However, {{the functions of the}} remaining seven <b>PPD</b> <b>proteins</b> are unknown. To elucidate the function of the PPD 5 protein (At 5 g 11450) in Arabidopsis, we have characterized a mutant T-DNA insertion line (SALK_ 061118) as well as several RNAi lines designed to suppress the expression of this gene. The functions of the photosynthetic electron transfer reactions are largely unaltered in the ppd 5 mutants, except for a modest though significant decrease in NADPH dehydrogenase (NDH) activity. Interestingly, these mutants show striking plant developmental and morphological defects. Relative to the wildtype Col- 0 plants, the ppd 5 mutants exhibit both increased lateral root branching and defects associated with axillary bud formation. These defects include the formation of additional rosettes originating from axils {{at the base of the}} plant as well as aerial rosettes formed at the axils of the first few nodes of the shoot. The root-branching phenotype is chemically complemented by treatment with the synthetic strigolactone, GR 24. We propose that the developmental defects observe...|$|E

A pilot mass spectrometric protein identification of PPD using the new protein fractionation system of Beckmen Coulter’s ProteomeLab PF 2 D is reported here. ProteomeLab PF 2 D is a two-dimensional liquid chromatographic system to fractionate complex proteomes. This system consists of a chromatofocusing column to separate the protein based on charge/pI in the first dimension and a reversed-phase column to separate the protein based on hydrophobicity in the second dimension. The advantages of this technique include high loading capacity and better detection of hydrophobic and low molecular weight proteins. Up to 800 protein fractions are collected. So far, 50 proteins such as cfp 10, MPB 53, MPB 70, and others have been identified using MALDI-TOF or FT-ICR MS with Sequest or Mascot search engines.

40|$|In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, three {{genes that}} {{function}} in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, ago 1 +, dcr 1 +, and rdp 1 +, have recently {{been shown to be}} important for timely formation of heterochromatin and accurate chromosome segregation. In the present study, we present evidence that null mutants for ago 1 + and dcr 1 + but not rdp 1 +, exhibit abnormal cytokinesis, cell cycle arrest deficiencies, and mating defects. Subsequent analyses showed that ago 1 + and dcr 1 + are required for regulated hyperphosphorylation of Cdc 2 when encountering genotoxic insults. Because rdp 1 + is dispensable for this process, the functions of ago 1 + and dcr 1 + in this pathway are presumably independent of their roles in RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation and chromosome segregation. This was further supported by the finding that ago 1 + is a multicopy suppressor of the S-M checkpoint deficiency and cytokinesis defects associated with loss of Dcr 1 function, but not for the chromosome segregation defects of this mutant. Accordingly, we conclude that Dcr 1 -dependent production of small interfering RNAs is not required for enactment and/or maintenance of certain cell cycle checkpoints and that Ago 1 and Dcr 1 functionally diverge from Rdp 1 to control cell cycle events in fission yeast. Finally, exogenous expression of hGERp 95 /EIF 2 C 2 /hAgo 2, a human Ago 1 homolog implicated in posttranscriptional gene silencing, compensated for the loss of ago 1 + function in S. pombe.

Using chemical modification techniques, we found that reagents specific for lysine or arginine residues inactivated the RNA-binding capacity of the protein. The binding of pp 12 to 60 S viral RNA was also strongly affected by pH (pKapp of 5. 5); the affinity for viral RNA decreased by as much as 40 -fold after protonation of one or more titratable groups on the protein. When the protein was cleaved by cyanogen bromide, each of the two polypeptide products bound to RNA (with low affinity), but pH dependence was lost. Thus, an intact protein was required for this effect. Since histidine and phosphoserine residues have pKa values close to the pKapp of the pp 12 -RNA interaction, they were studied to determine whether they were involved in this process. Each of the two histidyl residues in pp 12 had pKa values of 6. 2, as determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance titrations, values too high to account for the pKapp of binding. The involvement of phosphoserine residues, which have pKa values similar to the pKapp, was investigated by removal of phosphate from pp 12.

The protein {{has been}} studied in yeast and mammalian cells, but {{little is known about}} PP 4 in plants. The function of PP 4 in plants is unknown and it will not have the same function as in the other studied organisms because the processes does not exist in plants. It is likely that the <b>PP</b> 4 <b>proteins</b> has been adapted for other uses in plants. In this thesis project, I worked toward making Arabidopsis thaliana plants with the two <b>PP</b> 4 <b>proteins</b> <b>PP</b> 4 - 1 and PP 4 - 2 using a variety of recombination technologies. Plants were successfully transformed with PP 4 - 2 and PP 4 - 1. The plants with PP 4 - 2 made seeds that have a chance of having the PP 4 - 2 gene themselves. These plants can be used for further study of PP 4 - 2 in plants. As the practical part of the thesis work ended, the plants transformed with the PP 4 - 1 gene were starting to produce seeds that later can be selected for the gene and grow to produce more seeds. These can potentially be used in further studies. I also demonstrated that the PP 4 - 2 protein could be produced with E. coli Rosetta strain. The protein was visualized on a polyacrylamide gel. The PP 4 - 1 has been successfully cloned into a pMAL-C 2 X vector {{that can be used for}} further studies...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} if dendritic cells (DCs) {{were able}} to present intracellularly located antigens derived from apoptotic cells to T cells, thereby inducing a CD 4 (+) and a CD 8 (+) response. A transfected cell line with the cytomegalovirus-derived <b>protein</b> <b>pp</b> 65 was triggered to go into apoptosis by ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, and after the uptake of apoptotic cells by DC, the activation and proliferation of T cells were determined. We found that DC efficiently phagocytosed apoptotic cells and induced a CD 4 (+) and a CD 8 (+) T-cell response specific for the viral <b>protein</b> <b>pp</b> 65. This mechanism can be useful for vaccination studies to induce an antiviral immune response...|$|R
40|$|The {{activities}} of type I protein phosphatases {{play a central}} role in eukaryotic cell cycle control. Here, we report the cloning and characterization from the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana of a cDNA clone named PP 1 -At which is highly homologous to protein phosphatase 1. The deduced amino acid sequence of PP 1 -At shows that the <b>PP</b> 1 -At <b>protein</b> is 318 amino acid residues long and has a molecular weight of 35, 298 Da. The <b>PP</b> 1 -At <b>protein</b> has strong similarity to all other known protein phosphatase type 1 catalytic subunits. Approximately 62 % of the amino acids are identical to type 1 protein phosphatases of rabbit, mouse, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. RNA blot analysis revealed a single mRNA species of approximately the same size as the cDNA isolated. The PP 1 -At-encoded mRNA of 1. 3 kb is abundant in most vegetative Arabidopsis tissues, with the lowest level of expression in leaves. When transferred to the fission yeast S. pombe, the <b>PP</b> 1 -At-encoded <b>protein</b> can rescue a semidominant mutant, cold sensitive (cs) dis 2 - 11, which under nonpermissive conditions is unable to complete chromosome disjunction...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the {{biological}} and biochemical activities of <b>pp</b> 60 recombinant-src <b>proteins</b> encoded by 12 carboxyl-terminal mutants showed that a wide family of alternate src carboxyl termini permit complete transforming and kinase activities. src proteins having carboxyl termini which are up to 10 amino acids longer than that of pp 60 c-src (17 amino acids longer than that of pp 60 v-src) still permit transformation. Transformation-positive mutations preserve leucine- 516, a residue which is highly conserved in protein-tyrosine kinase sequences; removal causes in vivo protein instability. Successive deletion mutants show that this residue is at the boundary of a region required for kinase activity. pp 60 src which is truncated just outside this point still transforms cells and binds both pp 50 and <b>pp</b> 90 cellular <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the in vitro phosphorylation of cellular src <b>protein</b> (<b>pp</b> 60 c-src) molecules associated with the polyoma virus middle-sized tumor antigen in polyoma virus-transformed cells. These pp 60 c-src molecules possessed an enhanced tyrosyl kinase activity, migrated aberrantly on NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide gels, and contained a novel site of tyrosine phosphorylation within the amino-terminal region of the molecule. The pp 60 c-src molecules not associated with the middle-sized tumor antigen were phosphorylated exclusively on a tyrosine residue within the carboxyl-terminal domain of pp 60 c-src. A similar modified form of the middle-sized tumor antigen-associated <b>pp</b> 60 c-src <b>protein</b> was detected in lysates from polyoma virus-transformed cells labeled in vivo with [32 P]orthophosphate {{in the presence of}} sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosyl phosphatases...|$|R
