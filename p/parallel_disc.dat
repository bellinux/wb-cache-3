In which, it is required to omit the natural convection effects on the inaccuracy of measurement for heat lost quantification. One of the well-known steady-state apparatus is circular parallel-plate where the distance between circular plates is filled with liquids or nanofluids. So, {{it has to be}} designed accurately to neglect the effects of free convection. The numerical simulation is a convenient method which can omit the mentioned effects.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) structure of near-wall jets observed in disc-like gas vortex units (GVUs), experimental and numerical studies are performed. The experimental results are obtained using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser doppler anemometry, pressure probes and surface oil flow visualization techniques. The first three techniques {{have been used}} to investigate the bulk flow hydrodynamics of the vortex unit. Surface oil flow visualization is adopted to visualize streamlines near the end-walls of the vortex unit. The surface streamlines help to determine the azimuthal and radial velocity components of the radial near-wall jets. Simulations of the vortex unit using FLUENTVR v. 14 a are simultaneously performed, computationally resolving the near-wall jet regions in the axial direction. The simulation results together with the surface oil flow visualization establish the 3 D structure of the near-wall jets in GVUs {{for the first time in}} literature. It is also conjectured that the near-wall jets develop due to the combined effect of bulk flow acceleration and swirl. The centrifugal force diminishes in the vicinity of the end-walls. The radially inward pressure gradient in these regions, no longer balanced by the centrifugal force, pushes gas radially inward thus developing the near-wall jets.

Pressure locking and thermal binding are phenomena that make a closed gate valve difficult to open. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause {{the pressure of the}} fluid in the bonnet (and, in most gate valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. Thermal binding can occur when thermal expansion/contraction effects cause the disc to be squeezed between the valve body seats. If the loads associated with pressure locking or thermal binding are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The authors tested a flexible-wedge gate valve and a double-disc gate valve under pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. The results show that these valves are susceptible to pressure locking; however, they are not significantly affected by thermal binding. For the flexible-wedge gate valve, pressure locking loads (in terms of stem thrust) were higher than corresponding hydrostatic opening loads by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 5.

This configuration represents operational characteristics of viscous coupling systems. In particular, the case of viscous dampers for tractive torque generation and distribution in all-wheel-drive off road vehicles is studied. Various forms of lubricant behaviour, from idealised Newtonian to that of non-Newtonian silicone-based fluids and incompressible isothermal electrically conduct-ing couple stress fluids, subjected to a magneto-hydrodynamic field are studied. The solution for the magneto-hydrodynamics includes combined solution of modified Reynolds equation and Stoke’s micro-continuum for couple stress fluids in squeeze and shear with rotational fluid inertia, an approach not hitherto reported in the literature. It is shown that in general magneto-hydrodynamic couple stress fluids enhance the load-carrying capacity of the contact and inhibit the incidence of thin films, which can result in direct contact of surfaces. Rotational inertia decreases the load-carrying capacity, although in general the magneto-hydrodynamic fluids show better load-carrying capacity and tractive efficiency than the other alternatives. However, they exhibit a lower response time under the assumed isothermal condition. Nevertheless, the magneto-hydrodynamic fluids are best suited to applications in viscous coupling systems because of their controllability...|$|R

These flows occur between two co-axial and <b>parallel</b> <b>discs</b> which are subjected to an impact, arising from a falling mass, which induces a constant energy squeezing system, as distinct from the traditionally investigated constant force or constant velocity squeezing systems. Experiments were conducted using a test cell comprising two <b>parallel</b> <b>discs</b> of diameter 120 mm with a flexible bladder used to contain fluid. This test cell was bolted onto {{the base of a}} drop-weight tester used to induce constant energy squeeze flows. Glycerine was used as the working fluid, the temperature of which was appropriately monitored. Disc separation, together with pressures (at three radial positions), were measured throughout the experimental stroke (typically less than 10 ms duration). Two additional pressure transducers (at the same radial position as the outermost transducer) were also used to monitor (and subsequently correct for) minor non-axi-symmetries that arose in the system. Approximately 150 tests were conducted, embracing combinations of drop height from 0. 1 to 1 m, drop mass from 10 to 55 kg and initial disc separation from 3 to 10 mm. Three elementary features were typically observed: a distinct preliminary pressure spike (1) immediately after impact corresponding to very large accelerations (exceeding over 6 km/s 2 in some experiments), a secondary major pressure spike (2) towards the termination of the stroke corresponding to diminishing disc separations and a bridging region (3) joining the two spikes corresponding to somewhat reduced pressures. While pressure distributions were observed to be closely parabolic during the major pressure spike, some uncertainty was present during the preliminary pressure spike, ascribed to sensitivities to deviations from axi-symmetry, and the likelihood of inertially generated pressures {{at the edge of the}} disc. By applying newly defined parameters of inertial composition 1 ̆ 00538 (which characterizes the ratio of temporal to spatial inertia effects) and dynamic Reynolds number 1 ̆ 007341 ̆ 007411 ̆ 00 bd 71 ̆ 00 bec 1 ̆ 00 be 1 (which represents the instantaneous ratio of inertial to viscous effects), it was established that the preliminary pressure spike is dominated by temporal inertia whereas the major pressure spike is viscous dominant. The former feature appears not to have been reported on in the formal literature. iii Four analytical models were considered, invoking the parallel flow assumption in conjunction with the Navier Stokes equations: an inviscid/inertial model, a viscous model (the lubrication approximation), a quasi-steady linear (QSL) model and a quasi-steady corrected linear (QSCL) model. The first two of these models, on incorporation of measured disc separations, and the derived velocities and accelerations, achieved acceptable correlations with pressure measurements (largely within uncertainty bounds) during the initial impact and towards the end of the stroke, respectively. The QSL model agreed satisfactorily with measurements throughout the entire duration of the experiment, while the QSCL model, by incorporating non-linear effects in an approximate linear way, yielded somewhat better correlations. By invoking the parallel flow assumption, all four models predict a parabolic radial pressure distribution. Utilizing a hypothetical case in which variations of disc separation, velocity and acceleration were considered (employing similar magnitudes and timescales to those that were measured), outputs of the QSL model yielded results that correlated closely with CFD predictions, while the QSCL data were somewhat better. On the basis of the CFD data it was also inferred that, within practical uncertainty bounds, the parallel flow assumption was valid for the range of disc separation to radius ratios embraced in the current investigation...|$|R

The device includes a cradle-like frame for holding the discs in place during rotation thereof, with the entire frame or individual discs being removable from the vessel without disturbing other discs. Means are provided on the frame for selectively holding the discs in place...|$|R
2500|$|Integration {{with respect}} to another {{variable}} was done by a rotating disc driven by one variable. Output came from a pickoff device (such as a wheel) positioned at a radius on the disc proportional to the second variable. (A carrier {{with a pair of}} steel balls supported by small rollers worked especially well. A roller, its axis <b>parallel</b> to the <b>disc's</b> surface, provided the output. It was held against the pair of balls by a spring.) ...|$|R
