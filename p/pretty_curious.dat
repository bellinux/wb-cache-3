60|$|By {{this time}} Tracy had {{achieved}} a very friendly feeling for Barrow {{and would have}} called him a friend, maybe, if not taken too suddenly on a straight-out requirement to realize on his theories. He was glad of his society, anyway, and was feeling lighter hearted than before. Also he was <b>pretty</b> <b>curious</b> to know what vocation it might be which had furnished Barrow such a large acquaintanceship with books and allowed him so much time to read.|$|E
6000|$|I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. I {{had to do}} {{something}} with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me <b>pretty</b> <b>curious</b> and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to be interested --and I was, too--and says: ...|$|E
60|$|A <b>pretty</b> <b>curious</b> {{instance}} of the genesis of a book. I am delighted at your good word for DAVID; I believe the two together make up much {{the best of my}} work and perhaps of what is in me. I am not ashamed of them, at least. There is one hitch; instead of three hours between the two parts, I fear there have passed three years over Davie's character; but do not tell anybody; see if they can find it out for themselves; and no doubt his experiences in KIDNAPPED would go far to form him. I would like a copy to go to G. Meredith.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, Mr. Dover {{pulled open}} a drawer in {{the desk and}} {{displayed}} a delightful collection of <b>pretty,</b> quaint, and <b>curious</b> trinkets picked up in foreign lands, and kept for keepsakes, since no little daughters of his own lived to wear them.|$|R
60|$|With this he {{held out}} a small skein of {{glittering}} gold twine, which was really <b>pretty</b> and <b>curious.</b> Rinkitink took {{it in his hand}} and at once the golden thread began to unwind--so swiftly that the eye could not follow its motion. And, as it unwound, it coiled itself around Rinkitink's body, at the same time weaving itself into a net, until it had enveloped the little King from head to foot and placed him in a prison of gold.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the curious}} {{results of this}} flood was that Bob was always more prompt to the summons to haul up the trawl {{than he had ever}} been before, more {{energetic}} in clawing the net inboard, and more eager to see and examine the contents of the cod-end. The explanation is simple. He had overheard his skipper say how fond Eve was of shells--especially of those which came {{from the bottom of the}} North Sea, and of all sorts of <b>pretty</b> and <b>curious</b> things, wherever they came from.|$|R
60|$|This was {{the first}} time, {{in all my years}} in the Pacific, I had ever {{exchanged}} two words with any missionary, let alone asked one for a favour. I didn't like the lot--no trader does; they look down upon us, and make no concealment; and, besides, they're partly Kanakaised, and suck up with natives instead of with other white men like themselves. I had on a rig of clean striped pyjamas--for, of course, I had dressed decent to go before the chiefs; but when I saw the missionary step out of this boat in the regular uniform, white duck clothes, pith helmet, white shirt and tie, and yellow boots to his feet, I could have bunged stones at him. As he came nearer, queering me <b>pretty</b> <b>curious</b> (because of the fight, I suppose), I saw he looked mortal sick, for the truth was he had a fever on, and had just had a chill in the boat.|$|E
60|$|Up he went, {{hand over}} hand, and putting his toes into nicks {{every now and}} then, thereby helping himself very much. He took it slowly and easily, and I felt sure he would be all right. As I looked at him, {{climbing}} {{up there in the}} darkness, while I was standing below, holding the rope so that it should not swing, I could not help thinking that I was a <b>pretty</b> <b>curious</b> kind of a tutor for a boy. However, I was taking all the care of him that I could, and if he came down he'd probably hurt me worse than he would hurt himself. Besides, I had no reason to suppose that old Mr. Colbert objected to a little fun. Then I began to think of Mrs. Colbert, and while I was thinking of her, and looking up at Rectus, I was amazed to see him going up quite rapidly, while the end of the rope slipped through my fingers. Up he went, and when I ran back, I could see a dark figure on the wall, above him. Somebody was pulling him up.|$|E
60|$|I suppose you're {{right about}} Simon.[69] But it is Symon {{throughout}} in that blessed little volume my father bought {{for me in}} Inverness {{in the year of}} grace '81, I believe--the trial of James Stewart, with the Jacobite pamphlet and the dying speech appended--out of which the whole of Davie has already been begotten, and which I felt it a kind of loyalty to follow. I really ought to have it bound in velvet and gold, if I had any gratitude! and the best of the lark is, that the name of David Balfour is not anywhere within the bounds of it. A <b>pretty</b> <b>curious</b> instance of the genesis of a book. I am delighted at your good word for David; I believe the two together make up much the best of my work and perhaps of what is in me. I am not ashamed of them, at least. There is one hitch; instead of three hours between the two parts, I fear there have passed three years over Davie's character; but do not tell anybody; see if they can find it out for themselves; and no doubt his experiences in Kidnapped would go far to form him.

6000|$|That night, however, he kept no Sabbath, {{and we got}} no sleep; {{and were}} glad enough, before sunrise, to escape once more to the cove we had visited the evening before; {{not that it was}} <b>prettier</b> or more <b>curious</b> than others, but simply because it is better, for those who wish to learn accurately, to see one thing twice than many things once. A lesson is never learnt till it is learnt over many times, and a spot is best {{understood}} by staying in it and mastering it. In natural history the old scholar's saw of 'Cave hominem unius libri' may be paraphrased by 'He is a thoroughly good naturalist who knows one parish thoroughly.' ...|$|R

6000|$|On the {{afternoon}} in question the stillness was rudely {{broken by a}} murmur of voices, unmodulated and sharp with an intonation which sounds especially {{out of place in}} the wilderness, though it is heard there often enough, from the redwoods of Oregon to where Alaskan pines spring from ten feet of snow. A crowd of people were scattered about the glade, and while some were dressed in [...] "store clothes" [...] and a few in coarse blue jean the eyes of all were turned towards the stump of a great cedar, sawn off a man's height above the ground, which formed a natural platform for a speaker whose address had astonished most of them. Ingleby and Leger lay a little apart from the rest, where the sunlight fell faintly warm upon the withered needles, while Hetty was seated near them upon a fallen fir, displeasure in her eyes and her lips set together. Her eyebrows also seemed unusually straight, as they often did when she was angry, and that gave to her delicately <b>pretty</b> face a <b>curious</b> appearance of severity one would scarcely have expected to find there. She was dressed tastefully, for she earned a sufficiency as a boarding-house waitress.|$|R

6000|$|Another {{feature of}} the Ziscaberg, already hinted at, is very notable: that of the Moldau {{skirting}} its northern base, and scarping the Hill, on that side too, into a precipitous, or very steep condition. Moldau having arrived from southward, fairly past the end of Ziscaberg, had, so to speak, {{made up his mind}} to go right eastward, quarrying his way through the lower uplands there, And he proceeds accordingly, hugging the northern base of Ziscaberg, and making it steep enough; but finds, {{in the course of a}} mile or so, that he can no more; upland being still rock-built, not underminable farther; and so is obliged to wind round again, to northward, and finally straight westward, the way he came, or parallel to the way he came; and has effected that great Horse-shoe Hollow we heard of lately. An extremely <b>pretty</b> Hollow, and <b>curious</b> to look upon; pretty villas, gardens, and a [...] "Belvedere Park," [...] laid out in the bottom part; with green mountain-walls rising all round it, and a silver ring of river at the base of them: length of Horse-shoe, from heel to toe, or from west to east, is perhaps a mile; breadth, from heel to heel, perhaps half as much. Having arrived at his old distance to west, Moldau, like a repentant prodigal, and as if ashamed of his frolic, just over against the old point he swerved from, takes straight to northward again. Straight northward; and quarries out that fine narrow valley, or Quasi-Highland Strath, with its pleasant busy villages, where he turns the overshot machinery, and where Friedrich and his men had their pontoons swimming yesterday.|$|R
6000|$|... 126. The first tale shows very curiously the {{mercenary}} {{and independent}} character of warfare, {{as it now}} was carried on by the great chiefs, whether Guelph or Ghibelline. The Florentines wanted to send a troop of five hundred horse to assist Orvieto, a Guelph town, isolated on its rock, and at present harrassed upon it. They gave command of this troop to the Knight Guido Guerra de' Conti Guidi, {{and he and his}} riders set out for Orvieto by the Umbrian road, through Arezzo, which was at peace with Florence, though a Ghibelline town. The Guelph party within the town asked help from the passing Florentine battalion; and Guido Guerra, without any authority for such action, used the troop of which he was in command in their favour, and drove out the Ghibellines. Sismondi does not notice what is quite one of the main points in the matter, that this troop of horse must have been mainly composed of Count Guido's own retainers, and not of Florentine citizens, who would not have cared to leave their business on such a far-off quest as this help to Orvieto. However, Arezzo is thus brought over to the Florentine interest; and any other Italian state would have been sure, while it disclaimed the Count's independent action, to keep the advantage of it. Not so Florence. She is entirely resolved, in these years of victory, to do justice to all men so far she understands it; and in this case it will give her some trouble to do it, and worse,--cost her some of her fine new florins. For her counter-mandate is quite powerless with Guido Guerra. He has taken Arezzo mainly with his own men, and means to stay there, thinking that the Florentines, if even they do not abet him, will take no practical steps against him. But he does not know this newly risen clan of military merchants, who quite clearly understand what honesty means, and will put themselves {{out of their way to}} keep their faith. Florence calls out her trades instantly, and with gules, a dragon vert, and or, a bull sable, they march, themselves, angrily up the Val d'Arno, replace the adverse Ghibellines in Arezzo, and send Master Guido de' Conti Guido about his business. But the <b>prettiest</b> and most <b>curious</b> part of the whole story is their equity even to him, after he had given them all this trouble. They entirely recognize the need he is under of getting meat, somehow, for the mouths of these five hundred riders of his; also they hold him still their friend, though an unmanageable one; and admit with praise what of more or less patriotic and Guelphic principle may be at the root of his disobedience. So when he claims twelve thousand lire,--roughly, some two thousand pounds of money at present value,--from the Guelphs of Arezzo for his service, and the Guelphs, having got no good of it, owing to this Florentine interference, object to paying him, the Florentines themselves lend them the money,--and are never paid a farthing of it back.|$|R
