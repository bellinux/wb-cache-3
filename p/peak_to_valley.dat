Optimal management of a typical residential smart micro-grid is conducted using a proposed model in the present study. In the optimal management, the real-time pricing mechanism, feed-in-tariff for Photovoltaics (PV) power as residential electricity generators, and residential appliances are considered. Four scenarios are studied and the result shows that the real-time pricing mechanism shifts effectively the electricity consumption from time <b>peak</b> time <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> time, and different feed-in-tariff of Photovoltaic (PV) can shift the energy consumption of micro-grid between periods with strong solar irradiation and weak solar irradiation...|$|R

By sensitivity analysis of system economic performance on ratio of <b>peak</b> price <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> price, it is revealed that with much higher ratio of <b>peak</b> price <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> price, not only system economic performance can seldom be improved, but also chilled water storage is restricted for engineering utilization.

At 1. 0 ms, thermal diffusion will be the major cause of uncertainty in determining the <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> ratio, and we calculate thermal diffusion will reduce the measured <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> ratio to 76 % of its initial value, but the individual microbeams will still resolve.

40|$|Purpose: In this study, {{we present}} {{the results of the}} {{evaluation}} of the SensL ArraySL- 4 photo-detector, coupled to a 6 × 6 GAGG:Ce scintillator array, with 2 × 2 × 5 mm 3 crystal size elements for possible applications in medical imaging detectors with focus in PET applications. Experimental evaluation was carried out with 22 Na and 137 Cs radioactive sources and the parameters studied were energy resolution and <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> ratio. Methods: ArraySL- 4 is a commercially available, 4 × 4 array detector covering an active area of 13. 4 mm 2. The GAGG:Ce scintillator array used in this study has 0. 1 mm thickness BaSO 4 reflector material between the crystal elements. A symmetric resistive voltage division matrix was applied, which reduces the 16 outputs of the array to 4 position signals. A Field Programmable Gate Array was used for triggering and digital processing of the signal pulses acquired using free running Analog to Digital Converters. Results: Raw images and horizontal profiles of the 6 × 6 GAGG:Ce scintillator array produced under 511 keV and 662 keV excitation are illustrated. Moreover, the energy spectra obtained with 22 Na and 137 Cs radioactive sources from a single 2 × 2 × 5 mm 3 GAGG:Ce scintillator are shown. The <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> ratio and the mean energy resolution values are reported. Conclusions: The acquired raw image of the GAGG:Ce crystal array under 511 keV excitation shows a clear visualization of all discrete scintillator elements with a mean <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> ratio equal to 40.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{trigonal}} warping on the focussing of electrons by n-p junctions in graphene. We find that perfect focussing, which was predicted for massless Dirac fermions, is only preserved for one specific sample orientation. In the general case, trigonal warping leads {{to the formation of}} cusp caustics, with a different position of the focus for graphene's two valleys. We develop a semiclassical theory to compute these positions and find very good agreement with tight-binding simulations. Considering the transmission as a function of potential strength, we find that trigonal warping splits the single Dirac peak into two distinct <b>peaks,</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> polarization. We obtain the transmission curves from tight-binding simulations and find that they are in very good agreement with the results of a billiard model that incorporates trigonal warping. Furthermore, the positions of the transmission maxima and the scaling of the peak width are accurately predicted by our semiclassical theory.
