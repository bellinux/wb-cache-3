5000|$|According to many {{researchers}} studying <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> family businesses, {{they agree that}} succession {{is the most important}} issue families will face. Family business succession is defined as [...] "the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leadership <b>baton</b> from <b>the</b> founder-owner to a successor who will either be a family member or non-family member that is a, ‘professional manager’." [...] Many also argue that <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> providing succession lies with the owner or founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business (2). The succession process has been divided into four common stages: (1) stage of owner-management where only a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family is involved in the business, (2) a training and development stage where the owner’s children learn the business, (3) a partnership stage between a parent and child, and (4) a power transfer stage where responsibilities shift to the successor.|$|R

40|$|Functional myths promote {{business}} and interpersonal relationship structure, however, they become dysfunctional when they hinder the succession process. This research’s {{objective was to}} identify the {{factors that contribute to}} <b>the</b> deconstruction <b>of</b> a myth in a family business that goes through <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> succession from <b>the</b> founder, and analyze how the myth relates to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> systemic organization. <b>The</b> research method used was the case study. Data analysis revealed that the factors that contributed to <b>the</b> deconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myth were: a refusal to address issues related to family conflicts; centralization and authoritarian behavior about the myth; and not transmitting a sense <b>of</b> entrepreneurship to <b>the</b> successive generation. In the property dimension, the Group is in the initial stage and controlled by the owner, but the desire to replace the founding-myth has led to a transition to a state of society among siblings; in the family dimension, the Group is in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>baton,</b> despite resistance from the founding-myth; and, finally, the corporate dimension is a state <b>of</b> expansion/formalization, despite <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> underlying conflicts between family members...|$|R

[...] David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the film a {{positive}} review, saying: [...] "There's an emotional resonance to this story about growing old, chasing glory days and <b>the</b> joy <b>of</b> <b>passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> that leaves <b>the</b> other two films choking on its digitally rendered dust.

50|$|The {{next season}} (2012/13) was a {{catastrophe}} for Panathinaikos as four coaches exchange rates during the year, after finishing {{sixth in the}} league sadly.

50|$|Not much {{is known}} about Botticini's life, except through his works. His father was the painter Francesco Botticini.

Also in Empoli are two tables with Saint Jerome and Saint Sebastian, dating back to around 1500, from the Society of St. Andrew in the Collegiate.

50|$|Subsequent seasons {{saw a lot}} of the same, as U-M {{finished}} second during the CCWHA regular season in three straight years from 2005-06 through 2006-08, and won exactly 18 games while playing for the CCWHA title in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2007-08 (Michigan's ten appearances in the league championship game are a record, solidly ahead of Michigan State's seven, although the Wolverines have gone 2-8-0 in those contests). In both 2005-06 and 2007-08, U-M advanced out of the pool round of the ACHA National Tournament but were defeated in the quarterfinals by, respectively, Rhode Island and Robert Morris (IL), two of the ACHA's powerhouses of the era. In 2007-08, Michigan finished with three All-Americans (Amy Cauzillo on the second team, Lauren Lobert and Maggie Wagner as honorable mentions) although Emily Nelson's arrival that year, which included a 23-goal freshman season, signaled a <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> to the next generation of stars.|$|E

50|$|His {{paper of}} the waning of the Oedipus Complex is {{considered}} particularly illuminating. Both Loewald and Freud considered guilt at {{the wish to}} murder or harm the same-sex parent {{to be one of}} the driving forces behind the organization of the self. Freud saw guilt as something that should be evaded, Loewald regarded it as something that had to be worked through to complete the individuation process - the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> from one generation to the next. In Loewald's view the resolution of the Oedipus Complex involved symbolic destruction of the parents as libidinal objects cite. Loewald, contrary to Freud, saw the parents as complementary with both advantages and disadvantages of their own. The mother fulfills all the wishes of the child but in doing so she leaves no room for the child’s autonomy. The father presents autonomy to the child and thus protects the child from engulfment by the mother, which could lead to ego loss. The task of ego development is to integrate both parts..|$|E

5000|$|FFS {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. On review aggregator site Metacritic, the album has {{a score of}} 78/100 based on 24 critics, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". At Consequence of Sound, Ryan Bray writes:It's evident from the outset that things on FFS {{are going to work}} out just fine, and the record keeps that momentum flowing largely through to the end. Franz Ferdinand's panicked dance rock gets a new lease, even if it's a mild reinvention. Meanwhile, Sparks are at their quirky best thanks to their newfound collaboration. Both acts insist that FFS isn't a one-off musical play date, that they're invested in the project as a full-time thing. This debut is enough to make you hope both sides make good on that promise. Writing for NOW, Carla Gillis writes that:It might be too weird for the average FF fan - [...] "Dictator's Son" [...] is total nerd prog, for example, and most of the songs take sharp turns - but others will find that the pair-up has revitalised FF's sound and taken it in a far more interesting direction while also giving an overdue spotlight to Sparks. Vocal duties are seamlessly shared between FF's Alex Kapranos and Sparks' Russell Mael, a shockingly smooth <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> in every song.At The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski wrote that the album [...] "seamlessly meshes the sonic styles of the two bands. Jaunty piano, cheeky keyboards, glammy guitars, rhythmic digital jolts and theatrical arrangements lead to music that's akin to a mashup of Broadway musicals, '70s classic rock, and perforated electropop." [...] Writing for The Independent, Andy Gill wrote that, musically, the album is:an almost seamless blend of the two groups' styles, variations on a sort of operatic indie-electropop, which recalls variously Freedom of Choice-era Devo, chattering Kraftwerk techno and, in the more melancholy environs inhabited by [...] "Little Guy from the Suburbs", a whiff of Leonard Cohen. Russell Mael's and Alex Kapranos's voices likewise braid pleasingly on their shared songs, while both parties seem to have egged each other on lyrically, with songs about a dictator's son living large, a Japanese girl toting a [...] "Hello Kitty Uzi", and a litany of [...] "Things I Won't Get" [...] that includes both luxuries (a Bentley Arnage), qualities (celebrity) and theories ("Schoenberg and twelve-tone and such"), all supposedly outweighed by the solace of a partner's love.|$|E
