Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Karen Filippelli exploit Dwight's paranoia, and <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> Jim was bitten by the bat and {{is turning into}} a vampire. Jim calls animal control, but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5:00 passes and the other employees go home, save Meredith who continues {{to hide in the}} breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after it lands on Meredith's head.|$|E

5|$|At a {{bachelor}} auction, the available bachelors on display are deemed undesirable, and the auction generates no money at all. Marge then nominates Apu, who is deemed a success {{by the women}} at the auction. He goes out on dates {{with many of the}} town's women, and begins to enjoy his bachelor lifestyle. However, he receives a letter from his mother in India, reminding him of his arranged marriage to Manjula, the daughter of a family friend. Not wanting to get married, Apu asks Homer for advice, who suggests Apu tell his mother that he is already married.

5|$|The {{attendant}} tells Scully that Mr. Milsap is {{the only}} person with a working phone, but she discovers that the line is dead. Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone; they are all too engrossed in Bible study groups. Disturbed by the turn of events, she keeps her gun close at hand. The next morning, Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there is a man who needs help downstairs. She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the teaser having a seizure. She advises them {{to take him to the}} hospital, but they <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> they do not have any cars. While examining the man, Scully discovers a strange circular wound on his back. Meanwhile, Doggett calls the local sheriff and learns that Scully has not arrived yet, and so he sets out to find her.|$|E
5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes and Doctor Browning {{travel to}} Las Vegas. They bump into Clare, who lies {{to her that}} Doctor Browning tried to seduce her. Mercedes wants to test Doctor Browning {{to see how much}} he loves her because of this, and comes up with a plan with Clare in order to scam him of his money. They <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> Mercedes has been kidnapped and demand ransom money. When Mercedes realises that Clare has been lying she decides to stop the scheme, however Clare knocks her {{unconscious}} and takes her hostage. She demands ransom money in order for Mercedes' release. Jacqui is able to gather the money in order to release her, however, this money is stolen. As a result, Clare kidnaps Doctor Browning and traps him and Mercedes in a cage where she threatens them with vicious dogs. They are eventually tracked down and Clare is then sent to prison. Mercedes goes to see Jacqui, who has fled to Alicante having stolen money off of dangerous gangster Trevor Royle (Greg Wood), before returning to the village. When Myra discovers Doctor Browning is a murderer, she attempts to end his relationship with Mercedes. Doctor Browning attacks Myra because of this and she is left injured. Mercedes is furious when she discovers what Doctor Browning has done although forgives him. Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) also informs Mercedes that Doctor Browning attempted to rape her and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) tells Mercedes that she had slept with Doctor Browning and he attempted to kill her in order to stop her from telling Mercedes, however Mercedes refuses to believe either of them. Myra continues to attempt to split the couple up however and starts a hate campaign against Doctor Browning, spreading flyers across the village that he is a murderer. As a result, Doctor Browning pays Trevor to kill Myra. Mercedes overhears Doctor Browning and Trevor discussing Myra's murder. Devastated, she tells Myra of this who attempts to flee the country. Mercedes and her family are devastated when they are informed that Doctor Browning shot Myra dead while she was attempting to flee. When Mercedes and Doctor Browning fight over this along with his other actions, Doctor Browning strangles Mercedes and she is almost killed. However, Jim walks in on them in time to save her. Mercedes' half-brother John Paul (James Sutton) later reveals to the family that Myra faked her death to escape Doctor Browning and Trevor's murder plot. When Clare is released from prison, she offers to throw Mercedes a 30th birthday party at The Loft in order to make amends and Mercedes agrees in order to get over her recent tragedies, unaware that Clare is secretly planning to bomb the club in order to get revenge. However, Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis) believes the bag containing the bomb has money and takes it to Ste Hay's (Kieron Richardson) leaving party, causing a huge explosion at the block of flats when Clare detonates the bomb. Mercedes is furious and confronts Clare in the street after learning that Clare had planned to kill her, and a fight breaks out between the two women. Mercedes pushes Clare into the road and she is run over by a car and killed instantly.|$|E
25|$|Haymitch warns {{her that}} the danger is far from over. The {{authorities}} are furious at being made fools of, {{and the only way}} to try to allay their anger is to <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> her actions were because of her love for Peeta. On the journey home, Peeta is dismayed to learn of the deception.|$|E
25|$|The years {{demonstrated}} the increasing difficulty {{to maintain a}} zone in the United States and to <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> it worked {{as well as the}} one of Puerto Rico. A reformist movement arose abroad that culminated in 1964 with the establishment of the Phi Sigma Alpha Fraternity composed of active and militant chapters that can be found in Puerto Rico, in the United States or abroad. Therefore, the zones were eliminated.|$|E

He did not live to see Braham become an exception in his dialogue as in his singing.|$|E
25|$|The Meditator {{finds it}} almost {{impossible}} to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves to <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E
25|$|Proof. Consider a graph on t {{vertices}} and colour {{its edges}} with c colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> c−1 and c {{are the same}} colour. Thus the graph is now (c−1)-coloured. By the inductive hypothesis, it contains either a Kni mono-chromatically coloured with colour i for some 1 ≤ i ≤ c−2 or a K'R(n'c − 1, n'c)-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of R(n'c−1, n'c) we must have either a (c−1)-monochrome K'n'c−1 or a c-monochrome K'n'c. In either case the proof is complete.|$|E

25|$|After four days, Scott {{began to}} <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> {{he had changed}} his mind, feigning tears and remorse, {{in the hope that}} this would in due course {{give him a chance to}} escape. The final day of his {{imprisonment}} he spent watching films on New Age religions and channeling, even though neither are related to Pentecostalism. Scott's plan ultimately worked; Ross, pleased with the apparent success of the deprogramming session, proposed that they all went out to meet with Scott's family for a celebratory dinner. In the restaurant, Scott was allowed to go the restroom by himself; he ran out and called the police, who arrested Ross and his companions on suspicion of unlawful imprisonment. Initially, the charges were dismissed.|$|E
25|$|I scored 114 in {{the first}} innings and 97 in the second. I will not claim that the first innings was a {{particularly}} good one, as it took me almost seven hours. But neither would I <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> it was not immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played.

25|$|Now, as it happened, I had {{confined}} myself {{strictly to}} the business of clearing the line, which was entrusted to me, and although I do not <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> I considered the matter in its legal aspect at the time, the fact remains that I did not give a shot, nor was I armed when captured. I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the breakdown gang, whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E

25|$|The character's {{conception}} {{was a part}} of one of {{the most}} notable storylines in EastEnders during 1989, a love triangle between Cindy Williams (played by Michelle Collins), Simon Wicks (played by Nick Berry) and Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). Steven was the result of a one-night stand (in the bar of The Queen Victoria public house) between Cindy and Simon, occurring while Cindy was engaged to Ian Beale in May 1989. Viewers knew that Cindy was carrying Simon's child; however, between characters in the serial, Steven’s true paternity was kept secret, with only Cindy, Simon, and later Simon’s mother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) knowing the truth, though neither Simon or Pat would believe Cindy’s claim initially. Simon’s rejection of Cindy and her unborn child facilitated a plot twist that saw Cindy <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> the child was Ian’s.|$|E
25|$|In November 2003, at the University of Exeter, Kirby {{delivered}} the Hamlyn Lectures {{on the subject}} of judicial activism. Rejecting the doctrine of strict constructionism, Kirby declared that:Clearly it would be wrong for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal policy agenda and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge to <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, can be answered by the application of nothing more than purely verbal reasoning and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have.These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the United States, as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of natural law or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the embassy}} cannot be doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But {{we are at a}} loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E
