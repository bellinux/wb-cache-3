50|$|The <b>pyloric</b> <b>caecum</b> is a pouch, usually peritoneal, at the {{beginning}} of the large intestine. It receives faecal material from the ileum, and connects to the ascending colon of the large intestine. It is present in most amniotes, and also in lungfish. Many fish in addition have a number of small outpocketings, also called pyloric caeca, along their intestine; despite the name they are not homologous with the caecum of amniotes, and their purpose is to increase the overall area of the digestive epithelium.|$|E

40|$|The predatory sea star, Pisaster ochraceus, keeps {{stationary}} {{the lower}} boundary of mussel beds on rocky shores, despite year-to-year variation in juvenile mussel recruitment. This archetypal {{example of the}} stable regulation of prey populations depends, in part, on the predators??? numerical response to changing mussel zonation. We examined whether changes in body size might provide an additional response. Our results show that natural or experimentally induced up-shore shifts of the lower boundary of the mussel beds reduced growth rates and energy storage; down-shore shifts caused rapid growth and elevated energy storage. Remarkably, shifting the lower boundary of the mussel zone from extreme down-shore to extreme up-shore positions caused the sea stars to shrink, while still storing some energy in the <b>pyloric</b> <b>caecum</b> for reproduction. Thus, it appears that constraints on individual fitness underpin predator responses appear essential in the regulation of prey populations...|$|E
40|$|Argentaffin {{cells in}} the rat {{gastrointestinal}} tract were studied after silver methenamine and silver borate stains. Their morphology {{was similar to the}} classical descriptions. Other granulated cells, namely; globule leucocytes, mast cells and eosinophilic leucocytes were found in the gut wall. Their appearance and histochemical reactions were contrasted with those of argentaffin cells. Quantitative data were collected on the argentaffin, cell distribution in different regions of the gut. In spite of marked individual variation, the regional trends were consistent, with the highest concentrations of argentaffin {{cells in the}} <b>pyloric</b> autrum, duodenum, <b>caecum</b> and proximal colon. No sex differences were found. No appreciable changes in argentaffin cells were caused by treatment with atropine and pilocarpine which respectively suppress and stimulate gut motility. Radioautographic studies after injection of tritiated mannose indicated that some duodenal and jejunal argentaffin cells took up the labelled sugar...|$|R

40|$|Myxobolus porofilus sp. n. is {{described}} infecting the visceral cavity of Prochilodus lineatus (Valenciennes, 1836) cultivated in São Paulo State, Brazil. The plasmodial {{form of the}} parasite is 3 - 5 mm in length and appeared compressed between {{the wall of the}} visceral cavity and the <b>pyloric</b> <b>caecum,</b> reposing on this organ. The spores are small (length 5. 7 +/- 0. 3 microm, width 4. 8 +/- 0. 2 microm; mean +/- SD) and round to elliptical in frontal view. The valve surfaces are smooth and have sutural folds. The polar capsules are ovoid, small (length 1. 6 +/- 0. 1 microm, width 1. 1 +/- 0. 1 microm) and equal in size. The polar filaments have three turns aligned perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the capsule. A conspicuous polar filament pore is arranged at the anterior end of the spore. The only reaction observed upon histological analysis was the presence of a capsule of connective tissue surrounding the plasmodia. This is the first report of a myxosporean parasite in the Prochilodontidae...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} the North Atlantic asteroid Henricia abyssicola is determined in time series samples taken from 1250 to 1900 m depth in the Porcupine Seabight (NE Atlantic). The male-female ratio, gonadosomatic index (GI), <b>pyloric</b> <b>caecum</b> index (PCI), fecundity and oocyte size distribution were determined {{and the results}} were corroborated by histological examination of the gonads. This species is a gonochoric asteroid and the male-female ratio did not differ significantly from the equality. Oogenesis was asynchronous. The previtellogenic oocytes grow to a size of ~ 230 ?m before undergoing vitellogenesis. Maximum oocyte size was ~ 970 ?m. The ovary volume was mainly occupied by large vitellogenic oocytes (400 ? 500 ?m) at any time. There were no seasonal variations in GI, PCI and fecundity. There were, however, variations in the production of vitellogenic oocytes of H. abyssicola superimposed on the continuous reproduction. We suggest that H. abyssicola makes use of the energy source provided by the deposition of phytodetritus by storing it in the developing oocytes and that it might have the benefit of a facultative planktotrophic larva...|$|E
40|$|We report 80, 388 ESTs from 23 Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) cDNA {{libraries}} (61, 819 ESTs), 6 {{rainbow trout}} (Oncorhynchus mykiss) cDNA libraries (14, 544 ESTs), 2 chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) cDNA libraries (1317 ESTs), 2 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) cDNA libraries (1243 ESTs), and 2 lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) cDNA libraries (1465 ESTs). The {{majority of these}} are 3 ′ sequences, allowing discrimination between paralogs arising from a recent genome duplication in the salmonid lineage. Sequence assembly reveals 28, 710 different S. salar, 8981 O. mykiss, 1085 O. tshawytscha, 520 O. nerka, and 1176 C. clupeaformis putative transcripts. We annotate the submitted portion of our EST database by molecular function. Higher- and lower-molecular-weight fractions of libraries are shown to contain distinct gene sets, and higher rates of gene discovery are associated with higher-molecular weight libraries. <b>Pyloric</b> <b>caecum</b> library group annotations indicate this organ may function in redox control and as a barrier against systemic uptake of xenobiotics. A microarray is described, containing 7356 salmonid elements representing 3557 different cDNAs. Analyses of cross-species hybridizations to this cDNA microarray indicate that this resource {{may be used for}} studies involving all salmonids...|$|E
40|$|Elasmobranchii and Acipenseriformes are two ancient, yet highly derived {{groups of}} {{cartilaginous}} fishes with trophic dynamics ranging from planktivore to carnivore, habitat distributions {{ranging from the}} northern hemisphere to circumglobal, and widely varied reproductive strategies. Although largely structurally similar to other vertebrates, they exhibit a unique adaptation within the alimentary canal found only in ‘primitive’ fishes, the spiral valve intestine. In both groups, physiological functions of the alimentary canal are consistent with primary digestion {{taking place in the}} cardiac stomach and primary absorption taking place in the spiral valve intestine. A key difference in the alimentary canal between Elasmobranchii and Acipenseriformes is the presence of a well-developed <b>pyloric</b> <b>caecum</b> in the latter. Although the number of turns in the spiral valve is species specific, the effect of the structure is to increase the surface area of the spiral intestine by at least 3 -fold compared to a linear intestine of the same physical length. Additionally, although exhibiting very different modes of reproduction, both groups require a great deal of space within the body cavity for reproduction thus limiting space available for the organs of the alimentary canal. The spiral valve intestine creates the needed surface area for digestion and absorption while maintaining a compact structure...|$|E
40|$|An enzyme was {{purified}} {{from the}} <b>pyloric</b> <b>caecum</b> of tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) through heat treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sephadex (R) G- 75 and p-aminobenzamidine-agarose affinity chromatography. the enzyme had a molecular mass of 23. 9 kDa, NH(2) -terminal {{amino acid sequence}} of IVGGYECKAHSQPHVSLNI and substrate specificity for arginine at P 1, efficiently hydrolizing substrates with leucine and lysine at P 2 and serine and arginine at P 1 '. Using the substrate z-FR-MCA, the enzyme exhibited greatest activity at pH 9. 0 and 50 degrees C, whereas, with BAPNA activity was higher in a pH range of 7. 5 - 11. 5 and at 70 degrees C. Moreover, the enzyme maintained ca. 60 % of its activity after incubated for 3 h at 60 degrees C. the enzymatic activity significantly decreased {{in the presence of}} TLCK, benzamidine (trypsin inhibitors) and PMSF (serine protease inhibitor). This source of trypsin may be an attractive alternative for the detergent and food industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
