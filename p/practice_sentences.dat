Bartholomae (1980) begins his argument by citing Mina Shaughnessy’s claim that if teachers of composition are to help students develop their writing skills, they must first understand why basic writers make certain mistakes (p. 254). He asserts that the mistakes of basic writers are intentional, catalyzed by a deficient understanding of, and inability to properly identify, how academic language sounds (Bartholomae, 1980, p. 263). Therefore, similar to his claims set forth in “Inventing the University,” Bartholomae again suggests that instead of attempting to fix errors via drills and <b>practice</b> <b>sentences,</b> basic writers must learn to understand the code of written discourse, and mimic the voice of the language found within the academic community.|$|E
5000|$|Bart and Milhouse find {{a message}} dropped by Lisa that reads in cursive, [...] "The five boxing wizards jump quickly." [...] They also see Lisa sneak {{off into a}} taxicab. Intrigued, the two recruit Nelson and Ralph, both {{previous}} boyfriends of Lisa's, in hopes of profiling her mind to find {{the meaning of the}} message. While following Lisa, Nelson and Ralph find another message, also in cursive, saying, [...] "Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow." [...] The group's efforts in finding out what the messages mean go nowhere, and by this time, Principal Skinner, who is concerned from Lisa's strange disappearances, has joined them. Skinner deduces that the paper used for both messages only belongs to the previous principal of Springfield Elementary School, Meredith Milgram. The five visit her house and find Lisa there. To the kids' dismay, it turns out that she was learning cursive writing, a topic that the school cannot afford to teach. The two messages were mere <b>practice</b> <b>sentences,</b> as both consisted of every letter from the alphabet. The episode ends with the credits all written in cursive handwriting.|$|E

It {{is not intended to}} replace learners ' dialects but to provide alternative ways of speaking for appropriate situations. The book is divided into two main sections. The first outlines pronunciation differences between Standard English (SE) and other common dialects. This section is subdivided into chapters on consonant clusters, consonant sounds, vowel sounds, and common word pronunciation differences. The second section elaborates on grammatical differences. Each of these sections includes pronunciation drills, <b>practice</b> <b>sentences,</b> and a final exam.

By {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the phrase had become widely known. In the January 10, 1903, issue of Pitman's Phonetic Journal, it is referred to as [...] "the well known memorized typing line embracing all the letters of the alphabet". Robert Baden-Powell's book Scouting for Boys (1908) uses the phrase as a <b>practice</b> <b>sentence</b> for signaling.|$|R

40|$|It {{seems that}} {{there are very few}} {{research}} themes in sociolinguistics that have been as thoroughly explored as gender representation in educational materials (notably in E FL textbooks). However, relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} how learners themselves perceive the images of men and women in teaching resources. T he present contribution has been written in an attempt to fill this gap. Drawing on the findings of two small-scale survey studies conducted among Polish university students, it addresses two major issues. T he first one concerns the extent to which the choice of male or female-gendered sentence subjects in E FL grammar course books matches the learners’ associations and expectations. The other one, focusing specifically on attitudes to gender representation, seeks to demonstrate how the students view the ways male and female characters are portrayed in constructed examples of usage and <b>practice</b> <b>sentences</b> from English grammar textbooks. Both studies provide some indications of how E FL learners’ needs and expectations can be better addressed in teaching material...|$|E
40|$|Gender {{stereotyping}} {{in educational}} materials (especially in EFL textbooks) {{has been a}} common theme in linguistic research (cf., e. g., Hellinger 1980; Porreca 1984; Freebody/Baker 1987; Sunderland 1994; Lee/Collins 2010). However, very {{little attention has been}} paid to the representation of men and women in EFL/ESL grammar textbooks; i. e. the way both genders are portrayed in constructed examples of usage and <b>practice</b> <b>sentences.</b> The present contribution is intended to fill this gap. The paper investigates the scope of gender stereotyping from a diachronic perspective: it seeks to demonstrate whether and how the images of men and women have changed following the dissemination of guidelines for non-sexist language and equal treatment of the two genders in English language educational materials. To this aim, two corpora have been compiled. The first one includes sentences derived from three EFL textbooks published in the 1970 s and 1980 s, while the other one contains analogous data from three 21 st century titles. The contrastive analysis of the sentences in the two corpora across 11 semantic domains has found that the recently published grammar textbooks portray the two genders in a much less stereotyped way than the 20 th century course books...|$|E
40|$|In {{research}} and <b>practice,</b> <b>sentences</b> or paragraphs of reading tests may be randomly chosen to assess reading performance. This {{means that in}} addition to test reliability, all sentences or paragraphs should be reliable and equally difficult to read. The sentences and paragraphs of five (un-) standardised Dutch reading tests were investigated in this regard. Methods: Tests were performed with 71 normally sighted persons (mean age 55 [18 - 86] years). All sentences and paragraphs had equal print size. The relative difficulty of sentences and paragraphs from the five Dutch reading tests was tested with linear mixed models (reading speed) and generalised linear models (mistakes). Results: Reading speed in standard words per min ranged from 179 (Radner) to 142 (De Nederlanders). Reading mistakes per 100 characters ranged from 0. 25 (Radner) to 0. 40 (Colenbrander). On the Colenbrander charts 7 / 24 sentences were read significantly faster vs 5 / 24 read slower (sentence reliability 0. 56 - 0. 87); International Reading Speed Texts 3 / 10 vs 3 / 10 [0. 94 - 0. 97]; Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology 14 / 55 vs 15 / 55 [0. 64 - 0. 92]; De Nederlanders 2 / 6 vs 3 / 6 [0. 83 - 0. 94]; Radner 4 / 24 vs 3 / 24 [0. 73 - 0. 87]. Agreement between tests differed from 1 to 36 standard words per minute and 0. 01 to 0. 14 mistakes per 100 characters. Conclusion: The Radner, with the highest number of equally difficult sentences, is appropriate to measure reading acuity as well as reading speed in a heterogeneous population; the International Reading Speed Texts, with the highest paragraph reliability, provides long paragraphs to measure reading speed. The Colenbrander and Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology are suitable for daily practice; however, for research or inspection purposes, reliable sentences must be chosen. Although the clinical relevance {{of the differences between the}} tests is debatable, use of the De Nederlanders as a reading test remains questionable...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} ways in which the Germani have been portrayed in {{textbooks}} used for teaching and practising the Latin language in schools in Germany from 1872 to 2007. It is a contribution to the reception history of Roman ethnographic and historical writing about the Germani, especially Tacitus' Germania, but also Tacitus' Annals and Histories, and Caesar's Gallic War. The study also provides a perspective on the place of classics in education and society at large since the 1870 s. Concentration on Germany has been necessary for the sake of time, space and thoroughness, though many of the trends discussed are related to developments in other countries or are indicative of broader trends across Europe. The first chapter discusses Christian Ostermann's textbooks from Prussia in the late 19 th century. The content of these textbooks' <b>practice</b> <b>sentences</b> often reflects Nationalist trends in German society and the education system. In the second chapter the influential Ludus Latinus series represents the Weimar Republic. The series attempted to make Latin appealing to young learners and also shows the influence of the Kulturkunde theory, which made understanding of German culture the centre of the education system. In the third chapter the influence of National Socialism on Germany's education system is discussed with reference to a variety of textbooks of the period from 1938 to 1945. During this period, under the influence of racial ideology, nationalistic interpretations of ancient history and the close identification of Deutsche with Germani reached an extreme. Chapter four deals with the years from 1945 to 1970. After 1945, associations with the ideology of National Socialism made Germania and the Germani unpopular topics. Latin and Greek also became unfashionable subjects and experienced a 'crisis' from which they only slowly recovered due to radical reforms in the methodology of ancient language teaching (described in chapter 5), including the production of textbooks that aimed at providing greater understanding of the ancient world and challenged long-entrenched stereotypes. Public interest in Germany's ancient heritage (both Roman and Germanic) has increased in recent decades, and the content of textbooks reflects this trend. In addition, the process of European unification has led to new perspectives on the ancient world and its relevance to modern Germany and Europe as a whole...|$|E

40|$|The <b>sentencing</b> <b>practice</b> of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) is a {{relatively}} neglected topic in academic discussions. The few empirical studies on sentencing of international crimes have focused primarily on the <b>sentencing</b> <b>practice</b> of its 'sister court', the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Unlike ICTY defendants, almost all ICTR defendants {{have been convicted of}} and sentenced for genocide - arguably the most serious international crime. This empirical study examines the <b>sentencing</b> <b>practice</b> of the ICTR and analyses the relationship between sentence severity and the primary consideration in sentencing - crime gravity. The relevant principles stemming from ICTR case law are reviewed, followed by an examination of the interrelationship between sentence severity and factors relating to crime gravity, such as category of crime, scale of crime and the form and degree of a defendant's involvement in the crime. The ICTR judges appear in most cases to follow the main principles emphasized in their case law, with sentences gradated in line with the increasing seriousness of defendants' crimes and their culpability. © 2011 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers...|$|R
