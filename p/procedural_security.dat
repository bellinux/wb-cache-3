40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{security}} related procedures that are required for the successful development and deployment of electronic voting in legally-binding government elections. Initiating our research on the theoretical basis, which justifies the necessity for security in deploying electronic elections, we further explore {{the question of who}} and what should be safeguarded {{in the course of the}} e-electoral process. Based on our research study, we suggest that security in e-voting has two aspects, the technical and the procedural one. It is recognised that from the technical perspective further research is necessary to ensure full and complete voter authentication and voting security to enable an e-election. However, we argue that e-voting security can also be enhanced through providing <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> measures at specific points in the e-electoral process. Our analysis of the Electoral Commission’s evaluation reports on the 2002 UK local government evoting pilots identified past cases of <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> issues. Interviews and observations conducted during the 2003 UK e-voting pilots further confirmed these issues. We have established the need to further explore the re-design of the electoral process and consider <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> as primarily applicable to agent-related processes. In view of the increased complexity of the e-voting processes, which can involve multi-channel e-voting options, and the increase in the number of agents involved in the administration of eelections, we relate <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> to the need for transparent allocation of responsibilities among the different agents. In concluding we argue that existing <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> should be enhanced, that there is a clear need for better monitoring of compliance to such procedures and that further security procedures need to be put in place at specific points in the e-election process. 1...|$|E

An {{increasing number of}} information security breaches in organisations presents {{a serious threat to}} the confidentiality of personal and commercially sensitive data. While recent research shows that humans are the weakest link in the security chain and the root cause of a great portion of security breaches, the extant security literature tends to focus on technical issues.

The methodology adapted for this study draws on the analytical grounded theory approach employing a constant comparative method. Findings: This paper demonstrates that <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> countermeasures and organisational culture tend to affect security behaviour in organisational settings. Research limitations/implications: This paper fills the void in information security research and takes its place amongst the very few studies that focus on behavioural as opposed to technical issues.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of information security breaches in organisations presents {{a serious threat to}} the security of personal and commercially sensitive information. Recent research shows that humans are the weakest link in the security chain and the root cause of a great portion of security breaches. This dissertation draws on the General Deterrence Theory and prior research on organisational and national culture and examines how <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> countermeasures, including security education and an information security policy, and cultural factors affect employee security behaviour in organisational settings. In particular, this research project answers the following questions: â¢	How do security countermeasures affect employee security behaviour in organisational settings? â¢	How does perceived organisational culture affect employee security behaviour in organisational settings? â¢	How does perceived national culture affect employee security behaviour in organisational settings? Data for this research project were collected from 19 individuals, nine from organisations located in the United States and ten in Ireland, through qualitative interviews. Organisations and study participants were purposely selected. The principle of theoretical sampling guided data collection. Studyâs findings demonstrate that <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> countermeasures, including security education and an information security policy, tend to lead to compliant behaviour. Furthermore, organisational culture values of solidarity and people-orientation incline to promote compliance with information security requirements, while sociability and task-orientation lean towards non-compliant behaviour. Additionally, flat structure is associated with the improved information security in organisations because employees are empowered to bring up various issues related to information security. Finally, comparative analysis suggests differences in two data sets. In particular, employees in observed organisations located in the United States tend to be more compliant with information security rules than their counterparts from observed organisations located in Ireland. Further, group non-compliance is a more prevalent occurrence in observed organisations located in Ireland as opposed to observed cases located in the United States. Finally, it appears that employees in observed organisations located in the United States tend to put higher emphasis on information security value than employees in observed cases located in Ireland...|$|E
40|$|Deploying {{a system}} in a safe and secure manner {{requires}} ensuring the tech- nical and procedural levels of assurance also with respect to social and regu- latory frameworks. This is because threats and attacks may not only derive from pitfalls in complex security critical system, but also from ill-designed procedures. However, existing methodologies are not mature enough to em- brace procedural implications {{and the need for}} multidisciplinary approach on the safe and secure operation of system. This is particularly common in electronic voting (e-voting) systems. This dissertation focuses along two lines. First, we propose an approach to guarantee a reasonable security to the overall systems by performing for- mal <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> analysis. We apply existing techniques and define novel methodologies and approaches for the analysis and verification of procedural rich systems. This includes not only the definition of adequate modeling convention, but also the definition of general techniques for the injection of attacks, and for the transformation of process models into rep- resentations that can be given as input to model checkers. With this it is possible to understand and highlight how the switch to the new tech- nological solution changes security, with the ultimate goal of defining the procedures regulating system and system processes that ensure a sufficient level of security for the system as well as for its procedures. We then investigate the usage of formal methods to study and analyze the strength and weaknesses of currently deployed (e-voting) system in order to build the next generation (e-voting) systems. More specifically, we show how formal verification techniques can be used to model and reason about the security of an existing e-voting system. To do that, we reuse the methodology propose for <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> analysis. The practical applicability of the approaches is demonstrated in several case studies from the domain of public administrations in general and in e-voting system in particular. With this it can be possible to build more secure, reliable, and trustworthy e-voting system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Performing a good {{security}} {{analysis on the}} design of a system is an essential step in order to guarantee a reasonable level of protection. However, different attacks and threats may be carried out depending on the operational environment in which the system is used, i. e. the pro-cedures that define how to operate the systems. We are interested in reasoning about the security of e-Voting procedures, namely on the risks and attacks that can be carried out during an election. Our focus is more on people and organizations than on systems and technologies. In this paper we describe some ongoing work that we are carrying out within the ProVotE project (a project sponsored by the Autonomous Province of Trento to switch to e-Voting for local elections) to analyze and (pos-sibly) improve <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> of electronic elections. To do so, we are providing models of the Italian electoral laws using the UML and we are developing a custom methodology for analyzing threats from the models.

With increasing instances of compromised customer information, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been bringing suit against companies for inadequate data security procedures. The FTC’s newfound authority to bring suit regarding cybersecurity breaches, based on the Third Circuit’s decision in FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp., is a result of inaction—Congress has been unable to pass sufficient cybersecurity legislation, causing the FTC to step in and fill the void in regulation. In the absence of congressional action, this self-proclaimed authority is improper. This Note proposes that Congress enact a law giving the FTC actual authority to regulate data breaches. Thereafter, the FTC should use its rulemaking authority to establish <b>procedural</b> data <b>security</b> guidelines for companies to follow; this Note offers procedural guidelines for the FTC to enforce. It is necessary for companies to know how to protect themselves against FTC enforcement actions. As cyber risk is burgeoning, as self-regulation has proven insufficient, and as the FTC is continuously bringing suit against companies for inadequate data security, it is further necessary for companies to obtain stand-alone cyber insurance to protect themselves in the modern marketplace...|$|R

40|$|Port {{security}} {{is an increasing}} concern given the significant role of ports in global commerce and today’s increasingly complex threat environment. Current approaches to port security mirror traditional models of accident causality – ‘a series of security nets’ based on component reliability and probabilistic assumptions. Traditional port security frameworks result in isolated and inconsistent improvement strategies. Recent work in engineered safety combines the ideas of hierarchy, emergence, control and communication into a new paradigm for understanding port security as an emergent complex system property. The ‘System-Theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) ’ is {{a new model of}} causality based on systems and control theory. The associated analysis process – System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) – identifies specific technical or <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> requirements designed to work in coordination with (and be traceable to) overall port objectives. This process yields port security design specifications that can mitigate (if not eliminate) port security vulnerabilities related to an emphasis on component reliability, lack of coordination between port security stakeholders or economic pressures endemic in the maritime industry. This article aims to demonstrate how STAMP’s broader view of causality and complexity can better address the dynamic and interactive behaviors of social, organizational and technical components of port security.

40|$|The I-Voting {{system that}} was {{designed}} and implemented in Estonia in 2005 is the first Internet voting system to have been adopted anywhere in the world. Since its inception, it has been met with both praise and scrutiny. Concerns include in-person election observations, code reviews, and adversarial testing on system components. As {{a result of these}} concerns, some parties have concluded that there are various ways in which insider threats and sophisticated external attacks could compromise the system’s integrity and thus the voting process. This paper examines the procedural components of the I-Voting system, with an emphasis on the controls related to <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> mechanisms, high-level operational security aspects, and system transparency measures. The methodological approach is based on both primary and secondary data sources, including interviews with key Estonian election personnel, {{in order to determine the}} extent to which the present controls mitigate the security risks faced by the system. This study makes three main arguments. First, we found procedural controls to be fundamentally important to the design of the I-Voting system. While these mechanisms go a long way toward preventing cyberattacks, problems in the system still exist. For instance, some security situations appear to be addressed in informal ways which rely heavily on the knowledge, experience, and professional relationships between officials. Second, in terms of operational controls, we were generally impressed by the state of the controls adopted, particularly the incident handling processes during elections, as well as checks and investigations during and after elections. Our main concern regarding resilience is the increasing potential for more highly sophisticated attacks. As time progresses, attackers will naturally become stronger, and the system will have to adapt in order to accommodate this evolution. Third, the system’s transparency measures have had a noteworthy impact on building confidence and trust in the I-Voting system, both locally and internationally. Challenges still exist, however, especially pertaining to the difficulty in running voter awareness campaigns, as well as increasing voter usage of transparency measures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: Security of {{transactions}} in mobile commerce is {{moving away from}} an IT concern to a business concern because of potential loss of revenue to businesses {{due to lack of}} privacy, integrity or confidentiality, system slowdown or downtime. While most of the various security procedures are limited to corporate IT infrastructure, in mobile commerce, issues concerned with transaction security appear to have extended beyond the corporate network to embrace the complete business process. Any lapse in procedures that maintain confidentiality of data, or violation of privacy could affect corporate image and hence would impact customer relationships. Any adverse effect on customer relationship would negatively impact business revenue. In addition to existing security problems in a wired commerce environment, the emergence of mobile devices have renewed calls for addressing security threats to financial transactions.

In {{view of this}} situation, we exploit recent advance in theoretical and applied risk and decision analysis to attain methodological and <b>procedural</b> improvements in <b>security</b> risk management, especially quantitative risk assessment and the demarcation of acceptable risk. More precisely, we employ a recently developed model of optimal risky choice to compare and assess the cumulative probability distribution functions attached to safety and security risks. Related problems such as the standardisation of risk acceptance criteria frequently used in physical protection can also be approached on this basis. With regard to nuclear and radiological threats, the paper suggests possible applications of the improved methods to the safety and security management of nuclear material, cost efficiency of risk management practices, and the harmonisation of international safety and security standards {{of physical}} protection.

40|$|Adequate {{computing}} resources {{are essential to}} the effective teaching of Information Technology. There are several complicating factors when these resources are provided in the context of computer laboratories. These include the reliability of machines, consistency of software environments, and adequacy of hardware and the cost in both financial and human resources. We addressed these problems by progressively phasing out desktop computers in laboratories in favour of issuing laptops to IT students. These laptops were of a consistent specification and had a standard software environment. Practical problems encountered with this approach included procuring appropriate numbers of laptops in a timely manner, challenges with technical support and monitoring of students during practical tests and exams. <b>Procedural</b> problems included <b>security</b> of the laptops, handling returns and meeting student expectations. Each of these problems was solved and we succeeded in creating an efficient, cost-effective and flexible laptop-based environment. This created an improved teaching environment where student fees could be directed to other areas, where technical staff could focus on other issues, and students have greater flexibility in their work. We can therefore recommend a transition to laptop-based teaching for Information Technology students...|$|R
40|$|Abstract When {{implementing}} {{their information}} security solutions organizations have typically focused on technical and <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> measures. However, {{from the information}} systems (IS) point of view, this is not enough: effective IS security requires that users are aware of and use the available security measures as described in their organizations' information security policies and instructions. Otherwise, {{the usefulness of the}} security measures is lost. The research question of this thesis is to explore how IS users' compliance with IS security policies and instructions can be improved. Solving this research question is divided into two steps. Since {{there is a lack of}} a comprehensive review of existing IS security awareness approaches, the first step aims at reviewing the existing IS security awareness approaches. This kind of analysis is useful for practitioners as they do not necessarily have the time to go through a large body of literature. For scholars, such an analysis shows what areas of IS security awareness have been studied, and to where the need for future research is of greatest importance. The second step in this dissertation is to address the shortcomings detected by the analysis by developing three novel design theories for improving IS users' security behavior: (1) IS security awareness training, (2) IS security awareness campaigns, and (3) punishment and reward. These design theories aim to help practitioners to develop their own IS security awareness approaches. Finally, testing of the design theory for IS security awareness training (1) in two action research interventions is described. The results of the interventions suggest that this design theory provides a useful and applicable means for developing a training program in organizations. In addition, the results provide empirically evaluated information regarding the obstacles to user compliance with IS security policies and instructions. In the action research studies described, the goal was to solve practical problems experienced by the host organizations and to understand them and the results achieved from the viewpoint of theory. Consequently, the results as such can not be generalized, but they are of use in the host organizations in planning and delivering subsequent IS security awareness training programs. In addition, the results are utilizable in similar organizations as a point of departure in planning IS security awareness training programs...|$|E
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this thesis {{is to demonstrate}} that collective bargaining represents a fundamental source of flexibility and security for the labour market. This original finding emerges from a comparative analysis of bargaining arrangements in the chemical and pharmaceutical sector in three countries – Italy, Denmark, and the UK – with a detailed examination of arrangements at company level in two of these – Italy and Denmark. The sector chosen for the analysis is a solid manufacturing industry exposed to international competition and characterised by {{a long tradition of}} collaboration between the social partners. A focus on collective bargaining which is both multi-level and comparative enabled this research to establish: first, that sector level industrial relations institutions account for the degree of within-country homogeneity in the content of firm level agreements over issues of flexibility and security; and second, that the degree of cross-company heterogeneity is conditioned primarily by firm-level contingencies – both union density and organisational characteristics. This means that at company level both institutional structures and non-institutional variables play an important role. Significantly, the increasing attention paid at EU level to policies aimed at achieving greater flexibility while protecting the level of security for the workforce, and the ineffectiveness of the Member States to fully embrace such a policy paradigm, have required academic debate on flexicurity to look beyond public policies and legal regulation as sources of flexibility and security for the labour market. In line with this stream of research the thesis shows that sector level bargaining institutions act as beneficial constraints on company level negotiations over flexibility and security. In light of this it is argued that the flexicurity literature has not only overlooked the role of collective bargaining in shaping different regimes of flexibility and security, it has also ignored a further form of security: the <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> that a well-functioning multi-employer system provides to lower bargaining levels. Furthermore, by paying exclusive attention to collective bargaining institutions, the research responded to the challenge of offering a clearer account of the context within which the notion of flexicurity is deployed...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} {{information}} is ubiquitous throughout most modern organisations cannot be denied. Information is not merely used as an enabler in modern organisations today, but {{is also used to}} gain a competitive advantage over competitors. Thus, information {{has become one of the}} most important business assets. It is, therefore, imperative that organisations protect information assets as they would protect other business assets. This is typically achieved through implementing various security measures. Technological and <b>procedural</b> <b>security</b> measures are largely dependent on humans. However, the incorrect behaviour of humans poses a significant threat to the protection of these information assets. Thus, it is vital to understand how human behaviour may impact the protection of information assets. While the focus of much literature is on organisations, the focus of this research is on higher education institutions and the factors of information security, with a specific focus on influencing the information security behaviour of computing graduates. Typically, computing graduates would be employed in organisations in various careers such as software developers, network administrators, database administrators and information systems analysts. Employment in these careers means that they would be closely interacting with information assets and information systems. A real problem, as identified by this research, is that currently, many higher education institutions are not consciously doing enough to positively influence the information security behaviour of their computing graduates. This research presents a model to address various factors that could influence the information security behaviour of computing graduates. The aim of this model is to assist computing educators in influencing computing graduates to adopt more secure behaviour, such as security assurance behaviour. A literature review was conducted to identify the research problem. A number of theories such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour, Protection Motivation Theory and Social Cognitive Theory were identified as being relevant for this research as they provided a theoretical foundation for factors that could influence the information security behaviour of computing graduates. Additionally, a survey was conducted to gather the opinions and perceptions of computing educators relating to information security education in higher education institutions. Results indicated that information security is not pervasively integrated within the higher education institutions surveyed. Furthermore, results revealed that most computing students were perceived to not be behaving in a secure manner with regard to information security. This could negatively influence their information security behaviour as computing graduates employed within organisations. Computing educators therefore require assistance in influencing the information security behaviour of these computing students. The proposed model to provide this assistance was developed through argumentation and modelling...|$|E
40|$|Critical Security Methods {{offers a}} new {{approach}} to research methods in critical security studies. It argues that methods are not simply tools {{to bridge the gap between}} security theory and security practice. Rather, to practise methods critically means engaging in a more free and experimental interplay between theory, methods and practice. This recognises that the security practices we research are often methods in their own right, as forms of surveillance, data mining, visualisation, and so on, and that our own research methods are themselves practices that intervene and interfere in those sites of security and insecurity. Against the familiar methdological language of rigour, detachment and <b>procedural</b> consistency, Critical <b>Security</b> Methods reclaims the idea of method as experiment. The chapters offer a series of methodological experimentations that assemble concepts, theory and empirical cases into new frameworks for critical security research. They show how critical engagement and methodological innovation can be practiced as interventions into diverse instances of insecurity and securitisation, including airports, drug trafficking, peasant struggles, biometrics and police kettling. The book will be a valuable resource for students and researchers in critical security studies, politics and international relations...|$|R
40|$|Environmental and {{developmental}} concerns on the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) agenda are closely interrelated, both from substantive and <b>procedural</b> vantages. Food <b>security,</b> {{one of the}} proposed global goals of UNCED, is a concrete example of these concerns. This study explores practical applications of disaggregating issue complexity and explores a more formal way to improve understanding of how parties to the negotiation move toward mutually acceptable outcomes. Beginning with a broad framework, conceptual space, we identify six dimensions within which parties define a challenge like food security, their interests, and their beliefs about what should be done. Countries draw implications about the various levels of linkages within a particular issue area. At {{the same time that}} countries are defining the salience of an issue for themselves, they are also formulating judgments about possible policy responses to address the problems. These judgments are grounded in traditions of ethics and political philosophy, but manifest themselves as preferences among policies. Over the course of a negotiation, changes occur in perceptions, knowledge, and the relative importance assigned to corresponding problem and response attributes. Decision analysis models are well-suited to structuring this type of movement, and thus may assist delegates, conference leaders, and mediators while negotiations are still in progress...|$|R
40|$|Although 1995 {{marks the}} fiftieth {{anniversary of the}} birth of the United Nations, the year also marks the fifth anniversary of a newly revitalized Security Council. In this period of five years, {{scholarly}} debate on the Security Council has shifted from what it might do if it could act to what substantive limits, if any, exist on the Security Council 2 ̆ 7 s authority to act under the Charter. The legitimacy of the Security Council 2 ̆ 7 s authority under the Charter arises both in its initial determination of when it can act and in its determination of the appropriate scope of its actions once it has involved itself in an international dispute. Given the wide ranging scope of situations that might fall within the undefined parameters of a 2 ̆ 2 threat to the peace 2 ̆ 2 under Chapter VII and the even more discretionary language of Chapter VI, {{it is not surprising that}} on this anniversary much of the focus for reform of the Council has involved the <b>procedural</b> checks on <b>Security</b> Council decision-making - specifically, membership in the Council, voting procedures, and the veto power. Concerns about the legitimacy of Security Council action most often arise when it appears that its decisions are driven by the more powerful veto-holding states of the Security Council, particularly the United States, rather than reflecting a global consensus that Security Council action is necessary or advisable. On the other hand, as Professor David Caron recently noted, there is no denying that the United States 2 ̆ 7 resources are the linchpin to effective implementation of Security Council directives, at least with respect to collective actions...|$|R
