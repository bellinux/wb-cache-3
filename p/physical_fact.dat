25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} the {{relevance}} of thermodynamics to economics stems from the <b>physical</b> <b>fact</b> that man can neither create nor destroy matter or energy, only transform it. The usual economic terms of 'production' and 'consumption' are mere verbal conventions that tend to obscure that nothing is created and nothing is destroyed in the economic process — everything is being transformed.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, for the thermodynamical {{description}} of non-equilibrium processes, it is desired {{to consider the}} effect of a temperature gradient established by the surroundings across the system of interest when there is no physical barrier or wall between system and surroundings, that is to say, when they are open with respect to one another. The impossibility of a mechanical definition in terms of work for this circumstance does not alter the <b>physical</b> <b>fact</b> that a temperature gradient causes a diffusive flux of internal energy, a process that, in the thermodynamic view, might be proposed as a candidate concept for transfer of energy as heat.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{shown how}} to do science without using numbers, Field {{proceeded}} to rehabilitate mathematics {{as a kind of}} useful fiction. He showed that mathematical physics is a conservative extension of his non-mathematical physics (that is, every <b>physical</b> <b>fact</b> provable in mathematical physics is already provable from Field's system), so that mathematics is a reliable process whose physical applications are all true, even though its own statements are false. Thus, when doing mathematics, we can see ourselves as telling a sort of story, talking as if numbers existed. For Field, a statement like [...] is just as fictitious as [...] "Sherlock Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street"—but both are true according to the relevant fictions.|$|E

The issue finally {{came to a head}} in 1820 when the Master of the Sacred Palace (the Church's chief censor), Filippo Anfossi, refused to license a book by a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, because it openly treated heliocentrism as a <b>physical</b> <b>fact.</b> Settele appealed to pope Pius VII. [...] After the matter had been reconsidered by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office, Anfossi's decision was overturned. Copernicus's De Revolutionibus and Galileo's Dialogue were then subsequently omitted from the next edition of the Index when it appeared in 1835.|$|E
2500|$|Language shift [...] "occurs when {{speakers}} {{in a community}} give up speaking their language and take up the use of another in its place". ASL in particular, and sign languages in general, are undeniably influenced by their close contact with English or other oral languages, as evidenced by phenomena such as [...] "loan signs" [...] or lexicalized fingerspelling (the sign language equivalent of loanwords), and through the influence of Contact Sign. However, due to the <b>physical</b> <b>fact</b> of deafness or hearing loss, deaf people generally cannot acquire and speak the majority language {{in the same way}} or with the same competency that the hearing population does. Simultaneously, Deaf people still often have a need or desire to learn some form of English in order to communicate with family members and the majority culture. Thus, Deaf communities and individuals, in contrast to many hearing bilingual communities and individuals, will tend to [...] "remain bilingual throughout their lives and from generation to generation".|$|E

It will be admitted that, by asserting the proposition, we wish to communicate information of that <b>physical</b> <b>fact,</b> and are not thinking of the names, except as the necessary means of making that communication.

40|$|A typical first stab at explicating {{the thesis}} of physicalism is this: physicalism is true iff every fact about the world is entailed by the {{conjunction}} of <b>physical</b> <b>facts.</b> The same holds, mutatis mutandis, for other hypotheses about the fundamental nature of our world. But it has been recognized that this would leave such hypotheses without the fighting chance that they deserve: certain negative truths, like the truth (if it is one) {{that there are no}} angels, are not entailed by the <b>physical</b> <b>facts,</b> but nonetheless do not threaten physicalism. A plausible remedy that has been suggested by Jackson and Chalmers is that physicalism boils down to the thesis that every truth is entailed by the conjunction of the <b>physical</b> <b>facts</b> prefixed by a “that’s it” or “totality” operator. To evaluate this suggestion, we need to know what that operator means, and—since the truth of physicalism hinges on what is entailed by a totality claim—what its logic is. That is, we need to understand the logic of totality, or total logic. In this paper, I add a totality operator to the language of propositional logic and present a model theory for it, building on a suggestion by Chalmers and Jackson. I then prove determination results for a number of different systems...|$|R

6000|$|I premise, then, {{that when}} {{in the course of}} this inquiry I speak of the cause of any phenomenon, I do not mean a cause which is not itself a phenomenon; I make no {{research}} into the ultimate or ontological cause of any thing. To adopt a distinction familiar in the writings of the Scotch metaphysicians, and especially of Reid, the causes with which I concern myself are not efficient, but physical causes. They are causes in that sense alone, in which one <b>physical</b> <b>fact</b> is said to be the cause of another. Of the efficient causes of phenomena, or whether any such causes exist at all, I am not called upon to give an opinion. The notion of causation is deemed, by the schools of metaphysics most in vogue at the present moment, to imply a mysterious and most powerful tie, such as can not, or at least does not, exist between any <b>physical</b> <b>fact</b> and that other <b>physical</b> <b>fact</b> on which it is invariably consequent, and which is popularly termed its cause: and thence is deduced the supposed necessity of ascending higher, into the essences and inherent constitution of things, to find the true cause, the cause which is not only followed by, but actually produces, the effect. No such necessity exists for the purposes of the present inquiry, nor will any such doctrine be found in the following pages. The only notion of a cause, which the theory of induction requires, is such a notion as can be gained from experience. The Law of Causation, the recognition of which is the main pillar of inductive science, is but the familiar truth, that invariability of succession is found by observation to obtain between every fact in nature and some other fact which has preceded it; independently of all considerations respecting the ultimate mode of production of phenomena, and of every other question regarding the nature of “Things in themselves.” ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{solution}} to the knowledge argument. Both a priori and a posteriori physicalists reject the claim that Mary does not know all the facts, but they do so for different reasons. While the former think that Mary gains no new knowledge of any fact, the latter think that Mary gains new knowledge of an old fact. This paper argues that on a broad understanding of what counts as physical, it is consistent with physicalism that Mary does not know all the <b>physical</b> <b>facts,</b> and that on a narrow understanding, it is consistent with physicalism that Mary knows all the <b>physical</b> <b>facts,</b> {{but not all the}} facts. Either way, Mary gains new knowledge of a new fact that is not non-physical. The resultant view—epistemological physicalism—has it that although one cannot know everything just by knowing complete physical theory, everything is metaphysically necessitated by what one can know just by knowing such theory. Finally, some objections that have been raised against this view are presented and replies are considered. I.
