40|$|A silicon {{pressure}} die is bonded to a borosilicate substrate above the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>port.</b> A Wheatstone bridge circuit is formed on the silicon {{pressure die}} and has bridge elements of silicon doped with boron to a deposit density level of approximately 1 x 10 (exp 19) - 10 (exp 21) boron/cc. A current source is provided to excite the Wheatstone bridge circuit. In addition, a temperature sensor is provided to provide temperature readings. An array may be formed {{of the resulting}} pressure transducers. This unique solution of materials permits operation of a pressure transducer in cryogenic environments...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{pneumatic}} {{rack and}} pinion actuator controlling a valve in a water pipe. The actuator is a two-port device that converts from the pneumatic domain to the mechanical domain. Together with the valve itself it comprises a three-port system; the <b>pneumatic</b> control <b>port</b> and the fluid flow input and output water pipe ports of the valve.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of LEGO Pneumatics ran from 1984 through 1988. This generation is characterised by single <b>port</b> <b>pneumatic</b> cylinders and the more complex plumbing including a three port distribution block with a pressure and vacuum outlet port. These pressure and vacuum lines ran to a switch to provide pressure for extension or vacuum for retraction of the pneumatic cylinders. These are often falsely compared to single acting hydraulic cylinders that require gravity to retract. The difference is that these units retract on the application of vacuum.|$|R

Feeding noozle of <b>port</b> <b>pneumatic</b> grain {{unloader}} {{is vital}} to the whole system, CFD is used to simulate the flow field and optimize the geometry of the vacuum nozzle. The Euler two-phase flow model is taken in the modeling. Secondary air parameter play an important part in the remodeling. Through the adjustment of secondary air, including the relative area and height of the inlet as well as adjustment of the nozzle geometry, the distribution of the concentration of solid particles is improved and the the pressure loss is reduced, thus exert the transport efficiency and energy consumption with a positive effect...|$|R
40|$|As {{the world}} is {{suffering}} with energy and fuel crisis, and is being contaminated with harmful exhaust pollutants. Consequently, it becomes difficult to live a healthy life on earth. Therefore, any technology that can help in reducing these crisis and pollution are most welcomed and are widely accepted these days. One of such technology that can provide {{solution to this problem}} is compressed air driven engine. The literature has been reviewed to analysis the different effects of various parameters on the air engine such as air pressure from the compressor, capacity of compressor tank, number of strokes of the engine, number of cylinders, number of storage tank, number of inlet and exhaust <b>ports,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> guns, and use of electrical devices like piezometer, solenoid valves, etc. In the review, it was found that engine speed of 3000 rpm was obtained at a maximum pressure of 8 bar and also high power gain of about 0. 95 kW was achieved at 9 bar and 1320 rpm. At small pressure of 10 bar with varying injection angle from 10 ° before top dead centre to 15 ° after top dead centre, the rotating speed was found to be 715 rpm to 965 rpm whereas, at higher pressure of 25 bar with varying injection angle the speed ranged from 1191 rpm to 1422 rpm. At lower pressure of 5 bar the maximum speed was 28. 9 kmh- 1 with a travelling distance of 2. 5 km, whereas at high pressure of 9 bar the maximum speed attained was 36. 5 kmh- 1 travelling 1. 7 km...|$|R
