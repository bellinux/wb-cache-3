He admired Burroughs' use of [...] "repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning" [...] in Burroughs' only comic strip, [...] "The Unspeakable Mr. Hart", which appeared in the British underground magazine Cyclops. Not every intertextual link in the series was planned by Moore, who remarked that [...] "there's stuff in there Dave had <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> even I only noticed on the sixth or seventh read", while other [...] "things [...] turned up in there by accident." ...|$|E
500|$|When Ambrosius {{first met}} Jackson, {{it took a}} few minutes to calm down. She {{recalled}} to the same publication Stewart was interviewed by, [...] "To begin with, I was kinda shook. Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend." [...] Harris commented on the single, [...] "He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did 'Billie Jean' and 'Rock With You' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} support Cyrus' then newly launched, joint apparel line with Max Azria, sold {{exclusively}} by Walmart stores, an EP was chosen for release. [...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely {{want to be able to}} step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|I {{must say}} when I bowled at Len I {{felt a sense}} of {{personal}} grudge I have never known against any other batsman. [...] Ray did too. I suppose Len suffered a greater barrage from the two of us than any other player in the world. We both <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> little bit extra against Len, and he had to take it time after time... he had a poker face and never expressed either elation or disappointment. I tried my wickedest bumpers, hoping that I would have the satisfaction of seeing him look scared.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, in meditation, Bhagavan Das, {{according}} to his own account, was able to recognize Baba Hari Dass was in danger, who was then under anesthetic confinement for undisclosed medical reason in the hospital in Lucknow. Bhagavan Das drove from Nainital overnight and removed him from that life-threatening condition. After few days Baba Hari Dass wrote, [...] "You saved my life". Explaining that episode, Bhagavan Das interpreted the event with considerable hesitation, [...] "being subjected to Western medical techniques was a death sentence?" [...] He didn't offer Baba Hari Dass' own view of that medical treatment and left the reason why and by whom he was <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> condition unanswered.|$|E
2500|$|Honeyman-Scott's role {{in shaping}} the Pretenders' sound {{primarily}} involved adding melodic lead lines to existing songs to help tie them together. He recalled in the early days, [...] "We did lots of rehearsing - seven days a week, {{all hours of the day}} and night. At first a lot of the licks were very heavy - like 'Up the Neck' started off as a reggae song. I said, 'Let's speed it up,' and <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> little guitar run. The melodic parts of the numbers really all started coming together by me putting in these little runs and licks. [...] And then Chrissie started to like pop music, and that's why she started writing things like 'Kid'".|$|E

2500|$|Star CEO Uday Shankar {{stated that}} the IPL was a [...] "very {{powerful}} property", and that Star would [...] "remain very committed {{to make sure that}} the growth of sports in this country continues to be driven by the power of cricket". He went on to say that [...] "whoever puts in that money, they <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> money because they believe in the fans of the sport. The universe of cricket fans, it tells you, continues to very healthy, continues to grow. What was paid in 2008, that was 2008. India and cricket and IPL—all three have changed dramatically in the last 10 years. It is a reflection of that." [...] The deal led to concerns that Star India now held a monopoly on cricket rights in the country, as it is also the rightsholder of ICC competitions and the Indian national team.|$|E
