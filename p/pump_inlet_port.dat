50|$|Effect of precession. When {{the piston}} {{is at the}} top of the {{reciprocation}} cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's discharge port is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber becomes open to the <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>port.</b> As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the valve plate thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet</b> to fill the void. This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the <b>pumping</b> chamber and <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber becomes open to the discharge port again and the pumping cycle starts over.|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} publication, {{it was shown}} that pressure ripple levels in a hydraulic system depend on the flow ripple generated by the pump and the impedance characteristics of both the pump and the system. These pressure fluctuations can create structural vibration and hence lead to air-borne noise. In this paper it is shown that similar effects can occur in the suction line of a pump. The pressure ripple levels may {{be as high as}} those measured in some delivery lines. Tests have been performed on an axial piston pump boost system in order {{to examine the effects of}} mean pressure and system configuration on pressure ripple levels. Wave propagation theory has been employed to examine the behavior of pressure ripple generation in boost systems, and close agreement between experimental results and theory has been obtained. It has been possible to quantify the flow ripple and impedance spectra of a piston <b>pump</b> at its <b>inlet</b> <b>port.</b> Preliminary tests on unboosted systems have shown that pressure ripple effects can induce either air release or cavitation and some typical results are presente...|$|R

The effects of channel <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> height (vertical height between channel <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> and the block center), porosity, and block aspect ratio on the entropy generation rate due to fluid friction and heat transfer in the fluid are examined.
