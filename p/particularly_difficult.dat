5|$|RNA interference-based {{applications}} {{are being developed}} to target persistent HIV-1 infection. Viruses like HIV-1 are <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> targets for RNAi-attack because they are escape-prone, which requires combinatorial RNAi strategies to prevent viral escape.|$|E
5|$|Frederik Pohl {{dedicated}} {{the anthology}} Tales From The Planet Earth to Zajdel and A. Bertram Chandler. This book also contains the English translation {{of one of}} Zajdel's short stories, <b>Particularly</b> <b>Difficult</b> Territory. It is his only work to have been translated into English to date (as of August 2015).|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan is {{featured}} in numerous Starcraft merchandise, including toys and miniature statues. Due {{to the complexity}} of Kerrigan's infested appearance, she is cited as a <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> character for cosplaying, though attempts have been praised. Dwight Schrute dresses as Kerrigan for a halloween party on a season 8 episode of The Office.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the coins}} are fairly new, {{they can be}} easily {{obtained}} in the market at a lower value compared to the coins of {{other countries in the}} eurozone, <b>particularly</b> those <b>difficult</b> coins to find of 2002 or 2003.|$|R
5|$|Sebrights {{are neither}} {{prolific}} egg layers, nor outstanding meat birds. They can {{prove to be}} <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> to raise, especially for beginners. Hens rarely go broody and chicks usually have high mortality rates. Adults are generally hardy birds, but are especially susceptible to Marek's disease.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium and {{tellurium}} compounds {{are considered}} to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
50|$|The drama {{focuses on}} the life and {{relationships}} {{of a group of}} university students, <b>particularly</b> the <b>difficult</b> relationship between Hong Seol (Kim Go-eun) and her sunbae, or her friend in earlier class year than herself, Yoo Jung (Park Hae-jin).|$|R
5000|$|The {{innovation}} of a hook {{facilitates the}} recovery of fallen animals by ensnaring them by neck or leg. For this reason the crook {{has been used as}} a religious symbol of care (<b>particularly</b> in <b>difficult</b> circumstances), including the Christian bishop's crosier.|$|R
5000|$|Subvocalized reading {{combines}} sight {{reading with}} internal sounding {{of the words}} as if spoken.

5|$|The {{graphics}} for the game's {{characters are}} cel-shaded, and an implemented technique helps flatten the character models from any angle {{that the camera}} views them from, in order to recreate the 2D, hand-drawn look seen in the show. The development team found it <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment. The Wii version has lower-quality graphics than the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions due to the console's inferior hardware. There is a different cover for the game on each console.|$|E
5|$|The {{record is}} {{primarily}} based on DeLonge's post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The recording sessions were <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> for him, {{as he had}} recently undergone back surgery. The record is a concept album detailing {{the end of the}} world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus—the only member of that band not involved in the project—felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge. It contributed to the band's 2005 breakup.|$|E
5|$|Though she {{had missed}} out on Commonwealth Games selection, Kydd had {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> opponent {{by the beginning of the}} 2002 Commonwealth Bank Trophy season. She was consistently among the league's top goalers, particularly after she was again paired with Burton, due to the axing of struggling new recruit Kristy Doyle. She scored her 500th goal with the Kestrels in the middle of the season, and excelled against some <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> opponents, including then-Australian captain Kathryn Harby-Williams. She was integral in helping the Kestrels make the semifinals for the first time since 1999, and was the third-highest scorer in the league. Kydd was again named in the extended national squad at the end of the season, and finally survived the cut, being named in the squad to tour Jamaica in early 2003, beating rival shooters Jane Altschwager and Megan Dehn (née Anderson) for the vacancy caused by the retirement of veteran player Jacqui Delaney.|$|E
50|$|In rock climbing, some of {{the earlier}} first ascents, <b>particularly</b> for <b>difficult</b> routes, {{involved}} a mix of free and aid climbing. As a result, purist free climbers have developed the designation first free ascent (FFA) to acknowledge ascents intentionally made more challenging by using equipment for protection only.|$|R

50|$|After the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, the Seressaner {{troops were}} {{established}} with both {{military and police}} duties. They were not paid, but were exempted from taxes. Over the following century, each regiment had one section of Seressaners that organized border patrols towards Bosnia, <b>particularly</b> on <b>difficult</b> terrain, and stopped incursions of bandits.|$|R
5|$|An unusually small hurricane, with gale-force winds {{extending}} only 60mi (95km) {{from its}} center, Danny {{was prone to}} significant fluctuations in intensity, making forecasts <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult.</b> Indeed, the storm soon underwent an unpredicted period of rapid intensification aided by nearly non-existent upper-level wind shear. Low-level moisture wrapped around the circulation during this phase, mitigating {{the influence of the}} Saharan Air Layer. Danny achieved its peak intensity around 12:00UTC on August21 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125mph (205km/h) alongside a barometric pressure of 960mbar (hPa); 28.35inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing shear and dry air initiated a rapid weakening phase. The storm's eye became obscured by clouds and disappeared from satellite image late on August21.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> for several reasons. First, {{the variety of}} pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of a}} season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E
5|$|In the convict era, {{particularly}} during Hampton's term as governor, misbehaving prisoners were punished with flogging, solitary confinement, {{and working in}} chain gangs at gunpoint. <b>Particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> prisoners were put to work hand pumping groundwater into the prison's reservoir. Known as cranking, it was especially despised by the prisoners. Staff disliked giving the lashings – in 1851, {{out of a total}} of 400 lashings ordered, 150 were remitted as the superintendent could not find anyone to undertake the task. The role was so disliked that inducements were offered, including extra pay or improved lodgings.|$|E

She has also executed the triple lutz-triple loop combination in practice.|$|R
5|$|International {{reaction}} to the Dutch actions was negative. Neighbouring Australia and newly independent India were particularly active in supporting the Republic's cause in the UN, as was the Soviet Union and, most significantly, the United States. Dutch ships continued to be boycotted from loading and unloading by Australian waterside workers, a blockade that began in September 1945. The United Nations Security Council became {{directly involved in the}} conflict, establishing a Good Offices Committee to sponsor further negotiations, making the Dutch diplomatic position <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult.</b> A ceasefire, called for by UNSC resolution 27, was ordered by the Dutch and Sukarno on 4 August 1947. During the military action, on 9 December 1947 Dutch troops killed many civilians in the village of Rawagede (now Balongsari in Karawang, West Java).|$|E
5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{enrolled}} at Harvard College {{as a second}} year student (sophomore) in August 1811, {{at the age of}} 15. He was not considered academically distinguished, despite showing promise in Latin and Greek. Prescott found mathematics <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult,</b> and resorted to memorizing mathematical demonstrations word-for-word, which he could do with relative ease, in order to hide his ignorance of the subject. Prescott's eyesight degenerated after being hit in the eye with a crust of bread during a food fight as a student, and it remained weak and unstable throughout the rest of his life. Prescott was admitted to the Phi Beta Kappa Society as a senior, which he considered a great personal honor, and graduated from Harvard in 1814. After a short period of rheumatic illness, he embarked on an extended tour of Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the First World War left many issues to be settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered {{in its early years}} included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.|$|E
5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult.</b> He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It {{soon became clear that}} this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the march, the loyalist forces faced {{problems}} such as desertions, lack of discipline, illness, food shortages, and poor navigation. The march included several river crossings, which were made difficult {{by the lack of}} bridges, swollen rivers due to rain, as well as bogged down wagons and cannons. It was <b>particularly</b> <b>difficult</b> for the VOC forces, who were unfamiliar with the terrain of the Javanese interior. Hurdt wanted to stay in the Solo River valley, and to continue the campaign in the following year. Amangkurat preferred to keep marching, and his opinion prevailed. As the loyalist forces marched eastwards, the rebel forces avoided major battle, but fought in skirmishes, and continued to endanger the loyalists' foragers and stragglers. The loyalists scoured the countryside to collect food, causing panic among its inhabitants.|$|E
