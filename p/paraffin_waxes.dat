25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E

40|$|Microencapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> with {{polyaniline}} shells is synthesised as {{thermal energy}} storage material by in situ polymerisation. <b>Paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is the core material and polyaniline is the shell in this preparation. These materials are environment-friendly. The chemical structure, surface morphologies, thermal properties and thermal stability of the encapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> are determined by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetry analysis, respectively. The field-emission scanning electron microscopic {{results indicate that the}} <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is encapsulated well and that the capsules are spherical in shape. The differential scanning calorimetric analysis shows that the encapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> has a large energy storage and releases capacity (22 - 121 J g(- 1)) depending on the different ratios of the <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> and polyaniline. The thermogravimetric analysis results indicate that polyaniline can improve the thermal stability of encapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> because of the synergistic effect between the two (<b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> and polyaniline). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the microencapsulated <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> that acts as a microencapsulated phase change material has a good potential for {{thermal energy storage}} purposes...|$|R

50|$|Although many natural waxes contain esters, <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> are hydrocarbons, {{mixtures}} of alkanes {{usually in a}} homologous series of chain lengths. These materials represent a significant fraction of petroleum. They are refined by vacuum distillation. <b>Paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> are {{mixtures of}} saturated n- and iso- alkanes, naphthenes, and alkyl- and naphthene-substituted aromatic compounds. A typical alkane paraffin wax chemical composition comprises hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2, such as Hentriacontane, C31H64. The degree of branching has an important influence on the properties. Microcrystalline wax is a lesser produced petroleum based wax that contains higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple and rapid method of modifying poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) {{surfaces}} with <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax.</b> PDMS that contains a layer of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> at its surface resists the absorption of hydrophobic molecules; we used fluorescence microscopy to confirm that paraffin-modified PDMS resists the absorption of rhodamine B. Furthermore, we demonstrated that microfluidic devices made from PDMS that contains a surface layer of <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> prevent efficiently the transport of gas molecules through the bulk and into microchannels. We characterized the surface of PDMS that contains <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> using the water contact angle, optical transmission, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We show that PDMS that contains <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> can be substituted for native PDMS; specifically, we fabricated peristaltic valves in PDMS that contains <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax,</b> and the valves showed no degradation in performance after multiple open/close cycles. Finally, we show how to use PDMS that has been treated with <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> as a mold for the fabrication of PDMS replicas; this approach avoids silanization of PDMS, which is a time-consuming step in soft lithography. The wax-modified PDMS channels also show performance superiro to that of bare PDMS in micellar electrokinetic chromatography for quantitative analysis...|$|R

40|$|Petroleum wax is a substance, {{which has}} many {{applications}} and economical value today. The production of petroleum wax {{in the world}} about 3. 6 x 109 ton per year, valued at nearly $ 2 billion. The basic raw material for <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> is petroleum crude oil and lubricating oil.
