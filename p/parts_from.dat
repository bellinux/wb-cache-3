5|$|For the film, Lang {{commissioned}} a composer {{for the first}} time. Hans Erdmann created the opening theme and the music played during Professor Baum's madness.

Lang worked with his German editor Conrad von Molo directly on the post-production process. Lang was known for making very long films and to suit foreign fashions, editor Lothar Wolff was contracted to shorten the French-language version. This version deletes <b>parts</b> <b>from</b> the romantic sub-plot between Lilli and Kent.|$|E
