25|$|Foster {{turned his}} attention, while the packinghouse {{campaign}} was still underway, to another project: organizing steel workers. The <b>problems</b> <b>here</b> {{were even more}} complex: {{in addition to the}} history of defeated strikes and the deep ethnic divisions within the workforce, the steel mills were also divided by differences in skills, with the higher paid native-born skilled workers often looking down on their immigrant coworkers, who were often unskilled or semiskilled. Foster proposed a similar strategy, but on a much larger scale: a national campaign, led by a union council of all the craft unions and the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Tin and Steel Workers, that would organize all of basic steel simultaneously. Fitzpatrick agreed to put his name on the project and sent Foster as the CFL's delegate to the AFL's 1918 convention to present the plan.|$|E

25|$|In 1819-1820, Droste spent a {{year with}} the Haxthausens at Bökerhof, {{interrupted}} only by a stay at the nearby spa town of Bad Driburg, where she hoped {{to find a cure}} for her health <b>problems.</b> <b>Here</b> she became romantically involved with Heinrich Straube (1794–1847), a law student with literary interests, who was a friend of her step-uncle August. What happened next is unclear, but it appears that some members of the Haxthausen family, led by Annette's step-aunt Anna (who was in fact four years her junior), disapproved of the relationship because Straube was a middle-class Protestant, and they devised a scheme {{to put an end to}} it. While Straube was away pursuing his legal studies at the University of Göttingen, they persuaded another young man with literary ambitions, August von Arnswaldt, who came from an upper-class Protestant family, to pretend to pay court to Annette. At first flattered by Arnswaldt's attentions, she gave some indications she was in love with him, before telling him she really loved Straube. By this time it was too late, however, as Arnswaldt had all the evidence he needed. He travelled to Göttingen and told Straube of Annette's behaviour. The two men wrote a joint letter (which has not been preserved), breaking off all contact with her. She never saw either man again. A few years later, Arnswaldt married Anna von Haxthausen, the ringleader of the intrigue. Straube became a lawyer in Kassel and married in 1824. When he died in 1847, a lock of Droste's hair was found among his possessions. The affair was a catastrophe for Droste and damaged her future marriage prospects. Shocked by the role the Haxthausens had played in the intrigue, she refused to visit Bökerhof for the next 18 years.|$|E

The song was also performed in a similar manner on the October9, 2010 episode of Saturday Night Live, as part of a segue from [...] "Nothin' on You", the debut single was also performed. His performance was well received by critics. Billboards magazine critique Walter Frazier analysed the performance and commented [...] "Mars' backing band...dressed as a 1950s rockabilly group, while Mars resembled something of a modern-day Elvis, surely inspiring swoons for the [...] "SNL" [...] audience." [...] The performance was also praised by Mawuse Ziegbe, MTV reviewer, who wrote: [...] "Mars peppered the performance with hip-swaying moves Elvis would be proud of and wrapped up the set in classic rock-star style with an enthusiastic jump in the air." [...] On October 21, 2010, a soulful arrangement of the song was sung for a Billboard Tastemakers video session. On May 5, 2011 Mars expressed his apprehension about performing the song because fans have been throwing dummy grenades on stage, some of which are metal and have posed a safety hazard.|$|E

The song was also performed on NBC's Today Show on June 24, 2011. A live performance was also done on the French X Factor during the finale of the second season. Carolina Frost for the Huffington Post said that Mars at the 2012 Brit Awards [...] "took his poptastic song Just the Way You Are, and gave it a fresh jazzy arrangement." [...] While Tweeter David Quantick summed up his opinion, asking if [...] "someone came as a spare Osmond". Others praised Mars' vocality and confidence with his soulful rendition. It was the twelfth song of his debut worldwide tour, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour and was fourteenth on the set list of his second worldwide tour, The Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013). The single was performed as the last song in his set list for his performance at Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show as a Tribute to the United States Armed Forces.

However, due to disciplinary problems following unauthorized aerobatics on a Focke-Wulf Fw 56 [...] "Stösser" [...] and an open conflict with his commanding officer, Oberleutnant Brunner, Schuck ran {{the risk of a}} potential court-martial. To avoid further escalations Schuck was transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) at Werneuchen. He arrived at Werneuchen on 16 June 1940 where he was assigned to the 3. Staffel (3rd squadron). The entire Gruppe was under the command of Oberleutnant Klaus Quaet-Faslem. Schuck's fighter pilot instructor was Oberfeldwebel Hobe, who was aware of Schuck's disciplinary history. Hobe commented [...] "Schuck, we don't want <b>problems</b> <b>here.</b> We now go on a test flight and I am sure that you will be leaving afterwards". Fearful that this might have end his flying career, Schuck followed Hobe's every maneuver, which impressed Quaet-Faslem who had witnessed their test flight. Schuck's flying career was saved. At Werneuchen the pilots were first trained on the Messerschmitt Bf 109 B-2, later the Bf 109 E-1, which had a more powerful engine. Schuck scored more than 90% hits during target practice, the highest score then achieved at Werneuchen. After his graduation from the fighter pilot school, he was transferred to a supplementary fighter group on 2 September 1940.|$|E

60|$|After {{his first}} burst of {{surprise}} and rapid calculation Venters lost no time there, but slunk {{again into the}} sage on his back trail. With the discovery of Oldring's hidden cattle-range had come enlightenment on several <b>problems.</b> <b>Here</b> the rustler kept his stock, here was Jane Withersteen's red herd; here were the few cattle that had disappeared from the Cottonwoods slopes {{during the last two}} years. Until Oldring had driven the red herd his thefts of cattle for that time had not been more than enough to supply meat for his men. Of late no drives had been reported from Sterling or the villages north. And Venters knew that the riders had wondered at Oldring's inactivity in that particular field. He and his band had been active enough in their visits to Glaze and Cottonwoods; they always had gold; but of late the amount gambled away and drunk and thrown away in the villages had given rise to much conjecture. Oldring's more frequent visits had resulted in new saloons, and where there had formerly been one raid or shooting fray in the little hamlets there were now many. Perhaps Oldring had another range farther on up the pass, and from there drove the cattle to distant Utah towns where he was little known But Venters came finally to doubt this. And, from what he had learned in the last few days, a belief began to form in Venters's mind that Oldring's intimidations of the villages and the mystery of the Masked Rider, with his alleged evil deeds, and the fierce resistance offered any trailing riders, and the rustling of cattle--these things were only the craft of the rustler-chief to conceal his real life and purpose and work in Deception Pass.|$|E
