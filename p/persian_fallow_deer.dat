25|$|The zoo sees {{its primary}} goal as the {{conservation}} of endangered species. These include animals mentioned in the Bible which are now extinct in Israel, such as the Asian lion, the Syrian brown bear, the Asiatic cheetah, the Nile crocodile, and the <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer.</b> It also includes endangered species worldwide, such as the Asian elephant, rare species of macaw, the cockatiel, the ibis, and the golden lion tamarin.|$|E
50|$|Planning for the <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer’s</b> {{successful}} reintroduction {{has proven}} difficult because not much {{information regarding the}} species’ behavior and population dynamics is available. While {{it is hoped that}} as much as possible can be done to help ensure the success of the reintroduced population, most of the measures that could help the probability of success are costly. Because of the extensive financial investment involved in a fruitful reintroduction, many biologists believe the money could be better spent towards other conservation efforts.|$|R
50|$|While {{the use of}} {{multiple}} release sites for reintroducing captive-bred deer into the wild could improve the outlook of reintroduction by reducing competition among the individuals of the reintroduced species, several risks are associated with multiple sites of release, including the increased monetary cost of the reintroduction project, the reduced genetic diversity of the subpopulations, and the Allee effect, which involves a reduced proliferation rate in small populations. Data from the <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer’s</b> reintroduction, including the reproduction rates, survival rates, and movement patterns of released individuals, were used for simulations that compared whether the use {{of multiple}} release sites would {{have an effect on the}} survivorship and growth of a reintroduced population. The results of computer simulations comparing the use of one to nine release sites suggested, while two sites were significantly better than one with regards to the survivorship of the reintroduced species, any additional sites did not greatly improve the outlook of the species. The optimal distance between release sites was determined to be about 11 km, allowing the sites to be separated enough to reduce intraspecific competition immediately after release, yet close enough to allow the subpopulations to merge once they had begun to proliferate.|$|R
50|$|The {{forest of}} Gribskov offers a rare {{opportunity}} to observe free roaming deer of all the four species living in Denmark; namely the roe deer, sika deer, red <b>deer</b> and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> with roe and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> being most common in Gribskov. Roe deer have lived here {{for as long as the}} forest itself, while <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> were introduced at some point during the middle ages.

40|$|<b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> is {{an exotic}} species in Sweden; {{it was brought}} here in the 1570 s and has now {{established}} viable, wild populations in the southern parts of Sweden. Roe deer is native in Sweden {{and there is a}} concern that it is displaced by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> in areas where both species exists, as reported from other countries. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if there is an effect of competition at artificial feeding sites by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> on roe deer, more specific, to measure the use of feeding sites at different month and type of winters. In addition, by divide individuals into age classes and sex, also get a more precise measure of feeding site use. The data for this study consisted of GPS-positions from 31 roe <b>deer</b> and 50 <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> during six winter seasons (2006 - 2012). An individual within 50 m of the feeding station was counted as utilizing the feeding site. Both roe <b>deer</b> and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> increased feeding site use during a hard winter and decreased their use in a mild winter. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> males used feeding sites more than roe <b>deer</b> and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> females. The two species did use the feeding sites differently each month. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> used feeding sites more than roe deer in all months except for February and March. However, the high use by roe deer in February and March were driven by 6 females and 1 male. The feeding site use was not different among different age classes in roe deer. There was a trend that older <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> males use feeding sites more than younger males. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> females always used feeding sites less than <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> males. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> males had three feeding activity peaks during a day and a long pause between each. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> females on the other hand, did have a daily pattern that is more similar to the roe deer. This study conclude that <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> used feeding sites more than roe deer, but it did not detect any clear evidence of competition between the two species. However, the low use by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> females could be an indication of intra-specific competition...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of inter-specific interactions in large herbivore assemblies is under debate. We have studied inter-specific interactions between roe and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> on pastures, {{to assess whether}} competition between these Cervidae occurs through behavioural interference. Roe were displaced by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> (i. e. the former {{moved away from the}} latter at a distance of > 50 m) in 83 % of cases (N = 127). Ninety-four percentage (N = 83) of displacement events occurred while roe deer were feeding; in 50 % of these cases (N= 78), roe stopped grazing and left the feeding ground. Even when <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> did not show any sign of direct aggression to roe, these moved away from fallow in 72 % of cases (N= 127). Vigilance rate was significantly greater in roe than in <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> irrespectively of the presence of the other species. When roe and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> grazed within 50 m from each other, vigilance rate increased significantly in roe, but not in <b>fallow</b> <b>deer.</b> Roe deer, in a group, were significantly more tolerant of the presence of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> (even in group), than when solitary. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> seemed to be able to exclude roe deer from feeding sites through behavioural intolerance...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{breeding}} populations of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> were established in Roman Europe has been obscured by {{the possibility that the}} skeletal remains of the species, in particular Dama foot bones and antlers, were traded over long distances as objects in their own right. This paper sets out to refine our understanding of the evidence for the transportation of living and dead <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> in Iron Age and Roman Europe. To achieve this, museum archives containing purportedly early examples of Dama antler were searched, with available specimens sampled for carbon, nitrogen and strontium isotope analyses, and compared with data for archaeological <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> from across Europe. Importantly, the resulting isotope values can be interpreted in light of new modern baseline data for <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> presented here. Together these multi-isotope results for modern and archaeological <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> provide a more critical perspective on the transportation of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> and their body parts in antiquity...|$|R
2500|$|Mammals: Mammal explorations in Lebanon {{were limited}} until {{around the middle}} of the twentieth century. They are fragmentary and {{provided}} little information on the mammals inhabiting the country. Many species and sub-species were not yet recorded for Lebanon till the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1985, Tohmé, G. and Tohmé, H. alone produced 33% of the known published papers on the Lebanese mammals. The only documented data of the mammals of Al-Shouf Cedar Reserve apparently appeared in the report of Tohmé, H. that was prepared, on behalf of the Protected Areas Project at the Ministry of Environment, in 1999 by the NCSR. This report, which was based on inventory and surveys as well as brochures and other documents developed by the managing team of the reserve, produced a list of 32 mammals which include: wild boar (Sus scrofa), gray wolf (Canis lupus [...] ), beech marten (Martes foina), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> (Dama dama mesopotamica), wild goat (Capra aegagrus), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Middle East blind mole-rat (Nannospalax ehrenbergi) Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), wild cat (Felis silvestris), Cape hyrax (Procavia capensis). The reserve launched a project to reintroduce the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) to the area from Jordan, after it was extinct in the mid-twentieth century. The reserve was most probably home to the Anatolian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana) which are extinct now in Lebanon. The aurochs (Bos primigenius) may have existed in the area in the middle ages as well.|$|E

Moreover, spatial preferences of mineral deer-licks were examined in relation to feeding habits. The study has demonstrated that the location of a deer-lick has a considerable impact on its use. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> prefer significantly (75 %) a deer-lick close to a watering place rather than the deer-lick close to the border of the area.

50|$|Interspecific {{competition}} with domestic livestock, including cattle, has also further reduced {{the amount of}} food available to the deer. A study performed in Africa found that densities of the zebra, another herbivore with a diet similar to cattle and to the <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> increased by 46% on average when cattle were removed from a region, which indicates that cattle are strong competitors for food and may be able to exert competitive pressure on the <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Mesola Forest (1, 058 ha), {{located in}} the Ferrara {{province}} {{in the north of}} Italy, is completely enclosed and is home to a small group of endemic red deer (Cervus elaphus) that used to be widespread across all of North Italy.

5000|$|Currently, two {{populations of}} <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> born {{native to the}} wild {{are located in the}} Karkheh and Dez {{wildlife}} refuges in Iran; additionally, several reintroduced populations are in Iran and Israel.

50|$|Natural predators of the <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> {{include the}} golden jackal, the Arabian wolf, the caracal, the striped hyena, and the Syrian brown bear; however, the primary {{predation}} {{pressure on the}} <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> is human poaching. Hunted for sport and for food since the early Neolithic era, {{the range of the}} deer was restricted from areas in northern Africa, eastern Europe, and western Asia to only including small regions of western Iran by 1875. The spread of firearms caused a further increase in deer poaching, dropping the population size to what was regarded as the deer’s extinction in the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> {{home range}} sizes vary {{based on gender}} and age. Older male deer are more {{territorial}} than younger males; however, older females stay closer to the site (within an average of 0.9 km) where they were reintroduced, while younger females migrate farther away (an average of 2.3 km from release site). Because of these migration behaviors, introducing younger <b>Persian</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> along with adults is critical to rebuilding the wild population, so they can expand {{the range of the}} population, thereby reducing overcrowding and intraspecific competition. Together, increased migration and dispersal and a larger home range size can contribute to higher chances of reintroduction success.|$|E
40|$|Information on {{interspecific}} {{aggression is}} scarce for wild ungulates.

40|$|Information {{is scarce}} on {{behavioural}} interference between wild ungulates. In particular, data are lacking on relationships between interference and habitat use. We analysed habitat correlates of behavioural interactions between <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> Dama dama and roe deer Capreolus capreolus at a feeding site, in a Mediterranean area. Previous {{research has shown}} that behavioural interference between these deer, with the former dominant over the latter, occurred also through direct aggression. Here we show that, for roe deer, the probability of being displaced by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> did not depend on the habitat where the deer meet. Interspecific encounters, thus interactions, were the most frequent in the habitat selected by roe deer, i. e. the set-aside grassland. In the habitats most used by <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> (pastures and crops), roe deer experienced a greater risk of suffering a displacement. The rate of intolerance encounters increased in spring, when habitat overlap occurred because <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> intensified the use of set-aside.

40|$|Interference is {{expected}} to occur at feeding areas between species with a similar diet, but few studies have tested this idea for wild ungulates. We analysed interactions between <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> European roe deer and wild boar, in three sites, in a Mediterranean area.

We documented {{the negative effects of}} behavioural interference by fallow on foraging behaviour of roe deer, under field conditions. Deer species built up 90 % interference interactions, with fallow always dominant on roe, also through direct aggression. Although roe deer decreased feeding and increased vigilance levels in proximity (< 50 m) of either <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> or wild boar, they were displaced significantly more often by the former than by the latter. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> were neither displaced nor alarmed by roe and rarely by wild boar. No deer species displaced wild boar. Interference was significantly greater on solitary roe deer, especially females, in spring and roe left the feeding ground most often in the smallest site (13 ha). Roe deer avoided areas where the local density of <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> was the highest. During our 4 -year-study, roe deer density decreased whereas <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> numbers increased. Behavioural interference may explain how <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> outcompete roe deer through spatial exclusion from feeding sites and avoidance of areas with high densities of the former. <b>Fallow</b> <b>deer</b> evolved in semi-arid, relatively poor habitats of Asia Minor: interspecific defence of crucial resources could have developed as a beneficial tactic for its survival...|$|R
