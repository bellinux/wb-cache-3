40|$|The {{effect of}} {{atmosphere}} on the tribological properties of a plasma-sprayed chromium carbide based self-lubricating coating is reported. The coating contains bonded chromium carbide as the wear resistant base stock {{to which the}} lubricants silver and barium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic are added. It has been denoted as NASA PS 200. Potential applications for the PS 200 coating are cylinder wall/piston ring couples for Stirling engines and foil bearing journal lubrication. Friction and wear studies were performed in helium, hydrogen, and moist air at temperatures from 25 to 760 C. In general, the atmosphere {{had a significant effect}} on both the friction and the wear of the coating and counterface material. Specimens tested in hydrogen, a reducing environment, exhibited the best tribological properties. Friction and wear increased in helium and air but are still within acceptable limits for intended applications. A variety of X-ray analyses was performed on the test specimens in an effort to explain the results. The following conclusions are made: (1) As the test atmosphere becomes less reducing, the coating experiences a higher concentration level of chromic oxide at the sliding interface which increases both the friction and wear. (2) Beneficial silver transfer from the <b>parent</b> <b>coating</b> to the counter-face material is less effective in air than in helium or hydrogen. (3) There may be a direct relationship between chromic oxide level present at the sliding interface and the friction coefficient...|$|E

50|$|The {{champagne}} gene is {{a simple}} dominant allele responsible {{for a number of}} rare horse coat colors. The most distinctive traits of horses with the champagne gene are the hazel eyes and pinkish, freckled skin, which are bright blue and bright pink at birth, respectively. The coat color is also affected: any hairs that would have been red are gold, and any hairs that would have been black are chocolate brown. If a horse inherits the champagne gene from either or both <b>parents,</b> a <b>coat</b> that would otherwise be chestnut is instead gold champagne, with bay corresponding to amber champagne, seal brown to sable champagne, and black to classic champagne. A horse must have at least one champagne parent to inherit the champagne gene, for which there is now a DNA test.|$|R
50|$|A pumapard is {{a hybrid}} animal {{resulting}} from a mating between a leopard and a puma (a member of the genus Puma, not the genus Panthera). Three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late 1890s and early 1900s by Carl Hagenbeck at his animal park in Hamburg, Germany. While most of these animals did not reach adulthood, one of these was purchased in 1898 by the Berlin Zoo. A similar hybrid in the Berlin Zoo purchased from Hagenbeck was {{a cross between a}} male leopard and a female puma. A specimen in the Hamburg Zoo (in the photo at right) was the reverse pairing, fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess. The pumapard is characterised by a long body like the puma's, but with shorter legs. The hybrid is in general a dwarf, smaller than either <b>parent.</b> The <b>coat</b> is variously described as sandy, tawny or greyish with brown, chestnut or faded rosettes.|$|R
40|$|Microwaves at 2. 45 GHz {{have been}} used to ignite the self-propagating high{{temperature}}synthesis (SHS) in a Ni and Al powder mixture to produce NiAl coatingson Ti. The temperature of the reacting powders, owing to the exothermic nature ofthe reaction and to the energy provided by the high frequency electromagnetic field,reaches the melting temperature of NiAl. The newly formed NiAl, in the liquid phase,reacts with the underlying Ti and rapidly forms at the interface a ternary eutecticbelonging to the Ni-Al-Ti system. During cooling, the formed transient liquid eutecticlayer at the Ti/NiAl interface originates an intermediate layer presenting aninterlocking network, which constitutes an in-situ reinforcement phase. In this studyit is shown that the thickness of the interface layer can be altered by annealing at temperature higher than the ternary eutectic temperature (904 °C), in a few minutestime. Experimental results demonstrated also that, due to its peculiar microstructure,the intermediate layer is tougher and harder than the <b>parent</b> NiAl <b>coating...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the origin of}} running-in friction in unlubricated sliding wear, a magnetron sputtered multilayer coating TiAlN/VN was tested on a ball-on-disc tribometer {{for a series of}} sliding durations from 10 to 1000 cycles, followed by careful observation of the obtained worn surfaces using an field-emission gun scanning electron microscope. Three steps of friction variation were found: (1) prior to wear particle generation, low initial friction coefficient was around 0. 2 – 0. 25 purely attributed to the asperity contact; (2) then it increased steeply to a range of 0. 4 – 0. 5 in the first 100 cycles following the generation, breaking and agglomeration of wear particles, and in particular the scaling-up of fish-scale-like tribofilm; (3) eventually it approached to a steady-state value around 0. 5 when the friction was governed by the viscous shearing of the tribofilm. It is concluded that, under unlubricated sliding wear, the friction behaviour of transition metal nitride hard coating is dominated by the viscous shearing of tribofilm adhesively bonding to the <b>parent</b> nitride <b>coating...</b>|$|R
40|$|Microwaves at 2 · 45 GHz {{have been}} used to ignite the self-propagating high {{temperature}} synthesis of Ni and Al powder mixtures (50 : 50 at-%) to produce a duplex intermetallic coating on Ti substrates. Owing to the high β-NiAl synthesis reaction enthalpy and the energy provided by the electromagnetic field, the newly formed aluminide is in the liquid phase. Thus, it can react with the underlying Ti substrate, forming a ternary eutectic at the interface, belonging to the Ni‐Al‐Ti system. The peculiar interlocking microstructure of such ternary layer is responsible for an increase in toughness and hardness compared to the <b>parent</b> NiAl <b>coating.</b> Moreover, the ternary layer’s oxidation resistance was tested, showing the possibility of replacing the functionality of hard and brittle NiAl, but limitedly up to 750 °C. This can be ascribed to the relatively low Al content in the ternary layer, which hinders the formation of a continuous and protective Al 2 O 3 scale. For this reason, the increase in Al content, or the addition of further elements such as Cr or Si, in the starting powder mixture, helps improve the oxidation resistance of the complex intermetallic coating at the interface, up to the tested temperature of 900 °C...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{explores the}} {{capabilities}} of methods for in-situ synthesis of titanium aluminides using the Direct Metal Deposition process. This allows for the functional grading of components which will be required for next generation aerospace components. The feasibility of three techniques are explored here; firstly, a new process of powder preparation for Additive Manufacturing, satelliting, in which a larger <b>parent</b> powder is <b>coated</b> with a smaller powder fraction. Here, Al parent particles are satellited with fine TiO 2 to produce an intermetallic matrix composite with Al 2 O 3 particulates. The satelliting procedure is shown to increase capability and mixing of in situ synthesis. Secondly, combined wire and single powder feeding is explored {{through the use of}} Ti wire and Al powder to create Ti- 50 Al (at%). Finally, a combination of wire and loose mixed powders is explored to produce the commercially deployed Ti- 48 Al- 2 Cr- 2 Nb (at%) alloy. The simultaneous wire and powder delivery is designed to overcome issues encountered when processing with single powder or wire feedstocks, whilst allowing for on-the-fly changes in elemental composition required for functional grading. Characterisation of the deposits produced, through OM, SEM, and EDX, reveal the influence of key processing parameters and provides a meaningful basis for comparison between the techniques. Results show {{that it is possible to}} produce α 2 +γ two-phase microstructures consistent with previous studies which have relied upon more expensive and harder to obtain pre-alloyed feedstocks. This represents a move forward in manufacturability for an emergent process type...|$|R
