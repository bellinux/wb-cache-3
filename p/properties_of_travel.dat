40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{bottleneck}} model to study congestion behavior of morning commute with flexible work schedule. The proposed model assumes a stochastic bottleneck capacity which follows a uniform distribution and homogeneous commuters {{who have the}} same preferred arrival time interval. The commuters are {{fully aware of the}} stochastic <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> time and schedule delay distributions at all departure times that emerge from day-to-day capacity variations. The commuters' departure time choice follows user equilibrium (UE) principle in terms of the expected trip cost. Analytical and numerical solutions of this model are provided. The equilibrium departure time patterns are examined which show that the stochastic capacity increases the mean trip cost and lengthens the rush hour. The adoption of flexitime results in less congestion and more efficient use of bottleneck capacity than fixed-time work schedule. The longer the flexi-time interval is, the more uniformly distributed the departure times are...|$|E
40|$|While {{research}} on time-varying graphs has attracted recent attention, the research community has limited or {{no access to}} real datasets to develop effective algorithms and systems. Using noisy and sparse GPS traces from vehicles, we develop a time-varying road network data set where edge weights differ over time. We present our methodology and share this dataset, along with a graph manipulation tool. We estimate the traffic conditions using the sparse GPS data available by characterizing the sparsity issues and assessing the <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> sequence data frequency domain. We develop interpolation methods to complete the sparse data into a complete graph dataset with realistic time-varying edge values. We evaluate the performance of time-varying and static shortest path solutions over the generated dynamic road network. The shortest paths using the dynamic graph produce very different results than the static version. We provide an independent Java API and a graph database to analyze and manipulate the generated time-varying graph data easily, not requiring any knowledge about the inners of the graph database system. We expect our solution to support researchers to pursue problems of time-varying graphs in terms of theoretical, algorithmic, and systems aspects. The data and Java API are available at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> {{times when the}} latter are derived from traffic-flow models. In particular we consider exit-flow models, which {{have been used to}} model time-varying flows on road networks, in dynamic traffic assignment (DTA). But we here define the class more widely to include, for example, models based on finite difference approximations to the LWR (Lighthill, Whitham and Richards) model of traffic flow, and ‘large step’ versions of these. For the derived travel times we {{investigate the}} properties of existence, uniqueness, continuity, first-in-first-out (FIFO), causality and time-flow consistency (or intertemporal consistency). We assume a single traffic type and assume that time may be treated as continuous or as discrete, and for each case we obtain conditions under which the above properties are satisfied, and interrelations among the properties. For example, we find that FIFO is easily satisfied, but not strict causality, and find that if we redefine travel time to ensure strict causality then we lose time-flow consistency, and that neither of these conditions is strictly necessary or sufficient for FIFO. All of the models can be viewed as an approximation to a model that is continuous in time and space (the LWR model), and it seems that any loss of desirable properties is the price we pay for using such approximations. We also extend the exit-flow models and results to allow ‘inhomogeneity ’ over time (link capacity or other parameters changing over time), and show that FIFO is still ensured if the exit-flow function is defined appropriately...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGrowing {{concerns}} regarding urban congestion, {{and the recent}} explosion of mobile devices able to provide real-time information to traffic users have motivated increasing reliance on real-time route guidance for the online management of traffic networks. However, while the theory of traffic equilibria is very well-known, much fewer results exist on the stability of such equilibria, especially {{in the context of}} adaptive routing policy. In this work, we consider the problem of characterizing the stability properties of traffic equilibria in the context of online adaptive route choice induced by GPS-based decision making. We first extend the recent framework of “Markovian Traffic Equilibria” (MTE), in which users update their route choice at each intersection of the road network based on traffic conditions, to the case of non-equilibrium conditions, while preserving consistency with known existence and uniqueness results on MTE. We then exhibit sufficient conditions on the network topology and the latency functions for those MTEs to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov for a single destination problem. For various more restricted classes of network topologies motivated by the observed <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> patterns in the Singapore network, under certain assumptions we prove local exponential stability of the MTE, and derive analytical results on the sensitivity of the characteristic time of convergence on network and traffic parameters. The results proposed in this work are illustrated and validated on synthetic toy problems {{as well as on the}} full Singapore road network with real demand and traffic data, and the applicability of our results for online road network analysis, pricing and control is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the significance of}} traveller information sources including mono-modal and multimodal websites for travel decisions. The research follows a decision paradigm developed earlier, involving an information acquisition process for travel choices, and identifies the abstract characteristics of new information sources that deserve further investigation (e. g. by incorporating these in models and studying their significance in model estimation). A Stated Preference experiment is developed and the utility functions are formulated by expanding the travellers' choice set to include different combinations of sources of information. In order to study the underlying choice mechanisms, the resulting variables are examined in models based on different behavioural strategies, including utility maximisation and minimising the regret associated with the foregone alternatives. This research confirmed that RRM (Random Regret Minimisation) Theory can fruitfully be used and can provide important insights for behavioural studies. The study also analyses the <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> planning websites and establishes a link between travel choices and the content, provenance, design, presence of advertisements, and presentation of information. The results indicate that travellers give particular credence to governmentowned sources and put more importance on their own previous experiences than on any other single source of information. Information from multimodal websites is more influential than that on train-only websites. This in turn is more influential than information from friends, while information from coachonly websites is the least influential. A website with less search time, specific information on users' own criteria, and real time information is regarded as most attractiv...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of history {{matching}} is to construct updated models capable of predicting the future {{performance of the}} reservoir more accurately. History matching method requires a solution of inverse problem to minimize the objective function. The main idea of the inverse problem is to find model parameters that best match to the production data. An inverse problem {{is said to be}} well-posed if stable and unique solution exists, else the problem is said to be ill-posed. Typically history matching is an ill-posed problem, for which non-unique solution exists. Therefore, regularization by parameterization is applied in this thesis {{to reduce the number of}} unknown parameters in order to alleviate the problem of ill-posedness. The parameterization includes two aspects: the parameterization structure determined by the set of bases functions and the corresponding coefficients embedded in the structure. Stepwise estimation strategy of parameterization structure is used to sequentially find new parameterization structure that leads to large decrease in the objective function. There are different approaches that can be used to integrate the geological model to production data. These include amplitude matching, time inversion and generalized travel time inversion (GTTI). GTTI is used in this thesis as it merges the travel time matching with the amplitude matching, in such a way that, it preserves the quasi-linear <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> time inversion while using the overall production data. In history matching, different optimization algorithms are applied to minimize the objective function. Levenberg-Marquard optimization method is used in this thesis. It is Guass-newton method with a trust region strategy and modified by adding positive term. The work in this thesis is based on the implementation in [1] and extended using the idea that are presented in [5]. Then the parameterization method is compared with standard method both in the ability to reduce the objective function and in characterizing the permeability field. Simulation results illustrated that the parameterization method showed better performance in reducing the objective function and in characterizing the permeability field for simple cases. But for last case the method did not performed well...|$|E

We find that the so-called Configurational Entropy (CE) for travelling solitons, which we name as travelling Configurational Entropy (TCE), shows that the best value of parameter responsible to break the Lorentz symmetry is one where the energy density is distributed equally around the origin.
