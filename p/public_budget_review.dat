Since {{the publication of}} the ROSC in late 2001, Mongolia has made significant progress in enhancing transparency practices in the fiscal area. Actions have been taken under each of the four areas underlying the fiscal transparency code. A new Public Sector Management and Finance Law (PSMFL) was adopted in June 2002 to set the legal basis for public administration reforms, output budgeting, and accrual accounting.

40|$|The very {{important}} instrument {{of public policy}} is a <b>public</b> <b>budgets</b> system, {{which is one of}} the most significant parts of the budgetary scale. <b>Public</b> <b>budget</b> performs an allocation, redistribution and stabilization function and as an account balance it balances ordinary and capital incomes and outlays. <b>Public</b> <b>budget</b> consists of state budget and municipal authorities budget. Nowadays most of European <b>public</b> <b>budgets</b> are deficient. Fiscal deficit is a result of a short-term imbalance. In the Czech Republic the <b>public</b> <b>budgets</b> have been deficient since 1996, when the balance of public incomes and outlays was - 11, 5 milliard CZK. After the admission of the Czech Republic to the European Union the public deficit within convergence criteria has been still declining under the norm of 3 % GDP. In order to <b>public</b> <b>budgets</b> deficit reducing the public finances reform is in progress in the Czech Republic.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the breadth of the}} current forecast literature as it relates to <b>public</b> <b>budget</b> making. It serves to provide summary information to decision-makers who otherwise do not have the resources to learn more than a small amount focused on much more narrowly defined areas of forecasting (such as the politics of forecast bias). Next, it serves those who perform forecasting related to <b>budgeting</b> by <b>reviewing</b> the current methods and practices commonly used in this domain. It also provides a ground level for future <b>public</b> <b>budget</b> forecasting research. Finally, this article identifies several areas in which the public forecasting literature needs additional development. Several of these areas, such as the effectiveness of nonregression-based forecasting techniques, are quite important to the majority of governments in the United States and other subnational jurisdictions, where budget offices are limited and resource investments in technology are scarce...|$|R

The role of <b>public</b> <b>budgets</b> in the former communist countries of Europe has expanded {{in the period of}} their economic transition, as these countries face relatively limited financial resources and numerous environmental challenges. <b>Public</b> <b>budgets</b> in the Czech Republic include the state budget, the State Environmental Fund, municipal and regional budgets and that of the National Property Fund (holder of the state?s corporate assets).

40|$|In {{the social}} sectors, {{encouraging}} results were obtained in education. The Ten-Year Education Program was finalized, creating a solid {{basis for the}} implementation of actions in this sector. According to the most recent estimates, the basic enrolment rate was 41. 7 percent in 2002 compared with 37. 3 percent in 2001. These results are owing to the efforts of the government in recruiting volunteer teachers and building and equipping of classrooms. The government also adopted a national policy for higher education.

The analysis concerns all governments between years 1993 and 2010 and shows possible connections with the political-business cycle. Origins of <b>public</b> <b>budgets</b> deficits are investigated in order to classify cyclical and structural deficit. These are established {{on the basis of}} political measures and the economic cycle analysis. First part of the thesis is based on the theory of Public finance, Public choice and Political-business cycle. Second part focuses on the analysis of economic cycles within the context of each election period and political decisions. Finally the thesis summarizes results of investigation at the said period and the influence of the economic policy of every government on results of <b>public</b> <b>budgets.</b> The economic cycle analysis demonstrate that between years 1993 and 2010 deficits of <b>public</b> <b>budgets</b> are predominantly structural...|$|R

40|$|Complexity {{studies were}} nonexistent until {{the work of}} Poincare during the period between 1881 and 1886. Poincare‟s work {{illustrated}} the first indication of chaotic behavior in a dynamic system. Today, complexity studies extend to vast areas {{in the fields of}} natural and social sciences. These studies uncover information of complex nature through paradigms such as interconnectedness, network, process, self-organization, mutual causality, bifurcation, scattered matrix, emergence, collapse dynamics, and phase shift. In <b>public</b> policy and <b>budgeting,</b> complexity studies are also making their way to observe various complex phenomena, providing information that the traditional Newtonian sciences are not capable of providing. Yet, teaching <b>public</b> <b>budgeting</b> through complexity models still is not widely accepted in most institutions of higher education despite the in-depth and vast information that these models uncover. This is because most institutions of higher learning still are constrained by top-down hierarchal systems that promote control and linear observations. Studying <b>public</b> <b>budgeting</b> falls under such limitation, preventing students from appreciating the complex nature of the discipline. This article addresses the problems and limitations of the current linear methods in teaching <b>public</b> <b>budgeting</b> in most institutions of higher learning. It then offers a complexity model in teaching <b>public</b> <b>budgeting</b> and the benefits gained through the application of such model in studying the subject.
