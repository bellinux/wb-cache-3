5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{may be more}} biologically productive than most other sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy catsharks {{from a number of}} locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|During the Palladian revival {{period in}} Ireland, even quite modest mansions were {{cast in a}} neo-Palladian mould. Palladian {{architecture}} in Ireland subtly differs from that in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.|$|E
5|$|Through the series, {{the cities}} used within the Crazy Taxi games have been {{influenced}} by real-world cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, and Las Vegas. Certain versions of the Crazy Taxi game include in-game counterparts of real-world businesses, including Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, FILA, and Tower Records; these were often destination targets for the passengers. Although {{this is one of the}} most prominent examples of product placement in video gaming history, it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> gives a sense of realism to the fictional cities in the game. These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties.|$|E
50|$|While {{providing}} extensive {{public affairs}} programming {{to the greater}} Tampa Bay area, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it,</b> WMNF has at times {{become the focus of}} controversy.|$|R
5000|$|Despite this controversy, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it,</b> he {{released}} a record himself, [...] "Hand In Hand"/"Friends In Need", on the Butterfly record label. It {{was not a}} chart hit.|$|R
5000|$|Jennifer Clay of Yahoo! Music {{noted that}} [...] "Ghosts" [...] sounded like {{material}} from the Thriller era. A longtime commentator on Jackson's public life, J. Randy Taraborrelli, gave a retrospective analysis of the album in the biography, The Magic & the Madness. Taraborrelli explained, [...] "Several of the other songs on Blood are also memorable. 'Ghosts' stands out, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> so evocative of Michael's spell-binding Ghosts long-styled video...it's classic, must-see Michael Jackson".|$|R
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was {{the lead}} cruiser in the U.S. formation, Atlanta {{was the target of}} fire and torpedoes from several Japanese ships—probably {{including}} Nagara, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi—in addition to Akatsuki. The gunfire caused heavy damage to Atlanta, and a type 93 torpedo strike cut all of her engineering power. The disabled cruiser drifted into the line of fire of SanFrancisco, which accidentally fired on her, causing even greater damage. Admiral Scott and many of the bridge crew were killed. Without power and unable to fire her guns, Atlanta drifted out of control and out of the battle as the Japanese ships passed her by. The lead U.S. destroyer, Cushing, was also caught in a crossfire between several Japanese destroyers and perhaps Nagara. She too was hit heavily and stopped dead in the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (<b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|Tikal {{as a whole}} {{went into}} general decline during the Terminal Classic, with {{some parts of the}} city {{apparently}} being abandoned. The Mundo Perdido, however, continued to be a centre of vigorous ceremonial activity. Evidence of this continued activity in the complex includes burials and collections of ceramic and lithic artefacts, together with significant construction activity. The main Late Classic structures were fitted with new benches and a change to access routes to the complex took place. Activity was concentrated in the northern portion of the Mundo Perdido, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was closest to the Temple Reservoir water supply. Some minor changes were made to the Talud-Tablero Temple at this time. The greatest residential activity during the Terminal Classic took place in the vaulted palace immediately to the east of the Talud-Tablero Temple (Structures 5C-45 through to 5C-47). This activity included complex construction projects and indicates that the elite were still in residence immediately prior to the complete abandonment of the city. Further construction activity, in the form of structural strengthening, also took place in other structures in the northern sector, including Structures 5D-77 and 5D-82. Ritual activity also continued, and the bottom half of Early Classic Stela 39 was placed in Temple 5D-86 on the East Platform and worshipped.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reviewer}} Thom Jurek of AllMusic.com {{awarded the}} album 4 stars. Geoffrey Himes at JazzTimes wrote, [...] "Melody writing {{is the most}} underrated skill in jazz today, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> also the rarest. There are thousands of jazz musicians who congratulate themselves on writing in 7/4 and 9/4 and on shifting their solos from tonal to atonal and back again. But {{how many of them}} can write a ballad that someone might want to hum to a lover?" ...|$|R
50|$|Thes One and Double K have {{described}} themselves as musicians first and rappers second, but despite that distinction (or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it),</b> they have developed a distinctive lyrical style with several recurring themes.|$|R
25|$|Dönitz's second book, Mein wechselvolles Leben (My Ever-Changing Life) is less known, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{deals with}} the events of his life before 1934. This book was first {{published}} in 1968, and a new edition was released in 1998 with the revised title Mein soldatisches Leben (My Martial Life).|$|E
25|$|Agreeableness is {{negatively}} correlated with income, although agreeable people can be less disruptive in teams {{and are more likely}} to be liked, although not necessarily respected, by their coworkers. Less agreeable people tend to make more effective managers, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is not easy to take advantage of them.|$|E
25|$|More {{modification}} of the technique occurred in the 18th century, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was no longer done only by the indigenous. Feather work was supplemented {{with the use of}} oil paint to depict people (especially faces and hands), landscapes and animals and tiny strips of paper were dropped along with the outer borders.|$|E
25|$|Despite drug {{legislation}} (or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it),</b> large, organized criminal {{drug cartels}} operate worldwide. Advocates of decriminalization argue that drug prohibition makes drug dealing a lucrative business, leading {{to much of}} the associated criminal activity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I don't know," [...] {{said the}} minister. [...] "There is {{something}} in personal attendance upon us that dishonours; but the reasons of it are very obscure; I couldn't give them. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> work that in a simpler state of things each of us would do for himself, and in this state is too proud to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} the song was banned from radio airplay, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it,</b> it became a hit, with Libby Holman's version going to #5 and the [...] "Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians" [...] version going to #14, both in 1931.|$|R
25|$|In Thackeray's own day some commentators, such as Anthony Trollope, ranked his History of Henry Esmond as his {{greatest}} work, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> expressed Victorian values of duty and earnestness, as {{did some of}} his other later novels. It is perhaps {{for this reason that}} they have not survived as well as Vanity Fair, which satirises those values.|$|E
25|$|Neolithic Ugarit was {{important}} enough to be fortified with a wall early on, perhaps by 6000 BCE, though the site {{is thought to have}} been inhabited earlier. Ugarit {{was important}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was both a port and at the entrance of the inland trade route to the Euphrates and Tigris lands. The city reached its heyday between 1800 and 1200 BC, when it ruled a trade-based coastal kingdom, trading with Egypt, Cyprus, the Aegean, Syria, the Hittites, and much of the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Is {{he going}} to throw it away? Is {{he going to}} beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E

40|$|Chaucer's villainous Pardoner {{is arguably}} his most unforgettable creation. Notwithstanding his shameless {{confession}} of his depraved nature, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it,</b> we cannot {{help but be}} drawn towards this paragon of evil, as we are drawn towards anybody who practices his profession so consummately either for good or for evil.

50|$|Despite his {{military}} service, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it,</b> the Prince became a pacifist, establishing the International Institute of Peace in Monaco {{as a place}} to develop a peaceful settlement for conflict through arbitration. In the tension-filled times leading up to World War I, Prince Albert made numerous attempts to dissuade Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II from war.|$|R
25|$|Among current {{educational}} psychologists, {{the cognitive}} perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> admits causally related mental constructs such as traits, beliefs, memories, motivations and emotions. Cognitive theories claim that memory structures determine how information is perceived, processed, stored, retrieved and forgotten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by Allan Paivio's dual coding theory. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and cognitive load theory {{to explain how}} people learn from multimedia presentations.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{systemic}} paralysis {{is possible}} in humans, {{it is now a}} relatively rare occurrence. This is because an engorging adult female tick needs to remain attached for several days. This was more likely to occur in the past because there was less medical and public awareness of the problem and <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was more likely to be misdiagnosed as 'infantile paralysis' (poliomyelitis or 'polio'). Paralysis is more likely to occur in children and in situations where ticks are attached in places they are not easily detected (e.g. under bandages). Up to 1989, 20 human fatalities had been reported in Australia.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} it was {{believed}} that Blaufränkisch was a clone of the Gamay grape of Beaujolais, {{due in part to the}} prevalence of the synonym Gamé used in Bulgaria, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was thought that there was a parent-offspring relationship between the two. However, in the 21st century DNA evidence showed that Blaufränkisch was an offspring of Gouais blanc and an unknown parent, making it a half-sibling to Gamay as well as other varieties of grapes which have Gouais blanc as a parent such as Chardonnay, Riesling, Elbling, Aramon noir, Grolleau noir, Muscadelle and Colombard.|$|E
50|$|Despite this {{controversy}} - or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it</b> - the play sold out on its initial run and, by the end, was playing to an enthusiastic young audience.

50|$|The Sakaume-gumi is an old-established, {{small group}} that focuses {{primarily}} on gambling, {{and not on}} other activities like extortion and drugs. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of this, <b>it</b> has had relatively {{good relations with the}} local police.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the exact}} {{origins of the}} term are uncertain, <b>it</b> was <b>perhaps</b> {{so-called}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was first noted in regions inhabited by Native Americans ("Indians"), or because the Native Americans first described it to Europeans,, or it had been based on the warm and hazy conditions in autumn when Native Americans hunted.|$|R
25|$|William and Mary Choate invited Mark Pitman (1830–1905), their tenant in the {{aforementioned}} Red House, {{to start a}} boys school under their sponsorship. Pitman, Bowdoin class of 1859, was sixty-six years old, a widower, and had been principal of Woolsey School in New Haven, Connecticut, since 1872. He accepted the Choates' offer, not least <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would provide employment for his unmarried adult daughters, Leila, Elizabeth, and Helen. Six boys entered the new school in fall term 1896, their average age about ten. Four of the six lived in Red House with the Pitmans, and Red House (now Squire Stanley House) has remained a dormitory to the present day.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan of the}} Chapel holds to the Gothic {{tradition}} of the T form, but the proportions of the interior, the arrangement of bays and buttresses outside, and the carving, are distinctly classical. Perhaps it was difficult owing to the disturbed state {{of the country to}} get carvers outside Oxford; in any case he had to use up old material. For some reason or other, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> contains swags and Classic capitals, it has been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren. Certainly he was in Oxford in 1656, not being elected to the Gresham Professorship till 1657, but from then onwards {{he spent most of his}} time in London, and probably did not return till his election to the Savilian Professorship in 1661. It is possible that he was interested in the matter, as an amateur: his father had very strong architectural leanings, and may have imbued his son with like interests: but there is absolutely no evidence in support of the theory, nor is there anything to show that he had any interest in architecture before his appointment to the post of Assistant Surveyor General in 1662, when the Chapel was practically completed. Beyond details of carving, there is little resemblance to his work, and the building lacks the unity and feeling for proportion and scale which are the chief characteristics of Wren's style.|$|E
500|$|Vanadium is a medium-hard, ductile, steel-blue metal. Some sources {{describe}} vanadium as [...] "soft", <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is ductile, malleable and not brittle. Vanadium {{is harder}} than most metals and steels (see Hardnesses {{of the elements}} (data page) and iron). It has good resistance to corrosion and it is stable against alkalis and sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. It is oxidized in air at about 933K (660°C, 1220°F), although an oxide passivation layer forms even at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons why I prefer Monhegan to all other places on the Atlantic coast.... The cliffs are so bold and precipitous and the studies offered by the island shore so inexhaustible.

2500|$|... {{so much is}} made of the deep, deep exculpatory {{shame of}} illiteracy– {{despite the fact that}} burning 300 people to death doesn't require reading skills– that some worshipful {{accounts}} of the novel (by those who buy into its ludicrous premise, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> been declared [...] "classic" [...] and [...] "profound") actually seem to affirm that illiteracy is something more to be ashamed of than participating in mass murder... Lack of reading skills is more disgraceful than listening in bovine silence to the screams of 300 people as they are burned to death behind the locked doors of a church you're guarding to prevent them from escaping the flames. Which is what Hanna did, although, of course, it's not shown in the film.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} this view — or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it</b> — Becker is warmly remembered for {{the manner in which}} he handled one of America's deepest tragedies on the air.
