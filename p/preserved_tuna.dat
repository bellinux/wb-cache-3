40|$|Tuna is a main export {{commodity}} of {{the fisheries}} sector {{with the average}} proportion of 15. 31 % of the total production. Indonesian tunas exported {{in the form of}} fresh, frozen, and <b>preserved</b> <b>tunas</b> with Japan and the USA as traditional markets. Through the Strategic Plan 2010 - 2014, Rep. of Korea has been set {{to be one of the}} prospective markets. The changes in the global order has not been only providing opportunities but on the other hand increasing the competition, so the competitiveness of products had become the key factor to win the competition. The research use the time series data of world’s import export tunas in 1982 - 2012 with the main source UNComtrade and Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of Indonesia. Data were analyzed to measure Market Share (MS), Revealed Symmetric Comparative Advantage (RSCA), Trade Specialist Ratio (TSR), and Constant Market Share Analysis (CMSA). The results showed that: (1) Indonesia Tunas has a highly competitiveness in world market and the competitiveness of fresh tunas is higher than frozen and <b>preserved</b> <b>tunas,</b> (2) Indonesia is the world's major exporter of fresh tunas, (3) Indonesian tunas have high competitiveness In the Japanese market, the USA, and Rep. of Korea, with the rate of growth go to maturity, and (4) competitiveness of Indonesian tuna is caused by the effect of specific competitiveness...|$|R

By the Mesolithic, an increase in the quantity of obsidian occurs contemporaneously with the appearance of bones from bluefin tuna weighing up to 200 kg.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out on several in-oil <b>preserved</b> canned <b>tuna</b> samples to evaluate the degradation level of the refined oil medium by means of recent analytical parameters {{as well as by}} the routine analysis prescribed by the EC Regulations. The analytical results show that the HPSEC analysis of polar compounds, separates and quantifies classes of oxidation (triglyceride oligopolymers and oxidized triglycerides) and hydrolysis (diglycerides) substances, giving a much more accurate evaluation of the quality of refined oils used as preserving medium in canned foodstuffs with respect to the routine analyses...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to assess the quality of vegetable oils used as liquid medium in <b>preserved</b> fish. Sixteen <b>tuna</b> <b>preserves</b> were tested, including two in extra virgin olive oil, nine in olive oil (refined olive oil plus virgin olive oil) and five in refined seed oil. Next to the traditional routine analyses prescribed by the EEC Regulation N° 2568 / 91 (useful for a preliminary characterisation of oils used as liquid medium), the content of trans isomers of unsaturated fatty acids was determined and the analysis of polar compounds was performed by HPSEC (high performance size-exclusion chromatography). The acid composition showed the presence of highly unsaturated fatty acids, typical of fish lipids. Trans isomers were always absent in extra virgin olive oils, whereas they were always present in olive oils and in refined seed oils. Triglyceride oligopolymers, oxidised triglycerides and diglycerides, measured {{by means of the}} HPSEC analysis of polar compounds, ranged within 0. 13 – 1. 07...|$|R

The element of umami, considered one of the five basic tastes in Japan, is introduced into dashi from the use of katsuobushi. Katsuobushi is especially high in sodium inosinate, which is identified as one source of umami.|$|R
40|$|The scombroid {{poisoning}} {{is due to}} the {{ingestion of}} poorly <b>preserved</b> fish (especially <b>tuna,</b> sardines, and mackerel) out of the cold chain.

40|$|The word {{mackerel}} is {{a common}} one in every day conversation. Everywhere we can hear such expressions as, "holy mackerel," "dead as a mackerel," and "cold as a mackerel. " Undoubtedly the fish called mackerel, from which these terms have arisen, must be universally popular and well known. It is hoped that the following pages will give {{some idea of the}} popularity and economic importance of this fish. The irregular habits and the unheralded periods of scarcity or abundance of the common Atlantic mackerel are subjects of great concern to the fishermen of Europe and America. The occasional failure of the mackerel to appear spells hardship and privation for many fishermen and dealers, and when its does appear in the vast shoals that are eagerly awaited each spring, adverse economic conditions sometimes prevent the fishermen from making a living. In California the mackerel is always present, summer and winter, year in and year out, but because of economic factors the fishery is subject to sudden ups and downs. As might be expected, the habits of the Atlantic mackerel have long been the subject of speculation and study, both by fishermen and scientists. Many stories are current about how the mackerel spends the winter, the time when it is absent from the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North America. One of the most common stories is that the fish bury themselves in the mud {{at the bottom of the}} sea and that during this hibernation a film comes over their eyes so they are rendered blind. Some people claim that the mackerel go into the Arctic Ocean to spend the winter; others say that they go south into the tropics. The only certain fact is that nobody really knows where the majority of the mackerel spend the winter and that one guess is as good as another. Mackerel occasionally appear in shoals so dense and extensive that the ocean is colored with them for miles. At these times it is said to be dangerous to enter the water. A story is told of a Norwegian fisherman who fell overboard into a school of mackerel and was torn to pieces by the savage fish before his comrades could pull him out. This story is probably somewhat exaggerated, but the thought of that luckless fellow would suffice to keep most people from diving into a swarm of hungry mackerel. The idea has arisen in some places, notably Australia, that the flesh of the mackerel and mackerel-like fishes is poisonous. As a matter of fact, no food is more wholesome than fresh or properly <b>preserved</b> mackerel, <b>tuna</b> or bonito. However, all these fish spoil readily if not cared for, and stale fish can cause illness, and the illness can cause stories about poison. The scombroid or mackerel-like fishes are of very great commercial importance throughout the world. The four most important groups of fishes are those comprising the herring, salmon, codfish and mackerel families. Of the mackerel family, the two mackerels (Scomber and Pneumatophorus) are among the most widespread and universally important, although the tunas, bonitos, seerfishes, and Spanish mackerels help to keep the family Scombridae in a leading position. The fishermen of nearly every maritime nation in the temperate zones catch mackerel in large numbers. The annual catch (1928 – 1929) off the North Sea and Atlantic coasts of Europe amounts to 100, 000, 000 pounds. The fishermen of the Atlantic coast of North America catch 40, 000, 000 to 60, 000, 000 pounds of mackerel every year (1924 – 1930). The California fishery accounts for 15, 000, 000 to 60, 000, 000 pounds annually (1928 – 1931). Japan, with an annual (1923 – 1925) catch of about 150, 000, 000 pounds, is the largest consumer of mackerel in the world. In addition to the foregoing, there are important mackerel fisheries in the Mediterranean and Black seas, and lesser fisheries in Australia, New Zealand and South America. The mackerel is everywhere primarily a fresh fish, that is to say, the greatest part of the world catch is consumed in a fresh state. Nevertheless, really enormous quantities are canned, salted or dried in many parts of the world. The canning industry is a recent development, dating back no farther than the nineteenth century. Salting and drying, however, are ancient methods of preserving fish so they can be sent to distant markets or held over from periods of abundance to times of scarcity. Before modern refrigeration methods made possible the transportation or holding of fresh mackerel in quantities, salted mackerel was by far the most important product of the world's mackerel fishery...|$|R
