5|$|The {{most common}} method of {{controlling}} the louvers is the balanced swell pedal. This device is usually placed above {{the centre of the}} pedalboard and is configured to rotate away from the organist from a near-vertical <b>position</b> (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> the shades are closed) to a near-horizontal <b>position</b> (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> the shades are open). An organ may also have a similar-looking crescendo pedal, found alongside any expression pedals. Pressing the crescendo pedal forward cumulatively activates the stops of the organ, starting with the softest and ending with the loudest; pressing it backwards reverses this process.|$|E
5|$|In August 1928, Godley was {{appointed}} to the governorship of Gibraltar, a <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he remained until his retirement in 1933. Godley was considered the ablest of the immediate post war governors although he made a misjudgement in interfering in the politics of the Royal Calpe Hunt. The King had to intercede after Godley removed the master of the hunt creating large divisions that were not repaired until his successor took charge.|$|E

5|$|Alston played {{high school}} {{football}} at Warren County High School as a quarterback. He later attended college at East Carolina University, where he played for the Pirates from 1999 to 2002. As a freshman, Alston {{was used by the}} Pirates coaching staff in tandem with sophomore teammate David Garrard as a quarterback. As Garrard's usage increased going into his junior and senior years, the Pirates coaching staff tried out Alston at several different positions. After starting the 2001 season as a running back, Alston was converted mid-season to a wide receiver, the <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he would play out the rest of his college and professional careers. In his final year with the Pirates, Alston led the team with 702 receiving yards on 36 catches, adding six touchdowns.|$|E

He made his debut a day later, coming on as a 56th-minute substitute for Patrick McLaughlin in a 0–0 draw away to Fleetwood Town. Challinor was soon converted into a right back at York, a <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he displayed composure {{and an ability to}} start attacking moves. His first goal for York came in a 4–2 win away to Hayes & Yeading United on 22 October 2011 with a drilled shot into the bottom right corner of the goal {{from the edge of the}} penalty area.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Though he professed {{membership}} in the Democratic Party, Brady was notably disengaged from politics. In 1843 he was made the interim district attorney for New York County. Two years later, Brady was appointed the city's corporation counsel, a <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he served two terms, each term lasting for a year. In 1850 Brady ran for, but was not elected to, the position of Attorney General of New York. Brady was on John C. Breckinridge and Joseph Lane's 1860 Democratic ticket for Governor of New York. When the American Civil War began, Brady switched sides and became an ardent supporter of Abraham Lincoln and his Republican Party. He deeply disdained Southern politics and policy.|$|E

5|$|When the War of the Austrian Succession started, Winterfeldt {{was sent}} {{on a mission}} to St. Petersburg, which, however, failed. He then {{commanded}} a grenadier battalion with great distinction at the Battle of Mollwitz, and won further glory in the celebrated minor combat of Rothschloss, where the Prussian hussars defeated the Austrians on 17 May 1741. One month later, Winterfeldt was made a colonel, as also was Zieten, the cavalry leader who had actually commanded at Rothschloss; the latter, as the older in years and service, resented the rapid promotion of his junior. After this promotion, Frederick chiefly employed Winterfeldt as a confidential staff officer to represent his views to the generals, a <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Winterfeldt needed extraordinary tact and knowledge of men and affairs, {{and as a matter of}} course made many enemies.|$|E
5|$|William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) {{served as}} the 27th President of the United States (1909–1913) and as the 10th Chief Justice of the United States (1921–1930), {{the only person to}} have held both offices. Taft was elected {{president}} in 1908, the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt, but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after Roosevelt split the Republican vote by running as a third-party candidate. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft to be chief justice, a <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he served until a month before his death.|$|E

There, Wodrow served {{in the position of}} major in the Hampshire County militia. In addition, he represented Hampshire County at the Virginia Ratifying Convention, held to ratify the United States Constitution in 1788. He was appointed by the Virginia General Assembly as a trustee of the towns of Romney and Watson Town (present-day Capon Springs). Wodrow amassed numerous properties which included landholdings along the Cacapon River and the Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House in Romney, and became a prosperous landholder in Hampshire County.|$|E

5|$|Sánchez rebounded to turn {{in another}} strong ride on Alpe d'Huez in stage 19. He, along with Contador and Pierre Rolland formed the leading group {{on the way up}} the climb. Contador, who had been riding out front much of the stage after an early attack, faded first and {{finished}} the day in third place. Rolland eventually rode away from Sánchez for the stage win, but Sánchez' second place on the day moved him up to seventh overall, and back into the mountains classification lead. Sánchez, as well as Contador, moved up a place in the stage 20 individual time trial. Damiano Cunego, who had been in fifth place and is considered a poor time trialist, had a bad race against the clock even by his standards, losing two minutes to most of the race's top overall riders and more than three to the stage winner. This moved him up to sixth place overall, the <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he concluded the race the next day, while also finishing as mountains classification winner.|$|E
5|$|The 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment was {{the second}} American {{airborne}} unit to land after the 507th, {{under the command of}} Colonel James Coutts. En route to the drop zone, the transport aircraft carrying the 513th had the misfortune to pass through a belt of German antiaircraft weapons, losing 22 of the C-46 transport aircraft and damaging a further 38. Just as the 507th had, the 513th also suffered from pilot error due to the ground haze, and as such the regiment actually missed its designated drop zone, DZX, and was dropped on one of the landing zones designated for the British 6th Airlanding Brigade. Despite this inaccuracy the paratroopers swiftly rallied and aided the British glider-borne troops who were landing simultaneously, eliminating several German artillery batteries that were covering the area. Once the German troops in the area had been eliminated, a combined force of American and British airborne troops stormed Hamminkeln and secured the town. By 2pm, Colonel Coutts reported to Divisional Headquarters that the 513th Parachute Infantry had secured all of its objectives, having knocked out two tanks and two complete regiments of artillery during their assault. During its attempts to secure its objectives, the regiment also gained a third Medal of Honor for the 17th Airborne Division when Private First Class Stuart Stryker posthumously received the award after leading a charge against a German machine-gun nest, creating a distraction to allow the rest of his platoon to capture the fortified <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the machine-gun was situated.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St John the Baptist, was built between the late 12th century and early 15th century {{replacing}} a 685 AD Saxon building. Major restoration work {{was carried out}} in the 1860s, including the construction of the Via Crucis, which is thought to be unique in an Anglican church. Outside the east end of the church is the tomb of Bishop Thomas Ken. The tower has eight bells, which bear inscriptions indicating that they were cast at various points between 1622 and 1792. A daughter church of St John's, Christ Church, was built in 1818 by George Allen Underwood, although considerable changes were made throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The third Anglican Church, Holy Trinity, was built in 1837–38 by Henry Goodridge in the style of Commissioners' Gothic. It is unusual in that the altar is at the west end due to the <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the church was built. The stained glass windows are near-contemporary copies of windows designed by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. Finally, St Mary's at Innox Hill was built in 1863, by C.E. Giles, as another Chapel of Ease to St John's. It is small with a decorated sanctuary ceiling.|$|E
