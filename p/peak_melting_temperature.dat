The methodwas used to successfully serotype a range of field isolates, although most of the these showed <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> shifts.

40|$|Melting {{behavior}} {{of a series of}} polyether-polyester block copolymers with low ether contents was studied. Significant melting-reorganization-remelting was suggested by means of differential scanning calorimetry. The equilibrium melting temperature of the copolymers was obtained by using the Hoffman-Weeks extrapolation. It has been found that the use of the on-set melting temperature for the Hoffman-Weeks plots is less reliable than the use of the corrected <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature.</b> Copolymerization of polyetheramides with polyesters leads to a significant melting temperature suppression for the polyester crystal. We hypothesize that the locations of the junction points between blocks can be treated as chain ends for the crystallizable polyester blocks: the polyether-polyesters grow to form extended chain-like crystals with lamellar thickness limited by the polyester block length. For comparison, the nonlinear Hoffman-Weeks treatment, recently proposed by Marand, has also been applied to examine the {{behavior of}} melting temperature depression. Although the T-m(o) obtained from nonlinear extrapolation is much higher than the T-m(o) obtained from the Hoffman-Weeks extrapolation, similar trend regarding the composition dependence of T-m(o) have been found...|$|E

Its thermal stability and crystalline properties were further explored, since such properties were important for SDS during heat processing. The {{results showed that}} the maximum percentage of remaining SDS was 78. 2 % for the starch physically modified by β-CD and subjected to dry heating for 15 min, and 73. 7 % for the starch subjected to moisture heating for 15 min. The starches physically modified by β-CD exhibited a higher <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature,</b> conclusion temperature, and enthalpy change of melting than the control sample. The crystalline data indicated that the higher yield of SDS in the starch physically modified by β-CD could be attributed to a greater difference of partial V-type crystallites. More perfect crystallites and imperfect crystallites were formed, and designated as the major components of the SDS product. These findings suggest that the starch physically modified by β-CD had higher thermal stability because of the formation of VII-type crystallites, and was suitable for potential application during heat processing...|$|E

The recrystallization mechanism was postulated, and a simple kinetics model was found to describe the behavior rather satisfactory under the conditions of prolonged thermal annealing.

40|$|Type B calcium-aluminum-rich {{inclusions}} (CAIs) can {{be thought}} of as a type of chondrule despite obvious differences in size, composition, and texture. Nevertheless, igneous CAIs likely experienced similar thermal histories. A major constraint on the thermal history of chondrules is that they have been recycled, mainly supported by the presence relict grains. Although well known that igneous CAIs experienced at least two melting events (counting Wark-Lovering rims), the identification of relict grains has been problematic. The best candidate for relict grains within type B CAIs is spinel. Spinel is the liquidus phase with complete melting at approximately l 50 °C above type B <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> (1400 °C). Consequently, relict spinels, either from a previous generation of CAIs or direct nebular condensate spinels, are stable at the inferred maximum heating temperature of type B CAIs.

In this paper, a comprehensive study is presented about the effectiveness of PCM wallboards for improving summer thermal comfort in existing lightweight buildings.

40|$|Dextrins are {{partially}} hydrolyzed starch products {{which are}} used {{in a wide range}} of applications. Hydrolysis can be performed by acid or enzymatic reaction. However the properties of dextrins are influenced by the type of reaction and the source of starch. The aim of the present study was to determine physicochemical properties of dextrins obtained from hydrolysis of starches (corn and wheat) and flours (wheat and cassava) by using sorghum malt amylases. Hydrolysis of starches and flours was performed at 65 °C, the hydrolysates were centrifuged and spray-dried for analysis. Physicochemical and structure of the powders were investigated. Results showed that the proportion of DP 2 (maltose and isomaltose) was higher in dextrins and more in dextrins from wheat flour. Low water activity and low dissolution time were found in all dextrins. XRD patterns revealed that the crystalline structure partially disappeared in some of them.

Under the nonisothermal mode of polymerization, a change in stirring level from diffusion-controlled regime to nondiffusion-controlled, external gas-liquid mass transfer resistance-free one, increased the reaction exotherm and the run time-average catalytic activity.

The rock is characterized by an assemblage of garnet, orthopyroxene, spinel, cordierite, biotite, plagioclase and quartz. Symplectites of orthopyroxene and spinel, and orthopyroxene and cordierite indicate decompression under UHT conditions. Mineral chemistry shows that the orthopyroxenes have high XMg and Al 2 O 3 contents (up to 9. 23 wt%). Biotites are enriched in TiO 2 and XMg and are stable under granulite facies conditions.

40|$|Simple sugars (e. g., sucrose, glucose, and fructose) are abundantly used {{as basic}} {{ingredients}} in the food industry and as excipients in the pharmaceutical industry, due to the quality attributes they contribute to the final products, such as sweet taste, flavor, texture, color, shelf-life (e. g., flavor retention via encapsulation), and carrier function of active pharmaceutical components.

Thus, it is important to accurately and completely characterize the sugars prior to use in specific applications. Melting has been commonly used for sugar characterization because it is an easy and quick property to measure, yet is usually repeatable and robust. In general, melting is determined by heating a sugar at a specified scanning rate using a thermal analytical technique, such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The sugar loses its crystalline structure (commonly termed melting) by adsorbing heat energy, which yields the critical parameters of the resultant melting peak, i. e., the onset melting temperature (Tm onset), the <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> (Tm peak), and the enthalpy of melting (∆H).

40|$|The radiolytic {{method was}} used to {{synthesize}} two types of nanocomposites with silver, PVA/Ag by film casting and PVA hydrogel/Ag nanocomposites. This method is particularly suitable for generating metal nanoparticles in solution. The radiolytic species (solvated electrons and secondary radicals) exhibit strong reducing properties such that metal ions are reduced at each encounter. Metal atoms then tend to grow into larger clusters. It was found that solid or swollen polymers are able to stabilize small crystallites against spontaneous growth via aggregation. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the melting behavior and kinetics of the PVA/Ag nanocomposites were investigated and compared to those of pure PVA. The melting as well as crystallization behavior of polymers is crucial because it governs the thermal properties, impact resistance and stress strain properties. Understanding the melting behavior is significant not only to tailor the properties of nanocomposites but to investigate the interactions between the constituents. The DSC curves of pure PVA and prepared nanocomposites show only one melting peak between 175 and 230 °C, indicating that the melting behavior of these two systems are analogous. In both cases, with increasing heating rate, the melting peak shifts to a higher temperature, but with increasing Ag content the <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> is lower. When specimens are heated at high heating rate, the motion of PVA molecular chains cannot follow the heating temperature on time due {{to the influence of}} heat hysteresis, which leads to a higher <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature.</b> When Ag nanoparticles are added they increase the heat transfer among the PVA molecular chains decreasing the melting temperature. The Ag content is a major factor affecting the degree of crystallinity. It was observed that at low nanofiller content, up to the 0. 5 wt%, the degree of crystallinity of the nanocomposites increased, while at a higher content the crystallization was retarded. The half time of melting is non-linearly dependent on the amount of nanofiller. In the range from 0. 25 to 1 wt% Ag it slightly increases, because at a low Ag content the nanoparticles act as a heterogeneous nucleation agent during the crystallization process. For large amounts of nanofiller, the half time of melting is markedly higher than for pure PVA. At a higher Ag content, the nanoparticles act as a barrier that restricts the thermal motion of PVA molecular chains and the half time of complete melting increases. The significantly lower melting activation energy of the nanocomposites with high amount of nanofiller compared to pure PVA, calculated by the Kissinger method, indicated that nanoparticles reduced the heat barrier for the melting process. ...|$|E

The solid fat content vs. tem-perature profile displayed two distinct regions: from 5 to 25 °C, and from 25 °C {{to the end of}} melt at 45 – 50 °C. A <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of 42. 7 °C was determined by DSC. Discontinuity in the crystallization induction time (determined by pulsed NMR) vs. temperature plot at 27 °C also suggested the existence of two separate groups of crystallizing material. Isothermal crystal-lization kinetics were characterized using the Avrami and Fisher–Turnbull models. In using DSC and powder X-ray diffrac-tion, the α polymorph formed upon fast cooling (> 5 °C/min), and the β ′ form predominated at lower cooling rates (< 1 °C/min). An α to β ′ transition took place upon storage. Fractal dimensions (Df) obtained by microscopy and image analysis showed no de-pendence on the degree of supercooling since Df remained con-stant (~ 1. 89) at crystallization temperatures of 5, 22, and 27 °C. Crystallization at 22 °C at 1 °C/min and 15 °C/min yielded Df val-ues of 1. 98 and 1. 93, respectively.

An anchor probe labeled with LightCycler Red 640 and mutation probe labeled with fluorescein were designed using the Del-E IBDV sequence. The sequence of the mutation probe included nucleotides in the hydrophilic B region of VP 2 {{that are important to}} a viral neutralizing epitope. This Del-E mutation probe was allowed to hybridize to the RT-PCR products following amplification and its temperature of dissociation (Tm) from each viral template was determined using the LightCycler <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> analysis.

In this paper, a green approach to the synthesis of Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles by chemical reduction at room temperature is reported. A safe organic solvent, ethanol, was used to prevent the formation of tin oxide during synthesis {{without the help of}} capping agents and N- 2 purging. Vigorous stirring instead of the use of capping agents was applied to the reaction mixture to reduce agglomeration of particles during the reaction time. Owing to not having capping agents on the nanoparticles and no detection of tin oxide, the subsequent steps for eliminating them are not necessary. Ag 3 Sn revealed by the XRD pattern and the electron diffraction pattern confirmed the successful alloying of Sn and Ag during synthesis.

The effect of modulation parameters, such as temperature amplitude and period was monitored with the heating rate that followed. Thickening of the lamellae {{as a result of the}} crystallization treatment enabled by the cool-heat method lead to an increase in the <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> and the final traces of melting. For instance, iPP melting peak shifted by up to 3. 5 degreesC with temperature amplitude of 1. 0 degreesC while the crystallinity was increased from 0. 45 (linearly cooled) to 0. 53. Multiple melting endotherms were also observed in some cases, but this was sensitive to the temperature changes experienced on cooling. Even with a slower underlying cooling rate and small temperature amplitudes, some recrystallization and reorganization occurred during the subsequent heating scan. The crystallinity was increased significantly and this was attributed to the crystal perfection that occurred at the crystal growth surface. In addition, temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC) has been used to study the melting of iPP for various crystallization treatments. The reversing and non-reversing contribution under the experimental time scale was modified by the relative crystal stability formed during crystallization.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Depending on the {{spinning}} and drawing conditions, two crystal structures for solution-spun poly(L-lactide) are obtained. The pseudoorthorhombic a structure (a = 10. 6, b = 6. 1, and c = 28. 8 A) contains two chains {{in the unit}} cell and is found at relatively low drawing temperatures and/or low hot-draw ratios. At higher drawing temperatures and/or higher hot-draw ratios a second so-called 0 structure appears. For this structure an orthorhombic unit cell is proposed (a = 10. 31, b = 18. 21, and c = 9. 00 A) containing six chains. The chain conformations of the a and p structure are left-handed 10 / 3 and 3 / 1 helices, respectively. Calculations show that both conformations have approximately the same energy. Therefore, the preference {{for one of the}} two structures is determined by packing considerations. In fibers containing a mixture of CY and 0 structure, the latter seems to bear most of the load during stress-strain experiments. Meridional small-angle X-ray scattering experiments yield a maximum for fibers containing only a structure pointing to a lamellar folded-chain morphology. The (3 structure on the other hand seems to correspond to a fibrillar morphology. Differential scanning calorimetry on unconstrained fibers shows that the 0 structure melts at a lower temperature than the a structure. The large shift of the <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> to higher temperatures in melting experiments on constrained fibers indicates that both lamellae and fibrils contribute to the strength of the fibers. This points to a considerable amount of interconnections/ entanglements between adjacent lamellae. 1...|$|E

Dual-labelled HyBeacon probes were developed to analyse single and clustered polymorphisms within these and neighbouring codons. Methods Extracted DNAs and unpurified blood samples were genotyped with respect to polymorphisms in PRNP codons 136, 141, 154 and 171. PCR amplicons were investigated using a LightTyper instrument, measuring the stability of probe/target hybridisation through <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> and determining the sequence of nucleotides at polymorphic sites. Results The performance of HyBeacon assays was evaluated in a validation study comparing genotypes with those obtained using a primer extension assay (Sequenom MassEXTEND) analysed on a MALDI-ToF mass spectrometer. Over 12, 000 sheep samples were successfully genotyped, reliably detecting A 136, V 136, T 136, T 137, L 141, F 141 R 154, H 154, L 168, R 171, Q 171, H 171 and K 171 sequence variants using only 4 HyBeacon probes.

The nm-CopolyPE inhomogeneity {{was reflected in}} the distributions of short chain branches, 1 -hexene composition, and methylene sequence length. The 1 -hexene incorporation into the polyethylene backbone strongly depended on the molecular weight of the growing polymer chain. (ONO) VCl(THF) 2, because of site diversity and easier removal of a tertiary (vs. a secondary) hydrogen, produced a skewed short chain branching (SCB) profile, incorporating 1 -hexene more efficiently in the low molecular weight region than in the high molecular weight region. The significant decrease in molecular weight by 1 -hexene showed that the (ONO) VCl(THF) 2 catalytic sites were also highly responsive to chain-transfer directly to 1 -hexene itself, producing vinyl and trans-vinylene termini. Subsequently, the effect of backbone inhomogeneity on the UV oxidative degradation of films made from both polyethylenes was investigated. The major functional group accumulated in the branched nm-CopolyPE film was carbonyl followed by carboxyl, then vinyl/ester, whereas that in the linear nm-HomoPE film was carboxyl. However, (carbonyl, carboxyl, vinyl, and ester) nm-CopolyPE film >> (carboxyl) nm-HomoPE film). The distributions of the tertiary C-H sites and methylene sequence length in the branched nm-CopolyPE film enhanced abstraction of H, decomposition of hydroperoxide group ROOH, and generation of carbonyl compounds as compared with those in the linear nm-HomoPE film. This clearly establishes the role played by the backbone inhomogeneity. The effect of short chain branches and sequence length distributions on <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> T pm, and most probably lamellar thickness L o, was modeled from a nanoscopic viewpoint.

Highly pure A- and B-type starch crystals were prepared from short linear α-glucans (short-chain amylose) generated from completely debranched waxy starches by manipulating the processing conditions such as starch solids concentration, crystallization temperature and chain length. High concentration, high temperature and short chain length favored the formation of the A-type structure, whereas reverse conditions resulted in the B-type polymorph. Digestion results using a mixture of α-amylase and glucoamylase showed that A-type crystals were more resistant to enzyme digestion than B-type crystals. The A-type crystalline product obtained upon debranching 25 % waxy maize starch at 50 ºC for 24 h gave 16. 6 % digestion after 3 h, whereas B-type crystals produced by debranching 5 % waxy maize starch at 50 ºC for 24 h followed by holding at 25 ºC for another 24 h had 38. 9 % digested after 3 h. The A-type crystals had a higher melting temperature than the B-type crystals as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Annealing increased the <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the B-type crystals, making it similar to that of the A-type crystals, but did not improve the enzyme resistance. The possible reason for these results was due to more condense packing pattern of double helices in A-type crystallites. It seems that the crystalline types are not the key factor that controls the digestibility of native starch granules. The resistance of native starches with B-type X-ray diffraction pattern is probably attributed to the other structural features in starch granules...|$|E
40|$|Cocoa {{butter is}} a highly complex system of triacyglycerides which {{has been shown to}} {{crystallize}} in a markedly different fashion under the application of shear. A rheometer insert was developed to enable the intact extraction of sheared samples for study of melting properties, crystal orientation and breaking stress. Samples were created by ramping from 50 °C at three different cooling rates (0. 5, 1 and 2 °C/min) to three different end point temperatures (16, 18 and 20 °C), creating nine different temperature sets. Viscosities of the cocoa butter samples under shear were recorded during sample creation and large jumps in viscosity were identified as form II and form V crystallization. Comparison of crystallization times for the nine different temperature profiles allowed for the conclusion that over a shear range of 90 – 1000 s^- 1 there was no further appreciable shear acceleration of the form V transformation for the 16 and 18 °C temperatures and only a slight increase up to 500 s^- 1 for the 20 °C temperature. Sheared samples were also examined with differential scanning calorimetry. Samples were examined for <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> on each of day 0, day 1, day 7 and day 28. Six of the nine different temperature conditions examined yielded a critical shear rate, above which the melting points of the samples were dramatically different than for low shear and no shear samples. For the day 0 and day 1 samples, above 500 s^- 1 the melting temperatures were ~ 2 °C higher than for 360 s- 1 and below. For the day 7 and day 28 samples, above 500 s^- 1 the peak melting temperatures were ~ 2 °C lower than for the lower shear and no shear samples. The orientation of sheared samples was also examined using x-ray diffraction. In all of the nine temperature sets, orientation was present for shear rates of 360 s^- 1 and higher. Breaking stress measurements were performed on sheared and non-sheared samples. These tests showed results remarkably similar to those seen in the DSC tests, with a critical shear rate existing in six of the nine temperature sets, above which an increase in the breaking strength occurs. Examination of samples {{on either side of the}} critical shear rate with x-ray diffraction yielded two distinct x-ray patterns leading to speculation that the application of high shear rates causes a change in the crystallization of cocoa butter leading to selective crystallization and the formation of a compositionally different form V crystal with fewer defects than its lower/no shear counterparts...|$|E
40|$|Water-blown {{polyurethane}} (PU) foams are {{of enormous}} technological interest {{as they are}} widely applied in various fields, i. e., consumer goods, medicine, automotive or aerospace industries. The discovery of the one-way shape-memory effect in PU foams provided a fresh impetus for extensive investigations on porous polymeric actuators over the past decades. High expansion ratios during the shape-recovery are of special interest when big volume changes are required, for example to fill an aneurysm during micro-invasive surgery or save space during transportation. However, the need to program the foams before each operation cycle could be a drawback impeding the entry of shape-memory polymeric (SMP) foams to our daily life. Here, we showed that a reversible shape-memory effect (rSME) is achievable for polyurethane water-blown semicrystalline foams. We selected commercially available crystallizable poly(ε-caprolactone) -diols of different molecular weight for foams synthesis, followed by investigations of morphology, thermal, thermomechanical and shape-memory properties of obtained compositions. Densities of synthesized foams varied from 110 to 180 kg∙m− 3, while <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> were composition-dependent and changed from 36 to 47 °C, while the <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> interval was around 15 K. All semicrystalline foams exhibited excellent one-way SME with shape-fixity ratios slightly above 100 % and shape-recovery ratios from the second cycle of 99 %. The composition with broad distribution of molecular weights of poly(ε-caprolactone) -diols exhibited an rSME of about 12 % upon cyclic heating and cooling from Tlow = 10 °C and Thigh = 47 °C. We anticipate that our experimental study opens a field of systematic investigation of rSMEs in porous polymeric materials on macro and micro scale and extend the application of water-blown polyurethane foams to, e. g., protective covers with zero thermal expansion or even cushions adjustable to a certain body shape...|$|R

Peak temperature and shape provide more detailed information about the properties of the colloids.

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{ultrasonic}} velocimetry technique {{was compared to}} direct pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (pNMR) spectroscopy for {{the determination of the}} solid fat content (SFC) of anhydrous milk fat (AMF), cocoa butter (CB) and 70 % (w/w) blends of AMF and CB with canola oil. In situ measurements of ultrasonic velocity were carried out during cooling (50 – 5 °C) and heating (5 – 50 °C) of the fat at 1 °C/min. SFCs were also determined in situ by pNMR, while polarized light microscopy (PLM) was used to image the crystallization process at the same time-temperature combinations as for the pNMR and ultrasonic velocimetry experiments. <b>Peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> determined by differential scanning calorimetry were used as an indicator of the polymorphic state of the different fats and fat blends. Our results suggest that ultrasonic velocity was highly dependent on the microstructure and polymorphism of the solid fat, and was higher for fats in more stable polymorphic forms. A high signal attenuation was observed in milkfat and cocoa butter at lower temperatures, particularly after 24 h of storage. SFC results obtained by pNMR did not have these problems and agreed quite closely with PLM results. Ultrasonic velocity was linearly correlated to SFC in AMF up to 40 % solids during both crystallization and melting. The Miles equation could be used to model this relationship, however large deviations were observed above 20 % solids. Ultrasonic velocity – SFC patterns for CB, on the other hand, were different for each CB dilution, thus making ultrasonic velocimetry not suitable for SFC determination in the CB systems. Ultrasonic velocity was lineary correlated with the box counting dimension (Db) in AMF during both crystallization and melting, while for CB, ultrasonic velocity was negatively correlated to Db upon melting only...|$|R
40|$|Thin polymer {{films and}} their {{properties}} have been investigated. The characteristics of crystalline polymers according to film thickness have been improved using polycaprolactone (PCL). The melting enthalpy of PCL has increased {{when the film}} thickness decreased and the <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> showed no significant changes with film thickness. Film thickness variation influenced surface roughness and crystal size. Optical microscope images showed the rougher surface of thicker films. The spinning time has shown no influence on film thickness and no significant changes to surface roughness. Thin films of block copolymers {{were used in the}} surface modification study; films studied included poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene) (SBS) and poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene) (SIS) and their surface modifications have been controlled using different methods of treatment. Films of SIS heated at different temperatures have shown different surface texture and roughness. Films treated at low temperature (45 °C) had smooth surfaces when compared with films heated at high temperature (120 °C and 160 °C). Phase separation of SIS heated at (120 °C and 160 °C) caused bulges of different sizes to cover the surface. The height and width of the bulges showed variation with film thickness and heating. Substrate interaction with SBS and SIS block copolymer films showed different surface texture when using the same type of substrate and different texture were obtained when SBS solutions were spun onto different substrates. It has been demonstrated that using different solvents in copolymer preparation caused different texture. Thermal and surface property variations with film thickness have been improved using amorphous polymers. Surface roughness of poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA and disperse red 1 -poly(methyl methacrylate) DR 1 -PMMA, PMMA has improved using thickness variation. Glass transition temperature measurement has increased when film thickness was increased. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and surface roughness of UV 15 UV - curable coating polymer has been modified using UV curing and heating methods. Tg variation was observed when curing time and curing intensity were changed causing the optical properties of the polymer to be more variable. A plasma etcher caused wrinkles to occur on the surface of unheated UV 15. Tg of UV 15 increased when curing time increased. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of cured UV 15 film have shown peak variations of the ester and carbon double bond regions over the range of 1850 - 1700 cm- 1. Urethane-Urea (UU) Polymer thin films were used to investigate optical properties and develop an optical waveguide. Absorption and transmission properties of light using non-linear optical (NLO) polymer was investigated and used in optical waveguide fabrication. Refractive indices were measured to examine UU films at two different wavelengths. A UU film of 1 µm thickness caused a maximum absorption at max = 471 nm also obtained at 810 nm wavelength. Many methods of fabrication were used; photolithography, plasma etching in a barrel reactor and thin film deposition using sputtering and evaporation. Etched depths from 1 μm to 100 μm were obtained. An optical waveguide has been prepared using plasma etching of a cured UV 15 as a cladding layer on a silicon substrate...|$|E
40|$|Simple sugars (e. g., sucrose, glucose, and fructose) are abundantly used {{as basic}} {{ingredients}} in the food industry and as excipients in the pharmaceutical industry, due to the quality attributes they contribute to the final products, such as sweet taste, flavor, texture, color, shelf-life (e. g., flavor retention via encapsulation), and carrier function of active pharmaceutical components. These quality attributes directly depend on the processing protocol employed, in particular heating conditions, {{as well as the}} type(s) of sugar used. Thus, it is important to accurately and completely characterize the sugars prior to use in specific applications. Melting has been commonly used for sugar characterization because it is an easy and quick property to measure, yet is usually repeatable and robust. In general, melting is determined by heating a sugar at a specified scanning rate using a thermal analytical technique, such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The sugar loses its crystalline structure (commonly termed melting) by adsorbing heat energy, which yields the critical parameters of the resultant melting peak, i. e., the onset melting temperature (Tm onset), the <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> (Tm peak), and the enthalpy of melting (???H). These parameters provide a good deal of information for sugar identification and characterization (e. g., purity, type, size, etc.) purposes. However, the reported melting temperatures for sugars vary widely. This variation has been attributed to a number of causes, such as differences in melting temperature determination methods, origin, impurity, polymorphs, superheating, liquefaction, and thermal decomposition and/or mutarotation in addition to melting. However, a complete explanation of the substantial variation observed in the sugar melting temperatures as a function of heating rates is not currently found in the literature. Of importance to note is that from a thermodynamic viewpoint, the heating rate dependency of the sugar melting temperatures suggests that the sugars do not experience thermodynamic melting. Because thermodynamic melting occurs at a single, time independent temperature with a constant enthalpy value (??H), where the crystalline solid and corresponding liquid phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium (???G= 0) at a constant pressure, the melting parameters for the sugars cannot be used for identification purpose. Therefore, the ultimate objective of this research was to elucidate the fundamental mechanism underlying the loss of crystalline structure (melting) in these sugars. With thermal and chemical analytical approaches, this research found that the kinetic process of thermal decomposition was responsible for the loss of crystalline structure in these sugars, leading to heating rate dependency in their melting parameters. This result distinguishes thermodynamic melting from the loss of crystalline structure caused by thermal decomposition (termed ???apparent melting??? in this research), which solves the controversy that currently exists in the literature regarding the wide variation in the melting parameters of these sugars. These results prove not only that the loss of crystalline structure in the sugars is caused by thermal decomposition, but also that apparent melting in the sugars is achieved via a time-temperature combination process. This research also attempted to determine the thermodynamic melting temperature of these sugars by suppressing thermal decomposition using fast scanning rates. In the case of fructose, its thermodynamic melting was achieved. In addition, this research explored the effect of different heating conditions on the glass transition parameters for amorphous sucrose prepared by melt-quenching (i. e., melting followed by quick cooling) because melting-quenching is one of the common methods for preparing amorphous materials. The heating conditions employed directly effected the glass transition parameters obtained, where, in general, {{it was found that the}} longer time, lower temperature heating conditions resulted in lower glass transition temperature values. Therefore, in practical applications, this research is useful for better understanding the quality and stability issues associated with heat processed sugar-containing food and pharmaceutical products and for developing new sugar based products...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{electrical}} aging on the trap parameter of HVAC XLPE cable insulation {{was investigated in}} this work. Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC) {{was used to measure}} depolarization current. The variation of trap parameter was calculated by means of start-up method based on the Gaussian fitting curve of TSC data. It was found that, the activation energy and the amount of trap charge obtained from TSC peak at 243 K and 348 K were increased after electrical aging, which may be benefit to characterize the degree of aging. The amount of trap charge in the two peaks increases as the increase of oxide dipole after electrical aging. And charge trapped described by the TSC <b>peak</b> at <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> increased after aging. It is considered that the increase of charge in the TSC peak {{can be attributed to the}} release of trap charge in the melt crystallization process, which corresponds to the α relaxation process in XLPE insulation...|$|R
40|$|In the United States, the {{production}} of the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is an important mechanism of carbap-enem resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. Infections with KPC-producing organisms are associated with increased morbid-ity andmortality; therefore, the rapid detection of KPC-producing pathogens is critical in patient care and infection control. We developed a real-time PCR assay complemented with traditional high-resolutionmelting (HRM) analysis, as well as statistically based genotyping, using the Rotor-Gene ScreenClust HRM software to both detect the presence of blaKPC and differentiate be-tween KPC- 2 -like and KPC- 3 -like alleles. A total of 166 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumanniiwith various -lactamase susceptibility patterns were tested in the validation of this assay; 66 of these organisms were known to produce the KPC -lactamase. The real-time PCR assay was able to detect the presence of blaKPC in all 66 of these clinical isolates (100 % sensitivity and specificity). HRM analysis demonstrated that 26 had KPC- 2 -like <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures,</b> while 40 had KPC- 3 -like <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Sequencing of 21 amplified products confirmed the <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> results, with 9 isolates carrying blaKPC- 2 and 12 isolates carrying blaKPC- 3. This PCR/HRM assay can identify KPC-produc-ing Gram-negative pathogens in as little as 3 h after isolation of pure colonies and does not require post-PCR sample manipula-tion for HRM analysis, and ScreenClust analysis easily distinguishes blaKPC- 2 -like and blaKPC- 3 -like alleles. Therefore, this assay is a rapid method to identify the presence of blaKPC enzymes in Gram-negative pathogens that can be easily integrated into busy clin-ical microbiology laboratories...|$|R
