500|$|At Casterman's prompting, Tintin in the Congo was {{subsequently}} fully re-drawn, {{and the new}} version was published in 1946. As {{a part of this}} modification, Hergé cut the <b>page</b> <b>length</b> from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and colonial rule. For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about geography, he states in the 1930–31 version, [...] "My dear friends, today I'm going {{to talk to you about}} your country: Belgium!" [...] whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a mathematics lesson. Hergé also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white [...] "supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first book}} {{published}} by Ace {{was a pair}} of mysteries bound tête-bêche: Keith Vining's Too Hot for Hell, backed with Samuel W. Taylor's The Grinning Gismo, priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01. A tête-bêche book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the [...] "Ace Double" [...] format was that the two books had to fit a fixed <b>page</b> <b>length</b> (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag [...] "Complete and Unabridged" [...] on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.|$|E
2500|$|Most news {{articles}} and book reviews call Wildwood [...] a children's novel, or middle grade book, but some class it as young adult fiction (YA or YAL). [...] HarperCollins recommended {{the book for}} ages 9 and up. The book's 541 <b>page</b> <b>length</b> was comparable {{to many of the}} books Meloy enjoyed at Wildwoods target age, and Ellis noted that [...] "a 10 year old kid can be a voracious reader." [...] The book is also marketed to adults, including Decemberists fans and adult fans of children's and young adult literature.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{of these}} novelisations {{contained}} minimal amounts of original material and were (usually) adapted closely from the shooting scripts, {{with the intent}} of the books being souvenirs of previously aired shows in the pre-VCR era; the decision by the BBC to delete many episodes from the Hartnell, Troughton, and Pertwee eras resulted in many of these books becoming the only way for these [...] "lost" [...] adventures to be experienced prior to the release of soundtracks for those episodes and/or recovery of lost episodes (the Pertwee era, in particular, has been rendered intact since the early 1990s, and several Hartnell and Troughton stories are once again complete). Although novelisations became more elaborate in later years, the early books usually followed a set formula and were for a time restricted to a maximum <b>page</b> <b>length</b> as they were considered children's literature.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952 Wollheim left Avon to {{work for}} A. A. Wyn at the Ace Magazine Company and spearheaded a new {{paperback}} book list, Ace Books. In 1953 he introduced science fiction to the Ace lineup, and for 20 years as editor-in-chief was responsible for their multi-genre list and, most important to him, their renowned sf list. Wollheim invented the Ace Doubles series which consisted of pairs of books, usually by different authors, bound back-to-back with two [...] "front" [...] covers. Because these paired books had to fit a fixed total <b>page</b> <b>length,</b> one or both were usually abridged to fit, and Wollheim often made other editorial alterations — as witness the differences between Poul Anderson's Ace novel War of the Wing-Men and its definitive revised edition, The Man Who Counts. Among the authors who made their paperback debuts in Ace Doubles were Philip K. Dick, Samuel R. Delany, Leigh Brackett, Ursula K. Le Guin, and John Brunner. William S. Burroughs' first book, Junkie, was published as an Ace Double. Wollheim also helped develop Marion Zimmer Bradley, Robert Silverberg, Avram Davidson, Fritz Leiber, Andre Norton, Thomas Burnett Swann, Jack Vance, and Roger Zelazny, among others. While at Ace, he and co-editor Terry Carr began an annual anthology series, The World's Best Science Fiction, the first collection of what they considered {{the best of the}} prior year's short stories, from magazines, hardcovers, paperback collections and other anthologies.|$|E

5000|$|In France, the {{academic}} dissertation or thesis {{is called a}} thèse and it is reserved for the final work of doctoral candidates.

50|$|In book publishing, {{casting off}} {{is the process}} of {{estimating}} the number of signatures required to typeset a manuscript.

5000|$|Will Salmon of SFX {{gave the}} book {{four out of}} five stars, {{labelling}} it as [...] "tells a spooky monster story that’s big on atmosphere, if lacking in originality". Den of Geek's Mark Harrison gave it three out of five stars, questioning whether the extra <b>page</b> <b>length</b> was necessary for the story, though he thought it was [...] "very well-written".

5000|$|Important {{publishers}} of gothic bluebooks, who {{often referred to}} the works as [...] "pamphlets," [...] included Thomas Tegg, Dean and Munday, Robert Harrild, and John Aliss, who each had distribution networks throughout Britain. If a bluebook story wasn't long enough to fill the allotted <b>page</b> <b>length,</b> publishers had versions of shorter stories on hand that they would attach to the end. One story that was commonly attached was [...] "Mary, A Fragment, [...] " [...] which was just one page long. Gothic bluebooks remained a popular trade through {{the first decade of}} the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Decompressed {{stories have}} been the cause of {{considerable}} controversy and debate amongst the comics fandom. Many detractors accuse their writers of unnecessarily stretching out the <b>page</b> <b>length</b> of plots, thinning out the content per page in order to earn more sales and money for {{a limited amount of}} work. Defenders of the style claim that decompressed stories are not stretched out, but rich in character development and mood rather than plot progression. Some see the phenomenon as driven by the increasing popularity of trade paperbacks, which typically collect an average of six comic book issues in a volume and thus provide a target length for stories to fit.|$|E
5000|$|An essay mill (also {{term paper}} mill) is a {{business}} that allows customers to commission an original piece of writing on a particular topic {{so that they may}} commit academic fraud. Customers provide the company with specific information about the essay, including: a <b>page</b> <b>length,</b> a general topic, and a time frame with which to work. The customer is then charged a certain amount per page. The similar essay bank concept is a company from which students can purchase pre-written but less expensive essays on various topics, at higher risk of being caught. Both forms of business are under varying legal restraints in some jurisdictions.|$|E

Others faulted Yergin for his impartiality and not taking a strong position on subjects such as climate change, although The Wall Street Journal said that the book succumbed to [...] "the conventional alarmist storyline” on climate. Finally, peak oil advocates take strong issue with Yergin’s handling of the subject in the book, particularly the discussion of the founding of the peak theory and the potential for future oil discoveries.|$|E

50|$|After {{the release}} of Lough's 2010 Stephen King {{adaption}} The Boogeyman, he set about developing his own material for his next project. Over an unusually long development period, the project originated as a feature-length screenplay that gradually was abandoned and rethought as a short story. The project remained dormant as Lough concentrated on a feature-length version of his 2008 short film Deviant. When that project failed {{to get off the}} ground, Ninety Seconds was then developed into an ambitious short film. A 12-minute version of the script was submitted to the Irish Film Board for financing but was eventually rejected. Lough proceeded to independently finance the film and produce it himself.
