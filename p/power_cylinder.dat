50|$|Scuderi engines have paired cylinders, each {{of which}} {{performs}} two of the tasks (strokes) of a conventional engine. The compression cylinder performs intake and compression. The <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> performs combustion and exhaust. Compressed air is transferred from the compression cylinder to the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> through a crossover passage. Fuel is then injected and fired to produce the power stroke.|$|E
50|$|Firing ATDC can be {{accomplished}} by using high-pressure air in the transfer passage to create sonic flow and high turbulence in the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E

50|$|In a later version, Cayley {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problem of continual cycling. In this version, the combustion chamber was removed to a separate cylinder placed to the side of the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Gunpowder was stored in the upper portion of this chamber, and small amounts were metered out to fall into the combustion area below. The hot gasses were then piped out of the combustion area into the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This consisted of two pistons on a common piston rod, with the gasses flowing into alternate sides of the cylinder to form a double-acting engine.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{engine is}} single acting using the {{two-stroke}} cycle, with separate pumps for gas and air, and a <b>power</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This cylinder is connected {{directly to a}} receiver vessel in which the combustion is initiated, the expansion flows into the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> driving the piston. Timing of inlet and exhaust is via a piston valve, and an exhausting pump may be added to remove exhaust gases from the receiver prior to the new charge being forced in by the pumps. This is described as optional for smaller engines, as the exhaust gases {{are not so much}} a problem for them.|$|E
5000|$|The early Brayton {{gas engine}} had the engine speed governed by varying {{the point of}} cut-off for the {{admission}} of the combusted gases into the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and the admissions of gas and air to the pump was similarly regulated to maintain the reservoir pressure. The liquid fueled engine reported by Clerk only regulated the cut-off to the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and used a pressure relief valve to limit the reservoir air pressure. The reservoir on the Brayton engine allowed it to be readily started if it remained pressurized, though Clerk states that [...] "leakage and loss were so frequent that the apparatus was of little use." ...|$|E

50|$|Post-war, the {{lifeboat}} engine was doubled {{up into a}} flat-six (four <b>power</b> <b>cylinders,</b> two pumping) twelve-piston engine for a 10 kVA generator. This engine was unsuccessful owing to problems with the complex crankcase casting warping after machining, preventing a reliable seal.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic systems used in {{industry}} are commonly powered by compressed air or compressed inert gases. A centrally located and electrically <b>powered</b> compressor <b>powers</b> <b>cylinders,</b> air motors, and other pneumatic devices. A pneumatic system controlled through manual or automatic solenoid valves is selected when it provides a lower cost, more flexible, or safer alternative to electric motors and actuators.|$|R
50|$|At each {{stroke the}} warm {{condensate}} was drawn {{off from the}} condenser and sent to a hot well by a vacuum pump, which also helped to evacuate the steam from under the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The still-warm condensate was recycled as feedwater for the boiler.|$|E
50|$|The <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> fires {{just after}} the piston has begun its {{downward}} motion ("after top dead center", or ATDC). The Scuderi Group says ATDC eliminates a thermal efficiency shortcoming seen in previous split-cycle engine designs. Firing ATDC in a split-cycle arrangement is claimed to eliminate the losses resulting from recompressing the gas.|$|E
50|$|Watt {{solved the}} problem of the water spray by {{removing}} the cold water to a different cylinder, placed beside the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Once the induction stroke was complete a valve was opened between the two, and any steam that entered the cylinder would condense inside this cold cylinder. This would create a vacuum that would pull more of the steam into the cylinder, and so on until the steam was mostly condensed. The valve was then closed, and operation of the main cylinder continued as it would on a conventional Newcomen engine. As the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> remained at operational temperature throughout, the system was ready for another stroke as soon as the piston was pulled back to the top. Maintaining the temperature was a jacket around the cylinder where steam was admitted. Watt produced a working model in 1765.|$|E

50|$|A {{problem with}} compressed-air {{propulsion}} {{is that the}} air cools as it expands, {{which can lead to}} the formation of ice in the <b>power</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Mekarski sought to overcome this problem by heating the air with steam, produced in a small boiler called a bouillotte. It is uncertain whether the steam was mixed with the air, or whether there was a heat exchanger.|$|R
50|$|A given {{power stroke}} can last {{no more than}} 180 degrees of {{crankshaft}} rotation, so the power strokes of a four-cylinder engine are sequential, with no overlap. At {{the end of one}} <b>cylinder's</b> <b>power</b> stroke another <b>cylinder</b> fires.|$|R
50|$|The Scuderi engine, {{as shown}} in the {{animated}} illustration, has highly desaxe cylinders. The compressor (blue) is offset a greater amount than the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> (yellow). Its benefit is to give a better line of thrust from piston to crank though con-rod during downward power stroke but it has disadvantages in vibration and bore wall thrust.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{had three}} {{horizontal}} cylinders, the outer {{two of which}} were power cylinders and the centre cylinder used as a scavenging pump. Each <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> contained two slightly oversquare opposed pistons with uniflow piston-porting. Unusually for a small two-stroke, there was no reliance on the Kadenacy effect. The transfer ports though were angle-drilled to encourage swirl.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the engines}} {{described}} in the patent uses compression of the fuel/air mixture in the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the system which Clerk describes as [...] "now so largely used in gas engines. The Frencheman, Lebon, it is true, described an engine using compression, in the year 1801, but his cycle is {{not in any way}} similar to that proposed by Barnett, or used in modern gas engines".|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>power</b> choice and the astigmatic refractive outcome for toric intraocular lenses (IOLs), the <b>cylinder</b> <b>power</b> of which was calculated using the Goggin nomogram that allows for the likely effect of posterior corneal astigmatism.

Methods: The absolute value of the prediction error of the toric IOL <b>cylinder</b> <b>power</b> effect in consecutive eyes with preoperative anterior keratometric cylinder values of 1. 0 diopter (D) or more was compared with the absolute value of the prediction error in a historical control group. The anteriorly measured keratometric cylinder values were altered by 2 coefficients of adjustment, one for with-the-rule eyes and one for against-the-rule eyes, before calculation of the IOL <b>cylinder</b> <b>power</b> to be implanted. In the controls, unadjusted keratometric cylinder values were used. Results: The case-series group comprised 31 eyes (29 patients) and the control group, 65 eyes.

5000|$|The third {{engine is}} also double acting using the {{two-stroke}} cycle, {{and although it}} has the gas and air pumps of the others, it has an exhaust port uncovered by the piston {{towards the end of}} the power stroke, allowing the exhaust gases to exit and the fresh charge to enter the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> and then be compressed by the piston prior to ignition at the end of the compression stroke.|$|E
50|$|In a {{conventional}} Otto cycle engine, each cylinder performs four strokes per cycle: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This means that two revolutions of the crankshaft {{are required for}} each power stroke. The split-cycle engine divides these four strokes between two paired cylinders: one for intake and compression, and another for power and exhaust. Compressed air is transferred from the compression cylinder to the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> through a crossover passage. Fuel is then injected and fired to produce the power stroke.|$|E
50|$|The large {{vertical}} blowing engine illustrated {{was built}} in the 1890s by E. P. Allis Co. of Milwaukee (later to form part of Allis-Chalmers). The air pumping cylinder is above the steam <b>power</b> <b>cylinder</b> and crosshead. The main force of the piston is transmitted to the air cylinder by a purely reciprocating action and the flywheels are there merely to smooth the action of the engine. The flywheel shaft is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards.|$|E
5000|$|The USRA 2-6-6-2 {{locomotive}} was a Mallet, or compound articulated type, having both low-pressure and high-pressure cylinders. The smaller high-pressure <b>cylinders</b> <b>powered</b> {{the rear}} set of driving wheels, {{and the larger}} low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> <b>powered</b> the forward set of driving wheels. The USRA 2-6-6-2 articulated locomotives were direct developments of the Chesapeake & Ohio class H2 and H4 series.|$|R
50|$|The AJR {{was one of}} the few {{motorcycles}} {{built in}} Scotland. AJ Robertson of Edinburgh built 346cc and 490cc Villiers <b>powered</b> single <b>cylinder</b> engine machines between 1925 and 1926. Robertson rode them in many sporting events.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1905, a {{replacement}} locomotive was considered and W G Bagnall were {{asked for a}} design. This {{was similar to the}} Lewins design, but more conventional. A saddle tank was used and conventional cylinders with connecting rods to the axle. The <b>power</b> <b>cylinders</b> were however mounted inside the frames and the Bagnall-Price valvgear and slide valves mounted outside. [...] This new locomotive was never constructed, although Bagnalls did instead build two new boilers for the existing locomotives. Both survived the closure of the mine, but were scrapped in 1935, some years afterwards. also there is a Diesel locomotive called wasp which worked in a mine in cornwall ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were introduced}} in 1913, {{the first of the}} class No. 2222 was named in honour of Sir Gilbert Claughton, who was the Chairman of the LNWR at that time. A total of 130 were built, all at Crewe works up to 1921. Author Brian Reed points out that weight restrictions and equipment limitations at Crewe limited the size of the boiler, hence engine <b>power.</b> <b>Cylinder</b> design and valve events were not optimal, so the Claughton Class was a mediocre performer on the track.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scavenging}} pistons {{were even}} more unusual, being double-acting. Two highly oversquare double-acting pistons in a single cylinder gave two pump volumes: one between the pistons that supplied #1 <b>power</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the other formed by the two spaces outside the pistons being coupled to both supply #2 cylinder. These double-acting pistons were of crosshead form, with a ½'" [...] diameter piston rod emerging through a seal and to a crosshead formed {{on the end of}} the piston rod, where it carried the connecting rod.|$|E
5000|$|In 1878 Clerk {{obtained}} a Brayton [...] "Ready Motor" [...] engine made from 1872-1876 by George Brayton in Philadelphia PA USA [...] Clerk {{wondered if he}} could improve {{the performance of the}} engine. He soon outfitted the engine with a spark plug and an improved fuel system. Initially Clerk used one cylinder for compression and the other for expansion. At one point an explosion occurred which broke the engine in two pieces. The engine was repaired and displayed in 1879. Later Clerk decided to abandon use of the pumping cylinder for compression and use it only to transfer the air / fuel mixture into the <b>power</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{a typical}} toric lens, the flattest and steepest curvatures are {{separated}} by 90°. As a result, the axis of the cylinder is also the meridian containing the sphere <b>power.</b> The <b>cylinder</b> <b>power,</b> as defined above is the power that is most different from the sphere power.

When using plus cylinder notation, the opposite is true.|$|R
