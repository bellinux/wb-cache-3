500|$|Microsoft Services Agreement reads {{that the}} company's online {{services}} may automatically [...] "download software updates or configuration changes, {{including those that}} <b>prevent</b> <b>you</b> from accessing the Services, playing counterfeit games, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices." [...] Critics interpreted this statement as implying that Microsoft would scan for and delete unlicensed software installed on devices running Windows10. However, others pointed out that this agreement was specifically for Microsoft online services such as Microsoft account, Office 365, Skype, as well as Xbox Live, and that the offending passage most likely referred to digital rights management on Xbox consoles and first-party games, and not plans to police pirated video games installed on Windows10 PCs. Despite this, some torrent trackers announced plans to block Windows10 users, also arguing that the operating system could send information to anti-piracy groups that are affiliated with Microsoft. Writing about these allegations, Ed Bott of ZDNet compared Microsoft's privacy policy to Apple's and Google's and concluded that [...] "after carefully reading the Microsoft Services Agreement, the Windows license agreement...and the Microsoft Privacy Statement carefully, I don't see anything that looks remotely like Big Brother." [...] Columnist Kim Komando argued that [...] "Microsoft might in the future run scans and disable software or hardware it sees as a security threat," [...] consistent with the Windows10 update policy.|$|E

"If {{he fears}} that he {{shall not be}} able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if he fear that he shall {{not be able to}} deal justly (with them), then only one, or that which your right hands possess.

[...] If a man cannot deal justly with more than one wife, then he must marry only one.

His {{house had been}} taken over by the U.S. {{government}} during the war and turned into a fort, but he was able to move into what had been an overseer's house. Due to his age Cooper earned a meager living. On August 4, 1870, Robert E. Lee, on the behalf of other former Confederates, sent Cooper $300. Lee wrote to him saying, [...] "To this sum I have only been able to add $100, but I hope it may enable you to supply some immediate want and <b>prevent</b> <b>you</b> from taxing your strength too much." [...] Samuel Cooper died at his home in 1876, and is buried in Alexandria's Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery.|$|E

2500|$|However a vice {{president}} of the Office of Special Affairs branch of Scientology stated that Scientologists [...] "make a personal choice" [...] on whether or not to use the filtering software. A different spokesperson claimed that members of Scientology asked for the software, stating: [...] "many of our parishioners want to use the Internet but asked for a filter protection from those elements that have sought to twist and pervert the religion." [...] The packaging on the CD mailed to users who specifically request the filter states: [...] "By popular demand from Scientologists, a program has been developed to <b>prevent</b> <b>you</b> from being subjected to 'entheta' and hate mail on the Internet. This filter allows you direct access to our sites rapidly, without being dev-t'd by vilifying material, forgeries, and hate messages.
