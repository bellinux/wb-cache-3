It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E

After having passed the state house unanimously, the measure died in a Senate committee.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} months, the population radicalized itself, and, on September 18, 1848, {{just one week}} before the Revolution was crushed, crowds entered the Interior Ministry, taking over the official copies of Regulamentul Organic and the register of boyar ranks (Arhondologia). The documents were subsequently paraded through the city in a mock funeral cortege, and burned down, one sheet at a time, {{in the public square}} on Mitropoliei Hill. Neofit reluctantly agreed to preside over the ceremony and to issue a curse on both <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
5|$|A typical year in {{the life}} of a Senate {{legislation}} committee will see it conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates). In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> being considered by the parliament. A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate. Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations). A consolidated list of the reports prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the Department of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> {{passed by the}} new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which {{subjected}} members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E

5|$|A liberal {{member of}} Congress, Tierney voted {{along with other}} Democratic Representatives from Massachusetts. He sat on the House Committee on Education and Labor, where his {{priorities}} included green energy and increased college access. He co-authored several <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation,</b> including the Green Jobs Act of 2007 and the College Affordability and Accountability Act of 2008. He is {{the former chairman of}} the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, where he helped establish the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 1996 to 2012, Tierney comfortably won re-election in each cycle. He faced tougher challenges after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud in 2010, narrowly defeating his Republican opponent in 2012. In the 2014 election, he lost the Democratic primary to Seth Moulton, who went on to hold the seat in the general election.|$|E
5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two weeks}} of his {{appointment}} as Minister of Health Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> he hoped to see enacted. Before he left office in 1929, 21 of the 25 bills had passed into law. Chamberlain sought {{the abolition of the}} elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians which administered reliefâ€”and which in some areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and such Boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. In 1929 Chamberlain initiated legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a half}} hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties. The Bill passed into law.|$|E

5|$|To {{celebrate}} Hitler's {{appointment as}} chancellor, Goebbels organized a torchlit parade in Berlin {{on the night}} of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann GÃ¶ring. Goebbels was disappointed to not be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post Goebbels was expecting to receive. Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. The NSDAP took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorshipâ€”headed by Hitlerâ€”in its place. On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis {{at the end of the}} Second World War. While the NSDAP increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership. Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on 14 March.|$|E
