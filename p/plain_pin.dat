40|$|A basic {{question}} was asked concerning the drill string {{which is used}} in rotary Mode coring operations: `` [...] . what is the volume leak rate loss in a drill rod string under varying condiditons of the joint boxes and pins being either dry or coated with lubricant [...] . ``. A Variation of this was to either have an o-ring installed or absent on the drill rod that was grooved on the pin. A series of tests were run with both the o-ring grooved Longyear drill rod and the <b>plain</b> <b>pin</b> end rod manufactured by Diamond Drill. Test results show that drill rod leakage of both types is lowered dramatically when thread lubricant {{is applied to the}} threaded joints and the joints made up tight. The Diamond Drill rod with no o-ring groove has virtually no leakage when used with thread lubricant and the joints are properly tightened...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{test results}} {{to show the}} effect of hot-wet conditioning on the pin-bearing strength of a pultruded fiber reinforced polymer material. Knowledge of this strength property, taking account of any reduction over the service lives of structures, is required to reliably calculate bearing strength when designing bolted connections. Pin-bearing strength is determined using an in-house test method with batches of nominally identical specimens, cut from the web of a 203 x 203 x 9. 53 mm wide flange shape. This shape is from the 1525 series of Creative Pultrusion Inc., having a polyester based matrix. Specimens were immersed prior to strength testing under water for 3000 hours at the constant temperature of 40 ° C. The paper discusses the accelerated aging protocol {{and its relation to}} service life, and an explanation is given to why the material was aged for an unknown number of service years. Variables in the test matrix are the direction of the bearing force (0 °, 45 ° and 90 ° to the direction of pultrusion) and <b>plain</b> <b>pin</b> diameter (four sizes from 9. 7 mm to 25. 4 mm). Comparing aged pin-bearing strengths with equivalent strengths for non-aged material it is found that the average reduction in characteristic strength (calculated in accordance with Eurocode 0) of the 12 batches, is in the range of 18 to 31...|$|E

500|$|The custom came to Poland from Saxony {{during the}} reign of Augustus II (r.1697–1733), King of Poland and Elector of Saxony. During that time, the cockade worn by the Polish {{military}} had, like in Saxony, the form of a white silk ribbon with a knot in the middle. It was later replaced with a circular white cockade wrinkled toward the center, patterned after the cockade of the Kingdom of France. During the reign of King Stanislaus Augustus (r.1764–1795), a white-and-red cockade came into use alongside the plain white one. In 1791, the Military Commission introduced a metal cross pattée as a more durable alternative to the cockade. However, many soldiers continued to either pin the cross to the cockade or wear the cockade without the cross. Polish military leaders and national heroes of the time, such as General Tadeusz Kościuszko and Prince Józef Poniatowski <b>pinned</b> <b>plain</b> white [...] "national" [...] cockades to their hats.|$|R
40|$|Oval {{blackened}} steel badge with magnetic core; {{the face}} stippled with a helmet imposed on crossed swords within a laurel wreath border; the reverse <b>plain</b> with <b>pin</b> for wear. (Source: medal-medaille. com) Carol Kahn StraussThe wound badge was instituted on 3 March 1918 in three grades, black {{for one or}} two wounds, silver for three or four wounds and gold for five or more wounds. Alfred Kahn entered Realgymnasium in Dortmund in 1910. Both he and his brother Walter served in the German army during World War I. After the end of the war, Alfred completed his final examinations at his Realgymnasium and found a job in an iron wholesale business. He left this job to study law at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, and eventually earned a law degree from the University of Erlangen in 1930. In 1921, Alfred got engaged to Rosa (alternatively Rosel) Baum, whom he had known since his high school years. Rosa contracted pneumonia and, after spending years in a sanatorium, died of the disease in 1931. Alfred’s nascent legal career was cut short after the Nazi party took power in 1933. In 1937, he married Lotte Landau (1912 - 2004). In December 1938, Alfred and Lotte immigrated via Holland to the United States and settled in New York City. Alfred and Lotte Kahn’s son Steve was born in 1940 and their daughter Carol in 1944. After initial struggles as new immigrants, the family’s economic condition improved when Alfred established a law practice specializing in restitution claims and Lotte made a name for herself as a stockbroker.

30|$|Continued {{focus on}} {{materials}} development and novel methods of prophylactic antibiotic administration may provide insights {{that can be}} tested further in human clinical trials. Specifically, efforts are being made to produce an improved pin coating that has antimicrobial properties. This would have implications for external fixation but would revolutionize internal fixation for use over a site of previous pin use and for routine use as a prophylactic measure against infection. The findings of Chou et al. [9] are intriguing; topical pexiganan acetate applied to pin sites resulted in a 75  % decrease in pin site infections in a rabbit model. DeJong et al. [13] found that the pin site infection rate was significantly decreased by adding a coating of chlorhexidine, hydroxyapatite, and lipid to titanium and stainless steel pins implanted into goat tibiae. The coated pins had a 4.2  % infection rate and 12.5  % colonization rate at 14  days after inoculating the pin sites with S. aureus, {{in contrast to the}} 100  % infection rate in the uncoated pins (p <  0.01). Although the extraction torque of the coated pins decreased over the 14 -day study period, it was superior to the uncoated pins. These results suggest that this coating may be a viable option {{to reduce the risk of}} infection while maintaining a stable interface with bone. In an in vitro study by Chen et al. [8], a silver-containing HA pin coating was shown to decrease S. aureus and S. epidermidis adhesion in comparison with <b>plain</b> titanium <b>pins</b> without increased cytotoxicity to precursor osteoblast cells. The prevention measures tested in the Chou [9], DeJong [13], and Chen [8] studies, which seem promising in vitro or in animal models, would need to be shown to be effective in patients.|$|R
40|$|Air is a {{cheap and}} safe fluid, {{widely used in}} electronic, {{aerospace}} and air conditioning applications. Because of its poor heat transfer properties, it always flows through extended surfaces, such as finned surfaces, to enhance the convective heat transfer. In this paper, experimental results are reviewed and numerical studies during air forced convection through extended surfaces are presented. The thermal and hydraulic behaviours of a reference trapezoidal finned surface, experimentally evaluated by present authors in an open-circuit wind tunnel, has been compared with numerical simulations carried out by using the commercial CFD software COMSOL Multiphysics. Once the model has been validated, numerical simulations have been extended to other rectangular finned configurations, in order to {{study the effects of}} the fin thickness, fin pitch and fin height on the thermo-hydraulic behaviour of the extended surfaces. Moreover, several pin fin surfaces have been simulated in the same range of operating conditions previously analyzed. Numerical results about heat transfer and pressure drop, for both <b>plain</b> finned and <b>pin</b> fin surfaces, have been compared with empirical correlations from the open literature, and more accurate equations have been developed, proposed, and validated...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{dissipation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important issues for the reliability of electronics equipment. Up today, air represents the most safe, cheap, and common working fluid for electronics thermal management applications. Due to its poor heat transfer characteristics, air always flow through enhanced surfaces, such as plain and louvered fins, pin fins, offset strip fins and wire screens, in order to increase the heat transfer area and to create turbulence. Recently, metal foams have been proposed as promising enhanced surfaces to improve the overall heat transfer performance of the cooling system. In several applications air might be not enough for high level of heat dissipation, thus two-phase systems can represent a viable solution. Boiling is the heat transfer mechanism with the highest heat transfer coefficients, thus it can be used to spread high heat fluxes to maintain the wall temperature at low values with compact heat sinks. Microstructured surfaces, such as metal foams and microfin tubes, can exploit positive benefits on the flow boiling mechanism, i. e. they can promote bubble nucleation, reduce onset of nucleate boiling, augment two-phase mixing, enhance critical heat flux. On the other hand, the environmental issues associated to the use of synthetic refrigerants call for a continuous improvement of the technical solutions. Recently, new low-GWP refrigerants, in particular R 1234 ze(E) and R 1234 yf, have been proposed as possible alternatives of the traditional R 134 a. This PhD thesis explores the use of microstructured surfaces for thermal management applications. Metal foams, <b>plain</b> finned and <b>pin</b> finned surfaces are experimentally and numerically investigated during air forced convection. In addition, single- and two-phase flow (vaporization) of refrigerants through a copper foam and in a microfin tube is experimentally studied. The first chapter is focused on the air forced convection through metal foams. Nine copper foams are experimentally tested, and the overall heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops are calculated from the experimental measurements. The effects of the geometrical parameters (foam core height, pore density, and porosity) on the thermal and hydraulic behaviour of such materials are discussed. The experimental data points, coupled with other measurements previously obtained on aluminum foams, have permitted the development of a new semi-empirical equation for the estimation of the foam finned surface efficiency and of the heat transfer coefficient. The air forced convection through <b>plain</b> finned and <b>pin</b> fin surfaces is discussed in the second chapter. Numerical simulations are performed on different geometrical configurations of fin thickness, pitch, and height for the plain finned surfaces, and different configurations of pin diameter, longitudinal and transverse pin pitch, and pin height for the pin fin surfaces. The effects of the geometrical characteristics on the thermal and hydraulic behaviour are reported. From the numerical results, four correlations have been developed for the estimation of the Colburn j-factor and friction factor for <b>plain</b> finned and <b>pin</b> fin surfaces. In the end, an optimization of a plain finned surface is reported. The third chapter proposes a numerical approach to study the air forced convection through metal foams. The real structure of four copper foams, whose experimental results are reported in the first chapter, is obtained by micro-computed tomography scanned images. Once reconstructed, the real foams are meshed and the air flow simulated with a commercial software. Numerical results of pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient are compared against the experimental values. The design and development of a new experimental facility to study the phenomenon of the flow boiling inside microstructured surfaces is reported in the fourth chapter. The numerical design of the test section, which hosts a 200 mm long metal foam, is presented. Every component of the set up is discussed in details. The results of the calibration tests are reported. The flow boiling of refrigerants inside a metal foam is shown in the fifth chapter. The tested copper foam is 200 mm long, 10 mm wide, and 5 mm high. Three different refrigerants are studied: R 134 a, R 1234 ze(E), and R 1234 yf. R 1234 ze(E) and R 1234 yf (GWP= 6 and 4, respectively) are possible substitutes of R 134 a (GWP= 1400). Tests are run at a saturation temperature of 30 °C, which can be considered suitable for the case of electronic cooling applications, at different working conditions, in order to highlight the effects of the vapour quality, mass velocity, and heat flux on the thermal and hydraulic performance. Finally, the sixth chapter reports some results about the flow boiling of refrigerants inside a 3. 4 ID microfin tube. Three different refrigerants are studied: R 134 a, R 1234 ze(E), and R 1234 yf. As for the case of flow boiling inside a metal foam, tests are run at a saturation temperature of 30 °C under different working conditions, i. e. different vapour quality, mass velocity, and heat flux. The experimental results of heat transfer coefficient, vapour quality at the onset of the dryout, and pressure drop are compared against values predicted by correlations from the open literatur...|$|R
