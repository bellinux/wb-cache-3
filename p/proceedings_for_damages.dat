50|$|In May 2009, Foster began civil <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> against Associated Newspapers and {{a former}} lawyer.

In 2004, while still serving his sentence, he won £7m on the national lottery. The claimant started <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> on 22 December 2004 but Master Eyre, applying Stubbings, struck out the action as barred under section 2 of the 1980 Act. This decision was affirmed by the judge and the Court of Appeal 2006 1 WLR 2320." ...|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} Croatian Competition Agency started {{functioning}} in 1997, public enforcement of competition {{law has been}} the norm. Civil actions for breaches of competition law have been the exception in Croatia. The existing legislation {{in the area of}} competition law makes no effort to incentivise private enforcement. There are no specific rules in the Competition Act 2009 dedicated to civil actions, except a single provision that assigns jurisdiction over damages claims to commercial courts. General tort law is applicable in order to prove damages. A number of issues arise here mostly due to the complexity of competition cases. These issues were described in the European Commission’s White Paper on <b>Damages</b> Actions <b>for</b> Breach of EC Antitrust Rules (2008). The level of uncertainty as regards the outcome of the claim is high. It seems that special rules need to be adopted in Croatia in order to improve the position of the injured side. The paper deals with a number of procedural and substantive law issues relevant to the facilitation of civil <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> antitrust <b>damages.</b> A domestic law perspective is applied taking into account recent developments in EU competition law and policy. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need of {{conforming}} the binding regulation, by means of their interpretation, to the observed tendencies of economic crime. Particularly, the increasing threat posed to consumer by economic crime calls for rediscussing several problems of interpretation of art. 225 of Penal Code, art. 1 of The Speculation Elimination Act, and art. 226 p. c. {{in the light of}} their full use in protection of the endangered good. The article indicated the negative effects of interpretation according to which property swindled out of consumers by employees of the unit of socialized economy is considered to be the collective property, what in turn results in sentencing perpetrators for appropriation of collective property and holding them liable, in criminal <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> equal in value to the said property, payable to the unit of socialized economy. As far as art. 1. 1 of The Speculation Elimination Act is concerned, the trait „goods intended for sale in the unit of socialized commerce or in the catering business" has to be interpreted {{in such a way as}} to extend protection of penal law on all stages of transfer of goods designed for the average consummer, from the production establishment to the ultimate seller. Finally, considering the role of civil servants in that sphere of activity, it is suggested to modify the second segment of the subsidiarity principle (art. 246 § 4 p. c.) in order to be able to apply the regulation of art. 246 p. c. to those civil servants of socialized economy who are transgressing their competence in managing-effecting damage incurred by individuals.
