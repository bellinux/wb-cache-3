40|$|Abstract—An {{effective}} {{computational method}} {{based on a}} conven-tional modal-expansion approach is presented for solving the problem of diffraction by a deep grating. The groove depth can {{be the same as}} or a little more than the grating period. The material can be a <b>perfect</b> conductor, a <b>dielectric,</b> or a metal. The method is based on Yasuura’s modal expansion, which is known as a least-squares boundary residual method or a modified Rayleigh method. The feature of the present method is that: (1) The semi-infinite region U over the grating sur-face is divided into an upper half plane U 0 and a groove region UG by a fictitious boundary (a horizontal line); (2) The latter is further di-vided into shallow horizontal layers U 1, U 2, · · ·, UQ again by fictitious boundaries; (3) An approximate solution in U 0 is defined in a usual manner, i. e., a finite summation of up-going Floquet modal functions with unknown coefficients, while the solutions in Uq (q = 1, 2, · · ·, Q) include not only the up-going but also the down-going modal functions; (4) If the grating is made of a dielectric or a metal, the semi-infinite region L below the surface is partitioned similarly into L 0, L 1, · · ·, LQ, and approximate solutions are defined in each region; (5) A huge-sized least squares problem that appears in finding the modal coefficients is solved by the QR decomposition accompanied by sequential accu-mulation. The method of solution for a grating made of a perfect conductor is described in the text. The method for dielectric gratings can be found in an appendix.

3000|$|Prof. Wenping Hu and prof. Hongxiang Li, {{who lead}} the {{research}} group from Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Science, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Science, reported several novel methods {{to overcome the}} challenge in Research News titled “Micrometer and Nanometer-Sized Organic Single-Crystalline Transistors” in Advanced Materials published online on July 4, 2008. “By traditional physical vapor transport and chemical solution growth process, micrometer and nanometer-sized organic single crystals can be obtained more easily than large-sized crystals. Using these micrometer- and nanometer-sized organic single crystals not only retain all the merits of single crystals, but also provide more effective ways to characterize organic semiconductors,” said Hu and Li. “We have opened up some new techniques to make small sized organic single-crystalline devices, for example, the multi-time gold microwire mask moving method.” Hu and Li explained to Nanospotlight, “We placed the gold microwire above the small crystals, fixed the gold wire with silver glue, and then deposited the electrode. The gold wire serviced as mask to obtain the conducting channel with the length equal to the diameter of gold wire. After that, we slightly moved the gold wire, and deposited the metal again. The channel width can be decreased further. If a gold wire with width of 20 micrometer was used, the channel length can be decreased till 5 micrometers.” “Another advantage of this technique is the fabrication of the asymmetric electrodes, which is difficult to realize by other mask technique.” With this technique, high-performance copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) devices with Au/Au symmetric electrodes (published separately on November 21, 2005, online edition of Advanced Materials, “Low threshold voltage transistors based on individual single-crystalline submicrometer-sized ribbons of copper phthalocyanine”), and copper hexadecafluoro phthalocyanine (F 16 CuPc) devices with Au/Ag asymmetric electrodes (published separately in October 26, 2006, online edition of Journal of the American Chemical Society, “High-Performance Air-Stable n-Type Transistors with an Asymmetrical Device Configuration Based on Organic Single-Crystalline Submicrometer/Nanometer Ribbons”) have been achieved. “We are also exploring other device fabrication techniques.” Hu and Li said. “By simply using a mechanical probe to scratch the polymer layer on a Si substrate to create a gap as an air dielectric, using single-crystalline ribbon as semiconductor layer, and stamping the thin Au layers to form electrodes, the air-dielectric devices could be fabricated.” The results achieved by their group demonstrated excellent photo/air stability and good performance of single-crystalline F 16 CuPc devices (published separately on February 28, 2008, online edition of Applied Physics Letters, “Air/vacuum Dielectric Organic Single Crystalline Transistors of Copper-hexadecafluoro phthalocyanine Ribbons”).

A front-tracking finite difference scheme is used in conjunction with Taylor-Melcher leaky dielectric theory to study the problem. The numerical results in different regions of the deformation-circulation map show that the structure formation in regions I and III can be hindered by the hydrodynamic effect. This is opposite to what is observed in the <b>perfect</b> <b>dielectric</b> cases and region II of the map. For <b>perfect</b> <b>dielectric</b> systems, where the electrohydrodynamics effects are absent, droplets form chain-like structures spanning the distance between the electrodes after the application of the electric field.

Point-dipole approximation is used to analyze the structure formation and it is shown that it is also applicable to region II where the hydrodynamic effect is weak and the behavior of the system is mainly governed by the dielectrophoretic forces. It is shown that the chain formation is not possible in regions I and III due to the competition between the dipolar force and torque on one side and hydrodynamic effect on the other side. In region I, the hydrodynamic torque prevents the chain formation by competing with the dipolar torque, which tends to align the drops with the electric field. On the other hand, in region III, the repulsive nature of the hydrodynamic effect opposes the attractive dipolar force and does not allow the particles to form stable chains...|$|E
