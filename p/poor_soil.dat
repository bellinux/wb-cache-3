5|$|A 1.5 hectare {{patch of}} brown earth soil at the {{abandoned}} settlement of Papadil {{is home to}} a thriving population of earthworms, which are rare in the elsewhere <b>poor</b> <b>soil</b> of the island. Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due to the good quality soil, and absence of predators.|$|E
5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway will be {{extended}} north from Major Mackenzie Drive {{to tie in}} with Highway48, becoming the through-route {{in the process and}} completing the Markham Bypass. <b>Poor</b> <b>soil</b> conditions at a planned overpass of the Stouffville GO Train line have required several years of ongoing soil consolidation, beginning in July 2012 and scheduled for completion in the fall of 2017.|$|E

50|$|Often seen in {{gardens and}} {{suitable}} for warm and maritime districtsand tolerant of hot sun, <b>poor</b> <b>soils,</b> wind and coastal exposure, New Zealand native broadleaf evergreen shrub Brachyglottis greyi {{can be found}} sprawled in the hot sun, <b>poor</b> <b>soils</b> and coastal breezes; maturing into mounds 1.2 m to 1.5 m tall and 1.8 m wide.|$|R
5|$|On this site, 171 {{plant species}} are surveyed. Given {{its size and}} <b>poor</b> <b>soil,</b> this {{diversity}} is notable. Management undertaken {{in recent years has}} been essential to maintaining open areas, the most threatened by primary succession. Thus, the various vegetation layers (pioneer and mature woodland, bushy areas, open areas) provide a mosaic of habitats, and thus remarkable species.|$|E
5|$|For {{the bridge}} over Ydseelva in Verdal, {{which had a}} main span of only , {{construction}} started in April 1903 and was completed on 21 November. The area has quik clay, so the bridge needed piling. At Røra, a spur was originally planned to Hylla, but this was discarded late in the planning phase. At Hellem in Inderøy the right-of-way had to be moved because of <b>poor</b> <b>soil</b> mechanics. There were similar issues north of the Lunnan Tunnel, forcing the tunnel to be extended and a supporting being built. Construction of the tunnel was performed by 40 men {{during the winter of}} 1904 and 1905. It cost NOK90,179 and took 23.9 man-hours per meter to build.|$|E
5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in <b>poor</b> <b>soil</b> and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E
50|$|It {{also shows}} {{characteristics}} of a plant adapted to <b>poor</b> <b>soils.</b> This shrub has a high root/shoot ratio {{and the presence of}} mycorrhizae serves to maximize the uptake of minerals in <b>poor</b> <b>soils.</b> Different nitrogen-fixing bacterial strains have been isolated from the caper bush rhizosphere, playing a role in maintaining high reserves of that growth-limiting element.|$|R

5|$|About 298 {{million years}} ago Permian forests started to cover the continent, and there were tundras as late as 15 {{million years ago}}, but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow {{extensive}} vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, <b>poor</b> <b>soil</b> quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes. There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts, but only three species of flowering plants, {{all of which are}} found in the Antarctic Peninsula: Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic hair grass), Colobanthus quitensis (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native Poa annua (annual bluegrass). Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poor</b> <b>soil</b> {{conditions}} and bad weather led to crop failures {{during the first}} three years of the project, but the group still managed to cultivate mint and farm livestock. The burgeoning timber industry provided a boost to the settlement's economy, and by 1918 there were over 500 families residing there. A fire in 1917 razed the entire village, leading to the departure of around twenty families. Ueshiba was attending a meeting over railway construction around 50 miles away, but on learning of the fire travelled back the entire distance on foot. He was elected to the village council that year, and took a prominent role in leading the reconstruction efforts. In the summer of 1918, Hatsu gave birth to their first son, Takemori.|$|E
5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin <b>poor</b> <b>soil</b> covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E

5|$|The {{geography}} of Ratanakiri Province is diverse, encompassing rolling hills, mountains, plateaus, lowland watersheds, and crater lakes. Two major rivers, Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, flow {{from east to}} west across the province. The province is known for its lush forests; as of 1997, 70–80% of the province was forested, either with old-growth forest or with secondary forest regrown after shifting cultivation. In the far north of the province are mountains of the Annamite Range; the area is characterized by dense broadleaf evergreen forests, relatively <b>poor</b> <b>soil,</b> and abundant wildlife. In the highlands between Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, the home of the vast majority of Ratanakiri's population, a hilly basalt plateau provides fertile red soils. Secondary forests dominate this region. South of the Srepok River is a flat area of tropical deciduous forests.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{agricultural}} activities {{accounted for}} about one-fifth of Iran's gross domestic product (GDP) and employed a comparable proportion of the workforce. Most farms are small, less than 25 acres (10 hectares), and are not economically viable, which has contributed to the wide-scale migration to cities. In addition to water scarcity and areas of <b>poor</b> <b>soil,</b> seed is of low quality and farming techniques are antiquated.|$|E
25|$|The primary company {{operations}} were centered at Fort Nisqually and Cowlitz Farm in modern Washington state. At Fort Nisqually (near present-day Olympia, Washington) due to <b>poor</b> <b>soil,</b> the station focused on pastoral operations, including flocks of sheep for wool, cattle herds for beef and cheese manufacturing. Cowlitz Farm was the company's primary center of agricultural production. The company also operated many large {{farms in the}} area of Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island.|$|E
25|$|Most agronomists {{believe that}} {{agricultural}} production will be mostly {{affected by the}} severity and pace of climate change, {{not so much by}} gradual trends in climate. If change is gradual, there may be enough time for biota adjustment. Rapid climate change, however, could harm agriculture in many countries, especially those that are already suffering from rather <b>poor</b> <b>soil</b> and climate conditions, because there is less time for optimum natural selection and adaption.|$|E
