40|$|Both color keyed {{and color}} {{specific}} liquid primers {{have been used}} successfully in automotive paint application, reducing the use of costly topcoat materials. Generally, color keyed primer is close in color to the topcoat and {{is applied to the}} exterior surfaces of the vehicle body. Color specific primer identically matches the topcoat material color, and {{can be used as a}} replacement for topcoat on interior surfaces. Application of color powder <b>paint</b> <b>primer</b> would provide for additional cost savings, more environment-friendly manufacturing, and higher customer satisfaction. Recent technology breakthroughs have led to the technical feasibility of applying multicolor powder paint with full reclaim and therefore 100 % material utilization. The field feasibility of applying multicolor powder paint in an automotive manufacturing facility is being assessed and validated by GM. More specifically, GM has developed the GM Canister Powder Paint Delivery System to meet the challenges of color powder paint application. In anticipation of multicolor powder paint application, GM is completing its Manufacturing Systems Qualification (MSQ) Process for the Canister System. Due to the newness of the enabling technology, GM is investigating all aspects of materials, process designs, facilities, operations, and people, for the implementation of color keyed/color specific powder <b>paint</b> <b>primer</b> into new GM paint shops. Similar to GM's MSQ Process, qualification requirements in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry attest to the importance of validation in the implementation of new manufacturing technology. Beyond its technical purposes, validation can serve as a bridge between development and operation. During development, formal and relational contracts with(cont.) suppliers should be established to provide incentives for the supplier to perform throughout validation and commissioning. Involving the plant in validation along with suppliers is one means of education and thus empowerment, a key phase of organizational change as described by Professor Shoji Shiba. Leadership can use several change management techniques to help prepare the plant organization for operation of the new manufacturing technology. by Bevin Barberich. Thesis (S. M.)

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) during an accelerated corrosion (GM scab) test was used to differentiate between good and poor coating systems on coldrolled steel (CRS). The best coating was determined to be a cathodic Ecoat/ trimethylsilane (TMS) plasma polymer/oxide-free steel surface having an impedance modulus at low frequency of 109 ohms throughout the entire corrosion test. A spray <b>paint</b> <b>primer</b> and surface oxides both contributed to a degradation of corrosion protection evident from a significant drop in impedance (106 _). With samples of known corrosion resistance, equivalent circuits were used to relate circuit elements to individual chemical processes taking place and identify the major factors contributing to failure of the coating. Two models (with and without plasma polymer film) were proposed and a good correlation to the EIS data was shown by a good visual plot fit and low chi squared values (< 10 - 3). It was determined that the performance of the plasma polymer and conditions at the PP/steel interface are the major factors influencing the coating performance. The good coating system maintained a low double layer capacitance (10 - 9 F) and high charge transfer resistance (109 _) relating to good adhesion at the coating/metal interface. The other samples, which exhibited poor adhesion, had a much higher capacitance (10 - 6 F) meaning water pool formation has created a water/metal interface. This in turn allows salt penetration for a higher corrosion rate showing up in the lower resistance (106 _) ...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion-resistant {{films were}} formed on {{aluminum}} by immersion in solutions of basic chromic sulfate, plus fluosilicate, with alkali added to near, or slightly beyond, precipitation of insoluble basic compounds. The trivalent chromium films formed on 7075 -T 6 or 2024 -T 3 aluminum, when tested in 5 -percent NaCl salt spray, provided corrosion resistance {{in excess of}} 96 hr. When a post-treatment of peroxide or permanganate solution was applied, corrosion resistance for both alloys almost reached 336 hr and sometimes exceeded this value. In most cases, only a 10 -min immersion was necessary at 25 "C to obtain a corrosion-resistant film. Trivalentchromium-treated aluminum served as an effective base for an epoxy <b>paint</b> <b>primer.</b> Anodized aluminum was afforded excellent corrosion resistance, comparable to dichromate, by sealing in dilute basic chromic sulfate solution and post-treated with peroxide. C hromate conversioncoatings have found widespread commercial and military applications on aluminum alloys and zinc or cadmium electrodeposits. Of particular interest to the Navy {{is the use of}} chromate coatings on aircrafl aluminum alloys, because of excellent corrosion resistance and the ability to serve as an effective base for paint. The bathsusedtodevelopthiscoatingcontainchromates (hexavalent chromium), and it is the residual chromates in the coating that are largely responsible for the high degree of corrosion inhibition observed. Chromates are highly toxic, however, and theirpresence in wastewater effluents is severely restricted. It would, therefore, be highly desirable to develop a coating for aluminum alloys utilizing relatively non-toxic chemicals that could serve as an alternative to chromate coating. Preliminary studies were conducted with molybdate solutions that produced thin colored films (presumably molybdic oxides) on immersed 7075 -T 6 AI alloy, but that possessed only slight salt spray resistance. With additives, corrosion resistance of about 24 hr salt spray exposure was achieved as, for example, by 5 -min immersion at 25 "C in the following bath: 6 g/L Na,MoO, 4 gfL NaLSiF, 5 g/L Na,PO,. 2 H,...|$|E

50|$|Chromate {{conversion}} coating {{is a type}} of {{conversion coating}} used to passivate steel, aluminum, zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and tin alloys. It is primarily used as a corrosion inhibitor, primer, decorative finish, or to retain electrical conductivity. The process is named after the chromate found in chromic acid, also known as hexavalent chromium, the chemical most widely used in the immersion bath process whereby the coating is applied. However, hexavalent chromium is toxic, thus, highly regulated, so new, non-hexavalent chromium-based processes are becoming more readily available at a commercial level. One alternative contains trivalent chromium. In Europe the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive is commonly referred to regarding elimination of hexavalent chromium in electrical and electronic equipment, and the REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals") Directive to wider applications including chromate conversion coating processes, <b>paint</b> <b>primers</b> and other preparations.|$|R

Although some lead oxides are detected as small paint chips associated with electro-coated <b>paint</b> <b>primers,</b> used to provide corrosion resistance in automobiles, the actual quantities detected are small.

5000|$|Hexavalent {{chromium}} (chromium(VI), Cr(VI), chromium 6) {{refers to}} chemical compounds that contain the element chromium in the +6 oxidation state (thus hexavalent). Virtually all chromium ore is processed via hexavalent chromium, specifically the salt sodium dichromate. Approximately 136000 tonne lb of hexavalent chromium were produced in 1985. Additional hexavalent chromium compounds are chromium trioxide and various salts of chromate and dichromate, among others. Hexavalent chromium {{is used in}} textile dyes, wood preservation, anti-corrosion products, chromate conversion coatings, {{and a variety of}} niche uses. Industrial uses of hexavalent chromium compounds include chromate pigments in dyes, paints, inks, and plastics; chromates added as anticorrosive agents to <b>paints,</b> <b>primers,</b> and other surface coatings; and chromic acid electroplated onto metal parts to provide a decorative or protective coating. Hexavalent chromium can be formed when performing [...] "hot work" [...] such as welding on stainless steel or melting chromium metal. In these situations the chromium is not originally hexavalent, but the high temperatures involved in the process result in oxidation that converts the chromium to a hexavalent state. Hexavalent chromium can also be found in drinking water and public water systems.|$|R
