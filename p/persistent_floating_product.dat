In certain aquatic plants and animals, these films are thicker and more <b>persistent.</b> <b>Floating</b> ferns {{of the genus}} Salvinia show elaborated hierarchical superhydrophobic surface structures: a hairy cover of complex trichomes. In the case of S. molesta, they are eggbeater shaped and topped by hydrophilic tips, which pin the air–water interface and prevent rupture of contact. It has been proposed that these trichomes can oscillate with the air–water interface, when turbulences occur and thereby stabilize the air film. The deformability of such arrays of trichomes requires a certain elasticity of the structures. In this study, we determined the stiffness of the trichome coverage of S. molesta and three other Salvinia species. Our results confirm the elasticity of the trichome coverage in all investigated Salvinia species. We did not reveal a clear relationship between the time of air retention and stiffness of the trichome coverage, {{which means that the}} air retention function is additionally dependent on different parameters, e. g., the trichome shape and surface free energy.

To assess the presence of oil near shorelines during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, we scanned the library of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery collected during the event to determine which images intersected shorelines and appeared to contain oil. In total, 715 SAR images taken during the DWH spill were analyzed and processed, with 188 of the images clearly showing oil. Of these, 156 SAR images showed oil within 10 km of the shoreline with appropriate weather conditions for the detection of oil on SAR data. We found detectable oil in SAR images within 10 km of the shoreline from west Louisiana to west Florida, including near beaches, marshes, and islands. The high number of SAR images collected in Barataria Bay, Louisiana in 2010 allowed {{for the creation of a}} nearshore oiling persistence map. This analysis shows that, in some areas inside Barataria Bay, floating oil was detected on as many as 29 different days in 2010.

We conclude that satellite-based SAR imagery can detect oil slicks near shorelines, even in sheltered areas.

40|$|This is a {{guide to}} using {{groundwater}} extraction and product recovery as a remediation technology. Groundwater extraction systems are systems that pump contaminated groundwater from an aquifer on a long-term basis. Groundwater extraction requires treatment and proper disposal of the pumped groundwater. Groundwater that is treated on-site can be discharged to surface water or groundwater under a Wisconsin Pollution Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permit. Treated groundwater (on-site or off-site) may also be discharged to a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) provided that prior approval is obtained from the POTW. Most of this guidance is specific to remediation of unconfined aquifers, however, much of the guidance is also appropriate for confined aquifers. An aquifer is defined in this document as any soil or rock unit that contains water under saturated conditions. The term aquifer, as used in this document, can refer to a unit that is overlain and/or underlain by a geologic unit that has relatively higher permeability, and/or does not produce economically significant volumes of water. Product recovery refers to physically removing free product from the aquifer by pumping. In almost all cases, product recovery refers to extracting <b>floating</b> <b>product</b> from the aquifer. Recovery of sinking product (dense non aqueous phase liquid or DNAPL) by pumping is also considered product recovery. Because each site has unique characteristics, {{it may be necessary}} for system designers to deviate from the guidance. The DNR acknowledges that systems will deviate from this guidance when site-specific conditions warrant. When deviations occur, designers should document these differences in their work plan to facilitate DNR review.

Several empirical studies have suggested that inflation has been significantly more persistent (positively serially correlated) and monetary policy more accommodative of inflation under floating exchange rates than under pegged rates (see Alogoskoufis and Smith, 1991; Alogoskoufis, 1992; Obstfeld, 1995).

This novel flotation technique is based on the fact that coarse particles, if they are selectively rendered hydrophobic by conditioning, would act as bubble film breakers. If the feed was introduced onto the surface of the froth, such particles would settle through the froth under gravity to be recovered as an underflow (concentrate) product, while the hydrophilic gangue would be supported by the bubble films and be recovered as a <b>float</b> (tailings) <b>product.</b> The efficiency of this technique - reverse froth flotation - depends on the interaction between various characteristics of particles and the froth. In order to simulate the experimentally observed trends, and hence investigate the various mechanisms qualitatively, a fundamental model of these interactions was developed. Various particle properties were taken into account, including surface properties, shape, size and density. To account for the changing nature of the froth at different positions in the cell, the model predicts the trajectory of a particle over discrete time events.
