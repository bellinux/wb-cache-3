25|$|Animal {{studies had}} {{previously}} been conducted by William Pollack, using a rabbit model of Rh. This model, named the rabbit HgA-F system, was a perfect animal model of human Rh, and enabled Pollack's team to gain experience in preventing hemolytic disease in rabbits by giving specific HgA antibody, as was later done with Rh-negative mothers. One of the needs was a dosing experiment {{that could be used}} to determine the level of circulating Rh-positive cells in an Rh-negative <b>pregnant</b> <b>female</b> derived from her Rh-positive fetus. This was first done in the rabbit system, but subsequent human tests at the University of Manitoba conducted under Pollack's direction confirmed that this result matched the human dosing perfectly. The dose is 20 µG of antibody for 1mL of Rh-positive red cells.|$|E
25|$|Proponents for wolf hunting often {{point out}} the {{apparently}} adverse effects large wolf populations have on game herds. An example occurred in 2008, in which the Alaska Board of Game approved plans calling for department staff to shoot wolves from helicopters on the southern Alaska Peninsula in order to assist {{the survival of the}} Southern Alaska Peninsula Caribou Herd. Wolves were believed to be responsible for a dramatic drop in the Southern Alaska Caribou Herd's population, which once numbered up to 10,000 in 1983, only to drop to a population of 600 animals in 2008. Wolf predation was also believed to be responsible for virtually no calves surviving for the two years prior the culling plans, despite a 70% pregnancy rate. In the former Soviet Union, depending on the locality, a single wolf can consume 90 saiga, 50-80 wild boar or an average of 50 domestic or wild caribou annually. A pack of 2-5 wolves will often kill 2 caribou every three days. Further reports from the former Soviet Union indicate that rather than prey on exclusively sick or infirm prey, wolves seem to attack young or pregnant animals far more frequently, regardless of their sanitary state. In the Nenetskij National Okrug, wolves were shown to select <b>pregnant</b> <b>female</b> domestic caribou and calves rather than infirm specimens, with some reports showing that wolves bypassed emaciated, sickly animals in favour of well fed ones. Large numbers of wolves have also been blamed on the decline of critically endangered saiga antelope herds in Central Asia. During the late 1950s and early 1960s when the Soviet Union used poison to effectively bring down wolf numbers, the number, as well as the range of moose, wild boar and red deer increased. Caspian seals were valued as fur bearers in the Soviet industry, and in a three-week period in February 1978, wolves were responsible for the wanton killing of numerous seals on the Caspian sea near Astrakhan. Between 17-40% of the seals in the area were estimated to have been killed, but not eaten.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} {{the levels of}} leptin in <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> during different stages of pregnancy and to correlate these levels to maternal weight, body mass index (BMI), neonate weight and neonate BMI. A case control study {{was carried out in}} which 60 <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> were enrolled, but only 36 completed the study and 30 non-pregnant females were used as controls. Blood samples were collected at the 1 st trimester, 2 nd trimester and 3 rd trimester, and after delivery. Serum was used for the estimation of leptin (by radioimmunoassay). The results showed that the levels of leptin were significantly higher in <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> compared to non-pregnant females, but significantly decreased after delivery. In <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> with gestational diabetes the leptin level was insignificantly higher. Conclusion: The increase of leptin levels {{may be due to the}} stimulatory effect of insulin on leptin secretion from adipose tissue. KS...|$|R
5000|$|A {{longitudinal}} study on <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> found that 76% of <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> experienced {{significant changes in}} gustation and olfaction perception.

The study concluded that 67% of the <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> had reported a higher level of sensitivity to smell, 17% suffered from an olfactory distortion and 14% suffered from phantosmia; these distortions were very minimal towards the last stages of pregnancy and in the majority were not present post partum. Furthermore, 26% of these participants also claimed that they also experienced an increased sensitivity to foods that were bitter and a decreased sensitivity to salt. These findings suggest that <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> experience distorted smell and taste perception during pregnancy.

500|$|Females become fertile {{at around}} 9 years of age. The oldest <b>pregnant</b> <b>female</b> ever {{recorded}} was 41 years old. Gestation requires 14 to 16 months, producing a single calf.

The <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> of the 1 st group have been receiving a ferrum (III) hydroxide polymaltosate preparation (ferrum medicinal) by a tablet twice a day during 30 days. The <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> of a control group were observed by the obstetrician-gynecologist. The lipid peroxidation values (the dienic and trienic conjugate, Schiff’s base content) were investigated with a spectrophotometry method, the antioxidant system activity — with a method of induced biochemiliminescence. The endothelium state values (the endothelin level (1 — 21) and the Willebrand’s factor activity) were detected with a method of immunoenzymatic analysis, a content of the nitrogen oxide stable metabolites was assessed with a use of a spectrophotometric method. Results. The higher initial levels of all the studied lipoperoxidation products as well as the antioxidant system activity, the nitrogen oxide content and the Willebrand’s factor activity are marked in a blood serum of <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> with a ferrodeficient anemia compared to <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> without the ferrum deficiency signs. An increase of the dienic conjugate content and the antioxidant system activity in a blood serum of <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> with a ferrodeficient anemia is observed in 30 days of the ferrum studied preparation use. Besides, a substantial alteration of the endothelium state values is not revealed. Conclusion. A dynamic control of the lipid peroxidation values and endothelium state, especially in patients with attendant diseases, accompanied by the endothelium dysfunction, is recommended considering a necessity of the ferrum preparation durative use for a ferrodeficient anemia treatment...|$|R

500|$|The {{size and}} {{structure}} of the prickly shark's mouth and pharynx suggests that it uses suction to capture prey. This species feeds on a variety of benthic and pelagic bony fishes, including hake, flounders, rockfishes, lingcod, topsmelt, mackerel, and herring, and on cartilaginous fishes, including elephantfishes (Callorhinchus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), young bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus), and ghost catshark (Apristurus) egg cases. Octopuses and squid, including the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) are also consumed. Young prickly sharks may themselves fall prey to the bluntnose sixgill shark, while adults likely face few threats. Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous, with the unborn young sustained by yolk. There is only one known record of a <b>pregnant</b> <b>female,</b> which was gestating 114 embryos; this ranks among the largest known litters from any shark.

40|$|Aim of {{investigation}} is {{establishment of the}} lipid peroxidation (LPO) and antioxidant protection system (AOPS) of blood value use possibility for assessment of the chronic placental insufficiency (ChPI) development risk, a degree of its gravity and a control of the conducted treatment. Materials and methods. 140 females in the pregnancy dates of 24 to 36 weeks, undergoing {{a study of the}} LPO and AOPS of blood, are examined. 400 <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> with a compensated form of ChPI, at a treatment of which the ozonotherapy (OT), hyperbarotherapy (HBTh) and traditional medicamental methods were used, are also examined. Investigation results. The LPO and AOPS of blood values in a group of <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> with a high risk of a ChPI development already differed from the normal ones. The alterations in females with a compensated ChPI appeared to be more expressed, the investigating values in <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> with a subcompensated pathology differed more from the normal ones. A dynamic observation has demonstrated that the ozonotherapy leads to normalization of the LPO-AOPS system state in <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> with a compensated ChPI. A HBTh and traditional treatment were less effective. Thus, the processes of free-radical oxidation and a state of AOPS in <b>pregnant</b> <b>females</b> can serve both for prognosia of a ChPI development and an assessment of a pathologic state gravity degree, a control of the conducted therapy effectiveness...|$|R
