40|$|OBJECTIVES—To assess {{sensitivity}} and specificity of a questionnaire designed to detect neurotoxic symptoms in workers exposed to solvents and in patients with a <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome.</b>  METHODS—The Swedish Q 16 is a self administered questionnaire for neurotoxic symptoms. The modified German version consists of 18  questions. The results were analysed from 1166  questionnaires which were completed by adults belonging to the following groups; 483  workers with occupational exposure to solvents and 193  non-exposed controls, 25  patients with a <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> 25  sex and age matched patients with a lung disease, and a sample of 440  people from the general population.  RESULTS—The German Q 18 was easy to handle and quick to perform. Workers exposed to solvents reported significantly more complaints than controls (2. 9  v 2. 5). All patients with a <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome</b> had five or more complaints. This was true for only 32 % of patients with lung disease. These comparisons showed that chronic exposure to solvents was associated with subjective complaints related particularly to cognitive functions. In the sample of the general population, age, education level, smoking habits, and time of performance showed no significant influence on the Q 18 result. Women had significantly more complaints than men (3. 2  v 2. 3). People who reported drinking alcohol occasionally or moderately had significantly fewer complaints than teetotalers.  CONCLUSIONS—The German Q 18 has an acceptable {{sensitivity and}} reliability, a reasonable specificity, and a good practicability. It is a useful instrument for screening workers exposed to solvents. A cut off point of 5  for men is recommended, and a cut off point of 6  for women is proposed.    Keywords: neurotoxicity; solvents; questionnaire Q 1...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{concept of}} Minimal Brain Dysfunctions (MBD), i. e. minor psycho-organic symptoms, has gained {{considerable}} scientific interest in earlier years. In clinical practice there are regularly patients {{who do not}} fulfil the criteria for ADHD but still show distinct psycho-organic symptoms. On the other hand, patients with ADHD almost regularly do not only show the core criteria of ADHD but also additional signs of a <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Furthermore do epidemiological data suggest that in a non-selected population of patients with mental disorders about 10 % should show some indicators for minimal brain dysfunction. In this study we assessed indicator signs for a MBD in a non-selected population of patients with psychological problems in order to study their frequency and interrelations. Methods: 1346 consecutive inpatients of a department for behavioral medicine filled in the MBD self rating questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 20 items, which cover symptoms characteristic for a <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The items are rated as 0 (not present) or 1 (present). In this paper we report data on the {{factor analysis of the}} scale. Results: The average score has been 7, 6 (s. d. 4, 1, range 0 - 20), with a normal distribution of scores. Three factors had an Eigenwert > 1, explaining 38, 8 % of variance: a) „disorders of affect regulation“, b) „impairment of memory and orientation“, and c) „disorders of drive and autonomic instability“. Conclusions: The data suggest, that psycho-organic impairment is not a dichotomous but dimensional phenomenon, as can be expected for theoretical reasons. The factors of the MBD scale reflect the classical tri-dimensional structure of psycho-organic brain syndromes. For the understanding of mental disorders in general and ADHD in particular, the MBD concept should gain new attention...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of intravenous valproate (i. v. VPA) as first-line treatment of status epilepticus (SE) and seizure clusters in selected patient populations. Methods: We enrolled 23 patients (11 females and 12 males; mean age: 61 years) with SE who received i. v. VPA as first-line therapy (25 mg/kg in 100 mL saline infused over 15 min). ECG tracing was monitored before, during, and after infusion. Liver function and serum ammonia tests were conducted after 24 and 72 h of treatment. We evaluate the response of SE to i. v. therapy and short-term outcome. Results: In 15 out of 23 patients (65 %), i. v. VPA was effective. In our population, we retrospectively identified three different subgroups: patients with cardiorespiratory comorbidities discouraging the use of traditional SE first-line drugs, patients with specific epileptic subsyndromes (such as idiopathic generalized epilepsy), and patients affected by <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndromes.</b> No significant adverse effects were detected. Discussion: Our study shows the clinical relevance of i. v. VPA as first-line therapy of SE in patients with medical conditions contraindicating the use of traditional first-line antiepileptic drugs for SE, and in those presenting with specific forms of SE.

40|$|Introduction. Psychiatric {{symptoms}} in hospitalized somatic patients are not rare in practice, and therefore consultative psychiatric examinations {{are an important}} part of the treatment of patients in non-psychiatric departments. The term consultative psychiatry refers to psychiatric evaluation, advising and treatment of numerous and various psychiatric disorders in physically ill patients in non-psychiatric departments. The aim of the research was to determine the wards at which psychiatric consultations were the most frequent as well as the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Material and method. The research included 887 patients hospitalized at the clinics of the Clinical Centre Nis, examined by consultant psychiatrists during the twelve month period. The research instrument was medical documentation (files of psychiatrist-consultants after the completed consultation). Results and conclusion. The greatest number of psychiatric consultations was made at the Endocrinology Clinic, followed by the Neurology Clinic and the Surgery Clinic, and then at the Clinic for Cardiovascular Diseases. Most diagnoses were syndromological-descriptive, which entailed a relatively high percentage of multiple diagnoses. The most frequent diagnostic groups were chronic and acute <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> which cause a bad compliance and can lead to difficulties during somatic examination, intervention or pharmacological treatment. Immediately following are mental disorders due to the use of psychoactive substances, situational reactions and suicide attempts. The obtained results have shown that consultative psychiatric examinations were made in urgent conditions (aggressive patients), with few control examinations, which means without the follow up of the given therapy, without the use of psychotherapy and the principles of liaison psychiatry...|$|R
40|$|Tiredness is {{a common}} {{complaint}} which may have multiple causes, sometimes difficult to ascertain. As occupational activities can {{play a major role}} in the incidence of various diseases, failure to investigate the patient's work history may hinder an adequate patient care. In the clinical case described hereafter, the patient symptoms could eventually be ascribed to a <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (POS) caused by the chronic exposure to organic solvents in the painting material used. This syndrome is non specific, evolves with time in an insidious manner, and, in its last stages, may cause non reversible brain damages. When facing non typical neurological symptoms in a working age adult, one has thus to consider the possibility of this diagnosis since the workers populations exposed to solvents are large in several occupations, and because the recent legal recognition in Belgium of this syndrome as an occupational disease does provide some interesting means for a better follow-up and protection of the patients concerned.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{chart the}} subtle {{neurological}} abnormalities {{in patients with}} asbestosis relative to possible development of cancer. METHODS: In 1979 - 81 a standardised neurological examination was made of 115 patients with asbestosis who carried {{a high risk of}} occupational cancer and their cancer morbidity was analysed 15 years later. RESULTS: Slight disturbances of unknown aetiology were found in the central nervous system (CNS) of 33 and in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) of 41 patients. Of these 17 had disturbances of both the CNS and PNS. This cohort was followed up to the end of 1994. During this time 47 of the patients developed cancer. Statistical analyses showed that disturbances of the CNS such as <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> cerebellar dysfunction, and motor disturbances of unknown origin were significantly associated with cancer, whereas no such association was found for peripheral neuropathy. Interaction between the radiological progression of asbestosis and disturbances of the CNS was an even stronger predictor of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that slight disturbances of the CNS are predictors of development of cancer. Whether or not these disturbances are manifestations of involvement of a paraneoplastic nervous system or some factor associated with progression of asbestosis remains open...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{provided}} evidence that neuropsychiatric symptoms are induced by long term exposure to solvents; individual diagnosis with psychometric tests, however, {{is not always}} possible (for example, when the patient has linguistic difficulties). Therefore evoked potentials and cerebral blood flow were studied in 50 patients occupationally exposed to solvents who were referred to our department and for whom a solvent induced <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was suspected. Degree of exposure was evaluated by its duration (mean 13. 9, range 1 to 37 years) and its intensity (from an interview). At the group level, P 22 and N 35 latencies and amplitude N 20 -P 22 of somatosensory evoked potentials were higher in cases than in controls (p < 0. 05), whereas {{there was no difference}} for brainstem and visual evoked potentials, nor for hemispheric cerebral blood flow (but a higher distribution in the left occipital region was seen in patients, p < 0. 05). Some parameters were linked to degree of exposure (amplitude N 20 -P 22 of somatosensory evoked potentials, interpeak latency I-V of brainstem evoked potentials, distribution of cerebral blood flow in the internal frontal left region). At the individual level, these examinations were not of diagnostic value because sensitivity was low...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intracranial dermoid cysts are uncommon, {{and their}} {{clinical}} features {{as well as}} surgical management differ from patient to patient. Dermoids are generally benign lesions, but may cause spontaneous complications such as meningitis and/or hydrocephalus due to rupture and epileptic seizures depending on their location. Little has been reported about characteristic imaging findings with resulting therapeutic considerations, {{and only a few}} reports exist about associated hydrocephalus. Imaging modalities have changed and can facilitate differential diagnosis and follow-up if applied correctly. In this paper, we attempt to contribute our clinical experience with the management of dermoid cysts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of five men and two women with intracranial dermoid cysts were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were treated between September 1993 and September 2006. Selected patients are presented in detail. RESULTS: Tumour location, size and radiographic characteristics varied in each patient. Clinical presentations comprised focal neurological deficits as well as epileptic seizures, persistent headache, mental changes and <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndromes.</b> One patient underwent delayed ventriculo-peritoneal shunting after ruptured fatty particles caused obstructive hydrocephalus. Despite dermoid rupture into the subarachnoid space, three patients never developed hydrocephalus. Diffuse vascular supra-tentorial lesions were seen in one patient as a result of aseptic meningitis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity in dermoids is related to decrease of water proton diffusion and should be used for both the diagnosis and follow-up of this lesion. CONCLUSION: Although dermoid cysts are known to be benign entities per se, their rupture can cause a wide range of symptoms including aseptic meningitis and/or hydrocephalus. This may be due to intraventricular obstruction and/or paraventricular compression. While rupture does not necessarily bring about hydrocephalus, radical removal of the tumour and close monitoring of ventricular size is required. Although not widely recognised as such, DWI {{is considered to be a}} useful imaging modality in the diagnosis and follow-up of dermoids...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical characteristics of trichlorethylene are discussed together with its uses in industry and medical practice. Chemical and physical methods of the estimation of trichlorethylene in air have been described, {{including the use of}} gas detector tubes, which today is the method most commonly employed. The metabolism of trichlorethylene was systematically investigated by Butler (1948), who in animals established the identity of the main metabolites appearing in the urine, Powell (I 945 a, b) having also done this in human subjects. The excretion of these metabolites has since been repeatedly investigated, but the intermediate breakdown products within the body as well as the organ mainly responsible still remain uncertain. The acute toxicity of trichlorethylene, manifested preponderantly by central nervous system effects, came to be recognized during the second decade of this century, not long after its introduction as a substitute for benzol as a degreasant in Germany during the First World War. The recognition of a possible chronic toxic effect, characterized by a mild <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> came much later and is still not universally accepted. Damage to the trigeminal nerve after closed-circuit trichlorethylene anaesthesia was observed soon after its introduction as a general anaesthetic 30 to 40 years ago, and it was shown to be due to break...|$|E
40|$|Three {{hundred and}} nine men with organic dementia, {{cerebral}} atrophy, or <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome</b> admitted for five nights {{or more to}} one of 18 Quebec hospitals were individually matched with patients admitted (1) with some other psychiatric diagnosis and (2) to a general hospital. Lifetime occupational histories were obtained by telephone. Occupational exposure to solvents was assessed blind to type of case by (1) individual ratings and (2) a job exposure matrix; men who worked in moderate or high solvent concentrations for at least 10 years were considered exposed. With the psychiatric referent series, an odds ratio of 1. 4 (90 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 0) was calculated by individual exposure ratings and 1. 4 (90 % CI 0. 9 - 2. 2) by job matrix. Increased risk was mainly in those with organic dementia or cerebral atrophy and an alcohol related diagnosis. The same pattern of risk was found against the general hospital referents. Adjustment for possible confounders did not alter the risk estimates appreciably. Also, lifetime job histories, compared in selected case-referent pairs, gave similar evidence of increased risk (odds ratio 2. 3; 90 % CI 1. 0 - 5. 5). It is concluded that the combined effect of occupational solvent exposure and alcohol intake is probably an important cause of organic brain damage...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAVI) is an established therapy option for high risk patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. The peripheral arterial (Femoral or Subclavien) and the minimal invasive surgical access via Apex are the standard access routes. Out come and prognosis of TAVI {{is determined by}} the peripheral vessel complications, strokes, paravalvular leak and apical cardiac infarction. The direct aortic (DA) approaches is a new alternative for the minimal invasive surgical TAVI access. We report our experience and discuss the different aspects this technique. MethodsBetween September 2011 and August 2012 we performed in 50 patients DA-TAVI via partial upper sternotomy with the self expanding Medtronic CorValve bioprothesis. From the tenth patient DA was the primary access route for TAVI. The Procedure is done in general anesthesia and performed by an interventional heart team in the operating room (OR). The fast-track anesthesia with immediate extubation after the procedure in the OR was established after the tenth patient. ResultsThe mean patients age was 78 ± 5, 2 years and 52 % were male. The mean logistic EuroSCORE were 20, 3 ± 10, 8. Coronary artery disease were documented in 30 (60 %) patients, including eight re-do procedures. In 15 (30 %) cases were severe peripheral vasculopathy the main indication for DA access. Procedural success was 100 %. Mean aortic gradient dropped immediately under 5 mm Hg, end diastolic left ventricle pressure improved on average by 30 % in all patients and there was no vascular complications. Stroke occurred in one patient. 5 patients had, during the first days after the procedure, a <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> where a stroke was excluded. The post-operative echocardiogram demonstrated in 45 (90 %) patients non to trace, in 4 (8 %) patients mild and in 1 (2 %) patient moderate aortic regurgitation. ConclusionDirect aortic access for TAVI is a surgical simple, flexible and safe approach to treat high risk patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis and might enrich the surgical TAVI access with a new promising approach...|$|E
40|$|Neurofibromatosis- 1 (NF 1) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{hereditary}} multisystemic disorders. The disease manifests a variety of characteristic features that include: hyperpigmentary abnormalities of the skin (café-au-lait macules, freckles in the axillae, and iris Lisch nodules) and growth of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas) in the skin. Associated extracutaneous clinical features include: skeletal abnormalities, neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine and other malformations. NF 1 is caused by mutation in the neurofibromatosis- 1 gene, which codes for the protein neurofibromin. The inheritance of NF 1 follows an autosomal dominant trait, although about 50 % of patients present with new („de novo“) mutations, and represent the first member of their family. No difference in the severity of the disease can be found in patients with familial mutations versus those with new mutations. We present a 78 -year-old female patient with an extreme cutaneous form of neurofibromatosis who reported no affected family member. Apart from skin problems, she had no major health issues in childhood and adolescence, but in recent decades she had frequent headaches, occasional abdominal pain, and vision and hearing impairment. About 10 to 14 days before admission, she developed a severe cough, shortness of breath, and chest and abdominal pain. On examination, the patient of short stature (hight: 152 cm, weight: 49 kg) presented with thousands of soft nodules dispersed over the whole body, except on extensor sides of thighs and lower legs; the nodules varied in color from skin-colored, livid erythematous, to brown-grey; the nodules on the abdomen were moist, partly bleeding from the base, and accompanied by an unpleasant odor. Her feet were also densely covered by dark purple lumps, with dystrophic changes of the toe nails that were thickened, frayed, and yellowish. The skeletal abnormalities included: short stature, severe osteoporosis and osteosclerosis of the head bone structure; degenerative arthropathc-spondylotic changes of the thoracolumbar spine segment with signs of diffuse skeletal hyperostosis; pronounced degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. CT scans of the head, chest and abdomen showed the following abnormalities: flattening of the paraventricular gyri and reduction of brain parenchyma with hypodensity of the white matter in terms of cortical atrophy; periventricular bilateral small post-ischemic microvascular brain lesions of varying chronicity; in the parenchyma of the upper left lung lobe the apical presence of small areas of pleural effusion with consequent subatelectic region; distended stomach and a small inner wall herniation; hypotrophic right kidney; atherosclerotic lesions of the abdominal aorta; low grade infrarenal kinking of the abdominal aorta. Pathohistological analysis of biopsy specimen taken from the nodule corresponded with cutaneous neurofibroma. Consultative examinations of various specialists pointed to the existence of the following comorbidities: obstructive respiratory syndrome and right lobe pneumonia that were treated by antibiotics, aminophylline and dexamethasone infusions; <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome</b> without focal neurological deficit; Lisch nodules in each eye, and senile cataract. Considering the age and medical presentation of the patient, no other treatment was considered. In conclusion, this is a sporadic case of cutaneous neurofibromatosis 1 in a 78 -year-old female patient who presented with extremely severe cutaneous neurofibromas, making this case at least rather peculiar...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionAll handling, {{physical}} and mechanical methods {{applied to the}} patient {{in order to reduce}} his freedom of movement or access to his own body, was defined as physical restraints by Health Care Financing Administration in 1992 (Weick, 1992). This could range from isolation of the patient in an enclosed space, the so-called seclusion room (not in use in Italy), to immobilization of the patient by the staff physically restraining him or applying mechanical restraints, such as handcuffs or cotton or leather ties. According to the literature, the aim of physical restraint should be limited to self-injuring behaviour, to prevention of violent behaviour directed at others and to promoting control of symptoms such as anxiety, delusion, aggressiveness (Fisher, 1994; Gutheil, 1987). This procedure is widely accepted when all therapeutic restrictive measures for the patient who is a danger to himself or others have failed (Kallert, 2008). The frequency of physical restraint in acute psychiatric wards is not similar among the Western Countries according to the different culture and organization of Mental Health Service (Steinert et al., 2009). There is a total lack of controlled trials about the beneficial effects of coercive measures in patients with violent behaviour, since this clinical practice procedure has not been investigated by means of well-designed randomized studies, (Jarrett, Bowers, & Simpson, 2008; Murilidharan, & Fenton, 2006), as evidenced by Cochrane’s systematic review of Sailas and Fenton (2000). The aim of this work is to analyze the use of physical restraint in an acute psychiatric unit during a period of 5 years, in order to evidence the variables of patients, staff and ward related to this procedure. MethodsThe ward and procedure of physical restraints The SPDC 1 (Servizio Psichiatrico di Diagnosi e Cura 1) is a 15 -inbed public acute psychiatric ward, located inside a General Hospital in Modena, which receives all patients from Modena and Castelfranco Emilia (population 250, 000) affected by acute psychiatric diseases, compulsory or voluntary admitted (according to the “ 180 ” Italian Law). In our ward, physical restraint consists of immobilizing the patient in bed (never in face-down position) through handcuffs, leg ties and vest, applied according to hospital procedure: 1. this procedure could be prescribed only by a physician when other control measures had failed, after evaluation of the patient’s capacity to give his consent to treatment; 2. all staff had to focus attention on patient and staff safety, nurses had to continuously monitor the restrained patient and the physician had to re-evaluate every half hour the necessity for containment; 3. all above instructions and interventions had to be registered in the nurse restraint form and medical charts with the signature of each staff member, 4. during restraint, the necessary pharmacologic therapy and/or psychological support were prescribed with the aim to resolve the condition that had necessitated this procedure. The sample The sample was composed of all restrained patients admitted to SPDC 1 of Modena from 1 - 1 - 2005 to 31 - 12 - 2009 (n= 342). The variables The following variables, divided by year, were collected from medical charts and nurse restraint questionnaires and were relative to: 1) restrained patients -age, gender, nationality; 2) admissions with physical restraint -diagnosis according to the Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria, -voluntary state admission, with normal or altered state of consciousness due to intoxication or <b>psycho-organic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> or compulsory state admission, according to Italian Law “ 180 ”; 3) physical restraints-clinical motivations for restraints, divided into the following categories, according to the most frequent reasons registered in our ward and the literature indications (Kaltila-Heino et al., 2003) : A) control of dangerous, violent or aggressive behaviour, B) prevention of damages or necessity of urgent therapy;-time of restraints in comparison to the hospitalization day and to the three nursing shifts (Morning, from h 7 to h 13; Afternoon, from h 13 to h 20; Night, from h 20 to h 7) -duration of restraints-use of concomitant therapy-number of all admitted patients at the time of restraint use. We statistically analyzed the relationship between restraints and other variables; patients, admissions and staff. The following variables relative to restraints were statistically correlated: the motivations, the diagnosis, the state of admission and the day of hospitalization, the time of day (Chi square and Fisher tests) (Siegel, & Castellan, 1988). For the whole period, the number of physical restraints was statistically correlated to the number of all admitted patients at the moment this procedure was applied (Pearson correlation) (Armitage, & Berry, 1996). In order to describe the strength of association or non-indipendence of the variables above descripted with restraints, we measured the odds ratio (Mosteller, 1968) between restraint motivations (A: control of dangerous, violent or aggressive behaviour, B: prevention of damages or necessity of urgent therapy), restrained patient variables (age, gender, nationality), restraint procedure variables (time of restraints in comparison to the hospitalization day and to the three nursing shifts, duration of restraints, use of concomitant therapy) and state of admission (voluntary or compulsory). The data was processed by the SAS System Program. ResultsThe frequency of restrained patients was similar across the 5 - year period but frequency of restrained male (p= 0. 045) and foreigner (p 4 hours) than during other nurse shifts(Chi square test, p 1 : young age (< 30 years old), male gender, compulsory admission, normal state of consciousness, morning shift, early time of admission (< 2 days), concomitant therapy, short duration (< 1. 5 h). Finally, this procedure was not influenced by ward overcrowding, because the number of inpatients admitted did not influenced the number of restraints. Discussion and Conclusions The data of our 5 -year analysis overlap those in the literature: physical restraint was most frequently applied in order to control the aggressive behaviour of psychotic patients (Monahan, 2003; Flannery, Rachlin, & Walker, 2002; Steinert, 2002; Winstanley, & Whittington, 2002; Nijman, 2002; Mignon et al., 2008). In our ward, physical restraint represented an usual tool of facing extreme clinical situations because its frequency and modality of applying was similar across the 5 years of observation, although it was adopted in acute situations. In fact, it was more frequently applied during the first days following admission with principle aim of controlling extreme situations of aggressive or dangerous behaviour in seriously ill patients. In our study, patients affected by “Schizophrenia and other Psychotic Disorders” and “Substance Abuse or Dependence and Substance induced Psychosis Disorders” were more frequently restrained than others in order to control aggressive behaviour. This data, similar to data found in the literature, indirectly shows that paranoid delusions or excited mood are the most frequent clinical situations which induce behaviour so dangerous that mechanical containment could often be required in order to avoid harmful conditions for others or the patient himself (Mignon, 2008). During the first days after admission, “the necessity of controlling an aggressive behaviour” was the prevalent reason for restraining, probably because the aggressiveness itself, which characterizes a wide range of psychiatric disorders, represented the prevalent reason for admission. During night shifts, physical restraints were more frequently applied in order to contain aggressive behaviour, the prevalent reason for restraint use during this period...|$|E
