Three sward heights were evaluated {{in the beginning of}} the period of deferment: lower (20 cm), medium (30 cm) and higher (40 cm). The experimental design was of completely randomized blocks with three replications. The Piata palisade grass deferred with low initial height presented lower leaf area index, lower light interception and higher leaf angle in relation to the ones deferred with medium and high heights. The advance in the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>deferment</b> increased the leaf area index and the light interception by the sward, in a way that the highest values were recorded in the periods from 91 and 120 days.

40|$|Spraying {{with the}} {{chemical}} herbicide 2, 4 -D {{is the most}} widely used method of controlling big sagebrush. Spraying is very effective in increasing forage production and generally is not poisonous to either man or animals. Two procedures can be used to calculate the internal rate of return to big sagebrush control: standard and modified discounting. Standard discounting assumes all nonuse costs are incurred in the year of treatment, and the annual income stream is constant throughout the effective life of treatment. Modified discounting correctly assumes the nonuse cost is incurred in the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>deferment,</b> and the income stream does not reach its full potential until after deferment. Thus, modified discounting yields a lower internal rate of return. Three big sagebrush control methods (spraying, burning, and chaining) offer internal rates of return which are greater than 8 percent (cost of obtaining capital for range improvement). The most important factors in determining the internal rate of return are the site vigor index and the amount of forage present before treatment. A larger pre-treatment forage yield will give a larger internal rate of return, assuming the vigor index is sufficiently high. If state and private rangelands infested with big sagebrush are not improved by spraying or other big sagebrush control methods, certain benefits, called opportunity costs, will be foregone. For spraying alone, the expected annual opportunity costs would be $ 3, 048, 102. The economic feasibility of controlling nearly 2 1 / 2 million acres of state and private rangelands infested with big sagebrush are excellent. The expected annual increase in carrying capacity of 1, 830, 000 acres of sagebrush rangeland meriting improvement by spraying is 765, 855 AUMs. The remaining 623, 000 acres meriting control other than by spraying could possibly increase the total number of additional AUMs to over 1 million...|$|E
40|$|VULNERABLE CONSUMERS MUST BE PROTECTED FROM UNSCRUPULOUS BOOK UP OPERATORS While {{acknowledged}} {{as a necessary}} service with numerous benefits, particularly for those living in regional and remote areas, 2 ̆ 7 book up 2 ̆ 7 (an informal credit provision offered by stores or other traders to Indigenous customers) continues to fall through the gap in terms of legislative regulation against unscrupulous practices. In the latest edition of the Indigenous Law Bulletin, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s* (ASIC) Nathan Boyle reports {{on the findings of}} book up research recently undertaken for ASIC by Dr Heron Loban of Griffith University, and the subsequent ASIC report, ‘Book up in Indigenous communities in Australia: A national overview’. The research findings reveal some concerning practices, including: 	operators retaining customers’ debit cards and PINs, and withdrawing funds at their discretion; 	the failure to agree on terms and provide documentation upon provision of the service to a customer; 	unauthorised use of a book up accounts by account holders’ family members; and 	creating dependency on the book up system by allowing customers to accrue high debt levels. Boyle, an analyst for ASIC’s Indigenous Outreach Program, {{is quick to point out}} that this report is not the first to highlight unscrupulous practices of some book up operators. And while book up operation is regulated by both the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth), in practical terms neither instrument is effectively preventing the unscrupulous conduct, reported above, which affects the most vulnerable consumers. One of the reasons for this is that the great variance between different providers’ operations means that book up won’t always be captured by the National Credit Act’s prescriptive definition of ‘credit activities’, which, for example, requires a 62 -day <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>deferment</b> of debt, and fees and charges exceeding 5 per cent of credit provided. Even when a particular operator’s book up provision is captured by the Act, the absence of record-keeping requirements for book up operators means that where unscrupulous conduct is alleged, a lack of records often means proving that the credit activity in question satisfies the National Credit Act’s definition of a credit product is difficult. Regulation through the ASIC Act is also problematic, as the unconscionable conduct provisions of that Act are subjective and require a court’s determination, which has led to various state and federal courts arriving at different interpretations, making it, as Boyle states, ‘almost impossible to predict with any confidence the prospects of success in a matter being run purely on the basis of alleged unconscionable conduct, meaning law enforcement agencies must consider the expense and resources required to run this type of litigation and weigh this against other regulatory tools (such as informal negotiations) ’. Adding to the disincentive is the fact that not a single instituted proceeding prosecuting unconscionable conduct in book up operation has yet proceeded to a final judgment, though a pending decision in the case of ASIC v Kobelt (SAD 100 / 2014) may soon provide a valuable precedent. ASIC Commissioner Peter Kell said on that matter: ‘In bringing this action before the courts, we hope to make clear the circumstances under which book up can be offered and the legal provisions by which traders must abide. ’ Boyle argues that while there seems to be a strong argument for mandating the way book up services operate, requirements like those already imposed on other financial service providers by the National Credit Act are not the answer, as they would impose onerous obligations which would be impracticable. Rather, Boyle suggests amendment to the ASIC Act setting out minimum documentation requirements and stipulating the maximum amount of indebtedness allowable, with failure to comply attracting an Infringement Notice penalty. Such an approach would allow the continuation of what is a valuable service with numerous benefits, while giving regulators the tools needed to stamp out misconduct and to ensure the most vulnerable consumers are adequately protected.  ...|$|E
