The resulting speed difference between mainshaft and reverse idler gear produces gear noise grinding.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, wear of {{reinforced}} poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) polymer bushes in friction against 7075 {{aluminium alloy}} <b>cam</b> <b>plates</b> or titanium crankshafts is investigated {{in order to}} establish the application possibilities in transmission parts in humanoid robot joints under high load torque. The PEEK bush wear requires close examination as well as the input axis-output axis transmission error (backlash). Sliding wear tests were performed on bushes under 4000 kgfcm (392 Nm) load torque, while the <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> oscillated in the humanoid robot leg joint evaluation system. The robot joint using PEEK bush achieved quite small backlash after the fatigue wear test...|$|R
5000|$|The VTM-4 system's {{electronic}} control unit (ECU) determines torque {{which is to be}} distributed to the rear wheels, then electric current is sent to the two electromagnetic coils. The resulting magnetic field moves a rotating steel plate toward each fixed coil. Friction between that steel plate and an adjoining <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> causes the <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> to begin turning. As it does, three balls per clutch roll up curved ramps, creating an axial thrust against a clutch-engagement plate. This thrust force compresses the wet clutch plates, thereby engaging drive to the corresponding rear wheel. [...] Unlike mechanically actuated four-wheel drive systems, the VTM-4 system is infinitely variable. The amount of torque provided to the rear wheels is directly proportional to the electric current sent from the ECU and can be adjusted from zero to a preset maximum. This current constantly changes to deliver the optimum rear torque calculated by the ECU. An internal gear pump circulates VTM-4 fluid to cool and lubricate the clutches, bearings, and gears within the rear drive unit. Use of high-strength, low-weight materials such as diecast aluminum for the housing minimizes the bulk and weight of this hardware, helping to keep the weight of the entire all-wheel-drive system to about 212-pounds.|$|R

As all Mitchell cameras incorporate the provision for a [...] "hard mask" [...] within the movement itself, it is often possible to keep the 4-perf aperture plate, and insert a 2-perf mask in the mask slot, as an economy measure.|$|R

50|$|For use on {{cars and}} light trucks, the rotary pump or {{distributor}} pump was developed. It uses a single injection cylinder driven from an axial <b>cam</b> <b>plate,</b> which injects into the individual fuel lines via a rotary distribution valve. Later incarnations {{such as the}} Bosch VE pump vary the injection timing with crankshaft speed to allow greater power at high crank speeds, and smoother, more economical running at slower revolution of crankshaft. Some VE variants have a pressure-based system that allows the injection volume to increase over normal to allow a turbocharger or supercharger equipped engine to develop more power under boost conditions.|$|R

50|$|The {{parking pawl}} locks the {{transmission}}'s output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} parking pawl mechanism are the parking gear, parking pawl, actuator rod, <b>cam</b> collar, <b>cam</b> <b>plate,</b> pivot pin and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are {{put in place to}} avoid this condition and engage the pawl only when the vehicle has come to a stand still.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used cam is the <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> (also known as disc cam or radial cam)which is cut out {{of a piece of}} flat metal or plate. Here, the follower moves in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the camshaft. Several key terms are relevant in such a construction of plate cams: base circle, prime circle (with radius equal to the sum of the follower radius and the base circle radius), pitch curve which is the radial curve traced out by applying the radial displacements away from the prime circle across all angles, and the lobe separation angle (LSA - the angle between two adjacent intake and exhaust cam lobes).|$|R
50|$|The hammer {{action is}} {{provided}} by two <b>cam</b> <b>plates</b> that make the chuck rapidly pulse forward and backward as the drill spins on its axis. This pulsing (hammering) action is measured in Blows Per Minute (BPM) with 10,000 or more BPMs being common. Because the combined mass of the chuck and bit is {{comparable to that of}} the body of the drill, the energy transfer is inefficient and can sometimes make it difficult for larger bits to penetrate harder materials such as poured concrete. The operator experiences considerable vibration, and the cams are generally made from hardened steel to avoid them wearing out quickly. In practice, drills are restricted to standard masonry bits up to 13 mm (1/2 inch) in diameter. A typical application for a hammer drill is installing electrical boxes, conduit straps or shelves in concrete.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} Elan and Lotus Cortina customers {{who wanted a}} higher performance engine, Lotus sold cars with optional Special Equipment engines, and Lotus Components Ltd sold the parts used in these engines. At first, these were Cosworth developed and assembled engines with cast cranks and Cosworth name <b>plates</b> on the <b>cam</b> cover. However, Cosworth soon distanced themselves from this business, and Lotus started selling 'BRM' equivalents. BRM Phase I consisted of BRM camshafts and high compression cast pistons, and BRM Phase II added Mahle forged pistons, BRM forged conrods, small-end bushes and big-end bolts to the Phase I. When offered in assembled form, these engines carried a BRM name plate on a specially cast 'BRM' cam cover, but the actual assembly of these high performance 'BRM' road engines {{was carried out by}} Rubery Owen & Co. Ltd., an affiliated company of BRM through its ownership, not by BRM itself.|$|R

The machine gun uses a mixed recoil-operated locking {{system with a}} hinged bolt that is patterned after the lever-action Peabody Martini breechblock. The recoil operation is part short and part long recoil. After firing a round to start the open bolt firing cycle, the initial recoil impulse drives the barrel, barrel extension, and bolt to the rear. A pin {{on the right side}} of the bolt moves backward in grooves in an operating <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> mounted to the right side of the receiver. After 12.7 mm of travel, the bolt is cammed upward, away from the breech (the [...] "short" [...] portion of the recoil system). The barrel and barrel extension continue to move rearward to a point slightly exceeding the combined overall length of the cartridge case and projectile (the long portion of the recoil system, responsible for the weapon's low rate of fire).|$|R

40|$|Cam {{mechanisms}} {{are widely used}} in industry, in applications requiring quick-return and indexing motions. A current research effort at the Robotic Mechanical Systems Laboratory of McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines aims at the application of cam mechanisms as speed reducers. The accuracy required in these mechanisms is of the utmost importance, especially when cams are rotating at a high speed. In this thesis, the design for manufacturability of planar speed-reduction cam mechanisms is studied. In particular, the thesis focuses on a speed reducer with a rotating follower to couple shafts of parallel axes, termed planar Speed-o-Cam. Principles of the design for manufacturability are applied to Speed-o-Cam and a unified method for obtaining the optimum parameters satisfying the curvature constraints and pressure-angle bounds is developed. These two factors are relatively important because Numerically Controlled and Computer Numerically Controlled machine tools could be very sensitive to changes of curvature of the workpiece, especially when milling complex shapes {{such as those of}} <b>cam</b> <b>plates.</b> Cam-mechanism balancing is also studied because unbalance in a high-speed rotating element can cause severe vibrations and greatly affect the bearings and hence, the performance of the machine. This is done by not only adding counterweights, which unavoidably increase the weight and volume of the mechanism, but also by removing material...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{free piston}} expander-linear {{generator}} (FPE-LG) integrated unit was proposed to recover waste heat efficiently from vehicle engine. This integrated unit {{can be used}} in a small-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system and can directly convert the thermodynamic energy of working fluid into electric energy. The conceptual design of the free piston expander (FPE) was introduced and discussed. A <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> and the corresponding valve train were used to control the inlet and outlet valve timing of the FPE. The working principle of the FPE-LG was proven to be feasible using an air test rig. The indicated efficiency of the FPE was obtained from the p–V indicator diagram. The dynamic characteristics of the in-cylinder flow field during the intake and exhaust processes of the FPE were analyzed based on Fluent software and 3 D numerical simulation models using a computation fluid dynamics method. Results show that the indicated efficiency of the FPE can reach 66. 2 % and the maximal electric power output of the FPE-LG can reach 22. 7 W when the working frequency is 3 Hz and intake pressure is 0. 2 MPa. Two large-scale vortices are formed during the intake process because of the non-uniform distribution of velocity and pressure. The vortex flow will convert pressure energy and kinetic energy into thermodynamic energy for the working fluid, which weakens the power capacity of the working fluid...|$|R
40|$|Cam {{impingement}} {{appears to}} be an important factor in the development of early osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. A Cam is generally diagnosed in young and active adults, already at the age of thirteen. Therefore, {{it has been suggested that}} excessive femoral loading during skeletal development might trigger the abnormal morphology. The goal of this research is to understand how the deformity develops. A finite element analysis is conducted to predict the stress distribution in the immature proximal femur under different loading conditions. Furthermore, the influence of the orientation of the epiphyseal plate is studied, as a Cam-type deformity is highly associated with an abnormal epiphyseal extension on the anterosuperior region. Previous studies suggested that octahedral shear stress promotes growth, while hydrostatic compressive stress inhibits growth. These mechanobiological principals are implemented to predict the bone growth rate. The position and the shape of the growth plate, as well as the loading direction highly influence the stress distribution in the proximal femur and growth plate. A medial directed load causes high compression stress in the growth cartilage in the lateral region. Endochondral growth is inhibited, which could result in a deflection of the growth <b>plate,</b> observed in <b>Cam</b> patients as epiphyseal extension. High regional stresses and osteogenic index appear in the epiphysis at the anterosuperior region when a convex growth plate is modeled. These results would support the theory that a Cam-type deformity might not be a result of endochondral growth, but the higher stresses demand local remodeling and apposition. Incorporating dynamic loading and tissue adaptation is needed to further understand how mechanical stimuli effects the epiphyseal growth and to predict morphological changes over time. Once one understands the etiological factors of cam impingement, the disorder can be treated at an early stage and the development into early osteoarthritis might be prevented.

40|$|Bosch Rexroth in Mellansel {{develops}} and fabricates Hägglunds {{hydraulic motors}} among other things. One {{important component of}} the motor is the cam ring, which commonly affects the life span of the motor. The aim is to create the basis of a testing equipment where a loose cam ring can be tested. Previously, a complete motor has been used in order to test the fatigue resistance of the cam ring. In order to load the cam ring similar to the real case. FEM-analysis was performed to investigate how the cam ring is affected during loading and how the rig should be built for the strains to be similar to the real case. The result of this simulation was compiled in a Haighdiagram in order to get an indication of the magnitude of the stresses. The solution is a testing equipment which consist of a cylinder block which usually is in the motor. The cylinder block is bolted onto a bottom <b>plate</b> where the <b>cam</b> ring has a given position. The cam ring is fixated using a sloted spring pin and a dowel pin that keeps the cam ring in position and prevents potential torque. All pistons should be pressurised by pulsation at the same time using the same pressure, thus, the torque is expected to be zero. One of the holes which is holding the cam ring is oval, this is to allow deformation of the cam ring. The result of this work is a basic plan for the components included which affects the mechanical function of the testing equipment. A limitation of this work has been that the residual stresses in the clearance holes is unknown. These residual stresses have a great importance for fatigue resistance of the cam rings. As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to estimate which working pressure the test rig has to use in order to achieve the desired life span. Experimental testing when using the rig will indicate this. Task monotoring  The testing equipment will generate 1 - 10 million loading cycles before failure of the cam ring occurs. Will be achieved through experimental testing  Testing time should be reasonable, result would preferably be achieved within 2 - 4 weeks.

40|$|Laser cutting {{is one of}} {{the major}} cutting {{processes}} used to manufacture sheet metal products. A typical production process consists of designing parts, nesting the parts on metal sheets, cutting the parts from the sheets and if there are three dimensional parts, bending the parts. Integrated production scheduling methods to minimize the total cost incurred by the entire production process exist. One of the results is the assignment of parts to a metal sheet after which CAM software executes the actual nesting and generates a cutting path. In sheet metal laser cutting, a typical cutting process can take between several minutes to several hours, depending on the number of parts on the plate, the material type, the machine, the process parameters, and the <b>plate</b> thickness. Current <b>CAM</b> software utilizes very simple heuristics to generate these tool paths and as such not all relevant costs and technical constraints are taken into account, such as piercing costs, bridges, pre-cuts, sharp angle costs, skeleton cuts, plate edge and clamp positions, collisions, imposed path patterns, and thermal effects. This PhD research aims at developing fast and effective algorithms for generating tool paths for laser cutting machines taking all technical constraints into account. The tool path problem excluding thermal effects is modeled as a precedence constrained generalized traveling salesman. A tabu search meta-heuristic approach is found to be able to generate fast tool paths in a short amount of computation time for thin metal sheets where piercings can be executed on the fly and thermal effects are negligible. For thicker plates, this approach becomes too computationally expensive and specialized construction heuristics are developed that take advantage of the specific structure of laser cutting tool path problems. A novel tool path representation is developed that recasts the tool path problem in such a way that promising local improvement moves can more easily be identified. Furthermore, this new representation naturally decomposes the problem in two well-studied problems: the generalized traveling salesman problem (GTSP) and the rooted directed minimum spanning tree (RDMST). An improvement heuristic framework that iteratively solves GTSPs and RDMSTs and executes a local search improvement phase is developed and positively evaluated. A Finite Difference Method (FDM) simulation is developed to evaluate the thermal effects during cutting. It is shown that a FDM approach can estimate the thermal effects sufficiently accurate within acceptable calculation times. This FD method is utilized to construct a heat-penalty based multi-start construction heuristic that is able to generate tool paths free from thermal errors. The research further shows that many of the additional technical constraints can be included in the model by a proper preprocessing phase or can effectively be handled by a post optimization phase. nrpages: 198 status: publishe...|$|R
