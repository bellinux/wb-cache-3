Our results suggest that official supervisory <b>power</b> increase <b>bank</b> efficiency, activity restrictions and private monitoring reduce bank efficiency in general, but for banks with more market power these effects are all significantly positive.

Football aficionados among journalists ran the games for the first twenty years as volunteers. Since 2007, the Association staff took over the tournament's official organisation. The Cup carries no cash prizes or anything material other than the trophy. Yet it remains a highlight of the Association, attracting generations of football enthusiasts to give of their best in the game as in their media work. As the tournament became more established, it received increasing support from the community, such as San Miguel, Puma, Cathay Pacific, China Light & <b>Power,</b> <b>Bank</b> of East Asia, etc. in 1980s and 1990s.

40|$|Policy {{makers in}} many {{countries}} earnestly debate the extent of <b>powers</b> that commercial <b>banks</b> should be allowed. By contrast, some economists declare such a debate futile. Commercial banks should be allowed all powers, and competition will ensure they will adopt only those ones that they can perform competently. In other words, they argue, so long as competition is not artificially restricted, efficient institutions will emerge. This paper shows that unrestricted competition does not necessarily lead to efficient institutions if the markets in which institutions compete are not naturally competitive. Therefore, the debate on what <b>powers</b> <b>banks</b> should have is relevant even from an efficiency point of view. More evidence is needed to inform policy makers, especially in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tests for}} the {{existence}} of market <b>power</b> in <b>banking,</b> using data on demand deposit rates of households and corresponding market rates in five euro area countries. An implicit measure for market power is based on a partial adjustment model that also allows for an asymmetric response of deposit rates to changes in market rates. The period covers the ten years since introduction of the euro. The analysis indicates that banks are exercising major market power within the euro area. In addition to general sluggishness, bank deposit rates’ reactions are clearly asymmetric: flexible when market rates are decreasing and rigid when rates are increasing. The degree of asymmetric behaviour can be interpreted as a further indication of the market <b>power</b> <b>banks</b> exercise. Despite country differences, a general pattern of interest rate adjustment in demand deposit pricing is observable. competition; banking industry; retail interest rates...|$|R
