50|$|<b>Palles</b> {{was born}} on Christmas Day 1831 at Mount <b>Palles,</b> near Mountnugent, in south County Cavan, Ireland. He was the third son of Andrew Christopher <b>Palles</b> (1801-1880), a solicitor, and his wife Eleanor Mary <b>Palles</b> (née Plunkett) (1801-1877). Palles's {{ancestors}} (the earliest known version of the surname is de Palatio) were of Italian origin, and came to Ireland in the late fifteenth century in the entourage of their relative Ottaviano Spinelli de Palatio, who was Archbishop of Armagh from 1478 to 1513. <b>Palles</b> was educated at Clongowes Wood College and Trinity College, Dublin, from where he graduated in 1852, having been a non-Foundation Scholar (Catholics were not allowed be full 'Scholars of the House') in Mathematics and Physics. He subsequently attended King's Inns and Gray's Inn in London.|$|R

25|$|Ørsted Pedersen {{also had}} a {{particular}} ability to interpret Danish songs and folk melodies. He often played within trio ensembles, partly collectively with the trumpeter <b>Palle</b> Mikkelborg and the keyboard player Kenneth Knudsen, and partly under his own name, usually with guitarists like Philip Catherine and Ulf Wakenius. In 1999, he co-led a duo with pianist Mulgrew Miller, touring Europe, Japan, Australia, and Korea. This format was later enlarged into a trio featuring drummer, Alvin Queen. This trio remained intact until Pedersen's death.|$|E
25|$|His {{ancestors}} had migrated from Elbing in East Prussia to Norway, first with Tobias Fleischer (1630–1690) who found {{a position in}} Kongsberg. The current lineage is descended from Tobias' nephew Herman Reinhold Fleischer (1656–1712), who also had notable children in Denmark. Carl Gustav Fleischer was a descendant of Herman's son Philip Johan Fleischer (1699–1763). Notable relatives include Philip's brother Baltzer Fleischer and grandnephew <b>Palle</b> Rømer Fleischer, and Carl Gustav's brother, bishop Andreas Fleischer. Carl Gustav Fleischer was also a more distant relative of Carl August Fleischer, Nanna Fleischer, Agnes Fleischer and August Fleischer.|$|E

Her earliest comic strips were produced for productions including Lunkentus (Prickinas och Fabians äventyr, 1929), Vårbrodd (Fotbollen som Flög till Himlen, 1930), and Allas Krönika (<b>Palle</b> och Göran gå till sjöss, 1933).|$|E

500|$|After {{years of}} {{discussion}} between Skagen's fishermen and the authorities, a commission was finally {{established in the}} 1880s, leading to an early proposal for a harbour by Customs Inspector Holm that was not accepted. Under pressure from the fishermen, the Minister of the Interior called on an engineer {{by the name of}} Berg to prepare a new proposal in 1888. This finally led to parliamentary approval on 23 April 1903, followed by a call for tenders on 26 January 1904. On the basis of a bid from Gunnarson & Søn og Elzelingen, work was initiated [...] in February 1904 on Skagen's Sønderstand (south shore) just outside the town.

2500|$|The {{first record}} of a church in Hadlow was in 975. This church would {{probably}} have been a wooden building. In 1018, the early church was replaced by a building of stone. In the 12th century, the church was rebuilt and extended by Richard de Clare, then lord of the Manor of Hadlow. De Clare granted the church to the Knights Hospitallers in 1166. The Knights Hospitallers later had a preceptory at nearby West Peckham, which was their local administrative base. From the Norman Conquest until the 18th century, Hadlow did not have a resident Lord of the Manor, being held under Tonbridge Castle. It is thought that the tower was raised and the spire added in the 15th century. Little money was spent on the maintenance of the church, although some 15th- and 16th-century bequests are recorded. Thomas Walter, Yeoman bequeathed 20s in 1448 [...] "To make a window {{on the north side of}} the church by the altar of Our Lady". John Tatlyngbery bequeathed 10 marks [...] "For repair of the great door of the church". In 1456, Richard Bealde bequeathed 13s 4d [...] "For repair of the tower of Hadlow church". In 1461, Dionysia Ippenbury left 3d for masses to be said each year for 12 years. In 1465, William <b>Palle,</b> yeoman left a cow to the church. It was to be sold and [...] "the profits therefrom to be devoted to the maintenance of a lamp in the chancel". In 1509, Thomas Fisher, yeoman bequeathed £20 [...] "for making a new rood loft". The rood screen may not have been in existence long, although it was mentioned in bequests dated 1510 and 1513. The church remained under the ownership of the Knights Hospitallers until 1540, when the order was dissolved by Henry VIII. In 1533, Henry Fane left two chalices valued at £4.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Palles</b> married Ellen Doyle in a Catholic {{ceremony}} in Dublin in 1862 {{and they had}} one son, also named Christopher (1863-1953). The family lived in Mountjoy Square in Dublin, then moved out to Mountanville in Clonskeagh to a site subsequently named [...] "Knockrabo", where they cultivated a peach orchard, and to Fitzwilliam Place where a town-brick neo-gothic oratory was added (and can still be seen from Leeson Street). Palles's family life was not altogether happy: his wife's health was never good, and their son, as his father's will shows, needed special care throughout his very long life. Ellen <b>Palles</b> died in 1887.|$|R
