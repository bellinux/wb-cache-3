40|$|That {{historical}} inequality {{can affect}} long run macroeconomic performance {{has been argued}} by a large literature using models of indivisibilities in occupational choice, combined with credit constraints. Most of these models are characterized by a continuum of steady states, and absence of mobility in any steady state. We augment such a model with heterogeneity in agents ’ abilities in order to generate the possibility of occupational mobility in steady state. Traditional results concerning steady state multiplicity and history dependence are then considerably weakened. We provide a class of conditions under {{which there is a}} unique steady state with mobility. In general such steady states are (generically) locally unique and finite in number, implying that small temporary shocks to steady states do not have <b>permanent</b> <b>macro</b> effects. A ‘little ’ bit of heterogeneity may also cause competitive equilibrium dynamics to fail to converge. ...|$|E
