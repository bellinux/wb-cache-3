40|$|Schegloff {{described}} utterances such as “lemme ask you {{a question}} ” as pre-questions, pre-pre’s or pre-delicates (Schegloff 1980). This paper provides a discussion of similar utterances in a specific institutional setting- political radio <b>phone-in</b> <b>programs</b> in Israel. The participants use these utterances in ways that are similar to Schegloff's description. Yet, the pre-construction has additional institutional functions for the differing roles of the host and the caller. Hosts use these utterances to manage the interaction during overlaps as a means to secure an exclusive turn of talk following them. Callers use them infrequently {{at the beginning of their}} talk as story-prompts. Hosts may challenge this usage and the interactional role reversal. Regular callers can use the pre-constructions similarly to hosts. In this way, the pre-constructions in the Israeli radio <b>phone-in</b> <b>programs</b> are employed as interactional practices that relate and construct the roles in this institutional setting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The law of {{unintended}} consequences, often cited but rarely defined, is that actions {{of people and}} especially of government always have effects that are unanticipated or "unintended. " Economists and other social scientists have heeded its power for centuries; for just as long, politicians and popular opinion have largely ignored it (Norton Rob 2002). The thesis explores {{changes that have occurred}} in radio broadcasting in Uganda over the last almost ten years. From half a century dominated by a single state owned and controlled radio, Uganda now has one of the biggest numbers of private commercial radio stations in Africa. Though the liberalized broadcast media was and remains part of the wider government austerity measures to address economic problems, it has had far-reaching social and political consequences. Liberalization demands the institutionalisation and respect for individual rights to property, equality of all citizens, fairness of the law and a regime of freedoms of movement, association and expression. These rights and freedoms are inspiring not only to business entrepreneurs but also to politicians and civil society organizations as well. Therefore, by liberalizing the economy, in 1989, the Uganda government opened a pressure valve for wider social political changes that can lead to democratisation. This central argument in this thesis is that the liberalization of the broadcast media in particular has {{a significant impact on the}} democratisation process in the country. Given the country s limited literacy rate and the historic role of radio in Uganda as the source of all major official information, private commercial radio occupies a central role in the process of mobilizing and debating the future. The spread of private commercial radio across the entire country may have been spanned by economic and ethnic considerations but it has opened up the countryside, improving communication between citizens, improving the speed and volume of information available to ordinary people and giving them an opportunity to participate in the exchange of ideas. This thesis argues that live <b>phone-in</b> <b>programs</b> on private commercial radio are an important tool of democracy. It is through these programs that politicians and those entrusted with authority are interrogated. Private individuals and journalists join in the debate, demanding answers to questions that affect society. This phenomenon, hitherto unknown in Uganda is the source of anticipation and optimism about the strength and future of the country s democracy, with private commercial radio as the arena for the public sphere...|$|R
