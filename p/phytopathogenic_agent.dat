40|$|Bacteria of {{the genus}} Streptomyces are soil {{microorganisms}} with a saprophytic life cycle. Previous studies have revealed that the <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agent</b> S. scabiei undergoes metabolic and morphological modifications {{in the presence of}} suberin, a complex plant polymer. This paper investigates morphological changes induced by the presence of potato suberin in five species {{of the genus}} Streptomyces, with emphasis on S. scabiei. Streptomyces scabiei, S. acidiscabies, S. avermitilis, S. coelicolor and S. melanosporofaciens were grown both in the presence and absence of suberin. In all species tested, the presence of the plant polymer induced the production of aerial hyphae and enhanced resistance to mechanical lysis. The presence of suberin in liquid minimal medium also induced the synthesis of typical secondary metabolites in S. scabiei and S. acidiscabies (thaxtomin A), S. coelicolor (actinorhodin) and S. melanosporofaciens (geldanamycin). In S. scabiei, the presence of suberin modified the fatty acid composition of the bacterial membrane, which translated into higher membrane fluidity. Moreover, suberin also induced thickening of the bacterial cell wall. The present data indicate that suberin hastens cellular differentiation and triggers the onset of secondary metabolism in the genus Streptomyces...|$|E
40|$|Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici is the <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agent</b> of take-all, {{a severe}} root disease of wheat and barley. It {{is a member}} of the Gaeumannomyces-Phialophora complex of closely related homothallic, {{filamentous}} ascomycetes that are differentiated by pathogenicity and the ability to undergo meiosis. The population of Gaeumannomyces and Phialophora in native grasslands and take-all decline soils, where disease severity is absent or depressed, is characterized by darkly pigmented isolates. The parameters dictating this population dynamic have not been identified and there is no established relationship between fungal pigmentation and fungal virulence. The spontaneous melanin variants of a virulent Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici isolate demonstrated Phialophora-like characteristics, loss of virulence and the progressive loss of the ability to undergo meiosis. G. graminis var. tritici effects penetration of intact host tissue by enzymatic means requiring the secretion of lytic enzymes for the extracellular degradation of macromolecules. The relationship between the secretion of fungal proteins [cellulases, pectinases, proteinases (plant-cell-wall degrading enzymes) and a polyphenol oxidase] and the melanin variant phenotype (enhanced pigmentation) was assessed in the wild-type, two spontaneous melanin variants, and two meiotically derived white-derivatives of the melanin variants.

To test the effectiveness of the ethanol extract of pomegranate peel (EEPP), three parameters were studied: the mycelial growth, inhibition rate and sporulation. It is thus that the strain of Fusarium oxysporum lycopersici f. sp. Radicis was more resistant to 5 % EEPP with mycelial growth of 9 mm and an inhibition rate of 75. 67 %, compared to those of Ascocyhta rabiei (pass).

40|$|The {{fast and}} {{unambiguous}} identification of microbial pathogens affecting plants or plant products {{is an essential}} prerequisite for obtaining high-quality and safe production. Ecologically friendly practice of the modern agriculture requires the adoption of diagnostic techniques able to detect minimum inoculum levels of pathogens in soil, seeds, transplants or crops, to limit the raise of epidemics and to address the adoption of rational and efficient control means. Moreover, there is an increasing public and official awareness of the potential threat of bio-terrorism directed against food and agriculture (Monke, 2004). Rapid detection techniques for bioweapon agents are a critical need for the first-responder community. Among the nucleic acid-based diagnostic techniques, those involving the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR; Mullis and Faloona, 1987) are the most suited for early detection of <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agents,</b> due to their high sensitivity {{and the potential for}} automation. Many sequence source types could be selected and used as target for specific primer design. These may include, for instance, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (Williams et al., 1990; Welsh and McClelland, 1990), internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the ribosomal RNA genes (White et al., 1990) or other specific gene sequences. Primer sets can be designed to target specificity at the genus, species, or physiological race level, to distinguish a particular pathogen from closely related organisms. A common and tedious task for researchers and technicians is to search for and retrieve bibliographic references of published and validated specific primer sets for a given pathogen querying the Internet, abstract collections and monthly journals’ tables of contents. Very few examples of specific primer set collections for <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agents</b> have been released: a summary of primers for the diagnostic characterization of phytopathogenic bacteria seems to be the only one printed so far (Louws et al., 1999). Moreover, among 719 molecular biology databases publicly available recorded by Galperin (2006) or among the 2470 BMC biomedical databases catalog available at [URL] no online repository of primer sets of this kind is accessible. To overcome this lack of information, we released the first online searchable database of primer sets useful for the detection and identification of plant pathogenic fungi...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation ponds may act as {{a source}} of phytopathogenic species that might infest crops through the {{irrigation}} systems. Many studies have shown that submerged macrophytes can improve water clarity by out-competing phytoplankton by means of various mechanisms: favoured phytoplankton- grazing zooplankton, reduced nutrient and light availability, increased sinking losses and the release of allelopathically active substances. However, less information is available on the effects of submerged macrophytes on heterotrophic aquatic organisms such as pathogenic bacteria, fungi or oomycete species. This paper studies the effects of three submerged macrophytes—Chara fragilis, Potamogeton pectinatus and Najas marina—on the viability in water of propagules of two phytopathogenic isolates of the oomycetes Pythium aphanidermatum and Pythium ultimum. Moreover, we tested general antimicrobial properties (against bacteria and fungi in water) for these macrophytes. The results showed clear inhibitory effects of all three macrophytes on bacterial density in water and of C. fragilis on the viability of Pythium. Thus, preserving aquatic vegetation in irrigation ponds (i. e. charophytes), besides its purely environmental interest, may have important agronomic benefits owing to their role as biological control against some <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceMicrobial {{symbiosis}} is a ubiquitous {{aspect of}} life and was a major element {{in the ability of}} insects to explore several adverse environments. To date, the study of symbiosis in insects has been impaired by the unculturability of most symbionts. However, molecular methods have demonstrated to be powerful tools to understand insect-microorganism associations and to disclose new symbiont-host systems. Beyond playing an essential role in nutrition and development of the insects, symbionts can produce bioactive compounds that protect the host against adverse environmental conditions, predators and/or direct competitors. Since the search for natural bioactive products and new enzymes is a developing area, understanding the diversity and nature of symbiont-host relationships pave the way for the exploitation of new resources in biotechnology. Furthermore, genetic transformation of the symbionts with genes that code for compounds that are toxic for pathogenic and <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agents</b> is also a promising area of application of the insect-symbiont relationships. The search for new bioactive compounds, the use of symbionts for pest and disease control and the molecular strategies applied for these purposes are issues particularly interesting for innovative biotechnological applications and will be addressed in the present review...|$|R
40|$|AbstractToday, the chitinous wastes {{are used}} by several {{companies}} to produce chitin and chitosan, which are used in various biotechnological applications, particularly in the agricultural sector which is a key sector for sustainable development.

40|$|International {{audience}} Seeds {{are involved}} in the vertical transmission of microorganisms from one plant generation to another and consequently act as reservoirs for the plant microbiota. However, {{little is known about the}} structure of seed-associated microbial assemblages and the regulators of assemblage structure. In this work, we have assessed the response of seed-associated microbial assemblages of Raphanus sativus to invading <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agents,</b> the bacterial strain Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) 8004 and the fungal strain Alternaria brassicicola Abra 43. According to the indicators of bacterial (16 S rRNA gene and gyrB sequences) and fungal (ITS 1) diversity employed in this study, seed transmission of the bacterial strain Xcc 8004 did not change the overall composition of resident microbial assemblages. In contrast seed transmission of Abra 43 strongly modified the richness and structure of fungal assemblages without affecting bacterial assemblages. The sensitivity of seed-associated fungal assemblage to Abra 43 is mostly related to changes in relative abundance of closely related fungal species that belong to the Alternaria genus. Variation in stability of the seed microbiota in response to Xcc and Abra 43 invasions could be explained by differences in seed transmission pathways employed by these micro-organisms, which ultimately results in divergence in spatio-temporal colonization of the seed habitat. </p...|$|R

Five variety of grapevine were studied: Cramposie, Feteasca regala, Muscat Ottonel, Perla de Zala and Italian Riesling. The resistance of the cultivated grapevine varieties against the attack of the main phytopathogenic fungi: Plasmopara viticola, Uncinula necator, Botryotinia fuckeliana, {{in terms of the}} 2011 year, was studied. In order to assess the resistance of the grapevine varieties against the <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agents</b> attack, the frequency, intensity and degree of attack were determined. The most sensitive to the attack of downy mildew on leaves was the Italian Riessling, with a degree of attack of 71. 5 %; and the most resistant variety was Perla de Zala, with a degree of attack of 26 %. The most resistant to the attack of grape powdery mildew on leaves was the Muscat Ottonel variety, with a degree of attack of 8. 1 %; and the most sensitive was the Italian Riesling variety with 18. 1 %. In case of the attack of downy mildew on grapes, the most sensitive was the Italian Riesling variety with a degree of attack of 11. 5 %; and the most resistant was Perla de Zala with 2. 5 %.

40|$|The {{irrigated}} rice production can {{be limited}} by various <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agents,</b> including root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). Thus, {{the aim of this}} research was to check the host suitability of plant species most often found off-season and during rice cultivation, to root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola, under two irrigation managements. Two experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design. In the first experiment seven plant species that occur in an area of rice cultivation, in fallow, off-season were evaluated. For the second experiment nine weed species infesting the irrigated rice culture were tested in rainfed and flooding conditions. The sixteen species, kept individually in pots with sterilized substrate, were inoculated with 5, 000 eggs and second stage juveniles (J 2) of nematode. BRS 410 IRGA rice plants inoculated with M. graminicola were used as control. Two months after inoculation, the root system of each plant was evaluated for number of galls and nematode reproduction factor. It was verified that the species of off-season of rice cultivation Sida rhombifolia, Raphanus raphanistrum, Spergula arvensis, Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens, and, during the cycle of rice cultivation, Aeschynomene denticulata, Leersia hexandra, are immune to nematode. The plant species off-season, Avena strigosa and Lolium multiflorum and of cultivation, Alternanthera philoxeroides, red rice, Echinochloa crusgalli, Cyperus difformis, Cyperus esculentus, Cyperus iria and Fimbristylis miliacea would behave as hosts of M. graminicola, mostly under rainfed conditions...|$|R
30|$|The {{significant}} negative correlation founded between polyphenols compound and fungi biomass (r[*]=[*]−  0.883) {{could be explained}} by polyphenols <b>phytopathogenic</b> soil <b>agents</b> (Yangui et al. 2010; Debo et al. 2011). Of it made, the polyphenols content was negatively correlated with OM (r[*]=[*]−  0.939), the result was in agreement with previous works (Cardinali et al. 2010). Having a phytotoxic effect and antimicrobial activities, polyphenols are the main limiting factor for spreading OMW. In fact, polyphenols are difficult to decompose. Indeed, polyphenols present a microbial toxicity suppressing soil microorganisms and inhibiting their growth (Obied et al. 2007). In addition, the high level of polyphenols in OMW can also pollute surface and groundwater resources (Obied et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of olive mill wastewaters (OMWs) {{is a major}} problem that affects soil and groundwater. Different papers have discussed the effects of OMW discharge on soil characteristics, plant production and phytotoxicity. In this work, a holistic approach is proposed and the main research studies regarding the effects of OMWs on crops and soils are reviewed. Generally, direct application of OMWs exerts a temporary positive effect on soil physical properties. However, in clay soils, the accumulation of salts from these wastewaters could lead to the disintegration of the soil structure. Deterioration of soil structure would decrease the soil hydraulic conductivity, which is a key parameter for determining the volume of OMW that can be spread on a soil. Organic matter (OM) makes up approximately 65 % of the OMW dry weight. Among the soil chemical characteristics, the soil pH remains almost constant following OMW applications. Polyphenols are the most limiting factor for spreading OMWs on soils because of their antimicrobial and phytotoxic effects. Nevertheless, these polyphenols are rapidly degraded depending on environmental conditions. Due to the highly variable chemical composition of the OMWs, these effluents provide variable macronutrient inputs (especially potassium and phosphorus), which potentially reduce necessary fertilizer inputs. Regarding soil microflora, the OMWs exert the following two contrasting actions: stimulating microflora development by temporarily enriching soil carbon and inhibiting certain microorganisms and <b>phytopathogenic</b> <b>agents</b> by adding antimicrobial substances to the soil. For many crops, spreading OMWs benefits crop yield. However, the application of OMWs may also damage germination. Thus, the application of OMWs should adequately precede sowing. The beneficial effects of OMWs on crop yields indicate that these wastewaters may become very important sources of OM and nutrients in agriculture soils and positively impact soil fertility. However, to improve their effectiveness, some use restrictions based on soil characteristics were outlined...|$|R

Since {{there is no}} satisfactory chemical control for the disease, the recommended measures are preventive and include use of healthy seed, crop rotation, deep plowing and use of resistant cultivars. In this work we involved a detection method for isolation of Xap and Psp from bean seed to semi-selective medium Milk Agar Tween (MT). On this medium, Xap formed yellow, mucoid and convex colonies with two hydrolysis zones (less milk and more enlightened), and Psp formed whitish-cream, flat and round colonies. The identification of Xap and Psp was confirmed using the ELISA and PCR. Due to its selectivity, easy preparation and possibility of simultaneous detection of bacteria Xap and Psp, MT medium can be recommended for routine test of seed health for local seed or seed from import...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas corrugata is a <b>phytopathogenic</b> bacterium, causal <b>agent</b> {{of tomato}} pith necrosis, {{yet it is}} an {{ubiquitous}} bacterium {{that is part of}} the microbial community in the soil and in the rhizosphere of different plant species. Although it is a very heterogeneous species, all the strains tested were able to produce short chain acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing signal molecules. The main AHL produced was N-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C 6 -AHL). An AHL quorum sensing system, designated PcoI/PcoR, was identified and characterized. The role of the quorum sensing system in the expression of a variety of traits was evaluated. Inactivation of pcoI abolished the production of AHLs. The pcoR mutant, but not the pcoI mutant, was impaired in swarming, unable to cause a hypersensitivity response on tobacco and resulted in a reduced tomato pith necrosis phenotype. The pcoI mutant showed a reduced antimicrobial activity against various fungi and bacteria when assayed on King's B medium. These results demonstrate that the AHL quorum sensing in Ps. corrugata regulates traits that contribute to virulence, antimicrobial activity and fitness. This is the first report of genes of Ps. corrugata involved in the disease development and biological control activity. Â© 2007 Federation of European Microbiological Societies...|$|R
