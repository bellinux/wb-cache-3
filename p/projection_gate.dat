Of the 63 neurons that received corticofugal modulation of the membrane potential, 30 received potentiation and 33 received hyperpolarization. The corticofugal potentiation of the membrane potential (amplitude, mean � SD, 8. 6 � 5. 5 mV; duration, 125. 5 � 75. 4 msec) facilitated the auditory responses and spontaneous firing of the MGB neurons. The hyperpolarization of � 11. 3 � 4. 9 mV in amplitude and 210. 0 � 210. 1 msec in duration suppressed the auditory responses and spontaneous firing of the MGB neurons. Four of the five neurons that were histologically confirmed to {{be located in the}} lemniscal MGB received corticofugal facilitatory modulation, and all of the four neurons that were confirmed to be located in the non-lemniscal MGB received corticofugal inhibitory modulation. The present intracellular recording provides novel results on how the corticofugal <b>projection</b> <b>gates</b> the sensory information in the thalamus: via the spatially selective depolarization of lemniscal MGB neurons and hyperpolarization of non-lemniscal MGB neurons. It is speculated that the systematic selectivity of facilitation and inhibition over the lemniscal and non-lemniscal MGB is related to the attention shift within the auditory modality and across the sensory modalities.

40|$|Abstract—In many applications, a {{reduction}} {{of the amount of}} the original data, or a representation of the original data by a small set of variables is often required. Among many techniques, the linear projection is often chosen due to its computational attractiveness and good performance. For applications where real-time performance and flexibility to accommodate new data are required, the linear projection is implemented in FPGAs due to their fine-grain parallelism and reconfigurability properties. Currently, the optimization of such a design is considered as a separate problem from the basis calculation leading to suboptimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel approach that couples the calculation of the linear projection basis, the area optimization problem, and the heterogeneity exploration of modern FPGAs. The power of the proposed framework is based on the flexibility to insert information regarding the implementation requirements of the linear basis by assigning a proper prior distribution to the basis matrix. Results from real-life examples on modern FPGA devices demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where up to 48 % reduction in the required area is achieved compared to the current approach, without any loss in the accuracy or throughput of the design.

50|$|Although {{successful}} commercially, Process 2 {{was plagued}} with technical problems. Because {{the images on}} {{the two sides of}} the print were not in the same plane, both could not be perfectly in focus at the same time. The significance of this depended on the depth of field of the projection optics. Much more serious was a problem with cupping. Films in general tended to become somewhat cupped after repeated use: every time a film was projected, each frame in turn was heated by the intense light in the <b>projection</b> <b>gate,</b> causing it to bulge slightly; after it had passed through the gate, it cooled and the bulge subsided, but not quite completely. It was found that the cemented prints were not only very prone to cupping, but that the direction of cupping would suddenly and randomly change from back to front or vice versa, so that even the most attentive projectionist could not prevent the image from temporarily popping out of focus whenever the cupping direction changed. Technicolor had to supply new prints so the cupped ones could be shipped to their Boston laboratory for flattening, after which they could be put back into service, at least for a while. The presence of image layers on both surfaces made the prints especially vulnerable to scratching, and because the scratches were vividly colored they were very noticeable. Splicing a Process 2 print without special attention to its unusual laminated construction was apt to result in a weak splice that would fail as it passed through the projector. Even before these problems became apparent, Technicolor regarded this cemented print approach as a stopgap and was already at work developing an improved process.|$|E

Retrospective ECG gating techniques have already been adapted from clinical cardiac CT that allow 3 D reconstruction using retrospectively <b>gated</b> <b>projection</b> images of a multi-sweep C-arm CT scan according to the desired cardiac phase. However, {{it is known that}} retrospective <b>gating</b> of <b>projection</b> data does not provide an optimal signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) since the measured projection data is only partially considered during the reconstruction. In this work we introduce a new reconstruction technique for cardiac C-arm CT that provides increased SNR by including additional corrected and resampled filtered back-projections (FBP) from temporal windows outside of the targeted reconstruction phase. We take advantage of several motion corrected FDK-like reconstructions of the subject to increase SNR. In the presented results, using in vivo data from an animal model, the SNR could be increased by approximately 30 percent. ...|$|R

40|$|Cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) using an “on-board” x-ray imaging device {{integrated into a}} radiation therapy system has recently been made available for patient positioning, target localization, and adaptive treatment planning. One of the challenges for gantry mounted image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) systems is the slow acquisition of projections for cone-beam CT (CBCT), which makes them sensitive to any patient motion during the scans. Aiming at motion artifact reduction, four-dimensional CBCT (4 D CBCT) techniques have been introduced, where a surrogate for the target’s motion profile is utilized to sort the cone-beam data by respiratory phase. However, due to the limited gantry rotation speed and limited readout speed of the on-board imager, fewer than 100 projections are available for the image reconstruction at each respiratory phase. Thus, severe undersampling streaking artifacts plague 4 D CBCT images. In this paper, the authors propose a simple scheme to significantly reduce the streaking artifacts. In this method, a prior image is first reconstructed using all available <b>projections</b> without <b>gating,</b> in which static structures are well reconstructed while moving objects are blurred. The undersampling streaking artifacts from static structures are estimated from this prior image volume and then can {{be removed from the}} phase images using gated reconstruction. The proposed method was validated using numerical simulations, experimental phantom data, and patient data. The fidelity of stationary and moving objects is maintained, while large gains in streak artifact reduction are observed. Using this technique one can reconstruct 4 D CBCT datasets using no more projections than are acquired in a 60 s scan. At the same time, a temporal gating window as narrow as 100 ms was utilized. Compared to the conventional 4 D CBCT reconstruction, streaking artifacts were reduced by 60 % to 70 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—With the {{explosive}} growth of web data, effective and efficient technologies are in urgent needs for retrieving semantically relevant contents of heterogeneous modalities. Previous studies construct global transformations to project the heterogeneous data into a measurable subspace. However, global projections cannot appropriately adapt to diverse con-tents, and the naturally existing multi-level semantic relation in web data is ignored. We study the problem of semantic coherent retrieval, where documents from different modalities should be ranked by the semantic relevance to the queries. Accordingly, we propose TINA, a correlation learning method by adapTive hIerarchical semaNtic Aggregation. First, by joint modeling of content and ontology similarities, we build a semantic hierarchy to measure multi-level semantic relevance. Second, {{with a set of}} local linear <b>projections</b> aggregated by <b>gating</b> functions, we optimize the structure risk objective function that involves semantic coherence measurement, local projection consistency and the complexity penalty of local projections. Therefore, semantic coherence and a better bias-variance trade-off can be achieved by TINA. Extensive experiments on widely used NUS-WIDE and ICML-Challenge datasets demonstrate that TINA outperforms state-of-the-art, and achieves better adaptation to the multi-level semantic relation and content divergence.

40|$|The primary (S 1) and {{secondary}} (S 2) somatosensory cortices project to several trigeminal sensory nuclei. One putative function of these corticofugal <b>projections</b> is the <b>gating</b> of sensory transmission through the trigeminal principal nucleus (Pr 5), {{and some have}} proposed that S 1 and S 2 project differentially to the spinal trigeminal subnuclei, which have inhibitory circuits that could inhibit or disinhibit the output projections of Pr 5. Very little, however, {{is known about the}} origin of sensorimotor corticofugal projections and their patterns of termination in the various trigeminal nuclei. We addressed this issue by injecting anterograde tracers in S 1, S 2 and primary motor (M 1) cortices, and quantitatively characterizing the distribution of labeled terminals within the entire rostro-caudal chain of trigeminal sub-nuclei. We confirmed our anterograde tracing results by injecting retrograde tracers at various rostro-caudal levels within the trigeminal sensory nuclei to determine the position of retrogradely labeled cortical cells with respect to S 1 barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate that S 1 and S 2 projections terminate in largely overlapping regions but show some significant differences. Whereas S 1 projection terminals tend to cluster within the principal trigeminal (Pr 5), caudal spinal trigeminal interpolaris (Sp 5 ic), and the dorsal spinal trigeminal caudalis (Sp 5 c), S 2 projection terminals are distributed in a continuum across all trigeminal nuclei. Contrary to the view that sensory gating could be mediated by differential activation of inhibitory interconnections between the spinal trigeminal subnuclei,, we observed that projections from S 1 and S 2 are largely overlapping in these subnuclei despite the differences noted earlier...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the framework for}} the creation of whole-body planar acquisitions from Monte Carlo modelling with GATE. The ground truth is a complex model representing a `virtual patient' based on the NCAT-WB anthropomorphic model. Radiopharmaceutical kinetic was generated from compartmental modelling, to assign a time-activity curve (TAC) to each functional compartment. In order to match the kinetic model's functional compartments, the geometrical NCAT-WB model was used to define the corresponding functional volumes, where each geometric voxel results from a linear combination of the functional contributions for that voxel. Image generation was performed by Monte Carlo modelling with GATE. However, Monte Carlo modelling necessitates huge computation times. It is therefore important to save as much time as possible - for example by decreasing the total number of simulations required to generate a dataset. The originality of our approach is twofold: Each functional volume is simulated only once and the resulting output is weighted using the respective TAC, allowing for several image time-points to be generated from the same simulation. The second innovation deals with the way to corrupt images with Poisson noise. The classical way is to simulate enough photons to obtain almost-noiseless projections and then apply a noise filter on the <b>GATE</b> <b>projections.</b> In case of complete simulation of an anthropomorphic model, the simulation time becomes far too long. We propose a method to generate an image with sufficient statistics while preserving the Poisson noise modeled by GATE. We developed a new GATE output which stores in a list the projection pixel indices of the detected photons. It is then possible to build projections with the number of detected events needed for a specific compartment over an acquisition time period. The proposed output is compatible with the generation of SPECT images based on the compartmental approach...|$|R

This sort of variability {{is crucial for}} a multicentre study when many hospitals are involved. Methods A total of 106 institutes {{participated in this study}} and were grouped according to their use of five workstation types. Fifteen sets of 99 mTc-tetrofosmin <b>gated</b> <b>projection</b> images with normal ejection fraction (EF) (70 %, group A, n= 5), borderline low EF (50 %, group B, n= 5) and low EF with large perfusion defects (30 %, group C, n= 5) were prepared. The projection images were processed by QGS software in each institute based on its own routine settings. Based on 318 QGS results, the reproducibility of EF and volumes was analysed for each group and workstation. Results The reproducibility of EF was good in 14 of 15 cases, showing a standard deviation (SD) of < 3. 6 %, and the coefficient of variance of the end-diastolic volume (EDV) was < 9. 3 % in all cases. When the deviation from the average value was analysed, the difference between EF at each institute and the average EF of the workstation (dEF) showed an SD of 2. 2 – 3. 7 % for each group. The ratio of the EDV divided by the average EDV (rEDV) showed an SD of 0. 061 – 0. 069 for each group. One case in group C that had a large anterior defect with low EF showed bimodal EF distribution in one of the five workstations. The SD of EF was workstation dependent, owing to the SPECT reconstruction conditions. Conclusion The reproducibility in EF and volumes within a workstation was good, even though the gated SPECT preferences varied.

October 29 - November 3, 2012 Respiratory gating is {{necessary}} in cardio-thoracic small-animal imaging because of the physiological motions that are present during scanning. When applying a low-dose protocol, fewer than 180 noisy projections may be left for the reconstruction of each respiratory phase, leading to streaking artifacts. The Prior Image Constrained Compressed Sensing (PICCS) algorithm enables accurate reconstruction of highly undersampled data when a prior image is available. The gradient domain is the preferred choice for enforcing the sparsity of the variation of each phase {{with respect to the}} prior. We evaluate three CS algorithms based on the Split-Bregman approach, with different transformations of the prior penalty function: Gradient (TV-PICCS), L 1 -norm (L 1 -PICCS), and Wavelet Transform (WT-PICCS), on low-dose data acquired on a micro-CT scanner. High-dose projection data, acquired with a cone-beam micro-CT scanner, were arranged into four gates using a software-based retrospective gating and reconstructed with an FDK algorithm. To simulate the low-dose case, we took 120 <b>projections</b> from each <b>gate</b> and added Poisson noise. Prior image was obtained by the addition of all low-dose gates with Gaussian filtering. All CS methods performed very similarly in terms of noise and resolution, greatly improving FBP (79 % noise reduction) and eliminating streaks. Pixel and wavelet domains were found to be sparser than the commonly used gradient domain. In conclusion, compressed sensing using a Split-Bregman methodology is a feasible approach to reduce dose in CT respiratory gating. The selection of the sparsity transform for the prior term does not affect resolution and noise performance but it has an influence on the final image texture: Wavelet transform showed a more natural pattern than TV and L 1 -norm.

40|$|Stereotactic {{ablative}} body radiotherapy (SABR) is {{the standard}} of care for inoperable early-stage {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) patients. However, thoracic tumours are susceptible to respiratory motion and, if unaccounted for, can potentially lead to dosimetric uncertainties. Respiratory gating is one method that limits treatment delivery to portions of the respiratory cycle, but when combined with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), requires rigorous verification. The goal of this thesis is to optimize respiratory gated IMRT treatment planning and develop image-guided strategies to verify the dose delivery for future early-stage NSCLC patients. Retrospective treatment plans were generated for various IMRT delivery techniques, including fixed-beam, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and helical tomotherapy. VMAT was determined the best technique for optimizing dose conformity and efficiency. A second treatment planning study that considered patients exhibiting significant tumour motion was conducted. Respiratory ungated and gated VMAT plans were compared. Significant decreases in V 20 Gy and V 50 %, predictors for radiation pneumonitis and irreversible fibrosis, respectively, were observed. The predominant uncertainty of respiratory gating lies in the ability of an external surrogate marker to accurately predict internal target motion. Intrafraction triggered kV imaging was validated in a programmable motion phantom study as a method to determine how correlated the internal and external motion are during ungated and gated VMAT deliveries and to identify potential phase shifts between the motions. KV <b>projections</b> acquired during <b>gated</b> VMAT delivery were used to reconstruct gated cone-beam CT (CBCT), providing 3 D tumour position verification. Image quality and target detectability, in the presence of MV scatter from the treatment beam to the kV detector, was evaluated with various imaging parameters and under real-patient breathing motion conditions. No significant difference in image quality was observed for the CBCT acquisitions with or without the presence of MV scatter. This thesis explores the benefits of combining respiratory gating with IMRT/VMAT for the treatment of early stage NSCLC with SABR, and evaluates advanced on-board imaging capabilities to develop dose delivery verification protocols. The results of this thesis will provide the tools necessary to confidently implement a respiratory gated radiotherapy program aimed at improving the therapeutic ratio for early-stage NSCLC...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{compelling}} need to explore different material options as well as device structures to facilitate smooth transistor scaling for higher speed, higher density and lower power. The enormous potential of nanoelectronics, and nanotechnology in general, offers us the possibility of designing devices with added functionality. However, at the same time, the new materials come with their own challenges {{that need to be}} overcome. In this work, we have addressed some of these challenges in the context of quasi- 2 D Silicon, III-V semiconductor and graphene. Bulk Si is the most widely used semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of about 1. 1 eV. However, when Si is thinned down to sub- 10 nm regime, the quasi- 2 D nature of the system changes the electronic properties of the material significantly due to the strong geometrical confinement. Using a tight-binding study, we show that in addition to the increase in bandgap due to quantization, it is possible to transform the original in direct bandgap to a direct one. The effective masses at different valleys are also shown to vary uniquely in an anisotropic way. This ultra-thin Si, when used as a channel in a double gate MOSFET structure, creates so called “volume in version” which is extensively investigated in this work. It has been found that the both the quantum confinement as well as the gating effect {{play a significant role in}} determining the spatial distribution of the charge, which in turn has an important role in the characteristics of transistor. Compound III-V semiconductors, like Inx Ga 1 -xAs, provide low effective mass and low density of states. This, when coupled with strong confinement in a nanowire channel transistor, leads to the “Ultimate Quantum Capacitance Limit” (UQCL) regime of operation, where only the lowest subband is occupied. In this regime, the channel capacitance is much smaller than the oxide capacitance and hence dominates in the total gate capacitance. It is found that the gate capacitance change qualitatively in the UQCL regime, allowing multi-peak, non-monotonic capacitance-voltage characteristics. It is also shown that in an ideal condition, UQCL provides improved current saturation, on-off ratio and energy-delay product, but a degraded intrinsic gate delay. UQCL shows better immunity towards series resistance effect due to increased channel resistance, but is more prone to interfacial traps. A careful design can provide a better on-off ratio at a given gate delay in UQCL compared to conventional MOSFET scenario. To achieve the full advantages of both FinFET and HEMT in III-V domain, a hybrid structure, called “HFinFET” is proposed which provides excellent on performance like HEMT with good gate control like FinFET. During on state, the carriers in the channel are provided using a delta-doped layer(like HEMT) from the top of a fin-like non-planar channel, and during off state, the gates along the side of the fin(like FinFET) help to pull-off the carriers from the channel. Using an effective mass based coupled Poisson-Schrodinger simulation, the proposed structure is found to outperform the state of the art planar and non-planar MOSFETs. By careful optimization of the gate to source-drain underlap, it is shown that the design window of the device can be increased to meet ITRS <b>projections</b> at similar <b>gate</b> length. In addition, the performance degradation of HFinFET in presence of interface traps has been found to be significantly mitigated by tuning the underlap parameter. Graphene is a popular 2 D hexagonal carbon crystal with extraordinary electronic, mechani-cal and chemical properties. However, the zero band gap of grapheme has limited its application in digital electronics. One could create a bandgap in grapheme by making quasi- 1 D strips, called nanoribbon. However, the bandgap of these nanoribbons depends on the the type of the edge, depending on which, one can obtain either semiconducting or metallic nanoribbon. It has been shown that by the application of an external transverse ﬁeld along the sides of a nanoribbon, one could not only modulate the magnitude of the bandgap, but also change it from direct to indirect. This could open up interesting possibilities for novel electronic and optoelectronic applications. The asymmetric potential distribution inside the nanoribbon is found to result in such direct to indirect bandgap transition. The corresponding carrier masses are also found to be modulated by the external ﬁeld, following a transition from a“slow”electron to a“fast” electron and vice-versa. Experimentally, it is difficult to control the bandgap in nanoribbons as precise edge control at nanometer scale is nontrivial. One could also open a bandgap in a bilayer graphene, by the application of vertical electric field, which has raised a lot of interest for digital applications. Using a self-consistent tight binding theory, it is found that, inspite of this bandgap opening, the intrinsic bias dependent electronic structure and the screening effect limit the subthreshold slope of a metal source drain bilayer grapheme transistor at a relatively higher value-much above the Boltzmann limit. This in turn reduces the on-off ratio of the transistor significantly. To overcome this poor on-off ratio problem, a semiconductor source-drain structure has been proposed, where the minority carrier injection from the drain is largely switched off due to the bandgap of the drain. Using a self-consistent Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function(NEGF) approach, the proposed device is found to be extremely promising providing unipolar grapheme devices with large on-oﬀ ratio, improved subthreshold slope and better current saturation. At high drain bias, the transport properties of grapheme is extremely intriguing with a number of nontrivial effects. Optical phonons in monolayer grapheme couple with carriers in a much stronger way as compared to a bilayer due to selection rules. However, it is difficult to experimentally probe this through transport measurements in substrate supported grapheme as the surface polar phonons with typical low activation energy dominates the total scattering. However, at large drain field, the carriers obtain sufficient energy to interact with the optical phonons, and create so called ‘hot phonons’ which we have experimentally found to result in a negative differential conductance(NDC). The magnitude of this NDC is found to be much stronger in monolayer than in bilayer, which agrees with theoretical calculations. This NDC has also been shown to be compensated by extra minority carrier injection from drain at large bias resulting in an excellent current saturation through a fundamentally different mechanism as compared to velocity saturation. A transport model has been proposed based on the theory, and the experimental observations are found to be in agreement with the model...|$|R
