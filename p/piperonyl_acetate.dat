DEGBE is also a chemical intermediate for the synthesis of {{diethylene glycol monobutyl ether}} acetate, diethylene glycol dibutyl ether, and <b>piperonyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and as a solvent in high baked enamels. Other applications of DEGBE are as a dispersant for vinyl chloride resins in organosols, a diluent for hydraulic brake fluids, and a mutual solvent for soap, oil, and water in household cleaners. The textile industry uses DEGBE as a wetting-out solution. DEGBE is also a solvent for nitrocellulose, oils, dyes, gums, soaps, and polymers. DEGBE is also used as coupling solvent in liquid cleaners, cutting fluids, and textile auxiliaries. In the printing industry, DEGBE applications include: solvent in lacquers, paints, and printing inks; high boiling point solvent to improve gloss and flow properties; and used as a solubilizer in mineral oil products.|$|E
