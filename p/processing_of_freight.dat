40|$|In {{addition}} to selecting the preferred border post design layout, the appraisal approach demonstrated how {{the selection of}} the preferred location for future border post expansion could minimise travel cost, to maximise productivity gains, and to take advantage of economic opportunities. It was, for example, also established that separating freight and pedestrian processing can have substantial developmental and economic advantages. In addition we noted that remote <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> can be economically viable under certain conditions, provided that the additional regional travel time does not erode too much of the processing benefits.

40|$|At {{present time}} freight {{stations}} operation {{is complicated by}} raised dynamics of production and transport processes. Under the given handling capacity, this circumstance affects duration <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> inbound and internal flow <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> cars. In connection with the abovementioned, the article covers new approaches to the analysis and evaluation of operating characteristics, and designing <b>of</b> railway <b>freight</b> stations within industrial enterprises. These approaches base on the system adaptation <b>of</b> the railway <b>freight</b> stations structural layouts and parameters of technical facilities to new working conditions and production demands. As the criterion <b>of</b> optimization <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> station operation, the index <b>of</b> “transportation work” (<b>freight</b> car-hour) was offered. It allows differentiating the elemental flows <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> cars from the overall flow <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> cars at the freight station. It also allows identifying structure, volumes and other parameters of train operation (duration <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> measured in <b>freight</b> car-hours, interpretational and technological idle time denoting the location {{and the reason for}} their occurrence). Moreover, the analysis and evaluation of yard operation is offered to be carried out via handling capacity balance, which illustrates the relation between the overall volume of transportation work and the amount of trains handled at the station. This allows establishing additional transportation work and makes it possible to evaluate the real (objective) necessity in throughput and handling capacity of station facilities in particular, and the station in general. The operating characteristics that have been examined determine the new methodical approaches to designing of composition-and-structural layouts and parameters <b>of</b> industrial <b>freight</b> stations. As the basis for optimization of the station, the certain method of morphological analysis and synthesis of technical decisions can be accepted, with its modification due to the specificity <b>of</b> industrial <b>freight</b> stations operatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the {{liability}} <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarders according to national and international law. The liability <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder is an extremely complex issue for theoretical examination. The latter is especially case considering the process of complete transformation <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder position that freight forwarders experienced {{in the last decade}} of 21 -st century. Considering the fact that process <b>of</b> transformation <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> forwar-ders position imposed a new terminology determinant - logistic operators, in this paper we use the term freight forwarders, and emphasize that the subject of examination is conventional/classical freight forwarders. Theoretical examination <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder status is vital for clarification of many practical dilemmas and disputes in logistic sector. The determination <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarders liability is aimed at reducing of judical and arbitral disputes in Macedonian practice, and analysis of the legal regime <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder’s liability in the context of international shiiping, which present the main goal of this paper. The clarification <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarders liability is closely related to the determination <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder position towards his principal and the third party in the obligation.
