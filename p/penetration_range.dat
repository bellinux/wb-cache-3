50|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century Royal Navy {{warships}} had been armed with progressively larger smoothbore muzzle-loading cannon. These had by then approached their limit in terms of armour <b>penetration,</b> <b>range</b> and destructive power. It was known that rifled ordnance provided more accuracy, a greater range and more penetrative power, which was the rationale behind the development and on-board shipping of the breech-loading cannon developed by the company owned by Sir William Armstrong. These weapons, however, were dangerously prone to failure, frequently explosively, and an alternative armament became urgently necessary.|$|E

The effects of changing jet geometry and momentum flux ratio on the jet trajectory and mixing were studied experimentally and numerically. Through measurement of velocity field of jets utilizing particle image velocimetry (PIV), {{differences in the}} experimental jet penetration were found for the configurations tested. An increase in momentum flux ratio increased jet <b>penetration,</b> <b>ranging</b> from 11 % to 22 % increased penetration. A similar effect on penetration was also seen when the jet geometry was changed. PIV measurements also indicated that the reacting jets penetrated less than the non-reacting cases, showing a decrease in <b>penetration</b> <b>ranging</b> from 10 to 16 % measured at downstream locations x/D= 1 and x/D= 2. This observation was possibly due to increased confinement and blockage effects from gas expansion, reducing penetration. Jet fluid mixing was also analyzed utilizing numerical simulations. It {{was found that the}} higher momentum flux ratio lead to better mixing than the lower momentum flux ratio. Furthermore, it was seen that the computational mixing study performed for the non-reacting jets was reasonable in predicting the consumption of fuel in the reacting case, and could potentially be used to predict combustion efficiency. The results from the experiment and the simulations were compared with each other. It was found that the numerical results for the non-reacting trajectory over-predicted the experimental jet trajectory for the L/D= 2. 1, J= 16. 7 case. Moreover, the computations predicted that the reacting jets penetrated farther into the crossflow than the non-reacting jets, contrary to what was observed in the experiments...|$|R

From these results we obtain the loss function and related quantities such as optical-oscillator strengths and mean excitation energies.

The resulting parameterized fundamental diagram is then integrated with the first-order macroscopic traffic model, creating the ability to characterize operational performance on a network for heterogeneous traffic with varying CACC market penetration. This first-order approach is demonstrated through an illustrative case study which considers a small network with time-varying demand, temporary capacity reductions, and CACC market <b>penetration</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 0 to 1. 0.
