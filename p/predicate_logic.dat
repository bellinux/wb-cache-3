25|$|The {{development}} of <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> is usually attributed to Gottlob Frege, {{who is also}} credited {{as one of the}} founders of analytical philosophy, but the formulation of <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> most often used today is the first-order logic presented in Principles of Mathematical Logic by David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928. The analytical generality of <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of set theory, and allowed the {{development of}} Alfred Tarski's approach to model theory. It provides the foundation of modern mathematical logic.|$|E
25|$|Whilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic {{specifies}} a {{small number}} of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways—allowing <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> {{to solve the problem of}} multiple generality that had perplexed medieval logicians.|$|E

25|$|Within {{academic}} contexts, the syllogism was {{superseded by}} first-order <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> following {{the work of}} Gottlob Frege, in particular his Begriffsschrift (Concept Script) (1879), but syllogisms remain useful in some circumstances, and for general-audience introductions to logic.|$|E
25|$|In this example, the {{quantified}} determiner phrase {{every man}} {{can be expressed}} in <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> as a universal quantifier. Because of this, he refers universally and variably to each man, rather than to a single specific man.|$|E
25|$|This led to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of sentential logic and first-order <b>predicate</b> <b>logic,</b> subsuming syllogistic reasoning, which was, therefore, after 2000 years, suddenly considered obsolete by many.

25|$|Tableaux are {{extended}} to first order <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> by two rules {{for dealing with}} universal and existential quantifiers, respectively.

25|$|There are systems {{weaker than}} full first-order logic {{for which the}} logical {{consequence}} relation is decidable. These include propositional logic and monadic <b>predicate</b> <b>logic,</b> which is first-order logic restricted to unary predicate symbols and no function symbols. Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the guarded fragment of first-order logic, as well as two-variable logic. The Bernays–Schönfinkel class of first-order formulas is also decidable. Decidable subsets of first-order logic are also studied {{in the framework of}} description logics.|$|E

25|$|Some logical {{systems do}} not have all four properties.

25|$|Semantics is {{the branch}} of {{linguistics}} that examines the meaning of natural language, the notion of reference and denotation, {{and the concept of}} possible worlds. One concept used in the study of semantics is <b>predicate</b> <b>logic,</b> which is a system that uses symbols and alphabet letters to represent the overall meaning of a sentence. Quantifiers in semantics – such as the quantifier in the antecedent of a bound variable pronoun – can be expressed in two ways. There is an existential quantifier, ∃, meaning some. There is also a universal quantifier, ∀, meaning every, each, or all. Ambiguity arises when there are multiple quantifiers in one sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Just as {{propositional logic}} can be {{considered}} an advancement from the earlier syllogistic logic, Gottlob Frege's <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> was an advancement from the earlier propositional logic. One author describes <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> as combining [...] "the distinctive features of syllogistic logic and propositional logic." [...] Consequently, <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> ushered {{in a new era}} in logic's history; however, advances in propositional logic were still made after Frege, including Natural Deduction, Truth-Trees and Truth-Tables. Natural deduction was invented by Gerhard Gentzen and Jan Łukasiewicz. Truth-Trees were invented by Evert Willem Beth. The invention of truth-tables, however, is of uncertain attribution.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo nonstandard {{modes of}} inference, {{confirmation}} and denial, {{have been shown}} by Bandler and Kohout to be valid in fuzzy propositional and <b>predicate</b> <b>logics.</b> If denial is used in combination with modus ponens, the resulting inference mode (“augmented modus ponens”) yields more precise bounds on the consequent of an implication than are usually called for in approximate reasoning. Similar results hold for augmented modus tollens constructed from confirmation and conventional fuzzy modus tollens. Two simpler modes of inference, presumption and prejudice, are also valid under the same assumptions as confirmation and denial. Prejudice imposes an upper bound on the truth value of the consequent of a fuzzy implication regardless of the truth value of the antecedent; presumption imposes a lower bound on the truth value of the antecedent regardless of that of the consequent. Some {{of the consequences of}} presumption and prejudice cast doubt on the suitability of fuzzy propositional and <b>predicate</b> <b>logics</b> for use in expert systems that are designed to process real-world data. A logic based directly on fuzzy sets is explored as an alternative. Fuzzy set logic supports fuzzy modus ponens and modus tollens but does not entail the more problematic modes of confirmation, denial, presumption, and prejudice. However, some of the expressive power derivable from the diversity of fuzzy propositional logics and their derivative fuzzy <b>predicate</b> <b>logics</b> is lost...|$|R
