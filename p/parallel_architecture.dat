25|$|Continuing their {{participation}} of AVTC's, CSULA {{is involved with}} General Motors' new competition series called EcoCAR3. This competition is a 4-year competition where 16 Universities across northern America were donated a 2016 Chevy Camaro and are focused on converting this traditional fossil fuel vehicle into a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. CSULA's team has focused on developing a post transmission <b>parallel</b> <b>architecture</b> for their vehicle. Additionally, the team has decided to deviate from the standard expectation of marketing their developed vehicle to consumers and is instead targeting Law Enforcement Fleets as a business to business focus. The EcoCar3 team will have four years (2014–18) to redesign and re-engineer a Chevy Camaro {{in an effort to}} reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse emissions of the vehicle, while maintaining consumer acceptability, performance, utility and safety. At the end of the four year, the student-build vehicles will participate in an over-the-road event, raising the stakes for vehicle, dependability and safety.

The same mechanism {{is also used}} to permit parallel execution of loops. Speculation, prediction, predication, and renaming are under control of the compiler: each instruction word includes extra bits for this. This approach is the distinguishing characteristic of the architecture.|$|E
