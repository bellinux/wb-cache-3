40|$|Glioma is {{a common}} type of primary brain tumor that {{represents}} 28 % of all brain tumors and 80 % of malignant tumors. According {{to a recent study}} by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), gliomas account for 53 %, 35 % and 29 % of all brain tumors (68 %, 74 % and 81 % of malignant brain tumors) among children (aged 0 - 14), teenagers (aged 15 - 19) and young adults, respectively. Gliomas are often diagnosed through radiological imaging and histopathology. There are two main groups of gliomas following World Health Organization’s classification: Low grade gliomas (LGG), or grade I and II gliomas; and high grade gliomas (HGG), or Grade III and IV gliomas. This study focuses mainly on LGG due to its long term risks, such as recurrences and malignant transformations. Although the 5 -year mortality rate for LGG patients is relatively high (17. 6 %), several studies reported that the average 5 -year recurrence rate is up to 55 %. However, there is currently limited guidelines for <b>post-treatment</b> <b>management</b> for LGG patients. This research aims to estimate the recurrence, malignancy transformation, and mortality risks for LGG patients who have had an initial treatment in order to have a better understanding of disease progression. These risk estimates can be incorporated in the development of a natural history model that can then be used in evaluating and optimizing <b>post-treatment</b> <b>management</b> strategies for LGG patients in future research...|$|E
40|$|Background: Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients {{are at high risk}} of loco-regional recurrence and 5 -year survival rates are about 50 %. Identification of patients at high risk of recurrence will enable rigorous personalized <b>post-treatment</b> <b>management.</b> Most novel biomarkers have failed translation for clinical use because of their limited successful validation in external patient cohorts. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prognostic significance of alterations in sub-cellular expression of S 100 A 2, a pro-tumorigenic calcium binding protein, identified as a candidate biomarker in our proteomic analysis in OSCC and validation of its clinical utility in an external cohort. Methods: In a retrospective study, immunohistochemical analysis of S 100 A 2 was carried out in 235 Indian OSCC (Test set) and 129 normal oral tissues, correlated with clinicopathological parameters and disease outcome over 122 months for OSCC patients following the REMARK criteria. The findings were validated in an external cohort (Validation set 115 Canadian OSCC and 51 normal tissues) and data analyzed using the R package. Results: Significant increase in cytoplasmic and decrease in nuclear S 100 A 2 expression was observed in OSCC in comparison with normal tissues. Cox multivariable regression analysis internally and externally validated cytoplasmic S 100 A 2 association with tumor recurrence. Kaplan Meier analysis of patients stratified to high and low risk groups showed significantly different recurrence free survival (Test set- log rank test, p = 0. 005, median survival 16 an...|$|E
40|$|The use of in situ {{amendments}} {{for chemical}} stabilization of inorganic pollutants requires {{some indication of}} the longevity and sustainability of their effects. The efficiency and residual effect of different amendments for chemical stabilization of trace elements was evaluated in a contaminated soil under field conditions, based on single or repeated applications. Three amendments, two organic (biosolids compost and leonardite) and one inorganic (sugarlime), were applied to a soil contaminated by the tailings dam spill at Aznalcóllar (S. Spain), together with an unamended control. Amendments were applied in 2002 and 2003 to replicated test plots. In 2005 each plot was halved: one half received further amendments in 2005 and 2006 (4 treatments, D 4) and the other received no further treatment (2 treatments, D 2). The efficacy of the different treatments was evaluated in surface (0 - 15 cm) and sub-surface (15 - 30 cm) soil horizons. Both organic amendments significantly increased pH and TOC contents of amended soils, accompanied by reduced trace element extractability (CaCl 2 extraction). The inorganic amendment reduced extractable trace element pools and maintained alkaline conditions, but did not affect TOC. The need for repeated amendment applications to sustain these conditions depended {{on the type of}} amendment. Two consecutive applications, D 2, of the inorganic amendment showed sustained efficacy. Both organic amendments required repeated applications for full effectiveness. These results demonstrate that there are clear differences in the potential long-term sustainability of in situ amendments in field conditions and that treated soils require an effective monitoring programme as part of any <b>post-treatment</b> <b>management.</b> CTM 2004 - 01985 TECNO supported by the CICYT of the Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología and the Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia of Spain.

40|$|Avulsions {{and severe}} {{intrusions}} are associated withpoor <b>post-treatment</b> outcomes. <b>Management</b> ofboth avulsions and intrusions is controversial: avulsions present {{the dilemma of}} whether or not to replant, whereas intrusions have the widest choice of treatment options. Every trauma intervention should be guided by application of the best scientific evidence integrated with the clinician’s expertise and the values and expectations of patients and their parents. Yet dentists may be “rusty ” in both clinical techniques and application of research-based information, primarily because of the rarity of such events. Clinical guidelines should incorporate the best research evidence and techniques, as well as the means to explore the expectations of patients and their parents. This review of recent research and the changing management of avulsions and intrusions identifies the controversies and clarifies clinical options...|$|R
30|$|When {{people see}} the {{etiology}} of cancer as within their control, for example, related to behaviors associated with lifestyle, coping with the illness {{tends to be more}} effective. By adopting this perspective, individuals become more likely to change behaviors that they realize that have contributed to their illness (Ferrucci et al. 2011). More accuracy regarding the causes of the illness is important for the adoption of healthy behaviors that favor the prevention of breast cancer and other illnesses in general. For women already sick, a more realistic insight into the etiology of the illness can foster self-care behaviors in both the treatment (improvement of symptoms, prevention of complications, and adjustments in lifestyle) and <b>post-treatment</b> follow-up (<b>management</b> of side effects treatment, and psychological fear of recurrence symptoms) and thus promote better outcomes. The concept of self-care is broader than adherence to treatment, since it comprises the empowerment and the accountability of individuals for their health (Castro & Moro, 2013).|$|R
40|$|A case of gangrenous {{mastitis}} was surgically managed in a cross breed doe aging 3. 5 years and weighing 25 kg at SA Quadery Teaching Veterinary Hospital of Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chittagong, Bangladesh. Confirmatory {{diagnosis of the}} case was done based on physical changes of udder, and identification of associated bacterial agents; two bacteria namely Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli could be isolated from the milk sample. Parenteral administration of combined antimicrobials (Gentamycin + Sulphadimidine + Trimethoprim) and concurrent intra-mammary infusion of antimicrobials (Streptomycin + Penicillin) along with supportive treatments for 7 days could not save the quarter rather the condition deteriorated. After performing the antibiogram of the isolated bacteria, only Ciprofloxacin {{was found to be}} sensitive. Mastectomy was done, and together with supportive medicine, Ciprofloxacin (dosed at 10 mg/kg body weight) was given intramuscularly as antimicrobial. The doe recovered without any complication after 7 days of <b>post-treatment</b> and <b>management...</b>|$|R
40|$|Oregon {{white oak}} (or Carry oak, Quercusgarryana) {{woodlands}} and savannas {{of the coastal}} Pacific Northwest are legacies of an anthropogenic fire regime that ended with European settlement in the mid- 1 800 s. Historically, these oak stands had a sparse overstory and an understory dominated by fire-tolerant grasses and forbs. Post-settlement fire suppression resulted in widespread invasion and subsequent overstory dominance by conifers, causing mortality of shade-intolerant oak trees and shifting understory plant communities to shade-tolerant species. In a study on four southwestern Wash-ington sites, our objective {{was to determine the}} effects of overstory conifer removal, primarily Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga rnenziesii), on microclimate, native and non-native understory cover, and sapling growth. Overstory conifer removal created a warmer, drier understory microclimate during summer months. Conifer removal had little effect on native understory cover during five years post-treatment; however, cover of non-native plants, primarily grasses and woody understory species, increased significantly during the same period. Height growth of Oregon white oak and Douglas-fir saplings exhibited a delayed, but positive, response to overstory conifer removal, although the treatment response of Douglas-fir was 133 % greater than that of oak. Increases in non-native understory cover and the rapid growth of young Douglas-fir indicate the importance of pre- and <b>post-treatment</b> understory <b>management</b> to control undesirable plants and promote native species such as Oregon white oak...|$|R
