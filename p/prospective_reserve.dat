40|$|Due to {{regulation}} reasons, {{life insurance}} undertakings have long been struggling with interest rate variations. In the post-ﬁnancial-crisis era, most life insurance ﬁrms in Western countries are facing two major challenges, the one is the dropdown of interest rates {{and the other is}} the increase of longevity. Many supervisory authorities have warned {{life insurance undertakings}} in their countries that their current portfolios are not adaquate to generate enough returns for future payments to the insured, because most of their assets are made of ﬁxed-income products. The consequence of low interest rates and increasing longevity is that premiums are becoming more expensive and the company s technical provisions are becoming higher than before, which will reduce life insurance undertakings competitive conditions compared to other ﬁnancial institutions. The varying nature and crucial importance of interest rates make it unrealistic to assume them as constant in calculating <b>prospective</b> <b>reserves,</b> especially when it is taken into account the fact that most life insurance products last decades long or even life-long. This thesis explores the possibility of calculating <b>prospective</b> <b>reserves</b> when interest rates are assumed varying. Since stochastic interest rates are represented in bond markets, a unit-linked scheme will be utilized to connect the insurance market to the bond market. A more realistic assumption than varying interest rates is varying interest rates with jumps. L´evy processes are a good candidate for modelling stochastic interest rates with jumps, and hence will be applied in this thesis. However, the permission of jumps in the pricing model will destroy the market-completeness assumption, making it necessary to use a speciﬁc criterion for selecting a risk-neutral probability measure for discounting future cash ﬂows. In this thesis, an Esscher transform will be applied since it preserves the L´evy process. The result of the recursive formula for calculating <b>prospective</b> <b>reserves</b> with stochastic interest rates with jumps is an integro-partial diﬀerential equation which in general does not have an analytical solution...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five papers, presented in Chapters A-E, on topics {{in life and}} disability insurance. It is naturally divided into two parts, where papers A and B discuss disability rates estimation based on historical claims data, and papers C-E discuss claims reserving, risk management and insurer solvency. In Paper A, disability inception and recovery probabilities are modelled in a generalized linear models (GLM) framework. For prediction of future disability rates, it is customary to combine GLMs with time series forecasting techniques into a two-step method involving parameter estimation from historical data and subsequent calibration of a time series model. This approach may in fact lead to both conceptual and numerical problems since any time trend components of the model are incoherently treated as both model parameters and realizations of a stochastic process. In Paper B, we suggest that this general two-step approach can be improved in the following way: First, we assume a stochastic process form for the time trend component. The corresponding transition densities are then incorporated into the likelihood, and the model parameters are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In Papers C and D, we consider a large portfolio of life or disability annuity policies. The policies {{are assumed to be}} independent conditional on an external stochastic process representing the economic-demographic environment. Using the Conditional Law of Large Numbers (CLLN), we establish the connection between claims reserving and risk aggregation for large portfolios. Moreover, we show how statistical multi-factor intensity models can be approximated by one-factor models, which allows for computing reserves and capital requirements efficiently. Paper C focuses on claims reserving and ultimate risk, whereas the focus of Paper D is on the one-year risks associated with the Solvency II directive. In Paper E, we consider claims reserving for life insurance policies with reserve-dependent payments driven by multi-state Markov chains. The associated <b>prospective</b> <b>reserve</b> is formulated as a recursive utility function using the framework of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE). We show that the <b>prospective</b> <b>reserve</b> satisfies a nonlinear Thiele equation for Markovian BSDEs when the driver is a deterministic function of the reserve and the underlying Markov chain. Aggregation of prospective reserves for large and homogeneous insurance portfolios is considered through mean-field approximations. We show that the corresponding <b>prospective</b> <b>reserve</b> satisfies a BSDE of mean-field type and derive the associated nonlinear Thiele equation. QC 20151012 </p...|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} actuarial {{practice}} to calculate premiums and reserves under {{a set of}} biometric assumptions that represent a worst-case scenario for the insurer.

The present paper partly fills this gap by introducing a general method that allows one to construct such scenarios for homogenous portfolios of life insurance policies. The results are especially informative for life insurance policies with mixed character (e. g.  survival and occurrence character).

40|$|International audiencePorous micritic facies, either primary chalks or {{resulting}} from secondary destructive micritization, can constitute important hydrocarbon or water reservoirs. Characterization of reservoir properties and {{the understanding of}} factors which controlled the distribution of porosity are of primary interest to evaluate the <b>prospective</b> <b>reserves.</b> Middle and late Oxfordian limestones of the eastern Paris Basin show several horizons with porosities higher than 20 %. The porosity is mainly microporous and located either within secondary micritized grains or in the micritic matrix. Using SEM, cathodoluminescence, as well as confocal microscopy, stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios, and petrophysical measurements, a scenario {{for the evolution of}} the micropores is proposed. Lime mudstones to packstones constitute the majority of the high-porosity facies (HPFs). Inner lagoonal deposits are more micritized and thus more porous than grainstones, and facies rich in leiolitic oncoids and echinoid clasts are less impacted by micritization. Micritization was responsible for an increase of the intragranular porosity in most grain types. During both eogenesis and shallow burial, mineralogical stabilization dissolved aragonitic particles and allowed precipitation of calcite rhombs. This process was probably enhanced below surfaces of subaerial exposure. During burial, Ostwald ripening allowed the growth of larger micrite crystals at the expense of smaller ones during early Berriasian and late Aptian recharges of deep aquifers when the northern margin of the basin was exposed. Overgrowths on micrite crystals were more important in intervals strongly affected by chemical compaction, which favored oversaturation of waters with respect to calcite. In low-porosity horizons (LPFs), the dense micritic texture of oncoids and the monocrystalline architecture of echinoid clasts prevented an intense micritization, while the strong chemical compaction enhanced poronecrosis. Telogenetic fracturing created new fluid pathways that favored inputs of meteoric fluid in porous micrite and allowed the continuation of Ostwald ripening during Cenozoic times. As a whole, mesogenetic inputs of waters undersaturated with respect to calcite in deep aquifers during exposure of basin margins are a more efficient process than early subaerial exposure for enhancing aggrading neomorphism and appearance of microporous micrites. Initial mineralogical heterogeneities also impact the intensity of chemical compaction and thus the stratigraphical distribution of microporous limestones...|$|R

40|$|According to the 2011 Energy In{{formation}} Agency (EIA) global assessment, Mexico ranks 4 th in {{shale gas}} resources. The Eagle Ford shale is the formation {{with the greatest}} expectation in Mexico given the success it has had in the US and its liquids-rich zone. Accurate estimation of the resource size and future production, {{as well as the}} uncertainties associated with them, is critical for the decision-making process of developing shale oil and gas resources. The complexity of the shale reservoirs and high variability in its properties generate large uncertainties in the long-term production and recovery factors of these plays. Another source of uncertainty is the limited production history. Given all these uncertainties, a probabilistic decline-curve analysis approach was chosen for this study, given that it is relatively simple, it enables performing a play-wide assessment with available production data and, more importantly, it quantifies the uncertainty in the resource size. Analog areas in the US Eagle Ford shale were defined based on available geologic information in both the US and Mexico. The Duong model coupled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology was used to analyze and forecast production of wells located in the previously defined analog sectors in the US Eagle Ford shale. By combining the results of individual-well analyses, a type curve and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) distribution for each of the defined analog sectors was obtained. These distributions were combined with well-spacing assumptions and sector areas to generate the prospective-resources estimates. Similar probabilistic decline-curve-analysis methodology was used to estimate the reserves and contingent resources of existing wells. As of March 2013, the total prospective resources (P 90 -P 50 -P 10) for the Eagle Ford shale in Mexico (MX-EFS) are estimated to be 527 - 1, 139 - 7, 268 MMSTB of oil and 17 - 37 - 217 TSCF of gas. To my knowledge, this is the first oil estimate published for this formation in Mexico. The most attractive sectors based on total estimated resources as well as individual-well type curves are located in the southeast of the Burgos Basin and east-west of the Sabinas basin. Because there has been very little development to date, estimates for reserves and contingent resources are much lower than those for <b>prospective</b> resources. Estimated <b>reserves</b> associated with existing wells and corresponding offset well locations are 18, 375 - 34, 722 - 59, 667 MMSCF for gas and zero for oil. Estimated contingent resources are 14 - 64 - 228 MSTB of oil and 8, 526 - 13, 327 - 25, 983 MMSCF of gas.
