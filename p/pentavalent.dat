5|$|Bismuth forms {{trivalent}} and <b>pentavalent</b> compounds, the trivalent ones {{being more}} common. Many of its chemical properties {{are similar to}} those of arsenic and antimony, although they are less toxic than derivatives of those lighter elements.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a <b>pentavalent</b> post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium {{exhibits}} two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions {{is obtained}} {{by the action of}} strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of <b>pentavalent</b> protactinium are close to those of tantalum(V) and niobium(V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5f shell in this element.|$|E
5|$|Actinides with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2−, 2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·nH2O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of <b>pentavalent</b> and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.|$|E
5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a <b>pentavalent</b> (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of arsenic is predominately nonmetallic. Whether or not arsenic forms a cation is unclear. Its many metal alloys are mostly brittle. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by {{the formation of}} oxyanions. Arsenic generally forms compounds {{in which it has}} an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. In the trivalent state, arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties. The halides are hydrolysed by water but these reactions, particularly those of the chloride, are reversible {{with the addition of a}} hydrohalic acid. The oxide is acidic but, as noted below, (weakly) amphoteric. The higher, less stable, <b>pentavalent</b> state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties. Compared to phosphorus, the stronger metallic character of arsenic is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as AsPO4, As2(SO4)3 and arsenic acetate As(CH3COO)3. The oxide As2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Arsenic has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoarsenic chemistry).|$|E

25|$|For visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended treatment {{and is often}} used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to <b>pentavalent</b> antimonials. In Africa, a combination of <b>pentavalent</b> antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within 3 months of getting pregnant. It {{does not appear to}} work for L. major or L. braziliensis.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{treatment is}} with <b>pentavalent</b> antimonials such as sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate. Resistance is now common in India, {{and rates of}} resistance {{have been shown to}} be as high as 60% in parts of Bihar, India.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pentavalent</b> ammonia {{is known}} as λ5-amine, or more commonly, {{ammonium}} hydride. This crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure, and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions. This substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Inorganic arsenic and its compounds, upon {{entering}} the food chain, are progressively metabolised (detoxified) {{through a process of}} methylation. The methylation occurs through alternating reductive and oxidative methylation reactions, that is, reduction of <b>pentavalent</b> to trivalent arsenic followed by addition of a methyl group (CH3).|$|E
25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of <b>pentavalent</b> antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a <b>pentavalent</b> antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option for}} infants is DT {{which is a}} vaccine that is a {{combination}} of diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. This is given as an alternative to infants who have conflicts with the DTaP vaccine. Quadrivalent, <b>pentavalent,</b> and hexavalent formulations contain DTaP with {{one or more of the}} additional vaccines: inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, Hepatitis B, with the availability varying in different countries.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis can {{be partly}} {{prevented}} by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating {{people with the}} disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, {{and the type of}} infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of <b>pentavalent</b> antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective.|$|E
25|$|New {{treatment}} options are {{arising from the}} new oral drug miltefosine (Impavido) which has shown in several clinical trials to be very efficient and safe in visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Recent studies from Bolivia show a high cure rate for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Comparative studies against <b>pentavalent</b> antimonials in Iran and Pakistan are also beginning to show a high cure rate for L. major and L. tropica. It is registered in many countries of Latin America, as well in Germany. In October 2006 it received orphan drug status from the US Food and Drug administration. The drug is generally better tolerated than other drugs. Main side effects are gastrointestinal disturbances in the 1–2 days of treatment which {{does not affect the}} efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Suramin {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Oskar Dressel and Richard Kothe in 1916 for Bayer. It {{was introduced in}} 1920 to treat {{the first stage of}} the disease. By 1922, Suramin was generally combined with tryparsamide (another <b>pentavalent</b> organoarsenic drug), the first drug to enter the nervous system and be useful in the treatment of the second stage of the gambiense form. Tryparsamide was announced in the Journal of Experimental Medicine in 1919 and tested in the Belgian Congo by Louise Pearce of the Rockefeller Institute in 1920. It was used during the grand epidemic in West and Central Africa on millions of people and was the mainstay of therapy until the 1960s. American medical missionary Arthur Lewis Piper was active in using tryparsamide to treat sleeping sickness in the Belgian Congo in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Due to its similar {{structure}} and properties, <b>pentavalent</b> arsenic metabolites {{are capable of}} replacing the phosphate group of many metabolic pathways. The replacement of phosphate by arsenate is initiated when arsenate reacts with glucose and gluconate in vitro. This reaction generates glucose-6-arsenate and 6-arsenogluconate, which act as analogs for glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate. At the substrate level, during glycolysis, glucose-6-arsenate binds as a substrate to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and also inhibits hexokinase through negative feedback. Unlike the importance of phosphate in glycolysis, the presence of arsenate restricts the generation of ATP by forming an unstable anhydride product, through the reaction with D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The anhydride 1-arsenato-3-phospho-D-glycerate generated readily hydrolyzes due to the longer bond length of As-O compared to P-O. At the mitochondrial level, arsenate uncouples the synthesis of ATP by binding to ADP {{in the presence of}} succinate, thus forming an unstable compound that ultimately results in a decrease of ATP net gain. Arsenite (III) metabolites, on the other hand, have limited effect on ATP production in red blood cells.|$|E
500|$|All <b>pentavalent</b> and {{hexavalent}} americium compounds {{are complex}} salts such as KAmO2F2, Li3AmO4 and Li6AmO6, Ba3AmO6, AmO2F2. These high oxidation states Am(IV), Am(V) and Am(VI) {{can be prepared}} from Am(III) by oxidation with ammonium persulfate in dilute nitric acid, with silver(I) oxide in perchloric acid, or with ozone or sodium persulfate in sodium carbonate solutions. The <b>pentavalent</b> oxidation state of americium was first observed in 1951.

500|$|The {{atomic radius}} of bohrium is {{expected}} to be around 128pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Bh+ ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of [...] 5f14 6d4 7s2, giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues manganese and technetium. Rhenium, on the other hand, follows its heavier congener bohrium in giving up a 5d electron before a 6s electron, as relativistic effects have become significant by the sixth period, where they cause among other things the yellow color of gold and the low melting point of mercury. The Bh2+ ion {{is expected to}} have an electron configuration of [...] 5f14 6d3 7s2; in contrast, the Re2+ ion is expected to have a [...] 4f14 5d5 configuration, this time analogous to manganese and technetium. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate heptavalent bohrium {{is expected to be}} 58pm (heptavalent manganese, technetium, and rhenium having values of 46, 57, and 53pm respectively). <b>Pentavalent</b> bohrium should have a larger ionic radius of 83pm.|$|E

2500|$|Arsenic {{is unique}} among the trace {{metalloids}} and oxyanion-forming trace metals (e.g. As, Se, Sb, Mo, V, Cr, U, Re). It {{is sensitive to}} mobilization at pH values typical of natural waters (pH 6.5–8.5) under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Arsenic can occur in the environment in several oxidation states (−3, 0, +3 and +5), but in natural waters it is mostly found in inorganic forms as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite [...] or <b>pentavalent</b> arsenate [...] Organic forms of arsenic are produced by biological activity, mostly in surface waters, but are rarely quantitatively important.
