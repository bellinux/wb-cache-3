40|$|Objectives: Slip {{and fall}} {{accidents}} {{in the workplace}} {{are one of the}} top causes of work related fatalities and injuries. Previous studies have indicated that fall risk was related to postural and dynamic stability. However, the usage of this theoretical relationship was limited by laboratory based measuring instruments. The current study proposed a new method for stability assessment by use of inertial measurement units (IMUs). Methods: Accelerations at different body parts were recorded by the IMUs. Postural and local dynamic stability was assessed from these measures and compared with that computed from the traditional method. Results: The results demonstrated: 1) significant differences between fall prone and healthy groups in IMU assessed dynamic stability; and 2) better power of discrimination with multi stability index assessed by IMUs. Conclusion: The findings can be utilized in the design of a <b>portable</b> <b>screening</b> or monitoring tool for fall risk assessment in various industrial settings...|$|R

5000|$|Vertical filmmaking has {{aesthetic}} roots reaching back {{at least}} to tall frescoes and stained-glass windows of Christian churches. Noting that the new cinematic art had taken on the old strictures of the theatrical proscenium, on 17 September 1930 Russian filmmaker and theorist Sergei Eisenstein addressed the Technicians Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood, calling for a cinema screen of variable aspect ratio (a [...] "dynamic square"), one which would be able to cope with whatever compositional format the filmmaker chose, including a vertical framing. [...] He lost the argument to a screen format standardised at a new Academy ratio (1.375:1) and vertical filmmaking has largely remained confined to experimental artists of the Expanded Cinema movement, which flourished during the 1960s and 70s. If digital video production {{at the turn of the}} millennium freed the medium from many apparatus-based constraints it wasn't until the advent of <b>portable</b> <b>screen</b> devices such as the iPhone that the door opened to vertical video production and spectatorship for mass audiences.|$|E

50|$|The Play-Yan is an MP3 and MPEG-4 player add-on for the Game Boy Advance SP, Nintendo DS, DS Lite, and Game Boy Micro.

While the original Game Boy Advance is compatible, its non-illuminated screen and the Play-Yan's high rate of power consumption do not make the Game Boy Advance a very suitable platform. The Play-Yan is also compatible with the Game Boy Player, but compressed video does not play back as nicely on a television screen as it does on a small, <b>portable</b> <b>screen.</b> Therefore, the Game Boy Player is a somewhat unsuitable platform as well, at least compared to any standard DVD player. The adapter has its own integrated headphone port, but uses the parent console's power supply, controls, and display.

40|$|The {{research}} of influence of life environment adverse factors on physical development {{and health of}} population is an actual problem of ecology. The aspects of the most actual problems of the modern world, namely environmental industrial noise pollution are considered in the article. Industrial facilities everywhere have noisy equipment. Noise is a significant factors of negative influenceon people and environment. Combined effects of noise and of other physical pollutions on people may cause amplification of their negative impact. If the noise pollution level from the object in a residential area exceeds the permissible levels (MPL), noise protection measures can be initiated. Today, the most common design decisions for noise protection are sound absorbing construction, noise screens and barriers, acousting housings, soundproff cabins. Many of them are popular, others are less known. The article deals {{with one of the}} most wide spread means of noise protection – a <b>portable</b> acoustic <b>screen.</b> The aim of the research is to determine the efficiency of <b>portable</b> acoustic <b>screens.</b> It is shown that the installation of such structures can reduce the average value of the sound level.

Effectiveness, a sound absorption coefficient and sound conductivity coefficient of a <b>portable</b> acoustic <b>screen</b> are evaluated.
