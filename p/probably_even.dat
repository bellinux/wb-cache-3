5|$|Montville {{suggested}} that Ruth is <b>probably</b> <b>even</b> more popular today {{than he was}} when his career home run record was broken by Aaron. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, {{to the delight of}} the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on SportsCenter and Baseball Tonight each evening during the season. The questions of performance-enhancing drug use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.|$|E

25|$|An other {{legacy of}} Christian Nubia were crowns with {{features}} resembling bovine horns, called taqiya umm qarnein and worn by diverse Sudanese petty kings, <b>probably</b> <b>even</b> by the Funj kings themselves.

His oldest known printed work is a Latin Bible printed with 49 lines per page ("B49"), whose first volume is dated 1460. As Gutenberg's Bible was printed with 42 lines per page, Mentelin's had fewer pages and proved handier.|$|E

25|$|The Air Element is the {{air force}} branch of the PNGDF, {{operating}} {{a small number of}} light aircraft and rotary wing assets in support of army operations. Like the PNGDF in general {{the air force}} suffers from chronic equipment shortages and underfunding, but <b>probably</b> <b>even</b> more so than the other two branches. The role of the air force is to support army operations with transport, air re-supply and medical evacuation capabilities. The Defence White Paper 2013 included a new role to be developed of surveillance.|$|E

25|$|This war is {{notorious for}} the British {{scorched}} earth policy, which was implemented {{when it became}} clear that the guerrilla tactics practiced by the republican Boer forces could not be overcome by conventional means. In 1901, Emily Hobhouse reported on the genocide which was taking place in the 45 British concentration camps for Boer women, children and elderly in which, over an 18-month period, 26,370 people would die, 24,000 of them boys and girls under 16. Exact mortality figures in the 64 concentration camps for black displaced farm workers and their families are not known, but was <b>probably</b> <b>even</b> worse.|$|E
25|$|Exekias (545-520 BC) is {{generally}} considered to be the absolute master of the black-figure style, which reaches its apex with him. His significance is not only due to his masterful vase painting, but also to his high quality and innovative pottery. He signed 12 of his surviving vessels as potter, two as both painter and potter. Exekias probably had a large {{role in the development of}} Little-master cups and the Type A belly amphora mentioned above, and he possibly invented the calyx krater, at least the oldest existing piece is from his workshop. In contrast to many other comparable craftsmen, as a painter he attached great importance to the careful elaboration of ornaments. The details of his images—horses’ manes, weapons, clothing—are also outstandingly well executed. His scenes are usually monumental and the figures emanate a dignity previously unknown in painting. In many cases he broke with Attic conventions. For his most famous vessel, the Dionysus cup, he was the first to use a coral-red interior coating instead of the customary red color. This innovation, as well as his placing of two pairs of eyes on the exterior, connects Exekias with the classic eye cups. <b>Probably</b> <b>even</b> more innovative was his use of the entire inside of the cup for his picture of Dionysus, reclining on a ship from which grapevines sprout. At this time it was in fact customary to decorate the inside surface merely with a gorgon face. The cup is probably one of the experiments undertaken in the pottery district to break new ground before the red-figure style was introduced. He was the first to paint a ship sailing along the rim of a dinos. He only seldom adhered to traditional patterns of depicting customary mythological subjects. His depiction of the suicide of Ajax is also significant. Exekias does not show the act itself, which was in the tradition, but rather Ajax’ preparations. About as famous as the Dionysus cup is an amphora with his visualization of Ajax and Achilles engaged in a board game. Not only is the portrayal detailed, Exekias even conveys the outcome of the game. Almost in the style of a speech balloon he has both players announce the numbers they cast with their dice—Ajax a three and Achilles a four. This is the oldest known depiction of this scene, of which there is no mention in classical literature. No fewer than 180 other surviving vases, dating from the Exekias version up to about 480 BC, show this scene.|$|E
500|$|Streep's {{first feature}} film role came {{opposite}} Jane Fonda in the 1977 film Julia, {{in which she}} had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: [...] "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've made a terrible mistake, no more movies. I hate this business". However, Streep cites Fonda as having a lasting influence on her as an actress, and has credited her as [...] "open probably more doors than I <b>probably</b> <b>even</b> know about".|$|E

500|$|Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter {{summed up}} WrestleMania XXX as a [...] "very newsworthy show {{to say the}} least". Daniel Bryan's first match was {{described}} as a long technical one, and although Meltzer did not consider it [...] "a match of the year or <b>probably</b> <b>even</b> the week", it [...] "was the caliber of a good PPV main event". Triple H's post-match attack on Bryan was said to be a [...] "very basic" [...] storyline [...] "but it's also exactly what they should have done". Bryan's second match in the main event was described as [...] "really great" [...] with lots of twists and turns, while the match result was [...] "again exactly what they should have done" [...] and [...] "the crowd reacted the way you would expect". Meltzer thought that [...] "the people just weren't into" [...] the Undertaker's match as [...] "nobody bought that Lesnar could win". Meanwhile, he felt that the Undertaker's departure was [...] "certainly teased like a retirement". For the battle royal, Meltzer noted the lack of (surprise) entrants such as Rob Van Dam, Alexander Rusev, Christian, or Wade Barrett. In other notes, Meltzer described the strong fan support for Cesaro and also labelled Cena's win as a [...] "genuine upset".|$|E

2500|$|The {{remaining}} 15,600 square {{meters of}} the Hilda mega-bonebed contained only about 10% of the fossil density {{observed in the}} [...] "core" [...] of H97-04.

Thus, the total estimated number centrosaurs preserved in the Hilda area ranged from several hundred to about 1,500 individuals. However, the presence of centrosaur bonebeds {{on both sides of the}} South Saskatchewan River suggests that the river eroded away many fossil deposits that had originally been preserved there.
