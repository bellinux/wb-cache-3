5|$|As the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting {{in favor of the}} $700billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> 74–25.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{the case}} of Jamie Leigh Jones, Franken offered an {{amendment}} to the 2010 Defense Appropriations bill that would withhold defense contracts from companies that restrict their employees from taking workplace sexual assault, battery, and discrimination cases to court. It <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in November 2010, 68 to 30 in a roll-call vote.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> bill <b>passes</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> cloture vote, 68-23.|$|R
50|$|On December 2, 2009, Díaz {{voted against}} {{same-sex}} marriage legislation, which failed to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> bill would have to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be <b>passed</b> by <b>the</b> reconciliation process.|$|R
5|$|Part of Johnson's {{campaign}} for relief was {{the abolition of}} the practice of debt imprisonment nationwide. It would take him nearly ten years to see this goal accomplished. He first spoke to the issue in the Senate on December 14, 1822, introducing a bill to end the practice, and pointing to the positive effects its cessation had effected in his home state. The bill failed, but Johnson persisted in re-introducing it every year. In 1824, it <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> but was too late to be acted upon by the House. It <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> a second time in 1828, but again, the House failed to act on it, and the measure died for some years, owing to Johnson's exit from the Senate the next year.|$|E
5|$|In March 1898, a {{resolution}} {{was introduced in}} Congress for a commission to erect a monument to Lafayette in Paris {{on behalf of the}} United States. The bill <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> and hearings were held before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Chicago businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Peck testified in support of the bill, which though favored by the committee was not considered by the House due to higher priorities during the Spanish–American War.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2009, Franken {{presided over}} the {{confirmation}} vote of Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. A year later, on August 5, 2010, Franken {{presided over the}} confirmation vote of Elena Kagan. His first piece of legislation, the Service Dogs for Veterans Act, which he wrote jointly with Republican Johnny Isakson, <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> with unanimous consent, establishing a program with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to pair disabled veterans with service dogs.|$|E
50|$|On December 2, 2009, Monserrate {{voted against}} {{legislation}} allowing same-sex marriage, which failed to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Ohio {{legislature}} reelected Sherman {{to another}} six-year term that year, and when (after a three-month vacation in Europe) he resumed his seat he again {{turned to the}} greenback question. Public support for greenbacks had grown, especially among businesspeople who thought withdrawal would lead to lower prices. When a bill passed the House suspending the authority to retire greenbacks under the Contraction Act, Sherman supported it in the Senate. It <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> 33–4, and became law in 1868.|$|E
5|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would allow a casino in Prince George's County. The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft. The bill <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> but the House did not vote on it. The bill was passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to allow a casino in Prince George's County, which was passed via referendum in November 2012. After one season of live racing, Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft {{for the next two}} years. The only exception is if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George's County casino.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, a {{technical}} issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating in the}} House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and the House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.|$|E
50|$|On June 9, 2009, the Maine House of Representatives {{voted to}} form a unicameral legislature, but the measure did not <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
50|$|On December 2, 2009, Addabbo was one {{of eight}} Democratic state {{senators}} to vote against same-sex marriage legislation, which failed to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the end, Kennedy {{managed to}} amend the renewal of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include {{provisions}} for a national survey on nutrition. Stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from other Southern legislators {{and a lack of}} support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill <b>passed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. The Poverty Subcommittee held further field hearings across the country as part of its work.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{compromise}} <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 1925, Vermont Senator Frank Greene {{introduced}} legislation for commemorative coins {{to mark the}} 150th anniversary of Vermont declaring itself fully independent in 1777 and of the American victory at the Battle of Bennington the same year. His bill <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> without difficulty, but in the House of Representatives faced an array of problems. Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon sent a letter opposing the bill and dispatched three Treasury officials to testify against it, arguing that the public was being confused as special coin issues entered circulation. The committee's resolve to have no more commemorative coins—after this one—did not impress the full House, which added two more half dollars to the legislation to mark other anniversaries. The Senate agreed to the changes, and President Calvin Coolidge signed the authorizing act on February 24, 1925.|$|E
5000|$|On March 3, 2010, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4247 (now {{renamed the}} Keeping All Students Safe Act). The vote was 262-153, with 238 Democrats and 24 Republicans voting in favor. [...] The bill did not <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> [...] A revised Senate bill, S.3895, was {{introduced}} on September 29, 2010, and cosponsored by Senator Dodd and Senator Burr. It did not <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> [...] Because passage by {{both houses of}} Congress {{is required for the}} President to consider a bill in America, both bills died {{at the end of the}} 111th Congress in December 2010.|$|R
50|$|In December 2004, the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives voted 15-0 with 1 {{abstention}} {{in favor}} of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The constitutional amendment, however, failed to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
50|$|In February 2016, Erickson added {{language}} to a solar energy bill (Washington Bill HB2346) {{that would cause}} sections of the bill to expire if a law imposing limits on greenhouse emissions were <b>passed.</b> <b>The</b> amended bill did not <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
5|$|Randall {{returned}} to Washington in March 1877 {{at the start}} of the 45th Congress and was reelected Speaker. As the session began, many in the Democratic caucus were determined to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875. That Act, passed when Republicans last controlled the House, was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation, replacing them with dollars backed in specie (i.e., gold or silver). With the elimination of the silver dollar in 1873, this would effectively return the United States to the gold standard for the first time since before the Civil War. Randall, who had voted against the act in 1875, agreed to let the House vote on its repeal, which narrowly <b>passed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Senate,</b> still controlled by Republicans, declined to act on the bill.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{considered}} the bill between June 22 and 24, 1965. An amendment by Rhode Island Senator John Pastore to remove silver entirely from the half dollar failed, 32—60. A number of senators wished to retain {{silver in the}} dime and quarter, and called {{for them to be}} made from 40 percent silver, but an amendment to that effect was defeated. There were other failed amendments, including one by Bible to prohibit melting of silver coins by the public. Robertson was determined to prevent any changes to the bill, which had been unanimously approved by his committee, and each attempt failed. The bill <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> 74—9, the opponents being Bible and other Western senators.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} the Hawaii House of Representatives in February 2009 {{in a form}} {{specific}} to same-sex couples, was passed in amended form including opposite-sex couples by the Hawaii Senate in May 2009, and was carried over in the 2010 session, where it <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> again in January 2010 with a veto-proof majority. The bill {{moved back to the}} House but was indefinitely postponed by a voice vote initiated by House Speaker Calvin Say, requiring a vote of two-thirds of Representatives to be taken up again in 2010, and was considered dead. In April 2010, {{on the last day of}} the legislative session, the House suspended the rules on the Senate bill and passed it with a majority, sending the bill to Governor Linda Lingle, who vetoed it in July 2010.|$|E
5000|$|President Barack Obama {{said that}} he would veto the bill. Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) did not believe that <b>the</b> bill would <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> so [...] "we are wasting the time of the American people." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Passed</b> by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> September 25, 2013.|$|R
50|$|In January 2015, two Republican state {{senators}} {{introduced a}} bill in the Washington State Legislature to kill the project, citing Bertha and its delay in particular. The bill was never heard in <b>the</b> state <b>senate</b> and failed to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Transportation Committee.|$|R
5|$|The {{bill was}} next {{considered}} in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed. The bill <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms. The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it {{at the expense of}} the consumer. Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests. Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.|$|E
5|$|Truman was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations that had not fallen under Soviet control following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The U.S., Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories. The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education. The bill <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> but not the House. Cooper was made {{chairman}} of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorizing $900million in federal funds to states for highway construction. In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity. He insisted on {{an amendment to the}} War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets. He also co-sponsored legislation allowing {{hundreds of thousands of people}} displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally. He opposed bans on industrywide collective bargaining for organized labor and on the establishment of closed shops. He voted against putting union welfare funds under government control, but helped to pass an amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the House of Representatives <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act, {{which would}} require the {{government}} to disclose the data it uses to determine species classification, but the President threatened a veto and the bill is unlikely to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Xenophon {{supported}} the Abbott Government's Direct Action plan for combating Climate Change, enabling it to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> However, he later {{stated that the}} plan had been [...] "neutered" [...] because of changes made to it via regulation.|$|R
5000|$|On December 2, 2009, Savino {{voted for}} same sex {{marriage}} legislation, which failed to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Her speech on same-sex marriage became popular on the Internet. [...] Subsequently in 2011, the same-sex marriage bill passed to become law.|$|R
