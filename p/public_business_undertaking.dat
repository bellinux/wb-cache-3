This paper describes and analyses two key sets of provisions in this model legislation. The first establishes a 'primary' duty of care imposed not on 'employers' but on persons conducting a <b>business</b> or <b>undertaking,</b> and owed to all kinds of workers engaged, directed or influenced by the person conducting the <b>business</b> or <b>undertaking.</b> The second encompasses broad duties on all persons conducting a <b>business</b> or <b>undertaking</b> to consult with workers who carry out work for the <b>business</b> or <b>undertaking</b> and who are directly affected by a work health and safety issue, and to facilitate the election of health and safety representatives representing all workers who carry out work for the <b>business</b> or <b>undertaking.</b> These provisions arguably make a significant contribution to solving a problem faced by occupational safety and health regulators around the world - modifying regulation to accommodate all forms of precarious work.
