40|$|While the {{majority}} of Australians profess {{a concern for the}} environment, this is not reflected in actual <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental behaviour. Research has shown that when injunctive norms (what society expects) conflict with descriptive norms (what societ y actually does), the injunctive norm is less likely to be followed. Further, when individuals are ego depleted, having an impaired ability to self - regulate, {{they are more likely to}} base behaviour on mental heuristics, which can result in greater adherence to descriptive norms. The present study aimed to investigate how norm confl ict and ego depletion interact to influence <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental intentions, and whether this relationship was further moderated by individual differences in <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental attitud es. Participants were 109 young adult university students who completed an online experimental questionnaire. They considered norms that were either conflicting or in agreement, before completing a simple or an ego depleting writing task. Dependent variabl es were intentions to engage in easy and difficult <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental behaviours, general intentions to act <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmentally, and the number of green - purchasing decisions made in a consumer task. Against predictions, norms were not found to influence any of the dependent variables, nor did norms interact with ego depletion or <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental attitudes. An unexpected interaction was found between ego depletion and <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental attitudes for easy and difficu lt <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental intentions. Compared t o those high in <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental attitudes, those low in <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental attitudes were less likely to intend to act <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmentally, particularly when ego depleted or when the behaviour was difficult. Potential problems in the manipulation of the n orms variable are discussed, along with recommendations for future research to further investigate the effect of ego depletion on <b>pro</b> <b>-</b> environmental behaviours...|$|R
