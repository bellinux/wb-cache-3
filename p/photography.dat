5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, under the {{influence}} of the United States where <b>photography</b> had become an academic discipline, exhibitions such as New American <b>Photography</b> in Copenhagen's Bella Center presented top artistic photographers of the 1950s and 1960s including Harry Callahan, Jerry Uelsmann and Diane Arbus. This was followed in 1973 by the opening of Galleriet for Creativ Fotografi (Gallery for Creative <b>Photography)</b> in Copenhagen, to be followed in 1977 by the IMAGE gallery in Aarhus which encouraged experimental <b>photography.</b> Subsequent exhibitions involved the landscape photographer Kirsten Klein, the pioneers of staged <b>photography</b> Nanna Bisp Büchert and Lis Steincke, as well as the magic realist Per Bak Jensen.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor thesis "CZECH PRESS PHOTO 1995 - 2005 : Picture content {{analysis}} of winning <b>photographies</b> in General News and Spot News categories" deals with {{the content of the}} <b>photographies,</b> which have won first eleven yearly awards of the photographic contest Czech Press Photo in the categories General News and Spot News. The aim of this work is to analyse, which events were so important that they gave rise to the winning <b>photographies</b> and which topics frequently appeared in the pictures. The second monitored aspect is the <b>photography's</b> location of origin and probation or refutation of the hypothesis, whether the local events provide enough visually appealing events or whether the photographers have to seek the photographic topics abroad...|$|R

5|$|Thanks to the {{increasing}} availability of simpler techniques, amateur <b>photography</b> gained popularity {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century.

5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional <b>photography,</b> although digital <b>photography,</b> which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white <b>photography</b> is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour <b>photography</b> requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E

5|$|<b>Photography</b> in Denmark has {{developed}} from strong participation {{and interest in}} the very beginnings of the art in 1839 {{to the success of}} a considerable number of Danes in the world of <b>photography</b> today.

Although Denmark was slow to accept <b>photography</b> as an art form, Danish photographers are now increasingly active, participating in key exhibitions around the world.|$|E
