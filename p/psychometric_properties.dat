Assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is critical to outcome assessment after total joint replacement, a surgery aimed at improving pain, function and HRQoL of the patients undergoing these procedures. In a recent study, Shi et al. examined the responsiveness to change of various subscales of two instruments, physician-administered Harris Hip Score and patient self-administered Short Form- 36 (SF- 36), 6 months after revision total hip arthroplasty. The responsiveness statistics for both scales were reasonable, higher for Harris Hip Score than SF- 36.

30|$|As {{possible}} {{limitations of}} the present study, it should be considered {{that the number of}} different samples could have biased MIA’s results, once differences in metamemory characteristics are expected among those different respondents. On the other hand, the use of different samples is a strategy that allows a broader generalisation, considering the larger population representativity, and all statistical assumptions for the parametric analyses used were met, which suggests that the use of different samples did not impaired MIA’s reduction. Also, the items difficulty variability indicates that the instrument captures an adequate extent of the construct. The heterogeneity of the sample may have contributed to this <b>psychometric</b> <b>property.</b> Our results comparing clinical and non-clinical samples are also limited, due to the small number of participants in the clinical group. future studies should further explore this relationship.|$|R
25|$|Regarding {{the issue}} of whether the breadth of infant {{attachment}} functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, {{it should be noted that}} continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate <b>psychometric</b> <b>properties.</b> These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports. The original Richter's et al. (1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases. Readers further interested in the categorical versus continuous nature of attachment classifications (and the debate surrounding this issue) should consult a paper by Fraley and Spieker and the rejoinders in the same issue by many prominent attachment researchers including J.

Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable <b>psychometric</b> <b>properties</b> in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget to put things back in their proper place or Am careful to avoid making mistakes can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E

While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable <b>psychometric</b> <b>properties</b> in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do.

In the second study, the author examined the validity and reliability of data collected from 1, 992 Indiana {{middle and high school}} students with the Adolescent Health Risk Behavior Survey (AHRBS) instrument. The AHRBS instrument was created using the Biopsychosocial Model (BPSM) theoretical framework and investigates the relationships and influences of adolescents? intrapersonal and normative perceptions on alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use. In the third study, the author used reliable measures for the data to conduct mediation analyses to examine the effects of adolescent perceptions of their social environment, such as perceived peer disapproval, perceived parental disapproval, and perceived peer behavior, on adolescent lifetime inhalant use in the presence of the theorized mediator variable, characteristics of the peer group. The author concluded the following: (1) published articles in the four health education journals inconsistently reported survey instrument characteristics or results of <b>psychometric</b> <b>property</b> testing for the data collected with survey instruments; (2) systematically eliminating items due to their limited contribution to scale reliability for these data using exploratory factor analyses, confirmatory factor analyses, and calculating internal consistency reliability shortened the AHRBS instrument by 41. 18 % and improved the reliability of measures for these data; and (3) the effects of perceived peer disapproval, perceived parental disapproval, and perceived peer behavior on adolescent lifetime inhalant use were significantly mediated by characteristics of the peer group as theorized by the BPSM. Findings of this dissertation have implications for the field of health education. First, survey instrument characteristics and internal reliability coefficients for data collected with instrument scales should be reported in published manuscripts. Second, researchers should examine the validity and reliability of data collected with survey instruments. Third, only reliable measures for the data should be used in statistical analyses...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} the Internet in {{personnel}} selection has brought with it many opportunities, challenges and concerns. The opportunities afforded to the employer include, among others, increased security, {{a reduction in the}} resources needed, reduced geographical constraints, reduced time to hire, immediate scoring and a lowering of costs. Owing to these benefits, the use of the Internet for psychological testing will continue to become more prevalent in personnel selection over the next few years. The use and acceptance of the Internet has encouraged organisations and assessment practitioners to make use of Internet-delivered testing as the preferred mode of administration, especially in view of the benefits that it offers to the employer, {{as well as to the}} candidate. Internet-delivered testing brings with it a few concerns and many organisations are still making use of the paper-and-pencil version of an instrument even though it is available in an online version. This is because of concerns over measurement equivalence, as the paper-and-pencil version is seen as a “safer” and more accepted mode of administration. There are also many test publishers that would like to take advantage of the practicability of Internet-delivered testing by converting their current selection procedures to an Internet format. This conversion cannot simply be assumed and needs to be examined and documented for each instrument. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the construct equivalence of the Customer Contact Styles Questionnaire (CCSQ 7. 2) when it is administered via paper-and-pencil in the presence of a proctor and when it is administered online in the absence of a proctor. The aim is to determine whether the online version of the CCSQ 7. 2 can be considered equivalent to its paper-and-pencil counterpart without loss of <b>psychometric</b> <b>property.</b> The results of the study revealed that the mode in which the CCSQ 7. 2 is administered does not compromise scale reliabilities and that the relationship between scales of the CCSQ 7. 2 are not affected by modes of administration.

Objective: To assess the responsiveness of the Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life (MusiQoL) questionnaire to change in disability over 24 months, defined by change in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Methods: Patients with MS were enrolled into a multicenter, longitudinal observational study. QoL was assessed using both the MusiQoL and the 36 -Item Short-Form (SF- 36) instruments at baseline and every 6 months thereafter up to month 24; neurological assessments, including EDSS score, were performed at each evaluation.
