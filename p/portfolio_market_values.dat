40|$|In {{this paper}} {{techniques}} are proposed for investment portfolio modeling. We assume that money time <b>value</b> and <b>market</b> prices are continuously changing values while investment portfolio structure is a discretely evolving object. With these assumptions an investment portfolio can be modeled with a hybrid system (hybrid automaton). A hybrid automaton {{is a dynamic}} system which combines both continuous and discrete dynamics. Its state can be presented as a vector having both continuously and discretely evolving components. A transition function for continuous components belongs to a pre-defined set of continuous curves from a given class (e. g. defined by differential equations), and jumps from one curve to another are allowed. Discrete component dynamics is defined by a finite automaton. The main point is that discrete and continuous transition functions interact. Hybrid system specific techniques {{can be used for}} further analysis of the model. Portfolio performance scenarios, such as tiny <b>portfolio</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> movements against a pre-defined desirable scenario (stability) which is important for hedgers or portfolio high profitability which is important for speculators, can be defined using hybrid tempora...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss one of the modern risk {{measuring}} techniques Value-at-Risk (VaR). Currently central banks in major money centers, {{under the auspices of}} the BIS Basle Committee, adopt the VaR system to evaluate the market risk of their supervised banks. Banks regulators ask all commercial banks to report VaRs with their internal models. Value at risk (VaR) is a powerful tool for assessing market risk, but it also imposes a challenge. Its power is its generality. Unlike market risk metrics such as the Greeks, duration and convexity, or beta, which are applicable to only certain asset categories or certain sources of market risk, VaR is general. It is based on the probability distribution for a <b>portfolio’s</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> Value at Risk (VAR) calculates the maximum loss expected (or worst case scenario) on an investment, over a given time period and given a specified degree of confidence. There are three methods by which VaR can be calculated: the historical simulation, the variance-covariance method and the Monte Carlo simulation. The variance-covariance method is easiest because you need to estimate only two factors: average return and standard deviation. However, it assumes returns are well-behaved according to the symmetrical normal curve and that historical patterns will repeat into the future. The historical simulation improves on the accuracy of the VAR calculation, but requires more computational data; it also assumes that “past is prologue”. The Monte Carlo simulation is complex, but has the advantage of allowing users to tailor ideas about future patterns that depart from historical patterns...|$|R

The concept of {{business}} ethics arises to examine how a firm could meet the goal of maximizing firm value while in the meantime meditating the conflicts among all the stakeholders ethically. Recently, the concept of business ethics evolves into corporate social responsibility (CSR), which now {{has become a major}} issue in the business environment. The modern definition of CSR argues that a firm, as a corporate citizen, is expected not only to fulfill its economic responsibility, but also its social and environmental responsibilities. Built on this new definition, this study aims to empirically explore the impact of fulfilling CSR on stock performance. For this research purpose, we construct a local CSR index (CSRI) based on two ideas, socially responsible investment (SRI) and corporate contributions to stakeholders.

Using two major liquidity measures, I find that local liquidity risk is significantly priced for stocks in most of these markets in addition to Fama-French three local factors. The premium for local liquidity risk is significantly lower {{in a country where the}} country-level corporate board is more effective and there is less insider trading activity. I also discover that global liquidity risk is positively priced for these 23 diversified <b>market</b> <b>portfolios</b> after controlling for global <b>market,</b> <b>value,</b> and size factors. The contributions of global liquidity risk to the returns of locally-diversified <b>market</b> <b>portfolios</b> are economically and statistically significant across and within economic regions.

I also examine whether international investors are concerned about aggregate volatility risk at the local level and at the global level. I find that local volatility innovation is a priced risk factor for stocks in some countries. I also discover that global volatility innovation is negatively priced for these 23 <b>market</b> <b>portfolios</b> after controlling for global <b>market,</b> <b>value</b> and size factors. In sharp contrast to the stock level, I uncover that both local total volatility and local idiosyncratic volatility have high expected <b>market</b> <b>portfolio</b> returns even after adjusting for these global factors. They dominate these four global factors in explaining <b>market</b> <b>portfolio</b> returns. Supporting Merton’s (1987) incomplete information model, this result suggests that idiosyncratic stock volatility can be diversified away when investors hold locally-diversified <b>market</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Global investors are rewarded by high returns for bearing high risk characteristic measured by local volatility in a country.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{quantify}} the potential cost of liquidity constraints {{on a long}} equity portfolio using the liquidity risk framework of Acerbi and Scandolo (2008). The model modifies the classical mark-to-market valuation model, and incorporates the impact of liquidity policies of portfolios on the liquidity adjustment valuation (LVA). Also, we suggest a quantitative indicator that scores market liquidity ranging from 0 to 1 (perfect liquidity) for a portfolio with possible liquidity constraints. The thesis consists of three major studies. In the first one, we compute LVA given the cash, minimum weight and portfolio expected shortfall (ES) liquidity policies on a long equity portfolio. Several numerical examples in the results demonstrate the importance associated the incorporation of the liquidity policy in the liquidity risk valuation. In the second study, we quantify the execution costs and the revenue risk when implementing trading strategies over multiple periods by employing the transaction costs measure of Garleanu and Pedersen (2013). The portfolio liquidity costs estimated from the model of Garleanu and Pedersen (2013) are compared with the costs estimated from the liquidity risk measure of Finger (2011). In the third study, we estimate the liquidity-adjusted portfolio ES for a long equity portfolio with the liquidity constraints. <b>Portfolio</b> pure <b>market</b> P&L scenarios are based on initial positions, and the liquidity adjustments are based on positions sold, which depend on the specified liquidity constraints. <b>Portfolio</b> pure <b>market</b> P&L scenarios and state-dependent liquidity adjustments are integrated to obtain liquidity-adjusted P&L scenarios. Then, we apply the liquidity score method (Meucci, 2012) on the liquidity-plus-market P&L distribution to quantify the market liquidity for the portfolio. The results show the importance of pricing liquidity risk with liquidity constraints.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide additional evidence on the relationship between financial leverage and the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of common stock. ^ Numerous empirical studies have been done in this area, and, concurrently, many theories have been developed to explain the relationship between financial leverage and the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of common stock. Because of the methodological weaknesses of past studies, however, no conclusions can be drawn as to the validity of the theories. ^ Theories on financial leverage may be classified into three categories: irrelevance theorem, rising from value indefinitely with increase in financial leverage, and optimal financial leverage. Empirical implications of these categories along with the consequences of serious confounding effects are analyzed. The implications are then compared with evidence from actual events involving financial leverage changes, and distinguished from each other as finely as possible, using simple and multiple regression analyses, normal Z-test, and a simulation technique. ^ The evidence shows that changes in the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of common stock are positively related to changes in financial leverage for some firms and negatively related for other firms. This evidence is consistent with the existence of an optimal financial leverage for each firm, assuming that financial leverages of firms with a positive relationship are below the optimum and those of firms with a negative relationship are above the optimum. ^ The results of the study do not depend upon the definition of the <b>market</b> <b>portfolio,</b> the definition of the event period, or the choice of financial leverage measure.
