5|$|Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia {{defeated}} Pakistan in {{a one-day}} match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply. There were suspicions that the Pakistanis had thrown {{the game by}} batting slowly, although Warne said he had genuinely tried his best, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> that he was named man-of-the-match. Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly {{on the final day}} of the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne denied that he had thrown the match, again <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a one-day match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but it was not enough to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.|$|E
50|$|After a spymaster {{gives the}} hint with its word and number, their field {{operatives}} make guesses about which code name cards bear words {{related to the}} hint and <b>point</b> them <b>out,</b> one at a time. When a code name card is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the spymaster covers that card with an appropriate identity card -- a blue agent card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander card, or the assassin card -- as indicated on the spymasters' map of the grid. If the assassin is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the game ends immediately, with the team who identified him losing. If {{an agent of the}} other team is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the turn ends immediately, and that other team is also one agent closer to winning. If an innocent bystander is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the turn simply ends; but note that this also eliminates one more potential wrong guess that the other team might have made, right before their turn. If an agent of the playing team is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the team may <b>point</b> <b>out</b> another card if they have guesses left. Again, the maximum number of guesses in any turn is the hint's number plus one.|$|R
