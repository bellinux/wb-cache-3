Ferraro was connected with many other political and non-profit organizations. She was a board member of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She became president of the newly established International Institute for Women's Political Leadership in 1989. In 1992, she was on the founding board of Project Vote Smart. By 1993, she was serving on the Fordham Law School Board of Visitors, as well as on the boards of the National Breast Cancer Research Fund, the New York Easter Seal Society, and the Pension Rights Center, and was one of hundreds of public figures on the Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Board of Advocates. In 1999, she joined the board of the Bertarelli Foundation, and in 2003, the board of the National Women's Health Resource Center. During the 2000s she was on the board of advisors to the Committee to Free Lori Berenson.|$|E
5|$|Benavidez Elementary School, {{which opened}} on Tuesday January 21, 1992, {{relieved}} Cunningham of around 675 students and 29 teachers. Benavidez, {{along with two}} other schools, {{was a part of}} a $370 million Houston ISD school construction project, which originated from a school bond approved in March 1989. Rose Garza, the principal of Benavidez, said that the committee determining the name of the school named it after Roy P. Benavidez, a soldier in the Vietnam War who was given the Medal of Honor, because the school wanted to name the school after a Hispanic who could serve as a <b>positive</b> <b>role</b> model to the mostly Hispanic student body that occupied the school when it opened. HISD officials said that the district had little difficulty opening the three schools {{in the middle of the}} year, since the same teachers had been teaching the same students while they occupied the previously overcrowded schools in the preceding fall. On its opening day Benavidez referred 400 students to other schools due to overcrowding. After Benavidez opened, Benavidez and Cunningham each had about 700 students. In 1994, Benavidez had 1,065 pupils and it had to send 200 children to different schools. As of that year, 88% of Benavidez's children were Hispanic. By 1996, both Cunningham and Benavidez became overcrowded. Gordon also became a reliever school for Benavidez and another non-Gulfton school. SER-Niños opened in 1996. In 2000 Benavidez had 1,300 students and Cunningham had 1,190 students. At the schools, the average classroom size was 30 students, exceeding the state's recommendation of 22 students per classroom.|$|E

25|$|Like Antonescu and Potopeanu, Pântea faced {{trial in}} front of the newly created People's Tribunal. In the end, he was acquitted, since Yelena Rudenko and Tolbukhin {{informed}} the Romanian state about Pântea's honorable conduct, and since the Allied Commission recommended his release. Pântea was arrested on several other occasions, but, singularly among Romanians prosecuted for war crimes, he was acquitted each time. Although his rivals in the Transnistrian administration were by then destroying evidence of his more <b>positive</b> <b>role</b> in the affairs of state, Pântea preserved certified copies as a precautionary measure.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to its abrupt nationalization of the IPC {{and then of}} the largest copper mining company, the government turned mainly to purchases through negotiation to acquire {{the property of the}} International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT) and foreign banks. Partly in response to United States reactions to the earlier nationalizations, and perhaps also partly in response to the realization that foreign investment might play a <b>positive</b> <b>role</b> in the industrialization drive, the government began to take a milder position toward foreign firms. But at the same time, it pursued a policy of creating new state-owned firms, in a sense competing for position against domestic private ownership, as well as against foreign ownership.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Sachs' critique, Acemoglu and Robinson replied on their book blog with twelve specific points. First, {{on the role}} of geography, Acemoglu and Robinson agree that geography is crucial in shaping institutions but do not recognize a deterministic role of geography in economic performance. Second, on the <b>positive</b> <b>role</b> authoritarian governments can play in economic growth, {{especially in the case of}} China, the fast economic growth could be part of the catch-up effect. However, it does not mean that authoritarian governments are better than democratic governments in promoting economic growth. It is still way too early, according to Acemoglu and Robinson, to draw a definite conclusion solely based on the example of China. Last, on industrialization, they argue that industrialization is contingent upon institutions.|$|E
25|$|Springtails {{are well}} known as pests of some {{agricultural}} crops. Sminthurus viridis, the lucerne flea, {{has been shown to}} cause severe damage to agricultural crops, and is considered as a pest in Australia. Onychiuridae are also known to feed on tubers and to damage them to some extent. However, by their capacity to carry spores of mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhiza-helper bacteria on their tegument, soil springtails play a <b>positive</b> <b>role</b> in the establishment of plant-fungal symbioses and thus are beneficial to agriculture. They also contribute to controlling plant fungal diseases through their active consumption of mycelia and spores of damping-off and pathogenic fungi. It has been suggested that they could be reared to be used for the control of pathogenic fungi in greenhouses and other indoor cultures.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between humour and ageing from the 1970 s to the 1990 s and fndings from a historical {{study of how}} American artists portray older adults showed {{what appears to be}} little change in stereotypical representations of older people {{in one of the most}} widely read forms of humour in American popular culture, the comic strip. Variables were age, gender, and roles of people 56 years and over in strips published in the Washington Post during April of 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992. The number of older characters in American comic strips declined in the last ten years of the study. Men were more frequently represented than women. Women were almost equal to men in strong, <b>positive</b> <b>roles</b> despite the fact that they were represented 870 times and men 1511 times. Most women were portrayed in either <b>positive</b> or negative <b>roles</b> while a quarter of men were portrayed in indeterminate roles. The negative roles of women were double those of <b>positive</b> or strong <b>roles,</b> while the number of negative roles for men was three times the number of <b>positive</b> <b>roles...</b>|$|R

While he and Moscone were assassinated shortly thereafter, both became viewed as martyrs for gay rights.

25|$|Biological invasions and {{the spread}} of {{pathogens}} and diseases are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already existing environment. They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare. In some cases a new species may wreak havoc on a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a <b>positive</b> <b>role.</b> The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion.|$|E
25|$|Like many {{characters}} in his films, Jones has some autobiographical elements of Spielberg. Indiana lacks a proper father figure {{because of his}} strained relationship with his father, Henry Senior. His own contained anger is misdirected towards Professor Abner Ravenwood, his mentor at the University of Chicago, leading to a strained relationship with Marion Ravenwood. The teenage Indiana bases his own look on a figure from the prologue of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, after being given his hat. Marcus Brody acts as Indiana's <b>positive</b> <b>role</b> model at the college. Indiana's own insecurities are made worse {{by the absence of}} his mother. In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, he becomes the father figure to Willie Scott and Short Round, to survive; he is rescued from Kali's evil by Short Round's dedication.
