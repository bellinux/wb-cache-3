5|$|A further four {{conversions}} to <b>push-pull</b> capability appeared between 1960–62. This was {{the result}} of short-framed M7s having long frames substituted during overhaul in order to create room for the air compressor.|$|E
5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} <b>push-pull</b> train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated <b>push-pull</b> coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the electric multiple units used on Metro-North's New Haven Line, which are also purchased {{in part by the}} state of Connecticut, all SLE trains are diesel <b>push-pull</b> trains.|$|E
5|$|The legume vine Mucuna pruriens {{is used in}} the {{countries}} of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic Imperata cylindrica grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light. Mucuna pruriens is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area. Desmodium uncinatum can be used in <b>push-pull</b> farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (Striga).|$|E
5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this <b>push-pull</b> working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in <b>push-pull</b> service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
5|$|The LSWR M7 {{class is}} {{a class of}} 0-4-4 {{passenger}} tank locomotive built between 1897 and 1911. The class was designed by Dugald Drummond for use on the intensive London network of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), and performed well in such tasks. Because of their utility, 105 were built and the class went through several modifications over five production batches. For this reason there were detail variations such as frame length. Many of the class were fitted with <b>push-pull</b> operation gear that enabled efficient use on branch line duties without the need to change {{to the other end}} of its train at the end of a journey.|$|E
5|$|Government of Ontario Transit (later {{abbreviated}} as 'GO Transit') {{started as}} a three-year long experiment on May 23, 1967 running single-deck trains powered by diesel locomotives in <b>push-pull</b> configuration on a single rail line along Lake Ontario's shoreline. GO Train service ran throughout the day from Oakville to Pickering with limited rush hour train service to Hamilton. The experiment proved to be extremely popular; GO Transit carried its first million riders during its first four months, and averaged 15,000 per day soon after. This line, now divided as the Lakeshore East and Lakeshore West lines is the keystone corridor of GO Transit. Expansion of rail service continued in the 1970s and 1980s, aimed at developing ridership in {{with the introduction of}} the Georgetown (now Kitchener) line in 1974 and the Richmond Hill line in 1978. The Milton GO Train line opened in 1981, followed by the Bradford (now Barrie) and Stouffville lines a year later, establishing the 7 rail corridors that today's rail service is based upon.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1959, gallery {{cars on the}} Chicago and Northwestern were {{equipped}} with the AAR standard multiple-unit train control system and a control cab that allowed true high speed <b>push-pull</b> train operations without requiring any operators in the locomotive when operating in push mode. This combination of high passenger capacity, rapid turnaround (or flip-backs) and highly reliable <b>push-pull</b> operations has resulted in almost universal adoption of bilevel <b>push-pull</b> operations for commuter and non-electrified corridor services throughout North America.|$|E
25|$|PP = <b>Push-Pull</b> logic, OD = Open-Drain logic.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the number}} series {{originally}} {{carried by the}} railcars and that used for the <b>push–pull</b> conversions have been reused. Iarnród Éireann's first order of diesel multiple units, from Tokyu Car Corporation of Japan, received numbers in the 26xx series when delivered in 1994. Previously, the 61xx and 63xx series had been used, respectively, for driving and intermediate <b>push–pull</b> cars based on the British Rail Mark 3 design.|$|E
25|$|ZSSK {{operates}} 19 electric {{multiple units}} of Class 671 and 10 <b>push-pull</b> units of Class 951 manufactured by Škoda Transportation.|$|E
25|$|In Iran, the Tehran-Hashtgerd {{suburban}} {{commuter line}} is served with electric <b>push-pull</b> hauled trainsets with double-decker carriages manufactured by Wagon Pars in Iran.|$|E
25|$|The Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I was a World War I German twin engine, <b>push-pull</b> {{configuration}} triplane fighter aircraft. Only one was built, crashing on {{its first}} flight.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-four {{coaches were}} built for <b>push-pull</b> {{operation}} on the suburban rail service including 5 built to Control Cars (6101–05, 6301–19). Originally {{used in conjunction}} with the 121 Class locomotives they were last used with 201 Class locomotives. There were a number of differences between the Irish <b>push-pull</b> Mark 3's and the standard Mark 3's. An underfloor generator, mounted in the Control Car, provided electrical power to the coaches; unlike on the standard Mark 3's, which used a special generator van. This single generator was not as powerful as the two used in the Mark 3 generator vans and was the main reason the sets were limited to 6 cars. Irish Mark 3 <b>push-pull</b> based rolling stock did not have air conditioning and had opening windows instead. There was also a 70mph speed restriction imposed on the train {{due to the fact that}} three of the Control Cars were fitted with LHB bogies from an 8100 Class DART. and were air-braked.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} other Le Rhône series engines, the 9C {{featured}} highly visible telescopic copper induction pipes {{and used a}} single <b>push-pull</b> rod to operate its two overhead valves.|$|E
25|$|ACE {{operates}} <b>push-pull</b> trains with {{a single}} diesel locomotive and six or seven bilevel coach cars. Trains typically operate with the locomotive leading westbound and the cab car leading eastbound.|$|E
25|$|The Adam A500 is an American six-seat civil utility {{aircraft}} that {{was produced by}} Adam Aircraft Industries. The aircraft is of pod-and-boom, <b>push-pull</b> configuration with its two Continental TSIO-550-E piston engines mounted to provide centerline thrust.|$|E
25|$|Fitness test: The {{final stage}} of the {{application}} process is a fitness test involving completing one circuit of an activity course within three minutes and forty five seconds and a twenty-second test on a <b>push-pull</b> machine.|$|E
25|$|Secunderabad Station is {{also the}} hub of {{suburban}} transit trains (<b>push-pull</b> trains). These DHMU's run in the non-electrified rail lines {{in the suburbs of}} the Hyderabad Urban Area. These also run in the electrified lines of MMTS).|$|E
25|$|Vehicle nos. 94300/301 {{were the}} {{prototype}} Propelling Control Vehicles. Due to their non-standard nature, {{they have since}} had their <b>push-pull</b> equipment isolated and are used as standard parcels vans. To reflect this change, the two vehicles have been renumbered to 95300/301.|$|E
25|$|The Thomas-Morse MB-4 was a {{prototype}} American mailplane of the 1920s. It was of unusual design, being a biplane with twin fuselages housing {{the crew of}} two and a central nacelle which carried the aircraft's twin engines in a <b>push-pull</b> configuration.|$|E
25|$|The R.XIV closely resembled {{previous}} Zeppelin-Staaken R-planes differing only in {{engine installation}} and details. The five Maybach MbIV engines were arranged as <b>push-pull</b> pairs in the nacelles, with the engineer accommodated between the engines, {{and a single}} tractor engine in the nose.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 {{they were}} {{replaced}} on this service by Class 73 electro-diesel locomotives operating in <b>push-pull</b> with Class 488 coaching sets and Class 489 luggage vans. The twelve units were then converted back to standard sets, and regained their original unit numbers.|$|E
25|$|The MP-54s were {{replaced}} in the 1960s and 1970s with the Silverliner EMU cars, {{which are still}} in use today. More recently, SEPTA acquired <b>push-pull</b> coaches from the Bombardier corporation, which are hauled by AEM-7 electric locomotives {{similar to those used}} by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit.|$|E
25|$|From new, {{all members}} of the class were fitted with the Pullman style rubbing plate between the buffers {{allowing}} them to close couple with Southern Region electro-pneumatically controlled electric multiple units and diesel electric multiple units for <b>push-pull</b> train operation - the reason for retractable buffers.|$|E
25|$|All MBTA {{commuter}} rail service {{is provided by}} <b>push-pull</b> trains powered by diesel locomotives with a cab car on the opposite end. Trains typically have four to eight coaches (with six the most common) and seat between 400 and 1400 passengers. Approximately 58 trainsets are needed for weekday service.|$|E
25|$|Almost all the <b>push–pull</b> {{vehicles}} were scrapped at Mullingar or Dundalk. One, driving trailer 6111 (the former railcar 2624), was {{set aside for}} possible preservation. It remained at Inchicore in a derelict condition until 7 February 2015, when it was purchased by {{and moved to the}} Downpatrick and County Down Railway.|$|E
25|$|Ki-84-II: Sometimes {{known as}} the 'Hayate-Kai', the Ki-84-II had certain {{duralumin}} components replaced with ones made of wood and plywood, mainly concerning the rear fuselage, tail unit elements, wing tips, <b>push-pull</b> rods and other, minor components. This model was produced with the designations Ko, Otsu and Hei depending on the armament.|$|E
25|$|Fitted {{with three}} Rolls Royce Condor engines in a two tractor and one central pusher {{configuration}} - as originally {{intended for the}} Fury, two 1000 hp Cosmos Hercules engines or four 450hp Napier Lion engines in <b>push-pull</b> pairs. The design was similar to Porte's G5 variant of the Felixstowe F.5.|$|E
25|$|The {{practical}} {{amplifier circuit}} {{to the right}} could {{be the basis for}} a moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class-AB <b>push–pull</b> output stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.|$|E
25|$|The units {{continued}} to be used on these services until mid-2004, when the hire period ended. They were transferred south in two batches, and were replaced on the North Berwick branch by EWS Class 90 electric locomotives hauling former Virgin Trains Mk.3 coaching stock. To enable trains to reverse, the locomotive operates in <b>push-pull</b> mode with a Driving Van Trailer.|$|E
25|$|The {{units were}} {{converted}} from Class 414 driving motors cars, by Eastleigh works in 1983-84, {{for use on}} the new Gatwick Express service. They were used to allow <b>push-pull</b> operations, on the London-end of the rakes of Class 488 stock, with a Class 73 locomotive {{at the other end}} and both used for propulsion. The units were used as baggage cars.|$|E
25|$|The Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) 2600 Class were Associated Equipment Company (AEC)–engined diesel {{multiple}} units (normally termed railcars in Ireland) that operated InterCity and suburban services on the CIÉ system between 1952 and 1975. Many were later converted for <b>push–pull</b> operation with diesel locomotives, finally being withdrawn when {{displaced by the}} electric Dublin Area Rapid Transit service in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the turbulence caused the torque tube driving the port elevator to break; this would allow the port elevator to move freely, but the pilots would still retain approximately half of their attitude control. The aircraft also had a defective <b>push–pull</b> rod and worn steering cables, although it is not certain if this was part of the cause.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{nacelles}} {{consisted of}} semi-monocoque wooden constructions, with the paired engines amidships, a cockpit for the engineer and defensive gun {{position for the}} gunner either forward or behind of the engines depending on whether a pusher or tractor arrangement was used. Aircraft using <b>push-pull</b> nacelles, i.e. individual propellers for each engine, had no provision for defensive armament, just a cockpit for the engineer amidships.|$|E
