40|$|The {{increasing}} concentration of CO 2 and other greenhouse gasses (GHGs) {{in the atmosphere}} warms up the earth's surface and causes drastic changes to the climate. Therefore, reducing energy consumption {{in order to reduce}} GHGs emission from the manufactures become urgent, especially in developing new industries such as Slow Release Fertilizer (SRF) urea plant. In this work, mixing in an orbiting screw mixer designed for solid-solid mixing was investigated. Mixing was carried out using urea powder and natural zeolite powder by varying three particle sizes i. e. groups of > 50 mesh, > 60 mesh and > 80 mesh. Mixing process was conducted to examine the influence of orbital and rotation speeds combined with air injection, as well as the particle size of urea-natural zeolite to the specific energy consumption. Achieving a good homogeneity of mixture with a shorter mixing time, thus, power and energy consumption, was one goal of this work. The power consumption was calculated from measured torque of orbital and screw obtained by computerized record. Specific energy consumption was calculated by total power with time tied the homogeneity of the mixture for each <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>group.</b> Experimental results showed that the higher of the orbital and rotation speed, the higher energy consumption. It can be seen that power consumption was dominated by rotation motion of the screw. Smaller particle size required higher power for mixing process due to their cohesiveness. Mixing process used a modified orbiting screw mixer with air injection showed lower power consumption for each <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>group</b> compared with that of no air injection. This paper also developed a derivation of the power equation model of mixing in the orbiting screw mixer. The influence of speed of mixer in an orbiting screw mixer on the power consumption can be expressed by the Power Number. ...|$|E

The method is based on inducing an ultrasonic compression standing wave inside a microchannel. A finite element approach is used to model the acoustic and electro-mechanical behavior of the piezoelectric material, the microchannel geometry {{as well as the}} fluid inside the channel. The choices of silicon and PDMS materials are investigated as the chip materials for the resonator. A separation channel geometry which is commonly used in the literature is implemented in this study and the fluid flow inside the microchannel geometry is simulated using computational fluid dynamics. The acoustic field inside the fluid channel is also be simulated using the finite element method. For the separation process to be successful microparticles of different diameter groups should end up in different channels of the microseparator. In order to simulate real life scenarios, each <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>group</b> (such as 3 micron particles or 10 micron particles) have a size distribution within themselves. For realistic simulation results the particles will be released into the micro separator from a different starting locations (starting location distribution).

Four <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>groups,</b> 90 - 180 μm, 180 - 250 μm, 250 - 315 μm and 315 - 500 μm and 22 different volumetric flow rates were used, corresponding to Rep of 0. 012 to 1. 452. All <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> showed smooth flow rate vs expanded bed height curves. As is proven, the Ergun equation is useful for determining the minimum fluidization velocity for the large <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> by using a fixed sphericity value of 0. 354. For the fluidized bed regime (us>umf), the Ergun equation fails to represent the data as it results in fluctuating particle sphericity values, while the Richardson-Zaki model seems to correlate {{the data for the}} large <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> only.

The effects of rotation speed and orbital speed of the mixer and <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> on power consumption, homogeneity, mixing time and specific energy consumption are evaluated. The experimental results show that higher orbital speed gives higher power consumption. Power consumption is dominated by mixer rotation motion. Smaller <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> needs higher power for mixing process. Nitrogen mass fraction ranges from 0. 45 to 0. 49 when mixture reaches homogeneity. The mixing time required is about 5 – 12 minutes for <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of > 60 and > 80 mesh and 7 – 14 minutes for <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of > 50 mesh. At constant orbit speed, the higher the screw rotation speed, the shorter time needed to reach mixture homogeneity. Specific energy consumption of mixing process increases with decreasing <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> For the three <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> of > 80 mesh, > 60 mesh and > 50 mesh, the lowest specific energy consumption is given by combination of orbital speed of 5 rpm and rotation speed of 50 rpm; while for <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of > 60 mesh and > 80 mesh, it can obtained by combination of orbital speed of 5 rpm and rotation speed of 67, 5 rpm and orbital speed 5 rpm and rotation speed 30 rpm, respectively.

Lymphoscintigraphy identifies up to one-third of breast cancer patients with extra-axillary drainage, which is mainly located in the IM chain. Our aim in this meta-analysis is to identify the lymphoscintigraphy technique variables that effect IM node identification. M ethods: An internet database was utilized to review articles concerning sentinel nodes and breast cancer from 1993 {{through the end of}} 2011; 74 articles met our inclusion criteria. The total number of patients included was 22959. We grouped the citations by injection location and injection material. We then analyzed the rate of identification of IM nodes according to these groupings and their subsets. Results: The overall IM identification rate using the random effect model was 9 %. The injection location had the most significant impact on IM identification rate; the deeper injections were associated with the highest rate of identification. Variation in IM identification was associated with the particle size of injection material; the smaller <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>group</b> had a higher rate of identification. Increased dose of the tracer was also associated with increased identification rate. Conclusions: The use of smaller particle size tracers and a deeper injection location achieve the highest IM identification rate. The dose of the tracer also increased the identification rate. These observations can help in the selection of patients for IM sentinel node biopsy, which can affect their prognosis and treatment management. </p...|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{potential}} adverse health effects of engineered nanoparticles stems {{in part from the}} possibility that some materials display unique chemical and physical properties at nanoscales which could exacerbate their biological activity. However, studies that have assessed the effect of particle size across a comprehensive set of biological responses have not been reported. Using a macrophage cell model, we demonstrate that the ability of unopsonized amorphous silica particles to stimulate inflammatory protein secretion and induce macrophage cytotoxicity scales closely with the total administered particle surface area across a wide range of particle diameters (7 – 500 nm). Whole genome microarray analysis of the early gene expression changes induced by 10 - and 500 -nm particles showed that the magnitude of change for the majority of genes affected correlated more tightly with particle surface area than either particle mass or number. Gene expression changes that were particle size-specific were also identified. However, the overall biological processes represented by all gene expression changes were nearly identical, irrespective of particle diameter. Direct comparison of the cell processes represented in the 10 - and 500 -nm particle gene sets using gene set enrichment analysis revealed that among 1009 total biological processes, none were statistically enriched in one <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>group</b> over the other. The key mechanisms involved in silica nanoparticle-mediated gene regulation and cytotoxicity have yet to be established. However, our results suggest that on an equivalent nominal surface area basis, common biological modes of action are expected for nano- and supranano-sized silica particles...|$|E

The precipitator under consideration was poorly mixed, with particles settling to a high concentration in {{the lower part of the}} tank.

40|$|Abstract. Titanium {{is widely}} used in {{biomedical}} implants because of its excellent mechanical properties, good biocompatibility and high resistance to corrosion. However, the fabrication of titanium components often involves high cost due to the long processing time and difficulty in metalworking. Powder metallurgy is a near-net-shape processing method which {{has the advantage of}} high production rate with low unit cost. In this study, a technique comprising microwave sintering with powder metallurgy has been developed to fabricate titanium components. Commercially pure titanium powdered compacts, prepared by three initial <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> of 10 ± 2 µm, 30 ± 2 µm, and 50 ± 2 µm, were sintered in a 1. 4 kW, 2. 45 GHz microwave multi-mode furnace for 2 minutes using silicon carbide particles as the microwave susceptor to assist the heating. The room temperature deformation behavior of titanium components was investigated. Metallographic studies of the porosity and pore size were undertaken by optical microscopy. The results {{of this study indicate that}} irregular shaped pores were uniformly distributed within the sintered specimens. Furthermore, the pore size and porosity of the sintered specimens decrease with decreasing initial <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> The compressive yield strength showed a linear relationship with the porosity, and was found to follow the Hall-Petch relationship with the initial <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> This study demonstrated that it is feasible to microwave sinter titanium components having various compressive yield strengths by controlling the initial powder size of the titanium. 1...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the basic characteristics of degradable gelatin microspheres (GMSs), including their embolic behavior and degradation periods {{when they are}} used as embolic materials in the renal arteries of rabbit models. Materials and Methods: Based on the GMS particle size, 24 kidneys were divided into 3 groups of eight kidneys, and each group was embolized with a different GMS <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> (<b>group</b> 1 : 35 100 m, group 2 : 100 200 m, and group 3 : 200 300 m). From each group, two rabbits were sacrificed immediately after embolization (day 0), {{and a pair of}} rabbits from each group underwent an angiogram and were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 14, respectively, after embolization. The level of arterial occlusion, the pathological changes in the renal parenchyma, and the degradation of the GMSs were evaluated angiographically and histologically. Results: A follow-up angiogram on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 revealed the presence of wedge-shaped poorly-enhanced areas in the parenchymal phase as seen in all groups. The size of these areas tended to increase with the particle diameter, and persisted up to day 14. On days 3, 7, and 14, parenchymal infarctions were observed histologically in all cases, and this observation corresponded with the parenchyma being supplied by the embolized arteries. GMSs of group 1 mainly reached the interlobular arteries, while those of group 3 mainly reached the interlobar arteries. In all but two cases, the GMSs were identified histologically even on day 14, and sequential degradation was histologically identified in all GMS groups. Conclusion: GMSs can be used as degradable embolic materials which can control the level of embolization...|$|E

The apparent volatile flames from the prepared <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> were observed within 20 – 50 ms. To assess the effect of oxygen concentration, particles were burned for their flame characteristics {{in a range of}} 10 %– 40 % O 2. The test particles were sieved into three <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> (215 – 255 μm, 255 – 300 μm and 300 – 350 μm) to assess the effect of <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> Special <b>particles</b> for the co-firing effect were collected individually from two types of mixed pellet: 20 : 80 and 50 : 50 coal/wood. Pure sub-bituminous coal and wood particles were also prepared in order to compare their combustion behaviours.

The experimental results showed distinguishable flame characteristics from single particles of coal, 50 : 50 coal/wood, 20 : 80 coal/wood and wood, including soot flame size and intensity. The impact of high coal-blending ratio caused an increase in the flame size and intensity and the ignition time was close to that of pure coal particles.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study of {{particle}} deposition and rebound behaviour in a vertical two-dimensional ventilation duct, employing a Lagrangian particle model incorporating an algebraic rigid particle-wall impact model. A RNG κ - ε turbulence model was applied to solve the turbulent duct flow. Fifteen <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> ranging from 5 to 200 μm are investigated with one-way coupling approach. The turbulent airflow and particle movement were validated by experimental data. Adopting the particle-wall impact model, the dimensionless deposition velocities have been predicted smaller than those using conventional "trap" model, especially for particles of large relaxation time. The dimensionless deposition velocity and deposition fraction would first increase, and then decrease with increasing particle diameter. The deposition and capture fraction would roughly decrease with increasing frictional velocity. Additionally, Saffman force has {{played an important role}} in this improved wall model. This paper has demonstrated that particle rebound could have a considerable effect on the deposition and concentration of large particles in rooms and ventilation ducts.

We examined LDL <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> by 2 - 16 % gradient gel electrophoresis in 275 men with CAD (> 75 % cross-sectional-area stenosis) and 822 controls. Seven major LDL size bands (with LDL- 1 [d= 1. 025 - 1. 033 g/ml] being the largest and LDL- 7 [d = 1. 050 - 1. 063 g/ml, the smallest]) were identified. Because most subjects had two or more adjacent LDL bands, an LDL score was calculated for each subject, with the relative area in each band taken into consideration. Four major LDL <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> were classified in the present studies: large LDL, intermediate LDL, small LDL, and very small LDL. The use of 0 -blockers was significantly associated with smaller LDL particles. After adjusting for use of this medication, small LDL particles were still more prevalent in CAD patients (39 %) compared with controls (27 %). The prevalence of large LDL particles was lower in CAD patients (3 %) than in controls (24 %). Intermediate LDL particles were the most prevalent in both groups, 49 % in CAD patients and 46 % in controls. The difference in LDL <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> between CAD patients and controls was not independent but was highly associated (/>< 0. 0001) with elevated trigryceride levels and decreased nigh density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Signifi-cantly higher LDL cholesterol levels were found in subjects with intermediate and small LDL particles than in those with large or very small LDL particles. In addition, CAD patients with intermediate or small LDL particles had significantly (p< 0. 01) lower HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels and higher LDL cholesterol levels than did controls in the same group. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and HDL and LDL cholesterol levels were strong discrimi-nators between CAD patients and controls, while triglycerides and LDL <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> did not add significant information to the model.

40|$|To {{simulate}} dispersed two-phase flows CFD {{tools for}} predicting the local particle number density {{and the size}} distribution are required. These quantities do not only {{have a significant effect}} on rates of mixing, heterogeneous chemical reaction rates or interfacial heat and mass transfers, but also a direct relevance to the hydrodynamics of the total system, such as the flow pattern and flow regime. The Multiple <b>Size</b> <b>Group</b> (MUSIG) model available in the commercial codes CFX- 4 and CFX- 5 was developed for this purpose. Mathematically, this model is based on the population balance method and the two-fluid modeling approach. The dispersed phase is divided into N size classes. In order to reduce the computational cost, all <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> are assumed to share the same velocity field. This model allows to use a sufficient number of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> required for the coalescence and breakup calculation. Nevertheless, the assumption also restricts its applicability to homogeneous dispersed flows. We refer to the CFX MUSIG model mentioned above as the homogeneous model, which fails to predict the correct phase distribution when heterogeneous particle motion becomes important. In many flows the non-drag forces play an essential role with respect to the bubble motion. Especially, the lift force acting on large deformed bubbles, which is dominated by the asymmetrical wake, has a direction opposite to the shear induced lift force on a small bubble. This bubble separation cannot be predicted by the homogeneous MUSIG model. In order to overcome this shortcoming we developed an efficient inhomogeneous MUSIG model in cooperation with ANSYS CFX. A novel multiple velocity multiple <b>size</b> <b>group</b> model, which incorporates the population balance equation into the multi-fluid modeling framework, was proposed.

For this purpose serial filtration over different mesh size and parallel filtration over different mesh size methods were compared. Water samples were taken from before drum filter, after drum filter and after bio-filter (MBBR) and filtrated through eight different mesh size classes and calculated in mg suspended solids per liter (mgSS/l). Serial method is telling about suspended solids between two filter sizes, while parallel method tells about suspended solids bigger of a given filter size. Each filtering method was done three times in three different days. Results of serial filtration showed large difference in mgSS/l between days, especially between 0, 45 – 10 µm. Small particles (< 30 µm) are dominating in both methods. Water before drum filter contains a lot of large particles which are reduced after treatment in the drum filter. First and third days of serial filtration were more effective for the total suspended solids (TSS) after drum filter, unlike the second day which showed no decrease of TSS after drum filter: 9, 71 mgSS/l before drum filter, and 10 mgSS/l after drum filter. In the first day TSS before drum filter was 23, 58 mgSS/l and after drum filter it was reduced to 8, 8 mgSS/l. In the third day experiment showed 27, 73 mgSS/l before drum filter, and 14, 37 mgSS/l after drum filter. Water after Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) resulted in increase of TSS {{in the first two}} days, whilst the third day showed reduction of TSS value.

However, their impact on the rate of new bone formation, osteoconduction, and DBBM degradation has never been reported. In addition, the implant stability quotient (ISQ) has never been correlated to bone-to-implant contact (BIC) after SFE with simultaneous implant placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bilateral SFE with simultaneous implant placement was performed in 10 Göttingen minipigs. The two sides were randomized to receive large or small <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> DBBM. Two <b>groups</b> of 5 minipigs healed for 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. ISQ was recorded immediately after implant placement and at sacrifice. Qualitative histological differences were described and bone formation, DBBM degradation, BIC and bone-to-DBBM contact (osteoconduction) were quantified histomorphometrically. RESULTS DBBM <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> had no qualitative or quantitative impact on the amount of newly formed bone, DBBM degradation, or BIC for either of the healing periods (p[*]>[*] 0. 05). Small-size DBBM showed higher osteoconduction after 6 weeks than large-size DBBM (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). After 12 weeks this difference was compensated. There was no significant correlation between BIC and ISQ. CONCLUSION Small and large <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> were equally predictable when DBBM was used for SFE with simultaneous implant placement...|$|R

Operational parameters, such as the Al/Na ratio, temperature, gas velocity, and the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of bed materials, were considered by the {{prediction model}} developed by Lin et al., and thermodynamic consideration of the Al-Na-Si reaction system revealed the agglomeration mechanism. An exponential decay of f N was found with the increase of the Al/Na ratio, and the data analysis gave a regression formula of f N= 0. 0601 + 0. 4983 *exp [- 4. 4183 *(Al/Na ratio) ], with an R 2 of 0. 9972. The simulation data generally match well with the experimental results, particularly at lower operation temperatures and Geldart B group's particles, with acceptable average errors of - 8. 4 % and - 4. 9 %, respectively. However, relatively poor matches were found in the cases with different gas velocities, a higher operation temperature (900 °C), and a larger <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> (Geldart D <b>group)</b> of bed materials. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{effect of}} high {{pressure}} homogenisation (HPH) on decontamination, protein structure (turbidity, <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> free sulfhydryl <b>groups,</b> protein electrophoretic mobility) and selected functional properties (immunoreactivity, viscosity, foaming and gelling properties) of egg white were evaluated. HPH at 150 MPa for multiple passes allowed the progressive inactivation of Salmonella enterica SDMZ 9898. In addition, HPH modified egg white proteins by inducing unfolding and aggregation phenomena. The latter would occur bymeans of hydrophobic interactions among partially unfolded proteins. Protein structure modifications induced by HPH decreased egg white immunoreactivity {{probably due to}} protein epitopes hiding upon aggregation. HPH was not sufficient to modify egg white foaming properties. Depending on {{the intensity of the}} process, HPH allowed the modification of apparent viscosity of egg white and firmness of egg white gel. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} centrifugal, biochemical, and electron microscopic {{study of}} the cytoplasmic particulates present in 0. 88 M sucrose homogenates of rat liver has been carried out. Size distribution analyses of particles containing pentose nucleic acid (PNA) and exhibiting several types of enzymatic activity revealed three major <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> {{within the range of}} particle radius between 10 and 500 mµ. A different array of biochemical properties was associated with each <b>size</b> <b>group.</b> The largest <b>particles,</b> with an average radius (assuming spherical shape) in the region of 220 to 260 mµ, contained all of the succinic dehydrogenase activity of the cytoplasmic extract, 29 per cent of the diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN) -cytochrome c reductase activity, and minor amounts of PNA and acid phosphatase activity. Cytologically, this group of particles was identified with the mitochondria. All of the uricase activity, 58 per cent of the acid phosphatase activity, and 26 per cent of the PNA was apparently associated with a second <b>size</b> <b>group</b> of <b>particles</b> (average radius 120 mµ) which were tentatively identified by electron microscopy with vesicular structures derived from the ergastoplasm of the intact cell. The third particle group demonstrated by centrifugation exhibited a major size distribution peak at 25 mµ and a second smaller peak at 55 mµ. Over 50 per cent of the total cytoplasmic PNA and DPN-cytochrome c reductase activity was associated with <b>particles</b> in this <b>size</b> <b>group.</b> Electron microscopy revealed a morphologically heterogeneous population of <b>particles</b> within this <b>size</b> range...|$|R

40|$|Eggshell {{quality was}} studied {{in a total}} of 108 Hissex hens from 58 to 62 weeks of age. All hens {{received}} a basal diet of the same composition. The differences between the three equal groups were in the replacement percent of fine pulverised limestone by granular limestone, of larger <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> The first <b>group</b> (control) received the basal diet with only pulverised limestone as a calcium supplement. In the diet of the second group, 60 % of the pulverised limestone was replaced with granular limestone and in the third group percent 80 %. Significantly higher breaking force (3. 6 kg) shell mass (8. 2 g), shell thickness (36 x 0. 01 mm) and lower deformation (20. 4 m) were found for eggs from the third group of hens than for eggs from the first group (3. 4 kg; 8. 0 g; 35 x 0. 01 mm; 21. 4 m; respectively). Also these eggshell characteristics were more favourable in the second group than in the first group, but the difference was significant (p< 0. 05) only for breaking force (3. 5 kg versus 3. 4 kg). The results obtained in our investigation showed some possibilities of eggshell quality improvement using limestone of larger <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> as a Ca supplemente in the hen diet. Replacing 60 - 80 % of pulverised limestone by larger <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> limestone had positive effects on eggshell quality...|$|R
40|$|Experiments of {{high-velocity}} air-water flows {{were conducted}} on two scaled stepped spillways with step heights of h = 0. 05 and 0. 1 m to investigate scale effects in terms of air-water flow properties {{for a wide range}} of discharges in transition and skimming flows. The investigation comprised the complete range of macroscopic and microscopic two-phase flow properties including basic air-water flow parameters, interfacial turbulence properties, as well as cluster properties based upon the near-wake criterion and interparticle arrival time. For both undistorted Froude and Reynolds similitudes, the comparative analysis highlighted scale effects in terms of several gas-liquid flow properties, demonstrating that an extrapolation to full-scale prototype conditions may not be possible. These properties comprised the interfacial area, the turbulence properties and the <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> and <b>grouping,</b> affecting any scaling of air-water mass transfer processes. Other key air-water parameters were scaled accurately including the void fraction, interfacial velocity and flow bulking. The present investigation was the most comprehensive to date providing clear guidance on air-water flow properties which may be affected by scale effects. The present results may be also applicable to other types of air-water flows. However detailed testing of air-water flow properties at the prototype scale is needed for final confirmation...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on beef cattle to compare three {{different}} by-pass lipids administration {{in relation to their}} intake, performance, bunk behaviour and rumen fermentation characteristics. Ninety-six Charolaise males were subdivided into three groups. Each group was fed a specific diet including differentiated sources of rumen by-pass fats. The first group received 500 g/head/day of calcium salts (CaS), the second and the third received 420 g/head/day of hydrogenated fatty acids (HF) and triglycerides (AL), respectively. The three by-pass fats differ in fatty acids composition, chain length and mean <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> AL <b>group</b> had average daily gain significantly greater (P = 0. 0005) than animals fed calcium soaps. No difference was observed between AL and HF groups (P = 0. 08) and between HF and CaS groups. Final body weights of AL animals were significantly higher (P = 0. 005) than CaS group. There were no differences between AL group and HF group and between HF group and CaS group. Average dry matter intake (DMI) was higher (P < 0. 05) in AL and HF groups compared with CaS group. Feed conversion rate was better for AL and CaS groups (P< 0. 05) compared with HF group. Evaluating their behaviours in approaching feed, the animals seemed to prefer hydrogenated fats flavour as regard to calcium soaps. No differences were highlighted in ruminal pH and ruminal volatile fatty acids composition among the three groups. When high dosage of fat is included into a beef cattle diet, the administration of hydrogenated triglycerides, characterized by a pleasant flavour and a small mean <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> is likely to prove more suitable than adding calcium soaps or hydrogenated free fatty acids, probably thanks to its higher DMI and feed conversion rate, respectively. With regard to the latter higher rate, it could be only supposed that it is related to the smaller mean <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of hydrogenated triglycerides...|$|R

40|$|We study nite-inertia eects on the {{collision}} rate of bidisperse heavy particles in a turbulent gas, using direct numerical simulations and kinematic descriptions. As shown previously for a monodisperse system (Sundaram & Collins 1997; Wang, Wexler & Zhou 2000), a statistical mechanical {{description of the}} average collision kernel consists of two parts, namely {{a description of the}} relative velocity between two colliding particles (the turbulent transport eect) and of the non-uniform particle dis-tribution due to dynamic interaction of particles with coherent vortex structures (the accumulation eect). We rst show that this description remains valid and accurate for a bidisperse system involving two groups of particles of inertial response time p 1 and p 2, respectively. Numerical results for the turbulent transport eect and the accumulation eect have been obtained as a function of p 1 and p 2. Interestingly, the accumulation eect in a bidisperse system is bounded above by that of a monodis-perse system. An explanation for this observation is given, in terms of the correlation between concentration elds of the two <b>size</b> <b>groups.</b> Simulations show that <b>particles</b> from two <b>size</b> <b>groups</b> were found in dierent regions of a vortex, thus reducing th...|$|R
