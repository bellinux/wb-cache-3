Where snails were found, molluscicide was applied by means of dripping or aspersion using a 3 ppm aqueous suspension of niclosamide. Initially, a mean of 14. 3 % of snails in the region were found to be eliminating cercariae. Following the first four applications of molluscicide, this was reduced to 0. 0 % and maintained at about 1. 5 % throughout the program. Thus, there was a continued possibility of schistosomiasis transmission in the area and it was observed that the population of snails reestablished itself within three months of molluscicide application.

Aplicações trimestrais de niclosamida foram realizadas catorze anos em focos de Biomphalaria glabrata nas coleções hídricas de Peri-Peri, (Capim Branco, MG). Anualmente, os residentes da área eram submetidos a um exame coproscópio (Kato-Katz) e os que eliminavam ovos de Schistosoma mansoni nas fezes eram tratados com oxarnniquine. O levantamento malacológico trimestral foi realizado através de dez conchadas a cada dez metros nas duas margens das valas e córregos da região. Onde eram encontrados caramujos aplicava-se o moluscicida pela técnica de gotejamento ou aspersão de suspensão aquosa da niclosamida a 3 ppm. O índice médio de caramujos eliminando cercarias na região era de 14, 3 %. Após as quatro primeiras aplicações, foi reduzido a 0, 0 % e mantido em torno de 1, 5 % durante o programa. Portanto, a possibilidade de transmissão da esquistossomose na área continuou, e a população de caramujos se refazia em até três meses após aplicação do moluscicida. Os resultados obtidos neste estudo não encorajam o uso contínuo de niclosamida como medida única de controle da esquistossomose, por não diminuir permanentemente a população de planorbideos e por não interromper a possibilidade de transmissão da endemia...|$|E
