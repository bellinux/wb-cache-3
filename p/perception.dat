5|$|Philosophy of <b>perception</b> is {{concerned}} with the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual objects, in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world.

5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of <b>perception.</b> Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the <b>perception</b> of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to build a conceptual model to provide clear understanding of customer loyalty. Structural equation modeling as a data analysis tool has been used to analyze the data collected from 1530 customers of four major supermarkets chains in Turkey. The results {{of this study indicate that}} customer satisfaction among others is the most important antecedent of customer loyalty. Customer loyalty, which is composed of three different ways: intent to continue shopping, intent to increase purchases and intent to recommend the store, depend on comparative price <b>perceptions,</b> discount <b>perceptions,</b> product quality <b>perceptions,</b> service quality <b>perceptions,</b> value <b>perceptions</b> and customer satisfaction. Comparative price <b>perceptions,</b> discount <b>perceptions</b> and customer satisfaction have positive direct effect on customer loyalty and service quality <b>perceptions,</b> product quality <b>perceptions,</b> discount <b>perceptions</b> and value <b>perceptions</b> have indirect effect on customer loyalty...|$|R
40|$|<b>Perceptions</b> {{of crime}} {{seriousness}} {{have been studied}} since the 1960 s. Characteristics of acts affecting these <b>perceptions</b> have been identified, {{and the degree of}} agreement in seriousness judgments has been examined for a variety of behaviors. The present study extends this inquiry by investigating how <b>perceptions</b> of self-harm and <b>perceptions</b> of immorality shape attitudes toward the control of drug use. These attitudes and <b>perceptions</b> were measured for six widely known drugs – alcohol, cigarettes, cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana – using an electronic mail survey of university students. Univariate analysis shows dissensus rather than consensus in attitudes and <b>perceptions</b> and that, with the exception of marijuana, control attitudes toward drug use reflect the existing legal code. Multivariate analysis shows that <b>perceptions</b> of self-harm and <b>perceptions</b> of immorality are moderately to highly correlated and that control attitudes are strongly affected by <b>perceptions</b> of self-harm and <b>perceptions</b> of immorality...|$|R

Results show that a direct influence of illness <b>perceptions</b> on adherence was absent. Convincing evidence of an indirect influence of illness <b>perceptions</b> on adherence was also absent, although findings suggest that illness <b>perceptions</b> are related to <b>perceptions</b> of necessity of medication and worries about medication, which are in turn related to adherence.

40|$|This aim of {{the study}} is to gain more insight in {{diversity}} <b>perceptions</b> and the diversity benefits in the leisure industry by investigating the impact of leisure managers’ diversity <b>perceptions</b> on organizational performance <b>perceptions.</b> The diversity typology of Harrison and Klein (2007) based on variety, separation, and disparity has been used to study diversity <b>perceptions.</b> The findings are three-fold: a general positive view of employee diversity by leisure managers can lead to a positive impact on organizational outcomes; to increase possible positive effects of employee diversity, leisure managers should view employee diversity in terms of variety; and to decrease possible negative effects of employee diversity, leisure managers should not view employee diversity as disparity. Highlights ► Insight in leisure managers’ <b>perceptions</b> of diversity is given. ► Variety, separation and disparity are measured for diversity <b>perceptions.</b> ► Diversity <b>perceptions</b> can positively impact organizational performance <b>perceptions.</b> ► Diversity <b>perceptions</b> of leisure managers based on variety should be fostered. ► Diversity <b>perceptions</b> of leisure managers based on separation should be avoided.

40|$|Objective: An {{investigation}} of the interplay between various types of adolescents’ <b>perceptions</b> of weight status in predicting adolescents’ nutrition behavior and their body mass was conducted. In particular, {{it was hypothesized that}} the relationship between parental and peers’ <b>perceptions</b> of their own weight status (reported by adolescents) and objectively measured weight status of adolescents would be mediated by three types of adolescents’ weight status <b>perceptions</b> (adolescents’ own weight <b>perceptions,</b> parental <b>perceptions</b> of adolescents’ weight status perceived by participants, and peers’ <b>perceptions</b> of adolescents’ weight status perceived by participants) and by adolescents’ nutrition behaviors. Design: Data were collected twice, with a 13 -month follow-up. Participants (N = 1096) were aged 14 – 20, with BMI ranging from 16. 20 to 41. 21. Multiple mediation analysis with two sequential mediators was applied. Main outcome measures: At the baseline adolescents completed the questionnaire assessing their nutrition behaviors and weight status <b>perceptions.</b> Weight and height were measured objectively at baseline and follow-up. Results: Two types of weight <b>perceptions</b> (adolescents’ own weight status <b>perceptions,</b> peers’ <b>perceptions</b> of adolescents’ weight status reported by participants), and adolescents’ nutrition behaviors mediated the relationship between the others’ own weight <b>perceptions</b> and adolescents’ weight status. No indirect effects of others’ own weight <b>perceptions</b> on adolescents’ weight status through parental <b>perceptions</b> were found. Conclusion: Adolescents’ nutrition behaviors and body weight status depend on what they think about their own weight status and what they think of their peers’ <b>perceptions,</b> but do not depend on what adolescents think of their parents’ <b>perceptions...</b>|$|R

Adolescents completed questionnaires {{once a year}} for 2 years. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that achievement-related beliefs separate into three task values factors (interest, perceived importance, and perceived utility), one expectancy/ability factor (comprising beliefs about one's competence, expectancies for success, and performance <b>perceptions),</b> and two task difficulty factors (<b>perceptions</b> of difficulty and <b>perceptions</b> of effort required to do well).

5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual <b>perception.</b> Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced <b>perception</b> of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial <b>perception,</b> auditory <b>perception,</b> or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to gain knowledge of how consumers' <b>perceptions</b> regarding the ethics of online retailers affect to consumers' online shopping attitudes, more specifically consumers' <b>perceptions</b> of online shopping convenience. Also ambition is to achieve deeper knowledge about consumer behaviour and especially consumers' <b>perceptions</b> towards online retailers. Besides connection between consumers' <b>perceptions</b> regarding the ethics of online retailers and consumers' <b>perceptions</b> of online shopping convenience is examined also their relationship to purchasing intention is investigated. Methodology: The research is quantitative by nature and structural equation modelling (SEM) is {{used to examine the}} relationships of consumers' ethic and convenience <b>perceptions</b> as well as their link to purchasing intention.

40|$|Established {{entrepreneurial}} intentions models {{argue that}} entrepreneurial intentions are largely {{a function of}} <b>perceptions</b> of desirability and <b>perceptions</b> of feasibility. Recent research however, {{has suggested that the}} relationship between <b>perceptions</b> of desirability and <b>perceptions</b> of feasibility may be more complex. In this paper we investigate how <b>perceptions</b> of desirability interact with <b>perceptions</b> of feasibility in the formation of entrepreneurial intentions. Using a relatively large multi-country sample we find that consistent with previous research, entrepreneurial intentions are positively related to both <b>perceptions</b> of desirability and <b>perceptions</b> of feasibility. In addition, we find evidence of a significant interaction effect between <b>perceptions</b> of desirability and <b>perceptions</b> of feasibility. While conventional wisdom might suggest a positive interaction, we find this interaction effect to be negative. Thus, the study not only supports the contention by McMullen & Shepherd (2006) that individuals who are not necessarily highly motivated might act entrepreneurially if they have high perceived self-efficacy, but also supports the converse argument that highly motivated individuals might act entrepreneurially even if they have low perceived self-efficacy. These findings have important implications for both theory and practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{a unique}} {{combination}} of monthly survey data and matching trading records, we examine how individual investor <b>perceptions</b> change and drive trading and risk-taking behavior during the 2007 – 2009 financial crisis. Investor <b>perceptions</b> fluctuate significantly, with risk tolerance and risk <b>perceptions</b> being less volatile than return expectations. At {{the onset of}} the crisis, return expectations and risk tolerance sharply decline, while risk <b>perceptions</b> strongly increase. Towards the end of the crisis, these survey variables recover. We find substantial swings in trading and risk-taking behavior that are driven by changes in <b>perceptions.</b> As <b>perceptions</b> recover, trading and risk-taking behavior also return to pre-crisis levels. Although the crisis temporarily depresses individual investor <b>perceptions</b> and substantially changes their behavior, the impact of the crisis is not particularly long-lasting.

5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the <b>perception</b> of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the <b>perception</b> of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the <b>perception</b> of a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E
