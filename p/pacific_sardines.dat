40|$|The behaviour, {{distribution}} and abundance of the Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax, detected by acoustics, was studied {{in relation to}} the pelagic environmental conditions of water temperature, fluorescence and dissolved oxygen concentration induced by tidal currents in Bahía Magdalena, México (24 ° 32 ' N; 112 ° 01 ' W). Sampling was along an 18 km long transect covering an area inside the bay (mean depth 20 m), the main entrance to the bay (mean depth 35 m), and the continental shelf (mean depth 100 m). The main entrance to the bay was the most dynamic area along the hydrographic transect, where the <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardines</b> tended to aggregate, probably to feed on the phytoplankton accumulated during the receding tide. With the flood tide, a high-speed tidal current is generated, introducing cool water with low oxygen concentrations into the bay. During the ebb tide, a tidal wave is also formed, but the warm and relatively well oxygenated bay water mass is transported towards the open sea. Acoustic records showed that whatever the tidal current direction (inflow or outflow), no fish schools were detected within the area of more intense tidal current speeds (> 120 cm s− 1). Visual observations of surface Pacific sardine schools during the flood tide indicate that sardines were out of the transducer signal detection range (< 10 m depth), suggesting that <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardines</b> undergo vertical migration, probably to avoid the high water current speed with low dissolved oxygen content. This behaviour may have a relevant effect on the overall hydroacoustic estimation of small pelagic fish abundance in shallower pelagic environments such as this subtropical bay...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{historical}} fishing records to understand relationships between climatic change and fish abundance {{is limited by}} the relatively short duration of these records, and complications due to the strong influence of human activity in addition to climatic change. Sedimentary records containing scales, bones or geochemical proxies of variability in fish populations provide unique insights on long-term ecosystem dynamics and relationships with climatic change. Available records from Holocene sediments are summarized and synthesized. The records are from several widespread locations near or along the continental margins of the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans, including Alaska, USA (Pacific salmon), Saanich and Effingham Inlets, British Columbia, Canada (pelagic fish), Santa Barbara Basin, California, USA (Northern anchovies and <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardines),</b> Gulf of California, Mexico (<b>Pacific</b> <b>sardines,</b> Northern anchovies and Pacific hake), Peru upwelling system (sardines, anchovies and hake). and Benguela Current System, South Africa (sardines, anchovies and hake). These records demonstrate that fish population sizes are not constant, and varied significantly over a range of time scales prior to the advent of large-scale commercial fishing. In addition to the decadal-scale variability commonly observed in historical records, the long-term records reveal substantial variability over centennial and millennial time scales. Shifts in abundance are often, but not always, correlated with regional and/or global climatic changes. The long-term perspective reveals different patterns of variability in fish populations, as well as fish-climate relationships, than suggested by analysis {{of historical}} records. Many records suggest prominent changes in fish abundance at ca. 1000 - 1200 AD, during the Little Ice Age, and during the transition {{at the end of the}} Little Ice Age in the 19 th century that may be correlative, and that were likely driven by major hemispheric or global reorganizations in the earth's climate system.

In a survey of over 2000 otoliths, all ages (with an emphasis on age- 1 recruits) were compared. Principal components analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, and a novel method derived from regression and residuals calculations, termed perimeter-weight profiles (PWPs), revealed otolith similarities and differences.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the year-class strength of salmon populations is related to decadal scale climatic/ocean fluctuations. The interactions have complex latitudinal patterns and appear to involve the major food web and current structures of the North Pacific. To understand the effect of climate on Columbia River salmon the North Pacific system must be considered. A brief review of the patterns, the postulated mechanisms and indicators of the patterns follow. In general, two major climate regimes have been identified; one associated with cool and wet climate in the Pacific Northwest and another associated with warm and dry Pacific Northwest weather. The warm/dry regime favors stronger year class strengths of many Alaskan fish stocks while the cool/wet regime favors stocks on the West Coast of the lower United States.

The northern California Current (NCC) is a productive upwelling zone that is home to large populations of medusae, particularly during some years. Seasonal trawl surveys in the NCC over 13 yr have documented a substantial biomass of jellyfish consisting primarily of one species, the sea nettle Chrysaora fuscescens, with abundances generally peaking in late summer.

Juvenile salmon were more abundant during the August cruise as compared to the June cruise and were mainly distributed northward from Cape Blanco. There were distinct differences in distribution patterns between salmon species: chinook salmon were found close inshore in cooler water all along the coast and coho salmon were rarely found south of Cape Blanco. Distance offshore and temperature were the dominant explanatory variables related to coho and chinook salmon distribution. The nekton assemblages differed significantly between cruises. The June cruise was dominated by juvenile rockfishes, rex sole, and sablefish, which were almost completely absent in August. The forage fish community during June comprised Pacific herring and whitebait smelt north of Cape Blanco and surf smelt south of Cape Blanco.

Latent resource species including Pacific saury, Pacific hake, squid, and pelagic red crab also were surveyed. The principal technique consisted of running acoustic transects with a horizontal ranging sonar and vertical echo sounder during daylight hours and fishing a midwater trawl at night. Results show the northern anchovy grossly dominates all other species in terms of biomass and abundance with the southern California-northern Baja California region containing most of the total population. Although {{it was not possible to}} determine absolute population size, results indicate the estimates of 2 to 6 million tons made from egg and larvae surveys are reasonable. Behavior and availability studies indicate that although the anchovy population is large, its vulnerability to harvest by the present commercial fishery varies considerably from year to year as well as seasonally. Most of the common schooling behaviors are unfavorable for effective harvest by roundhaul net. Only a small portion of the population is harvestable during any particular time period. Acoustic surveys were much less effective for estimating abundance of <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardines,</b> Pacific mackerel, and jack mackerel.

Peak cell densities occurred in the month of July and were associated with elevated shellfish toxicity in the summers of 2004 and 2005. When A. catenella was present, particulate PSTs were detected 71 % of the time and reached a maximum concentration of 962  ng STXeq L− 1. Of the 13 species tested, we frequently detected PSTs in <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardines</b> (Sardinops sagax; maximum 250  μg STXeq 100  g− 1), northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax; maximum 23. 2  μg STXeq 100  g− 1), brown rock crabs (Cancer antennarius; maximum 49. 3  μg STXeq 100  g− 1) and red rock crabs (C. productus; 23. 8  μg STXeq 100  g− 1). PSTs were also present in one sample of Pacific herring (Clupea pallas; 13. 3  μg STXeq 100  g− 1) and one sample of English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus; 4. 5  μg STXeq 100  g− 1), and not detected in seven other species of flatfish tested. The presence of PSTs in several of these organisms reveals that toxins produced by A. catenella are more prevalent in California food webs than previously thought and also indicates potential routes of toxin transfer to higher trophic levels...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardines</b> (Sardinops sagax) are an {{economically}} and ecologically important forage fish which {{transfer energy from}} planktonic primary producers and secondary consumers to upper trophic predators. Previous genetics studies of Pacific sardine suggested a panmictic population with a shallow genetic structure. However, more than one subpopulation within the Central California Offshore management unit may exist based on recovering larger individuals at higher latitudes and a temporal difference in sardine spawning off Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. Potential for separate sardine subpopulations questions the long-standing paradigm of an annual migration of individuals to feeding grounds off the Pacific Northwest in the summer with migrants returning to Southern California in the fall to spawn the following spring. This study applied parasite community analyses and population genetics techniques to assess migration patterns and stock structure of Pacific sardine in the California Current from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada to San Diego, California, USA. A coastwide sardine migration {{is supported by the}} geographical distribution of Myosaccium ecaude (Trematoda), but a second migration pattern was identified within the Pacific Northwest from the geographic distribution of Lecithaster gibbosus (Trematoda). Population genetics studies identified a panmictic distribution for: 1) the trematode M. ecaude using a 283 bp portion of the NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND 1) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene; and 2) three species of Anisakis nematodes (A. simplex s. s., A. pegreffii, and A. simplex 'C') using a 524 bp portion of the cytochrome c oxidase 2 (cox 2) mtDNA gene. These results suggest that the extensive movement of all of the potential hosts utilized by these parasites, the limited oceanographic barriers, and complexity in the California Current are not preventing the mixing of M. ecaude or Anisakis species populations. The diversity and availability of fish and cetacean species that undergo extensive migrations along the full length of the California Current system may enable large geographically distributed population sizes of these parasite species. We thus cannot confirm the existence of separate Pacific sardine subpopulations within the California Current by the occurrence of parasite communities or the population genetics analyses of M. ecaude or the three Anisakis species...|$|E
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to refine the acoustic estimation method applied in the Gulf of California, especially regarding the acoustic energy allocation to the different species coexisting in the same area, {{in order to produce}} a more precise and reliable fishery independent biomass index for the sustainable management of the fishery. The series of acoustic surveys carried out in this work are the first systematic attempts to estimate <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardine</b> biomass in the Gulf of California. Due to similar acoustic reflectivity of other pelagic species, we need to refine the allocation of acoustic energy to species. From 2012, besides the 38 kHz transducer another frequency has been incorporated (120 kHz) in the surveys. With both frequencies we will apply acoustic signal filtering procedures in order to 1). Discriminate zooplankton echoes from fish echoes and 2). Investigate the possibility to better discriminate the <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardine</b> from other species...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardine</b> (Sardinops sagax) {{supports}} one of {{the most}} important fishing industries of the northeastern Pacific Ocean (NPO). The recruitment of juveniles in the NPO has shown fluctuations in recent decades; this has been attributed to variations in the spawning stock biomass (SSB) and to the oceanographic conditions within the California Current system (CCS). In this study, these hypotheses are tested by fitting three different stock-recruitment (SR) functions into different models using data of recruitment and SSB of <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardine</b> in three regions of the NPO: Magdalena Bay (MB), Ensenada (EN), and north Pacific (NP). To quantify the plausibility of each model, given the data and the set of three models, the Akaike weight of each model was calculated. The selection of the best model within each area was done by minimizing the small-sample, bias-corrected form of the Akaike information criterion. Through this approach, the MB and EN fisheries fitted both the asymptotic Beverton-Holt and dome-shaped Ricker models. These results agreed with prior evidence that recruitment of <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardine</b> has a density-dependent mortality term for eggs and juvenile stages, related to the total SSB and cohort size. To test environmental influence on sardine recruitment principal component analysis was undertaken. The first principal component group was determined by El Niño-La Niña episodes; the second, by the upwelling index. Upon incorporation of these principal components into the SR models, the recruitment of the sardine throughout the CCS was differentially affected, e. g., warm episodes in MB negatively affected recruitment, whereas in the EN and NP regions, the effect was positive...|$|R
