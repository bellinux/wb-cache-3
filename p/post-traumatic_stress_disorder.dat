5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorder.</b> Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the Armistice of Mudros (30 October 1918), several {{surviving}} Armenian intellectuals {{came back}} to Constantinople, which was under an allied occupation. They started a short, but intense, literary activity that was ended by the Turkish victory in 1923. Those who have written memoirs and books about their accounts during the deportation include Grigoris Balakian, Aram Andonian, Yervant Odian, Teotig, and Mikayel Shamtanchyan.

5|$|Some studies shows {{correlation}} of reduced hippocampus volume and {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> and a larger hippocampus {{increases the likelihood of}} efficacious treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{seeks to}} {{critically}} read Pat Barkerâs Regeneration {{in terms of}} Cathy Caruthâs psychoanalytic study of trauma. This analysis attempts to trace the concepts of latency, <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorders,</b> traumatic memory, and trauma in Barkerâs novel in order to explore how trauma and history are interrelated in the narrative of past history and, particularly, {{in the history of}} World War I. The present paper also demonstrates how Barkerâs novel Regeneration acts as the narrative of trauma that vocalizes the silenced history of shell-shocked soldiers of World War I to represent British society, the history that has been concealed due to social and individual factors. The study thus investigates the dissociative disorders which are experienced by traumatized survivors of World War I as the aftermath of traumatic experiences of wartime. In addition, it argues how time moves for the traumatized victim and how the notion of latency in terms of Caruthâs theory is traceable in Barkerâs novel. In Regeneration, the traumatized survivors are haunted with traumatic memory of past history; furthermore, past history constantly disrupts their present and the victims are in continuous shift from present time to past time. Time thus loses its linearity in the narrative of traumatized survivors. Keywords: Latency, <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorders,</b> traumatic memory, traum...|$|R
30|$|One {{of the big}} {{themes of}} {{neuroscience}} is {{to understand how the}} brain systems regulate emotion. Based on learning and memory from threatened conditions, humans continue to adapt to the environment by responding appropriately to a dangerous situation. However, uncontrollable fear may develop an anxiety <b>disorder</b> such as <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorders</b> (PTSD). As the number of PTSD patients increases {{for a variety of reasons}} in the modern society, research activities to understand the mechanism for extinction of traumatic memory have increased exponentially for recent 10 Â years (Milad and Quirk, 2012).|$|R

Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.|$|E

These conflicts can also lead to acute <b>stress</b> <b>disorders,</b> particularly in workers who are at-risk for <b>stress</b> <b>disorders.</b> To prevent psychological work-related injuries, occupational stakeholders should use assessments for work-related stress as a framework for addressing all organisational risk factors that are related to workplace relationships and conflict...|$|R
5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorder.</b> The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E
5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, <b>post-traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> <b>disorder,</b> schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E
