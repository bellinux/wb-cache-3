On May 10, 1967, the sixteenth and last glide flight ended in {{disaster}} as the vehicle slammed into the lake bed on landing. With test pilot Bruce Peterson at the controls, the M2-F2 suffered a <b>pilot</b> <b>induced</b> <b>oscillation</b> (PIO) as it neared the lake bed. At {{the core of this}} problem {{was the fact that the}} wings of the M2-F2 (essentially the body of the aircraft) produced considerably less roll authority than most aircraft. This resulted in less force available to the pilot to control the aircraft in roll. As a consequence, when Peterson attempted to perform roll maneuvers the response of the vehicle was substantially less than expected, thus lending to a [...] "soft" [...] feel for this control which often leads to PIO in the roll axis. (Source: interview with Bruce Peterson, 1980) The vehicle rolled from side to side in flight as he tried to bring it under control. Peterson recovered, but then observed a rescue helicopter that seemed to pose a collision threat. Distracted, Peterson drifted in a crosswind to an unmarked area of the lake bed where it was very difficult to judge the height over the ground because of a lack of guidance (the markers provided on the lake bed runway).|$|E

The results of this survey show undeniably that new aircraft and new pilots are not immune to old problems. Of three related human factors limitations, pilot skill frequently showed up as the primary factor responsible for accidents due to inadequate training (or proficiency) to handle an unexpected situation. A primary contributing factor was unsatisfactory aircraft handling qualities which increased pilot work load and therefore were less forgiving to 'pilot error,' particularly when flown in a stressful situation at the extremes of the flight envelope. Historically, <b>pilot</b> <b>induced</b> <b>oscillation</b> (PIO) has persisted as a major control problem particularly in first-flight operation.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate flying qualities requirements of alternate pitch command systems for fighter aircraft at high angle of attack. Flying qualities design guidelines have already been developed for angle of attack command systems at 30, 45, and 60 degrees angle of attack, so this research fills a similar need for rate command systems. Flying qualities tasks that require post-stall maneuvering were tested during piloted simulations in the McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Manned Air Combat Simulation facility. A generic fighter aircraft model was used to test angle of attack rate and pitch rate command systems for longitudinal gross acquisition and tracking tasks at high angle of attack. A wide range of longitudinal dynamic variations were tested at 30, 45, and 60 degrees angle of attack. Pilot comments, Cooper-Harper ratings, and <b>pilot</b> <b>induced</b> <b>oscillation</b> ratings were taken from five pilots from NASA, USN, CAF, and McDonnell Douglas Aerospace.

40|$|Rate {{saturation}} {{conditions in}} flight control systems {{are well known}} as an element which can contribute to severe <b>pilot</b> <b>induced</b> <b>oscillation</b> (PIO). Recently, the problem of rate saturation caused by rate limiting elements (RLE) in flight control systems have been revived due to the proposal to overcome rate saturation caused handling problems by using an alternate control scheme (ACS) providing {{that the rate of}} the RLE has the same sign as the commanded rate so that the input and output signals are in phase. Due to this proposal flight tests have been carried out at DLR or will be conducted by USAF/Calspan this year to evaluate the expected handling quality improvements by applying the ACS. The intention of this investigation is to develop a description of the dynamical behaviour of rate limiting elements in the frequency domain in order to create the basis for both the pilot/aircraft system analysis and the definition of the parameters which will influence handling qualities. Although RLE's cause nonlinear system behaviour it is shown in this investigation that linear methods could also be used when RLE's are active in the flight control path and that by this the very well established methods for handling quality analysis of pilot/aircraft systems in the frequency domain as open and closed loop approaches are applicable.

After {{a brief overview of}} some reconfigurable controllers, sliding mode control (SMC) is selected because of its invariance properties and lack of need for parameter identification. SMC is reviewed and issues with parasitic dynamics, which cause system instability, are addressed. Utilizing sliding manifold boundary layers, the nonlinear control is converted to a linear control and sliding manifold design is performed in the frequency domain. An additional feedback form of model reference hedging is employed which is similar to a prefilter and has large benefits to system performance. The effects of inclusion of actuator dynamics into the designed plant is heavily investigated. Multiple Simulink models of the full longitudinal dynamics and wing deflection modes of the forward swept aero elastic vehicle (FSAV) are constructed. Additionally a linear state space models to analyze effects from various system parameters. The FSAV has a pole at + 7 rad/sec and is non-minimum phase. The use of 'model actuators' in the feedback path, and varying there design, is heavily investigated for the resulting effects on plant robustness and tolerance to actuator failure.

40|$|Helicopter {{flight in}} {{degraded}} visual environment (DVE) can pose a serious safety hazard especially during low-level operations. One cause for rapidly losing the visual cues is introduced by surface properties such as sand or snow. They {{are prone to}} stir up particles due to the helicopters downwash and encase the helicopter in a non-transparent cloud. This effect {{is referred to as}} brownout or whiteout. Under such conditions lateral speeds introduce a high risk that when touching the ground may cause the helicopter to rollover. Therefore helicopter operators could benefit from some type of “drift indication” that mitigates the influence of degraded visual environment. To enhance the perception of ego motion in a conformal HMD symbol set the measured own ship movement was used to generate a “pattern motion” in the forward field of view close or on the landing pad. As a next step the part task study presented here takes {{a closer look at the}} mechanism of subconscious drift indication. It is believed that providing this type of constant subliminal information can enhance the reaction time to unforeseen movements like from gusts. The study focused on none-professional participants. 31 candidates took part in this study. The main task was to steer the lateral position to the center of the presented landing pad. A second task forced the participant to react as fast as possible to a frequent presentation of two different characters on the display. The experiment was displayed on an Oculus Rift DK 2 ™ virtual reality glass.

The platform uses three stages of limit protection modules: limit cue creation, limit cue arbitration, and control system interface. A {{common set of}} limit cue modules provides commands that can include constraints, alerts, transfer functions, and friction. An arbitration module selects the best limit protection cues and distributes them to the most appropriate control path interface. This platform adopts a holistic approach to limit protection whereby it considers all potential interface points, including the pilots visual, aural, and tactile displays; and automatic command restraint shaping for autonomous limit protection. For each functional module, this thesis guides the control system designer through the design choices and information interfaces among the modules. Limit cue module design choices include type of prediction, prediction mechanism, method of critical control calculation, and type of limit cue. Special consideration {{is given to the}} nature of the limit, particularly the level of knowledge about it, and the ramifications for limit protection design, especially with respect to intelligent control methods such as fuzzy inference systems and neural networks. The Open Platform for Limit Protection reduces the effort required for initial limit protection design by defining a practical structure that still allows considerable design freedom. The platform reduces lifecycle effort through its open engineering systems approach of decoupled, modular design and standardized information interfaces. Using the Open Platform for Limit Protection, a carefree maneuver system is designed that addresses: main rotor blade stall as a steady-state limit; hub moment as a transient structural limit; and <b>pilot</b> <b>induced</b> <b>oscillation</b> as a controllability limit. The limit cue modules in this system make use of static neural networks, adaptive neural networks, and fuzzy inference systems to predict these limits. Visual (heads up display) and tactile (force-feedback) limit cues are employed.
