5|$|Jim Henson {{originally}} {{conceived of}} his Muppets as characters aimed at an adult audience. He {{was disappointed that}} {{the popularity of the}} characters that appeared in Sesame Street, including Big Bird and Bert and Ernie, had solidified a public perception his Muppets were solely intended for educating children. Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters should be able to be appreciated by individuals of any maturity level. Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking down upon the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work on a <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television networks to create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} vessels of the Principe di Carignano class were {{initially}} ordered as steam frigates by the Regia Marina Sarda (Royal Sardinian Navy) {{shortly before the}} unification of Italy. While {{they were on the}} stocks, the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) of the newly-formed Kingdom of Italy decided to convert the ships into ironclads. A third ship, , was too far advanced in her construction to allow for conversion, and so she was completed as a wooden vessel. These ships had been designed by Inps. Eng. Felice Mattei. A fourth ship, Conte Verde, was built to a modified design created by Inps. Eng. Giuseppe De Luca. These ships came as part of a major naval expansion <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> designed to prepare a fleet of ironclads capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice.|$|E

5|$|The {{two ships}} of the Formidabile class were ordered by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, then both the Prime Minister and Naval Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860, {{shortly before the}} {{unification}} of Italy. The ships were originally intended to be armored floating batteries, but they were redesigned as sea-going ironclads after construction began. These ships were the first components of a major naval expansion <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> designed to prepare a fleet of ironclad warships capable of defeating the Austrian Navy.

5|$|With Đính and the Ngô family's {{increasing}} {{focus on}} the political usage of the army, the military situation in the III Corps deteriorated badly {{in the second half}} of 1963, as personnel were redeployed into the cities. In August, he moved a unit away from Bến Tượng, which had been portrayed as a model settlement in the Strategic Hamlet <b>Program</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> supposed to isolate peasants into fortified villages to keep the Viet Cong out. While the unit was in Saigon cracking down on the Buddhists, the communists overran Bến Tượng. A year earlier, the American media contingent had been invited to the opening ceremony of the settlement, which was supposed to be the flagship of the hamlet program. As Đính spent most of October in the capital plotting instead of inspecting the countryside, the communists began to systematically dismantle the strategic hamlets.|$|E
5|$|Chi's {{character}} is voiced by Rie Tanaka, and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The anime and manga storylines are essentially the same, but they differ slightly. These differences include {{the events in}} the ending, other things such as describing Elda's memory loss, and her special program. In the anime for example, it is explained that Hibiya reset Elda's memories after her husband's death rather than Elda losing them when she took Freya's program in. Another difference is the special <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> placed into Elda in the anime, this program appears to have an alternate effect. If Chi finds the Person just for her, all persocoms would be granted the ability to feel emotion. The reason for this is since Ichiro Mihara was the creator of persocoms, he viewed them all as his children. His wish was that if Chi were able to find someone who loved her in return, all his children would be able to share in this happiness by being able to feel emotions the way humans do.|$|E

5|$|On April 9, 1994, {{the first}} 777, line number WA001, was rolled {{out in a}} series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to {{accommodate}} the 100,000 invited guests. The first flight took place on June 12, 1994, under the command of chief test pilot John E. Cashman. This marked the start of an 11-month flight test <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> more extensive than testing for any previous Boeing model. Nine aircraft fitted with General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce engines were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at Edwards Air Force Base in California to frigid conditions in Alaska, mainly Fairbanks International Airport. To satisfy ETOPS requirements, eight 180-minute single-engine test flights were performed. The first aircraft built was used by Boeing's nondestructive testing campaign from 1994 to 1996, and provided data for the -200ER and -300 programs. At the successful conclusion of flight testing, the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) on April 19, 1995.|$|E
5|$|The George McGovern–Robert Dole International Food for Education and Nutrition <b>Program</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} 2000, and funded largely through the Congress, {{would go on}} to provide more than 22 million meals to {{children}} in 41 countries over the next eight years. It was also credited with improving school attendance, especially among girls, who {{were more likely to be}} allowed to go to school if a meal was being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern's service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern's book The Third Freedom: Ending Hunger In Our Time was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.|$|E
