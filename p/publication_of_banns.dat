60|$|Bluewater looked grateful, {{rather than}} pleased; {{but he made}} no answer. Now, he fell into a light slumber, from {{which he did not}} awake until the time he had himself set for the {{marriage}} of Wycherly and Mildred. With one uncle dead and still unburied, and another about to quit the world for ever, a rite that is usually deemed as joyous as it is solemn, might seem unseasonable; but the dying man had made it a request that he might have the consolation of knowing ere he expired, that he left his niece under the legal protection of one as competent, as he was desirous of protecting her. The reader must imagine the arguments that were used for the occasion, but they were such as disposed all, in the end, to admit the propriety of yielding their ordinary prejudices to the exigencies of the moment. It may be well to add, also, to prevent useless cavilling, that the laws of England were not as rigid {{on the subject of the}} celebration of marriages in 1745, as they subsequently became; and that it was lawful then to perform the ceremony in a private house without a license, and without the publishing of banns, even; restrictions that were imposed a few years later. The penalty for dispensing with the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>banns,</b> was a fine of £100, imposed on the clergyman; and this fine Bluewater chose to pay, rather than leave the only great object of life that now remained before him unaccomplished. This penalty in no degree impaired the validity of the contract, though Mrs. Dutton, as a woman, felt averse to parting with her beloved, without a rigid observance of all the customary forms. The point had finally been disposed of, by recourse to arguments addressed to the reason of this respectable woman, and by urging the necessity of the case. Her consent, however, was not given without a proviso, that a license should be subsequently procured, and a second marriage be had at a more fitting moment, should the ecclesiastical authorities consent to the same; a most improbable thing in itself.|$|E

50|$|In the 4th {{century in}} the Eastern Church it was the custom in some areas for marriages to receive a blessing by a priest to ensure fertility. There are also a few {{accounts}} of religious nuptial services from the 7th century onward. However, while in the East the priest was seen as ministering the sacrament, in the West it was the two parties to the marriage (if baptized) who effectively ministered, and their concordant word was sufficient proof {{of the existence of}} a sacramental marriage, whose validity required neither the presence of witnesses nor observance of the law of the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council that demanded <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>banns</b> <b>of</b> marriage.|$|R

While the Church continues to educate people on how HIV/AIDS can be prevented from spreading into the society, the Bishops reiterated the Church stand on the Matter. The Church does not allow or advocate the use of condoms as a way of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Church's solution is Chastity for those who are not Married, Fidelity to one's partner for married couples who are not infected and Abstinence from sexual intercourse for married couples if at least one partner is infected.|$|R

50|$|While the Council of Trent is {{best known}} as a Counter-Reformation Council, neither the Lutheran Church nor the Church of England broke with the Roman Catholic Church on the {{requirement}} of <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>banns</b> (or the equivalent) before marriage. (An equivalent notice was not required in the Orthodox Christian Churches, which used another method to verify eligibility to marry.) The break between some Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church was over what would constitute an impediment to marriage (the Church of England, for example, recognised remarriage after divorce in some circumstances), rather than over the means by which impediments to marriage should be identified.|$|E
5000|$|This ancient custom {{is similar}} to the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>banns</b> of marriage, but it is a civil process not an ecclesiastical one. (Ondertrouw does not refer to the banns. The Dutch phrase for [...] "banns" [...] is kerkelijke huwelijksaankondiging.) Ondertrouw existed before the Reformation and was {{continued}} afterwards. Ondertrouw has survived into modern times and exists today as a pre-marriage legal requirement in both the Netherlands and Belgium. In both countries civil marriage is compulsory and couples intending to marry register the ondertrouw beforehand at the civil registry (Burgerlijke Stand). Ondertrouw is now analogous to the process of applying for a marriage licence. Sometimes it is referred to as notice of intention to marry (huwelijksaangifte).|$|E
2500|$|For {{its first}} 16 years, Greenwich was Dutch property. Within weeks of his arrival, one of Dutch Director Peter Stuyvesant's first actions was to {{strengthen}} {{his claim to}} the area to prevent large English colonies from establishing themselves closer to the Dutch on Manhattan. [...] He purchased and received title from the Munsee named Seyseychimmus, to all the land between {{the west bank of}} the Mianus River and Stamford's Mill River, (natively called the Seweyruc), and confiscated the Feake/Patrick property in the process. [...] Angered by this, Stamford men, who answered to the New Haven Colony, demanded renegotiation of the border between New Netherland and New England. In 1650, [...] The Treaty of Hartford terms weakened Dutch control. Treaty terms, negotiated by Peter Stuyvesant and men from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, dictated that while the Dutch would continue to own the land of Groenwits, they would treat inhabitants there as jurisdictional neutrals. (This language was related to the plight of Elizabeth Fones Winthrop Feake Hallett, a niece, daughter-in-law and ward of Gov. John Winthrop, and her legal, matrimonial, political and land title disputes. She was a politically charged figure in English inter-colony squabbling). Further, this treaty prevented the Dutch from establishing any more homesteads within 6 miles of {{the west bank of the}} Mianus River. (This river was natively called the [...] "Kechkawes" [...] and called [...] "Greenwich Bay" [...] by the English). [...] Eroding jurisdictional oversight of Greenwich inhabitants resulted in early Greenwich farmers who [...] "live in a disorderly and riotous manner, sell intoxicating liquors to the Indians, receive and harbor servants who have fled their masters, and join persons unlawfully in marriage." [...] There were also cases of runaway Dutch Manhattan teenagers coming to Greenwich to be wed by a farmer there, (likely Andrew Crabb), who dispensed with the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> pre-wedding <b>banns,</b> or advance public notification. In 1656, when Dutch power had significantly declined, the New Haven Colony did exert jurisdiction over Greenwich and considered it a part of Stamford. With the fall of New Netherland to the English in 1664, the General Assembly in Hartford declared Greenwich a separate township from Stamford.|$|R
50|$|The purpose <b>of</b> <b>banns</b> is {{to enable}} anyone to raise any {{canonical}} or civil legal impediment to the marriage, {{so as to}} prevent marriages that are invalid. Impediments vary between legal jurisdictions, but would normally include a pre-existing marriage that has been neither dissolved nor annulled, a vow of celibacy, lack of consent, or the couple's being related within the prohibited degrees of kinship.|$|R
50|$|Hardwicke's Marriage Act 1753 affirmed this {{existing}} ecclesiastical law {{and built}} it into statutory law. From this date, a marriage was only legally valid, if it followed the calling <b>of</b> <b>banns</b> in church or the obtaining of a licence —the only exceptions being Jewish and Quaker marriages, whose legality was also recognised. From {{the date of}} Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act up to 1837, the ceremony was required to be performed in a consecrated building.|$|R
50|$|The {{policy of}} the Roman Catholic Church, and later various protestant churches, of {{considering}} clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran Church sought to end these practices, with limited success. Before 1929, Scots law followed Roman law in allowing a girl to marry at twelve {{years of age and}} a boy at fourteen, without any requirement for parental consent. However, marriage in Scotland at such young ages was in practice almost unknown. In England and Wales, the Marriage Act 1753 required a marriage to be covered by a licence (requiring parental consent for those under 21) or the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>banns</b> (which parents of those under 21 could forbid).|$|E
50|$|The Mass {{not being}} {{strictly}} conventual, {{it was not}} obligatory by common law {{for it to be}} sung as a Missa Cantata, but it could be, and frequently was, being prescribed by the statutes or custom of the area. It was preceded generally by the blessing and aspersion of water on Sundays. Even if the Mass was not sung, it was celebrated with additional solemnity, with more than two candles on the altar and at least two servers. What was characteristic of it is the instruction, with its special prayers, the announcements made to the congregation, the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>banns</b> of marriage, and finally the familiar sermon or homily. These later two features, so common today, were features only made an obligation at the Masses of Sundays and Holy-days relatively recently in the long history of the Mass.|$|E
50|$|A {{peculiarity}} of {{the group}} was the custom of marrying its members after partners had been selected, not by courtship, but by a jury of twelve drawing lots. This was to know precisely the will of Heaven concerning their matrimonial union (vide cleromancy). The idea was so extraordinary that even the German poet and philosopher Friedrich von Schiller, in far-away Stuttgart, was moved to write about it, and lamented in a 1781 article, Arme jugend van Calverton!, {{about the lack of}} sentimentality and passion in the arrangement. The Roeites however contended that they had the right to marry, as well as to perform any religious duty, under the Act of Toleration 1689. The Marriage Act of 1753 had tightened the existing ecclesiastical rules, providing that for a marriage to be valid it had to be performed in a church and after the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>banns.</b> However, Jews and, crucially, Quakers were seemingly exempted from its provisions (Catholics and other dissenting groups were not exempt), {{and it may be that}} John Roe believed, for this reason, that this Act did not apply to his Quaker-like group.|$|E
