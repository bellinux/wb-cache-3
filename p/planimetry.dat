The algorithm uses a representation based on coding horizontal sequences of black pixels identified in the image.

40|$|Within the {{construction}} sector, Building Information Models (BIMs) {{are more and}} more used thanks to the several benefits that they offer in the design of new buildings and the management of the existing ones. Frequently, however, BIMs are not available for already built constructions, but, at the same time, the range camera technology provides nowadays a cheap, intuitive and effective tool for automatically collecting the 3 D geometry of indoor environments. It is thus essential to find new strategies, able to perform the first step of the scan to BIM process, by extracting the geometrical information contained in the 3 D models that are so easily collected through the range cameras. In this work, a new algorithm to extract <b>planimetries</b> from the 3 D models of rooms acquired by means of a range camera is therefore presented. The algorithm was tested on two rooms, characterized by different shapes and dimensions, whose 3 D models were captured with the Occipital Structure Sensor TM. The preliminary results are promising: the developed algorithm is able to model effectively the 2 D shape of the investigated rooms, with an accuracy level comprised in the range of 5 - 10 cm.

50|$|The wind {{pressure}} is minimized by the helix shape {{made by the}} trunks in the skyscraper, described by the three sails made by the overlapping of the habitable floors which revolve around the central trunk creating in <b>planimetry</b> a growing movement based on the golden spiral. The form reacts to {{the action of the}} wind, whatever direction it comes from, in a uniform and dissipative way. The result is the elimination of two of the main negative phenomena vis-à-vis the typology of skyscrapers: the excess static caused by the asymmetry of traditional structures of rectangular design, where the pressure of the wind is highest on the long side and lowest on the short one and the Von Karman effect typical of cylindrical structures which provokes a sinusoidal whirlwind and consequently lateral pulsating forces. The helicoidal shape, on the other hand, splits up the force of the wind in resistance, leeway and lift. In that way, the lift does not have an influence on the stability and decreases the weight transmitted to the foundations.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, the site where the textile mill will be built was a {{countryside}} meadow owned by Count Giovanni Battista Durini, who held large estates in Cassina Baraggia. Less than a century later, during the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, in that place there was a rectangular court, which <b>planimetry</b> corresponds to the one has come down to present day: almost completely closed, with a single entrance from Municipal Road that from Cassina Baraggia goes to Carugate. The spinning mill was built in the second half of the nineteenth century and it was used for the first phase of silk processing, the reeling, in which the filament was extracted from the cocoon to wrap on reels. Between 1873 and 1894, the court was completely closed: the portion facing the street was elevated and, to the east of the building, it was built a group of houses intended for laborers employed in the factory. In the second half of the twentieth century, Baraggia underwent a slow decline. The Marquis Brivio, owners of most of the assets and land located in the hamlet, paid scant and manufacturing, with the textile industry crisis, were gradually abandoned. Remained empty, some houses and cottages in the courtyard collapsed from neglect.

MethodsThis study included 26 patients (69 % women, aged 67 ± 20 years, 45 % degenerative etiology) referred for mitral valvular stenosis assessment. Mitral valve area computed from real-time 3 D datasets (apical views) was compared to the results of 2 D <b>planimetry</b> (parasternal transverse view), proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA), the continuity equation and patient’s clinical status. For functional status asssessment, the following events were considered: previous heart failure, history of systemic embolic event or systolic pulmonary hypertension defined by systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 50 mmHg at rest or > 60 mmHg during exercise. ResultsMitral valve area assessed from real time 3 D <b>planimetry</b> was feasible in all patients (100 %), while the feasibility from other methods ranged from 76 % to 92 %.

Interestingly, 89 % (17 / 19, concordance= 0. 88, kappa= 0. 59) of patients with significant mitral valve stenosis (1. 5 cm 2) by real time 3 D were symptomatic versus 80 % (concordance= 0. 68, kappa= 0. 17) by 2 D <b>planimetry.</b> Finally, inter-observer reproducibility for real time 3 D <b>planimetry</b> was excellent (0. 15 ± 2 cm 2).

40|$|AIMS—The {{development}} of imaging and measurement techniques {{has brought the}} prospect of greater objectivity in the measurement of optic disc features, and therefore better agreement between observers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify and compare the variation between observers using two measurement devices.  METHODS—Optic disc photographs and images from the Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) of 30  eyes of 30  subjects were presented to six observers for analysis, and to one observer on five separate occasions. Agreement between observers was studied by comparing the analysis of each observer with the median result of the other five, and expressed as the mean difference and standard deviation of differences between the observer and the median. Inter- and intraobserver variation was calculated as a coefficient of variation (mean SD/mean ×  100).  RESULTS—For <b>planimetry,</b> agreement between observers was dependent on observer experience, for the HRT it was independent. Agreement between observers (SD of differences as a percentage of the median) for optic disc area was 4. 0 % to 7. 2 % (<b>planimetry)</b> and 3. 3 % to 6. 0 % (HRT), for neuroretinal rim area it was 10. 8 % to 21. 0 % (<b>planimetry)</b> and 5. 2 % to 9. 6 % (HRT). The mean interobserver coefficient of variation for optic disc area was 8. 1 % (<b>planimetry)</b> and 4. 4 % (HRT), for neuroretinal rim area it was 16. 3 % (<b>planimetry)</b> and 8. 1 % (HRT), and (HRT only) for rim volume was 16. 3 %, and reference height 9. 1 %. HRT variability was greater for the software version 1. 11  reference plane than for version 1. 10.  The intraobserver coefficient of variation for optic disc area was 1. 5 % (<b>planimetry)</b> and 2. 4 % (HRT), for neuroretinal rim area it was 4. 0 % (<b>planimetry)</b> and 4. 5 % (HRT).  CONCLUSIONS—Variation between observers is greatly reduced by the HRT when compared with <b>planimetry.</b> However, levels of variation, which may be clinically significant, remain for variables that depend on the subjective drawing of the disc margin. ...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveHakki's formula (Gorlin formula simplified) can be {{used during}} cardiac {{catheterization}} to calculate stenotic cardiac valve areas and can also be adapted to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure stenotic cardiac valve areas. We aimed at evaluating whether this approach was reliable to determine the severity of aortic stenosis compared with the continuity equation by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and <b>planimetry</b> by MRI. Material and methodsWe included symptomatic patients with known aortic stenosis referred to our Cardiology Department for over one year. The aortic valve area (AVA) was estimated using Hakki's formula (MRI), <b>planimetry</b> (MRI) and the continuity equation (TTE). The agreement between measurement methods was analyzed using Bland and Altman methodology. ResultsWe included 63 patients (mean age 72 ± 10 years, 35 (56 %) males). Their mean AVA was 0. 65 ± 0. 25 cm 2 by continuity equation, 0. 64 ± 0. 16 cm 2 by <b>planimetry</b> and 0. 64 ± 0. 20 cm 2 by Hakki's formula. Mean differences (95 % limits of agreement) were: 0. 03 cm 2 (- 0. 32 to 0. 25) for <b>planimetry</b> – continuity equation; 0. 05 cm 2 (- 0. 40 to 0. 29) for Hakki's formula – continuity equation; 0. 02 cm 2 (- 0. 20 to 0. 25) for Hakki's formula – <b>planimetry.</b> Reproducibility inter and intra observers by Hakki's was excellent (intra class correlation coefficient 0. 99 and 0. 98 respectively).
