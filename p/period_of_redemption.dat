50|$|The first African Americans {{to serve}} in the United States Congress were Republicans elected during the Reconstruction Era. After slaves were emancipated and granted {{citizenship}} rights, freedmen gained political representation in the Southern United States for the first time. White Democrats regained political power in state legislatures across the South and worked to restore white supremacy. By the presidential election of 1876, only three state legislatures were not controlled by white Democrats. The Compromise of 1877 completed the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>Redemption</b> by white Democratic Southerners, with the withdrawal of federal troops from the South. State legislatures began to pass Jim Crow laws to establish racial segregation and restrict labor rights, movement and organizing by blacks. They passed some laws to restrict voter registration, aimed at suppressing the black vote.|$|E
5000|$|Johann Reuchlin, (1455-1522), was [...] "Pico's most {{important}} follower". His main sources for Kabbalah were Menahem Recanati (Commentary on the Torah, Commentary on the Daily Prayers) and Joseph Gikatilla (Sha'are Orah, Ginnat 'Egoz). Reuchlin argued that human history divides into three periods: a natural {{period in which}} God revealed Himself as Shaddai (שדי), {{the period of the}} Torah in which God [...] "revealed Himself to Moses through the four-lettered name of the Tetragrammaton" [...] (יהוה), and the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption.</b> The five-letter name associated with this period is the tetragrammaton with the additional letter shin (ש). This name, YHShVH (יהשוה for 'Jesus', though the name's Hebrew version would be יהושוע), is also known as the pentagrammaton. The first of Reuchlin's two books on Cabala, De verbo mirifico, [...] "speaks of the … miraculous name of Jesus derived from the tetragrammaton". His second book, De arte cabalistica, is [...] "a broader, more informed excursion into various kabbalistic concerns".|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} fill a gap in the real estate finance {{literature}} by linking the well-known history of the Anglo–American mortgage recorded by legal scholars with the recent literature on security design and incomplete contracting in order to explain and evaluate several unique features of the mortgage. In particular, we investigate how a conditional transfer of ownership to a lender and the institution called the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> affect mortgage renegotiation and therefore the value of mortgaged real estate. Given the governance of the common law mortgage, we show that a mortgagor {{may not be able to}} renegotiate his mortgage debt in order delay repayment when faced with a re-investment opportunity during the life of the mortgage. The failure to optimally renegotiate the mortgage does not necessarily result in foreclosure but may result in underinvestment. Therefore, an additional <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time between default and foreclosure, known as a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> equitable <b>redemption,</b> may allow the mortgagor to accrue sufficient cash flow to not only avoid foreclosure but to mitigate underinvestment in non-default states. Since this extra <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time may not be achievable ex post due to a hold-up problem, its inclusion ex ante may be welfare improving.

50|$|On September 27, 2013, one of {{the three}} {{remaining}} founders, Westbrook, wrote to the other two remaining founders and outlined three proposals for avoiding the sale to InfiLaw: a cooling off <b>period,</b> the <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> the interests of Kosko and Carr by the law school, and the exploration of a merger with the College of Charleston. Westbook stated that he would donate his own one-third interest to the College of Charleston if the third option were accepted. On October 2, 2013, Carr and Kosko rejected the offer made by Westbrook, claiming that no offers had been submitted; instead, they announced that they were proceeding with pursuing a sale to InfiLaw.|$|R

5000|$|The tram is {{historically}} {{the second type}} of urban passenger transport in Moscow, the successor of the Konka (horse-driven tram). However, the presence in Moscow {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century horse-railways hindered the development of tram lines. For the laying of tram lines, it was necessary first to free the roads from horse tracks. In 1901, the council purchased the first competition of the Belgian joint-stock company. When, in 1903, came a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> horse-drawn railway the second Belgian joint stock company, the Duma is not solved, as, according to N. I. Astrov: [...] "In Russia we have not experienced builders and engineers". In November 1905, immediately after the events of October elected a new mayor Nikolai Guchkov. Its launching coincided with the revolutionary actions of workers of Moscow in November-December 1905. As soon as the life in the town had returned to normal, Nikolai Ivanovich ordered to proceed with the laying of tram tracks. In February 1907, a movement began in the Myasnitska street, the Sretenka street and the Lubyanka street, from the Passion of the monastery Dmitrovka and further the Sretenka and Myasnitskaya. The first electric tram routes linked the outskirts of the Garden ring with the center and mainly repeated konechnye.|$|E

40|$|The {{prohibition}} against 2 ̆ 2 clogging the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> 2 ̆ 2 has been {{enforced by the}} courts for centuries, yet the traditional justifications (invoking fairness or unfair bargaining power) offered for this central premise of mortgage law are rather unconvincing, particularly in the commercial context. After describing and critiquing the traditional view, this article lays out an alternative justification for the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption,</b> stressing {{the role of the}} law in fostering efficient renegotiation upon default. This view explains why the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> cannot be waived in the initial loan documents, and why it can be waived in subsequent workouts only if the court is convinced of the fairness of the waiver. Moreover, this article demonstrates that, even if the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> is an efficient term in most mortgages, an adverse selection dynamic may prevent parties from including it in their contracts, thus justifying the judicial insistence that the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> be a mandatory, rather than default, term...|$|R
