5|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>bags</b> made of {{polyethylene}} polymer with a {{thickness of}} less than 35µm were banned from retail distribution in the ACT from November2011. The ban was introduced by the ACT Government {{in an effort to}} make Canberra more sustainable.|$|E
5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with <b>plastic</b> <b>bags,</b> which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} <b>plastic</b> <b>bags,</b> a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
50|$|Lee (1977) {{designed}} a seepage meter, {{which consists of}} a chamber which is connected to a sampling port and a <b>plastic</b> <b>bag.</b> The chamber is inserted into the sediment and water discharging through the sediments is caught within the <b>plastic</b> <b>bag.</b> The change in volume of water which is caught in the <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> over time represents the freshwater flux.|$|R
40|$|Deaths due to <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> {{suffocation}} or <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> asphyxia are {{not reported}} in Malaysia. In the West many suicides by <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> asphyxia, {{particularly in the}} elderly {{and those who are}} chronically and terminally ill, have been reported. Accidental deaths too are not uncommon in the West, both among small children who play with shopping bags and adoles-cents who are solvent abusers. Another well-known but not so common form of accidental death from <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> asphyxia is sexual asphyxia, which is mostly seen among adult males. Homicide by <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> asphyxia too is reported in the West and the victims are invariably infants or adults who are frail or terminally ill and who cannot struggle. Two deaths due to <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> asphyxia are presented. Both the autopsies were performed at the University Hospital Mortuary, Kuala Lumpur. Both victims were 50 -year old married Chinese males. One death was diagnosed as suicide and the other as sexual asphyxia. Sexual asphyxia is generally believed to be a problem associated exclusively with the West. Specific autopsy findings are often absent in deaths due to <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> asphyxia and therefore such deaths could be missed when some interested parties have altered the scene and most importantly have removed the <b>plastic</b> <b>bag.</b> A visit to the scene of death is invariably useful...|$|R

5|$|Much {{floating}} plastic trash {{does not}} biodegrade, instead disintegrating {{over time and}} eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> and fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{wanting to}} contact {{his parents in}} the United States, Owumi {{was not able to}} access the Internet or use his phone for {{international}} calls. He was also without electricity and had little food or water. Al-Nasr team president Ahmed Elturki also told Owumi that the airport in Libya had been burned down by protesters and advised him to remain in his apartment. Trapped in Mutassim's apartment during conflict, Owumi was eventually forced to drink toilet water with tea bags, urinate in the bathtub, and defecate into <b>plastic</b> <b>bags.</b> He also ate cockroaches and worms he found in the flower pots. His poor living conditions caused his teeth to rot and his skin to discolor.|$|E
5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle {{in response to the}} rustling of <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.|$|E

5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, {{such as water}} cress or floating sweetgrass, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even <b>plastic</b> <b>bags.</b> In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E
5|$|Kemper {{then put}} {{both of the}} women's bodies {{in the trunk of}} his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into <b>plastic</b> <b>bags,</b> which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
5000|$|One of San Francisco's waste {{reduction}} measures, the city's <b>Plastic</b> <b>Bag</b> Reduction Ordinance (described {{in the history}} section), has achieved national and international attention. Within a year of its implementation, Boston, Portland, and Phoenix were investigating such <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> bans, and city supervisor Ross Mirkarimi had fielded inquiries from Paris and London. However, the Marin County suburb of Fairfax retreated from a similar ban when the <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> industry threatened legal action. Mayor Mary Ann Maggiore stated {{that the city was}} too small to fight the suit. [...] On April 26, 2011, the San Francisco Bay Area county of Santa Clara also passed a <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> ban in unincorporated areas of the county, but this ban excludes restaurants and non-profit organizations.|$|R

5|$|On October31, a {{disaster}} declaration was signed for Honduras {{due to the}} effects from Beta. USAID sent $50,000 in funds {{for the purchase of}} relief items such as blankets, foam mattresses, and hygiene kits. Two Fokker F27 aircraft were also supplied to help assist the transportation of relief supplies at a cost of $40,000. The United States Department of Defense sent military personnel to the affected areas from November4–8. During that time, more than 155,000lb (70,306kg) of relief supplies were airlifted to the affected communities. The United States embassy in Honduras also provided a C-12 Huron aircraft to transport 3,000lb (1,360kg) to Puerto Lempira. A total of $500,000 was sent in the form of relief supplies and transport to Honduras from USAID. The Spanish Government offered a C-130 Hercules containing emergency supplies to Honduras. The World Food Programme pre-positioned 509tons (461.7tonnes) of food to be used in temporary shelters and recovery activities. The government of Great Britain offered humanitarian assistance, consisting of 1,500 <b>plastic</b> <b>bags,</b> 1,800 jerrycans, one helicopter, five boats, 250 military personnel, and five medical assistants.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} <b>plastic</b> <b>bags,</b> baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E
5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E
40|$|In 2007, San Francisco {{adopted the}} first <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> ban in the United States. Since then 55 jurisdictions in the San Francisco Bay Area have adopted similar ordinances. Using {{diffusion}} of innovation theory, {{this study examines}} the determinants of <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> policy adoption in the nine-county Bay Area region. The diffusion of Bay Area <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> policies was mainly determined by the <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> industry???s legal challenges, subsequent judicial decisions, and the sharing of financial and informational resources between higher-level jurisdictions and their participating agencies. Ancillary drivers of policy adoption were the support from an advocacy organization {{and the need for}} jurisdictions to comply with overarching environmental policies. Demographic analysis showed that a jurisdiction???s political party preference and population size had a significant relationship with the timing of adoption...|$|R

5|$|Whales {{can also}} be {{threatened}} by humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include beaked whales. Whales are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain. They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales as they are higher up the food chain than baleen whales. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. They {{can also be}} poisoned by swallowing litter, such as <b>plastic</b> <b>bags.</b> Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some whales. Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger whale beachings, and they point to signs that such whales have experienced decompression sickness.|$|E
