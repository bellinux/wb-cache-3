40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate how the management practices of <b>prescribed</b> fire and understorey vegetation removal affect water and nutrient relations of old, yet prematurely declining Eucalyptus gomphocephala. Long unburnt sites were established in Yalgorup National Park, Western Australia, adjacent to frequently burnt state forest sites. Trees were allocated to vegetation clearing, <b>prescribed</b> fire or no <b>prescribed</b> fire treatments. <b>Prescribed</b> fire was achieved in only one long unburnt national park site so that the results were pseudoreplicated but analysed accordingly. Soil chemistry, plant nutrient availability and tree foliar carbon and nitrogen isotope ratio and nutrient concentration were investigated. No effects of vegetation clearing were found. <b>Prescribed</b> fire sites were associated with sky exposure and bare ground whereas no <b>prescribed</b> fire sites were associated with shrub and litter cover and litter depth. Foliar carbon isotope ratios were significantly more negative in <b>prescribed</b> fire, relative to no <b>prescribed</b> fire, treatments on long unburnt sites. Soil exchangeable Zn and Mn and plant available (estimated by charged resin beads) Mg were higher on <b>prescribed</b> fire, relative to no <b>prescribed</b> fire, long unburnt sites. Seedling bioassays indicated elevated P and Cu availability on <b>prescribed</b> fire, relative to no <b>prescribed</b> fire, treatments. In overstorey E. gomphocephala, foliar N levels were elevated (but not to excessive levels), and there was a trend toward elevated foliar Mn, in <b>prescribed</b> fire relative to no <b>prescribed</b> fire treatments on long unburnt sites. In the context of our large-scale pseudoreplicated case study, <b>prescribed</b> fire provided a pulse of water and N, (with some indications towards provision of elevated Mn, Cu and Mg) availability to E. gomphocephala in decline on sites with a history of a long absence of fire that may in part underpin observations of elevated tree health on sites that have a history of relatively frequent fire...|$|R

5|$|To more {{effectively}} minimize recurrence {{and severity of}} epistaxis, other options {{may be used in}} conjunction with therapies listed above. Intravenously administered anti-VEGF substances such as bevacizumab (brand name Avastin), pazopinab and thalidomide or its derivatives interfere with the production of new blood vessels that are weak and therefore prone to bleeding. Due to the past experiences with <b>prescribing</b> thalidomide to pregnant women to alleviate symptoms of nausea and the terrible birth defects that followed, thalidomide is a last resort therapy. Additionally, thalidomide can cause neuropathy. Though this can be mitigated by tinkering with dosages and <b>prescribing</b> its derivatives such as lenolidomide and pomalidomide, many doctors prefer alternative VEGF inhibitors. Bevacizumab has been shown to significantly reduce the severity of epistaxis without side effects.|$|E
5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of <b>prescribing</b> rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or <b>prescribing</b> codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The <b>prescribing</b> information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat.

The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for <b>prescribing</b> antibiotics.

40|$|<b>Prescribed</b> fire can {{potentially}} reduce carbon emissions from unplanned fires. This potential will differ among ecosystems owing to inherent {{differences in the}} efficacy of <b>prescribed</b> burning in reducing unplanned fire activity (or ‘leverage’, i. e. the reduction in area of unplanned fire per unit area of <b>prescribed</b> fire). In temperate eucalypt forests, <b>prescribed</b> burning leverage is relatively low and potential for mitigation of carbon emissions from unplanned fires via <b>prescribed</b> fire is potentially limited. Simulations of fire regimes accounting for non-linear patterns of fuel dynamics for three fuel types characteristic of eucalypt forests in south-eastern Australia supported this prediction. Estimated mean annual fuel consumption increased with diminishing leverage and increasing rate of <b>prescribed</b> burning, even though average fire intensity (<b>prescribed</b> and unplanned fires combined) decreased. The results indicated that use of <b>prescribed</b> burning in these temperate forests is unlikely to yield a net reduction in carbon emissions. Future increases in burning rates under climate change may increase emissions and reduce carbon sequestration. A more detailed understanding of the efficacy of <b>prescribed</b> burning and dynamics of combustible biomass pools is required to clarify the potential for mitigation of carbon emissions in temperate eucalypt forests and other ecosystems...|$|R
