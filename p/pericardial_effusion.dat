5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusion,</b> which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common signs of CMML is splenomegaly, found in {{approximately}} half of cases. Other less frequent signs and symptoms consist of anaemia, fever, weight loss, night sweats, infection, bleeding, synovitis, lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, pleural effusion, <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusion</b> and peritoneal effusion.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia nervosa {{increases}} the risk of sudden cardiac death, though the precise cause is unknown. Cardiac complications include structural and functional changes to the heart. Some of these cardiovascular changes are mild and are reversible with treatment, while others may be life-threatening.

Through this review, clinicians caring for patients with <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> will learn to rapidly diagnose this condition directly at the bedside. Clinicians will also learn to differentiate between simple <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> in contrast to more complicated effusions causing cardiac tamponade. Indications for emergency pericardiocentesis are covered, so that clinicians can rapidly determine which group of patients will benefit from an emergency procedure to drain the effusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{establish}} the prevalence of large <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, and to determine the incidence of various types of effusions. A total of 233 patients presented with large <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions.</b> Each patient underwent tests for HIV, sputum smear and culture, blood culture, blood biochemistry and serological testing. Tuberculous <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> were diagnosed according to pre-determined criteria. Eighty-four patients (36. 1 %) {{were found to be}} HIV positive; 81 of these (96. 4 %) had tuberculous pericarditis. More than 65 % of the study population was aged between 15 and 39 years. The prevalence of HIV amongst unemployed individuals was 49. 0 % compared to 30. 0 % amongst employed individuals. Tuberculous pericarditis was {{the most common cause of}} <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> (69. 5 %, n= 162). It was concluded that tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of pericarditis in this province of South Africa.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] To describe the abnormalities on chest X-ray (CXR) in patients presenting with tuberculous <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions.</b> Methods: One hundred and seventy patients presented to Tygerberg Hospital with large <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> (epi-pericardial separation > 10 mm). All patients had a diagnostic work-up, which included CXR, ECG, two-dimensional echocardiography and HIV serology. Echocardiography was followed by pericardiocentesis and drainage. Pericardial fluid was analysed for adenosine deaminase (ADA), Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) stain, bacterial and mycobacterial cultures. Sputum was sent for ZN stain and mycobacterial cultures. Tuberculous <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> were diagnosed according to predetermined criteria. Results: The diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis was made in 53 % (n = 90) of patients with <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions.</b> Forty-one of the subjects (45. 5 %) were HIV positive. All patients had an enlarged cardiac silhouette and {{in the majority of}} cases, the cardiac shadow was globular with distinct margins. The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) exceeded 0. 55 in all patients. The amount of fluid drained correlated with the radiographic finding of cardiac enlargement. Conclusion: In developing countries where TB is very prevalent, CXR {{plays an important role in}} the identification of large <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions.</b> Although sonography will still be required for a definite diagnosis, the results of this study show that CXR is a useful screening tool.

25|$|Pericardial effusion* is a {{collection}} of fluid in the pericardium. It is usually serosanguinous (bloody fluid). Serosanguinous accumulation can be caused by cancer, usually hemangiosarcoma or a heart base tumor, idiopathic pericarditis. Rare causes include trauma, clotting disorders, and left atrial rupture. Serous accumulation is rare and caused by heart failure, peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernias, uremia, pericardial cysts, or hypoalbuminemia. Rarely <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusion</b> can be caused by infection and consist of pus. An echocardiogram should be done prior to draining the fluid, if possible, to identify the cause (e.g., tumor). Drainage of the fluid (pericardiocentesis) relieves the clinical signs and, in the case of idiopathic pericarditis, can be curative.|$|E
25|$|Congestive heart failure* is {{the result}} of any severe, {{overwhelming}} heart disease that most commonly results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), and/or ascites (fluid in the abdomen). It can be caused by the above two diseases, congenital heart defects such as patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) disease, or <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusion.</b> Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. Left-sided heart failure results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Right-sided heart failure results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), uncommonly fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), or, rarely, peripheral edema.|$|E
25|$|AF often occurs after {{cardiac surgery}} {{and is usually}} self-limiting. It is {{strongly}} associated with age, preoperative hypertension, {{and the number of}} vessels grafted. Measures should be taken to control hypertension preoperatively {{to reduce the risk of}} AF. Also, people with a higher risk of AF, e.g., people with pre-operative hypertension, more than 3 vessels grafted, or greater than 70 years of age, should be considered for prophylactic treatment. Postoperative <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusion</b> is also suspected to be the cause of atrial fibrillation. Prophylaxis may include prophylactic postoperative rate and rhythm management. Some authors perform posterior pericardiotomy to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF. When AF occurs, management should primarily be rate and rhythm control. However, cardioversion may be employed if the person is hemodynamically unstable, highly symptomatic, or persists for 6 weeks after discharge. In persistent cases, anticoagulation should be used.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the clinical, echocardiographic and laboratory characteristics of large <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> and cardiac tamponade secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). An ongoing prospective study was conducted at Tygerberg Academic Hospital, South Africa between 1996 and 2002. All patients older than 13 years presenting with large <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> (. 10 mm) requiring pericardiocentesis were included. Eight cases (out of 258) were diagnosed with SLE. The mean (SD) age was 29. 5 (10. 7) years. Common clinical features were Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthralgia and lupus nephritis class III/IV. Echocardiography showed Libman–Sacks endocarditis (LSE) in all the mitral valves. Two patients developed transient left ventricular dysfunction; both these patients had pancarditis. Typical serological findings included antinuclear antibodies, anti-double stranded DNA antibodies, low complement C 4 levels and low C 3 levels. CRP was elevated in six cases. Treatment consisted of oral steroids and complete drainage of the <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions.</b> No repeat <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> or constrictive pericarditis developed amongst the survivors (3. 1 years follow up). This study concludes that large <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> due to SLE are rare, and associated with nephritis, LSE and myocardial dysfunction.

40|$|SETTING: An {{academic}} {{hospital in}} the Western Cape, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cytokine production (interferon-gamma [IFN-γ], interleukin- 1 [IL- 1], interleukin- 2 [IL- 2], interleukin- 6 [IL- 6], interleukin- 10 [IL- 10], interleukin- 4 [IL- 4] and tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α]) in patients with tuberculous pericarditis. DESIGN: Subpopulation of a consecutive prospective case series. PATIENTS: Thirty patients presenting with <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> due to tuberculosis (n = 19), malignancy (n = 6) and non-tuberculous infections (n = 5), and five control subjects who had undergone open heart surgery. RESULTS: The concentration of IFN-γ was significantly higher in tuberculous <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> than in the other diagnostic classes (P < 0. 0005). The concentration of TNF-α was similar in both infective and tuberculous effusions, but {{was significantly higher than}} that of malignant effusions. IL- 1 and IL- 2 were undetectable in malignant effusions, but elevated in both infective and tuberculous <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions.</b> The levels of IL- 1 and IL- 2 were furthermore significantly higher in <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> due to infective compared to tuberculous causes. The concentration of IL- 6, while elevated in all diagnostic classes, was significantly higher in the malignant group. Elevated levels of IL- 10 and undetectable levels of IL- 4 were observed in all three diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that tuberculous <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions</b> arise due to a hypersensitivity reaction that is orchestrated by the TH- 1 lymphocytes. Articl...|$|R

2500|$|Measuring LDH in fluid {{aspirated}} from a {{pleural effusion}} (or <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusion)</b> {{can help in}} the distinction between exudates (actively secreted fluid, e.g. due to inflammation) or transudates (passively secreted fluid, due to a high hydrostatic pressure or a low oncotic pressure). The usual criterion (included in Light's criteria) is that a ratio of fluid LDH versus upper limit of normal serum LDH of more than 0.6 or [...] indicates an exudate, while a ratio of less indicates a transudate. Different laboratories have different values for the upper limit of serum LDH, but examples include 200 and 300 IU/L. In empyema, the LDH levels, in general, will exceed 1000 IU/L.|$|E

2500|$|Cerebral {{hypoperfusion}} is {{the reduction}} of blood flow to {{all parts of the}} brain. The reduction could be to a particular part of the brain depending on the cause. It is most commonly due to heart failure from cardiac arrest or arrhythmias, or from reduced cardiac output as a result of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusion,</b> or bleeding. Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen content) may precipitate the hypoperfusion. Because the reduction in blood flow is global, all parts of the brain may be affected, especially vulnerable [...] "watershed" [...] areas - border zone regions supplied by the major cerebral arteries. A watershed stroke refers to the condition when the blood supply to these areas is compromised. Blood flow to these areas does not necessarily stop, but instead it may lessen to the point where brain damage can occur.|$|E

2500|$|Cats {{that develop}} {{lymphoma}} {{are much more}} likely to develop more severe symptoms than dogs. Whereas dogs often appear healthy initially except for swollen lymph nodes, cats will often be physically ill. The symptoms correspond closely to the location of the lymphoma. [...] The most common sites for alimentary (gastrointestinal) lymphoma are, in decreasing frequency, the small intestine, the stomach, the junction of the ileum, cecum, and colon. [...] Cats with the alimentary form of lymphoma often present with weight loss, rough hair coat, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea, although vomiting and diarrhea are commonly absent as symptoms. [...] The tumor can also cause life-threatening blockage of the intestine. [...] Cats with the mediastinal form often have respiratory distress and fluid in the thoracic cavity. If lymphoma develops in the kidney, the cat may have increased water consumption and increased urination. Lymphoma of the kidney presents as bilateral kidney enlargement and failure. If the lymphoma is located in the nose, the cat may have discharge from the nose and facial swelling. Lymphoma of the heart causes congestive heart failure, <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusion,</b> and cardiac arrhythmias. [...] Ocular lymphoma in cats often presents as anterior uveitis (inflammation of the inside of the eye). [...] Cats who are also infected with FeLV often present with pale mucous membranes due to anemia. Anemia is a common problem in all cats with lymphoma, but hypercalcemia is rare.|$|E

Patients: One hundred ten hospital patients > 12 years old, who presented to the echocardiography department with large <b>pericardial</b> <b>effusions,</b> and 12 control subjects who underwent open-heart surgery (coronary artery bypass graft or aortic valve replacement). Measurements: Fluid was sent for examination of biochemistry, adenosine deaminase, microbiology, hematology, and cytology.
