5|$|The PanzerI was {{upgraded}} {{in order}} to increase its lethality. On 8August 1937, Major General García Pallasar received a note from Generalísimo Francisco Franco that expressed the need for a PanzerI (or negrillo, as their Spanish crews called them) with a 20-millimeter gun. Ultimately, the piece chosen was the Breda Model 1935, due to the simplicity of the design over competitors such as the German Flak 30. Furthermore, the 20mm Breda was capable of <b>perforating</b> 40millimeters of armour at 250meters (1.57in at 275yd), which was more than sufficient to penetrate the frontal armour of the T-26. Although originally 40 Italian CV.35 light tanks were ordered with the Breda in place of their original armament, this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same gun to the PanzerI would yield better results. Prototypes were ready by September1937 and an order was placed after successful results. The mounting of the Breda in the Panzer I required the original turret to be opened at the top and then extended by a vertical supplement. Four of these tanks were finished at the Armament Factory of Seville, but further production was canceled as it was decided sufficient numbers of Republican T-26 tanks had been captured to fulfill the Nationalist leadership's request for more lethal tanks. The Breda modification was not particularly liked by German crews, as the unprotected gap in the turret, designed to allow the tank's commander to aim, was found to be a dangerous weak point.|$|E

25|$|Casing is set {{above the}} {{producing}} zone, the zone is drilled and the liner casing is cemented in place. The liner is then perforated for production.

25|$|Completion, in {{petroleum}} production, is {{the process}} of making a well ready for production (or injection).

25|$|Openhole {{completions}} (in {{comparison with}} cemented pipe) require {{better understanding of}} formation damage, wellbore clean-up and fluid loss control. A key difference is that <b>perforating</b> penetrates through the first 6-18 inches (15–45cm) of formation around the wellbore, whilst openhole completions require the reservoir fluids to flow {{through all of the}} filtrate-invaded zone around the wellbore and lift-off of the mud filter cake.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mechanical {{buckling}} analysis of rectangular plates with central circular cutout is performed in this paper. The finite-element method {{is used to}} {{study the effects of}} plate-support conditions, aspect ratio, and hole size on the mechanical buckling strength of the <b>perforated</b> plates subjected to linearly varying loading. Results show that increasing the hole size does not necessarily reduce the mechanical buckling strength of the <b>perforated</b> plates. It is also concluded that the clamped boundary condition increases the mechanical buckling strength of the <b>perforated</b> plates more than the simply-supported boundary condition and the free boundary conditions enhance the mechanical buckling strength of the <b>perforated</b> plates more effectively than the fixed boundary conditions. Furthermore, for the bending cases, the critical buckling load of <b>perforated</b> plates with free edges is less than <b>perforated</b> plates with fixed edges.

40|$|High {{pressure}} reducing valve (HPRV) is a key device for the pressure control of high temperature and pressure steam in industrial processes. <b>Perforated</b> plate is used as the throttling element to ensure the suitable pressure of steam and reduce aerodynamic noise inside HPRV and the linked pipelines. Mach number is the parameter to reflect the compressibility of steam flow. Higher Mach number may cause serious aerodynamic noise of steams flow, waste {{large amount of energy}} and do harm to the valves and pipelines. In this paper, Mach number on multi-stage <b>perforated</b> plates inside a novel HPRV and the linked pipelines is investigated. Mach number in reversible isentropic process is analyzed and the design method of multi-stage <b>perforated</b> plates in HPRV is proposed. Then, the RNG k-ϵ model combining with compressible gas is established, and the Mach number simulation of single <b>perforated</b> plate and multi-stage <b>perforated</b> plates is carried out in software Fluent 6. 3. Meanwhile, Mach number inside HPRV is also presented, and the pressure ratio of <b>perforated</b> plate is also investigated. It can be found that under higher pressure ratio, the influence area of the last <b>perforated</b> plate becomes larger, and the energy loss in <b>perforated</b> plate is larger than the valve core. Furthermore, there exists a limited pressure ratio of every stage <b>perforated</b> plate, and it is better to keep the pressure ratio of every stage <b>perforated</b> plate larger than 0. 5. This work presents the function of <b>perforated</b> plates in HPRV for throttling and reducing aerodynamic noises, and it can benefit the researchers who are dealing with multi-stage <b>perforated</b> plates design for valves and pipelines...|$|R
