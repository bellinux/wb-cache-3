5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Swiss {{scientist}} Albert Hofmann—known for {{the synthesis of}} the psychedelic drug LSD—chemically analyzed P.semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of <b>paper</b> <b>chromatography,</b> Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) psilocybin in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in Psilocybe species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified P.semilanceata—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then {{support the idea that}} the variability of psilocybin content in P.semilanceata is low, regardless of country of origin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>chromatography</b> is a {{technique}} that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of chromatography paper. The paper is placed in a container with a shallow layer of solvent and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture, which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.|$|E

Moreover {{since the first}} introduction of the detailed techniques by Hagioka in 1949, many investigations, using this method, have been made. With the cosideration that the correlation, if any, would be found out betwe e n the amount of free amino acids in the tuberculous focus and that in other tissue, many experiments were done for several years by using the <b>paper</b> partition <b>chromatography</b> and revealed the facts described in the following three parts. In this part of the report, the basic experiment to <b>paper</b> partition <b>chromatography</b> and the method adopted by this author are described, and then the free amino acids within the cavity tissue of thirty kidneys extirpated under the diagnosis of kidney tuberculosis are qualitatively distinguished by applying the two dimension method of <b>paper</b> partition <b>chromatography.</b> The following fifteen free amino acids could be easily recognized asparatic acid, glutamic acid, tyrosine, serine, valine, leucine, alanine, threonine, glycine, phenylalanine and arginine, S i x amino acids of cystine, proline, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine and arginine are easily fluctuated when the condition varies. In the ten extirpated tuberculous kidneys the free amino acids contained only in the caseous substance of its kidney were distinctly observed by the same way, and they were serine, glutamic acid, asparatic acid, alanine, glycine, tyrosine, valine, threonine, cystine, phenylanine, proline, leucine, histidine and methionine.

25|$|Planar {{chromatography}} is {{a separation}} technique {{in which the}} stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed (<b>paper</b> <b>chromatography)</b> or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate (thin layer chromatography). Different compounds in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase {{as compared to the}} mobile phase. The specific Retention factor (Rf) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.|$|E
25|$|They are {{analogous}} to the calculation of retention factor for a <b>paper</b> <b>chromatography</b> separation, but describes how well HPLC separates a mixture into two or more components that are detected as peaks (bands) on a chromatogram. The HPLC parameters are the: efficiency factor(N), the retention factor (kappa prime), and the separation factor (alpha). Together the factors are variables in a resolution equation, which describes how well two components' peaks separated or overlapped each other. These parameters are mostly only used for describing HPLC reversed phase and HPLC normal phase separations, since those separations {{tend to be more}} subtle than other HPLC modes (e.g. ion exchange and size exclusion).|$|E
25|$|Chromatography {{technique}} developed substantially as {{a result}} of the work of Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge during the 1940s and 1950s, for which they won the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.|$|E

40|$|Two {{new species}} of antigens were {{detected}} in simian virus 40 -transformed mouse cells, {{in addition to the}} large (94, 000 daltons) and small (20, 000 daltons) tumor antigens. These antigens were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts by using anti-T serum and not normal, nonimmune serum. One of these was a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 130, 000 and was present in some but not all SV 40 -transformed mouse cells. The other, which we have named Tau antigen, has a molecular weight of 56, 000 as estimated by electrophoresis through acrylamide gels and was found in all virus-transformed cells examined. The 13, 000 -daltons antigen contained about 15 methionine-tryptic peptides which were also present in the large SV 40 tumor antigen as determined by ion-exchange chromatography. This strongly suggested that the protein was virus coded. The 56, 000 -dalton Tau antigen appeared to share only two methionine-tryptic peptides with the large species of SV 40 tumor antigen, as determined by ion-exchange and <b>paper</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> Our results are compatible with a cellular origin for Tau antigen.

25|$|Thin layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) is {{a widely}} employed laboratory technique used to separate different biochemicals {{on the basis of}} their size and is similar to <b>paper</b> <b>chromatography.</b> However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel, alumina, or cellulose on a flat, inert substrate. TLC is very versatile; multiple samples can be separated simultaneously on the same layer, making it very useful for screening applications such as testing drug levels and water purity. Possibility of cross-contamination is low since each separation is performed on a new layer. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, better quantitative analysis, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and faster separation that utilizes less solvent, high-performance TLC can be used. An older popular use had been to differentiate chromosomes by observing distance in gel (separation of was a separate step).|$|E
500|$|The {{wide range}} of {{instrumentation}} for forensic chemical analysis also began to be developed during this time period.

[...] Their experiments with spectroscopy showed that specific substances created a unique spectrum when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. [...] Using spectroscopy, the two scientists were able to identify substances based on their spectrum, providing a method of identification for unknown materials. [...] In 1906 botanist Mikhail Tsvet invented <b>paper</b> <b>chromatography,</b> an early predecessor to thin layer chromatography, and used it to separate and examine the plant proteins that make up chlorophyll. [...] The ability to separate mixtures into their individual components allows forensic chemists to examine the parts of an unknown material against a database of known products.

2500|$|Partition {{chromatography}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of chromatography that chemists developed. The partition coefficient principle has been applied in <b>paper</b> <b>chromatography,</b> thin layer chromatography, gas phase and liquid–liquid separation applications. The 1952 Nobel Prize in chemistry was earned by Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge for their development of the technique, which was used for their separation of amino acids. Partition chromatography uses a retained solvent, on the surface or within the grains or fibers of an [...] "inert" [...] solid supporting matrix as with paper chromatography; or takes advantage of some coulombic and/or hydrogen donor interaction with the stationary phase. Analyte molecules partition between a liquid stationary phase and the eluent. Just as in Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC; a sub-technique within HPLC), this method separates analytes based on differences in their polarity. HILIC most often uses a bonded polar stationary phase and a mobile phase made primarily of acetonitrile with water as the strong component. Partition HPLC has been used historically on unbonded silica or alumina supports. Each works effectively for separating analytes by relative polar differences. HILIC bonded phases have the advantage of separating acidic, basic and neutral solutes in a single chromatographic run.|$|E

Gause was awarded the Stalin Prize for Medicine for his discovery in 1946. In 1944, Gramicidin S was sent by the Ministry of Health of the USSR to Great Britain via the International Red Cross in a collaborative effort to establish the exact structure. English chemist Richard Synge proved that the compound was an original antibiotic and a polypeptide using <b>paper</b> <b>chromatography.</b> He would later go on to receive the Nobel Prize for his work in chromatography. The crystal structure was finally established by Dorothy Hodgkin and Gerhard Schmidt; Margaret Thatcher worked for a term in 1947 with Gerhard Schmidt on the antibiotic Gramicidin S, as an undergraduate research project. [...] The importance of Gramicidin S and antibiotic research in general was so great that Gause was not persecuted during the period of Lysenkoism in the USSR, while many of his colleagues were being executed.

While the range of analytes to which zero volt PS is applicable is very similar to kV PS and nESI, differences in the mass spectra of mixtures are interpreted in terms of the more significant effects of analyte surface activity in the gentler zero volt experiment than in the other methods due to the significantly lower charge. The signal intensity of zero volt PS is also lower than in the other methods.

Complete kinetic studies of thyroxine and triiodothyronine were compared in the same individual in four of the subjects. The extrathyroidal conversion rates of thyroxine to triiodothyronine were calculated from data obtained during both the injection and the postinjection periods as functions of the 14 C-labeled thyroxine and triiodothyronine remaining in the body at time t and their fractional turnover rates. The average daily rate of the extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine was 4 % of the extrathyroidal thyroxine pool or 33 % of the total thyroxine production. The amount of triiodothyronine generated by this pathway (22 μg/day) was found to contribute 31 % of the extrathyroidal triiodothyronine pool or 41 % of the daily triiodothyronine production.
