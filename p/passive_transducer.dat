50|$|The {{noise figure}} {{can also be}} seen as the {{decrease}} in signal to noise ratio (SNR) caused by passing a signal through a system if the original signal had a noise temperature of 290 K. This is a common way of expressing the noise contributed by a radio frequency amplifier regardless of the amplifier's gain. For instance, assume an amplifier has a noise temperature 870 K and thus a noise figure of 6 dB. If that amplifier is used to amplify a source having a noise temperature of about room temperature (290 K), as many sources do, then the insertion of that amplifier would reduce the SNR of a signal by 6 dB. This simple relationship is frequently applicable where the source's noise is of thermal origin since a <b>passive</b> <b>transducer</b> will often have a noise temperature similar to 290 K.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSolutions for the {{development}} of compact RF <b>passive</b> <b>transducers</b> as an alternative to standard surface or bulk acoustic wave devices are receiving increasing interest. This article presents results on {{the development}} of an acoustic band-pass filter based on periodically poled ferroelectric domains in lithium niobate. The fabrication of periodically poled transducers (PPTs) operating in the range of 20 to 650 MHz has been achieved on 3 -in (76. 2 -mm) 500 -μm-thick wafers. This kind of transducer is able to excite elliptical as well as longitudinal modes, yielding phase velocities of about 3800 and 6500 ms(- 1), respectively. A new type of acoustic band-pass filter is proposed, based on the use of PPTs instead of the SAWs excited by classical interdigital transducers. The design and the fabrication of such a filter are presented, as well as experimental measurements of its electrical response and transfer function. The feasibility of such a PPT-based filter is thereby demonstrated and the limitations of this method are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Members of a {{panel of}} stress-responsive biosensors {{have been used to}} study the effect of {{megahertz}} frequency ultrasound on Escherichia coli. Insonification causes acoustic cavitation, the collapse of oscillating microbubbles in solution, which can damage bacterial cells. A focused 1 -MHz ultrasound transducer, capable of generating a spatial peak pulse average intensity of 500 W/cm 2, was used to treat liquid bacterial cultures. Stress-responsive promoters fused to luxCDABE allowed the continuous measurement of light produced as a result of protein damage, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and membrane perturbation. A promoter responsive to ammonia limitation was not transcriptionally activated under test conditions. In contrast to bacteria in exponentially growing cultures, those in stationary-phase cultures were more resistant to the effects of ultrasound treatment. Quantification of the degree of acoustic cavitation due to symmetric bubble collapse was measured by a 20 -MHz <b>passive</b> <b>transducer,</b> the output of which appears to be only partially correlated with cellular damage and survival. The methods and results summarized here provide the basis for further investigation into applications, including the purification of water samples...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an imaging method for the localization {{of the impact}} point in complex anisotropic structures with diffuse field conditions, using only one <b>passive</b> <b>transducer.</b> The proposed technique {{is based on the}} reciprocal time reversal approach (inverse filtering) applied to a number of waveforms stored into a database containing the experimental Green's function of the structure. Unlike most acoustic emission monitoring systems, the present method exploits the benefits of multiple scattering, mode conversion, and boundaries reflections to achieve the focusing of the source with high resolution. Compared to a standard time reversal approach, the optimal refocusing of the back propagated wave field at the impact point is accomplished through a virtual imaging process. The robustness of the inverse filtering technique is experimentally demonstrated on a dissipative stiffened composite panel and the source position can be retrieved {{with a high level of}} accuracy in any position of the structure.

The present method exploits the benefits of multiple scattering, mode conversion and boundaries reflections to achieve the focusing of the source with high resolution. The optimal re-focusing of the back propagated wave field at the impact point is accomplished through a "virtual" imaging process, which does not require any iterative algorithms and a priori knowledge of the mechanical properties of the structure. The robustness of the time reversal method is experimentally demonstrated on a stiffened composite panel and the source position can be retrieved {{with a high level of}} accuracy (error less than 3 %). The simple configuration, minimal processing requirements and computational time (less than 1 sec) make this method a valid alternative to the conventional imaging structural health monitoring systems for the acoustic emission source localization. 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Clinical {{instability}} is {{the loss}} of the spine´s ability to maintain its patterns of displacement under physiologic loads so there is no neurologic deficit, no major deformity and no incapacitating pain. Instability is considered as an important cause of low back pain. To maintain lumbar stability it is necessary the integrity of the neural, <b>passive</b> (<b>transducers)</b> and active (actuators) subsystems. Patients who suffer of this condition have changes in the recruitment pattern of the abdominal muscles and multifidus that may cause disability. The present study aimed {{to examine the effects of}} a four-week specific stabilization exercises intervention on pain and disability of subjects with chronic low back pain. Thirteen nonspecific chronic low back pain subjects were recruited for this study. There were a significant reduction in pain (p= 0, 007) and disability (p= 0, 002) after the four-week stabilization exercises intervention. These results suggest that a smaller oriented rehabilitation period is able to promote significant improvement in pain intensity and function, possibly reducing the time of absence from work and costs with health...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAcoustic wave {{devices are}} well known <b>passive</b> <b>transducers</b> for probing through a {{wireless}} link a physical quantity. Amongst the two main classes of designs - resonators and delay lines - the former {{have the advantage of}} providing informations in a narrow band signal and are hence compatible with an interrogation strategy compliant with radiofrequency (RF) emission regulations, while the latter are probed by a short RF pulse with larger instantaneous energy and shorter response time. We here demonstrate the measurement of temperature using the two configurations, and more specifically for sensors buried in soil. While we demonstrate long term stability and ruggedness of packaged resonators, and signal to noise ratio compatible with the envisioned application, the interrogation range in insufficient for most purposes and we focus towards the use of delay lines. Indeed, the interrogation method of the latter is similar to that used by ground penetrating RADAR (GPR) which displays interrogation ranges in the meter to tens of meters in the lower RF range, depending on soil water content, permittivity and conductivity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeContinuous {{monitoring}} of liver fibrosis progression in patients is not feasible {{with the current}} diagnostic golden standard (needle biopsy). Recently, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) {{has emerged as a}} promising method for such continuous monitoring. Since there are different MRE methods {{that could be used in}} a clinical setting there is a need to investigate whether measurements produced by these MRE methods are comparable. Hence, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether the measurements of the viscoelastic properties produced by 2 D (stiffness) and 3 D (elasticity and ‘Gabs,Elastic’) MRE are comparable. Materials and methodsSeven patients with diffuse or suspect diffuse liver disease were examined in the same day with the two MRE methods. 2 D MRE was performed using an acoustic <b>passive</b> <b>transducer,</b> with a 1. 5 T GE 450 W MR system. 3 D MRE was performed using an electromagnetic active transducer, with a 1. 5 T Philips Achieva MR system. Finally, mean viscoelastic values were extracted from the same anatomical region for both methods by an experienced radiologist. ResultsStiffness correlated well with the elasticity, R 2 = 0. 96 (P< 0. 001; slope= 1. 08, intercept= 0. 61 kPa), as well as with ‘Gabs,Elastic’ R 2 = 0. 96 (P< 0. 001; slope= 0. 95, intercept= 0. 28 kPa). ConclusionThis pilot study shows that different MRE methods can produce comparable measurements of the viscoelastic properties of the liver. The existence of such comparable measurements is important, both from a clinical as well as a research perspective, since it allows for equipment-independent {{monitoring of}} disease progression...|$|E

To save power, the power consuming phase-locked-loop (PLL) is replaced by an energy efficient digital automatic frequency control (AFC) loop. The AFC acts as a low-bandwidth frequency-locked-loop (FLL), using the FSK demodulator as frequency detector; the measured frequency offset is fed back to the on-chip digitally controlled oscillator. To further decrease the power consumption, the LNA is removed, the passive mixer being the first circuit in the receiver front-end. The mixer-first topology increases the linearity compared to injection-locked and envelope detector based receivers.
