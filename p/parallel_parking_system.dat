40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) In recent years, {{there have}} been a lot of {{technology}} innovations to automate the day to day processes done by every person. These days the automobile manufacturers introduce new features in their cars, in order to improve customer experience, like Adaptive cruise control, Parallel park assist, etc. The objective of this thesis is to model an automated <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> and to simulate the system behavior, by taking into account the high level events which happen when a car is parallel parked. The tool used in this thesis to model and simulate the system is Hybrid Petri net (HPN), which is versatile to model the real life systems. Chapter 1 deals with a brief introduction of the related work in Hybrid Petri net modeling of real life systems, automatic parallel parking systems and how the concept for modeling the <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> was developed. Chapter 2 deals with the general introduction about Discrete, Continuous and Hybrid Petri nets and their dynamics which are essential for understanding this thesis. Chapter 3 deals with the development of the model and the various stages in the model development. Errors encountered in each stage is briefly discussed and the improvements are discussed in the next stage of development. This chapter concludes with the final integrated model and operation of the model. Chapter 4 deals with the discussion of results obtained when the model is tested in MATLAB and SIMHPN (which is a Matlab embedded simulation program). The results are compared, the system behavior is observed and the purpose of the thesis is justified. In Chapter 5, a conclusion is provided to summarize the entire thesis...|$|E
40|$|Design of an in-car user {{interface}} requires knowledge {{from the field}} of Human Factors as well as from usability theory. In this project, a {{user interface}} for an automatic <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> has been developed. The main research question has been which display modality to choose, as current literature does not give a clear-cut answer to whether to use auditory or visual displays for in-car information systems. We also wanted to investigate how much information is needed in order to complete an automatic parallel parking. Results from three user evaluations with different prototypes indicate that audiovisual presentation is best suited for the task, and that feedback messages could be kept short. However, further research is needed since a real-life traffic situation differs from that in a sealed-off environment as the one used in this project. ...|$|E

5000|$|Newer {{versions}} of the system allow <b>parallel</b> or reverse <b>parking.</b> [...] When <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> with the <b>system,</b> drivers first pull up alongside the parking space. They move forward until the vehicle's rear bumper passes the rear wheel of the car {{parked in front of}} the open space. Then, shifting to reverse automatically activates the backup camera system, and the car's rear view appears on dash navigation/camera display. The driver's selection of the <b>parallel</b> <b>park</b> guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen causes a grid to appear (with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing the corner of the parking spot, and adjustment arrows).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a simulation system proposed {{in order to}} study and to implement intelligent autonomous vehicle control. The developed system can automatically drive a vehicle, implementing a robust control system capable of simulating in a realistic way autonomous <b>parking</b> in a <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> space. The <b>system</b> controls the vehicles based on the reading of sonar sensors and automatically generates acceleration and steering commands, parking it in a <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> space. The controller was implemented using a rule-based finite state automaton, and the results obtained in our simulations demonstrated that the proposed controller is perfectly able to correctly park the vehicle in different situations...|$|R
40|$|Collisions {{can happen}} during {{reversing}} or parking the car {{especially in the}} limited space. Since many drivers acknowledge that parallel parking is a very tedious task. This research aims to develop the <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> by developing small mobile vehicle as a model. Design of prototype vehicle is considered for the real-life parallel parking. Hence, it can detect a parking space, execute the parking maneuver, avoid hitting the front, rear obstacles and reduce the time for parking. The parking maneuver is simplified by choosing the optimum turning angle for both {{the first and second}} parts of the parking maneuvers. At the first stage, ultrasonic sensors sense the parking environment and if the space is sufficient, a safe parking maneuver is generated. In second stage, positioning phase, the mobile vehicle will execute reverse motion into the parking space without any collisions. The last stage, it moves to the correct parking position in the parking space while adjusting itself to a safe distance from front and rear obstacles respectively. It is discovered from the result that developed system required just 1. 33 times longer parking space than vehicle overall length. Small mobile vehicles successfully able to manage the parallel park itself without hitting or touching front and rear obstacles...|$|E
40|$|Soft {{computing}} {{techniques are}} generally well-suited for vehicular control {{systems that are}} usually modeled by highly nonlinear differential equations and working in unstructured environment. To demonstrate their applicability, two intelligent controllers based upon fuzzy logic theories and neural network paradigms are designed for performing a wall-following task and an autonomous parking task. Based on performance and flexibility considerations, the two controllers are implemented onto a reconfigurable hardware platform, namely a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). As the number of comparative studies of these two embedded controllers designed for the same application is limited in the literature, {{one of the main}} goals of this research work has been to evaluate and compare the two controllers in terms of hardware resource requirements, operational speeds and trajectory tracking errors in following different pre-defined trajectories. The main advantages and disadvantages of each of the controllers are presented and discussed in details. Challenging issues for implementation of the controllers on the FPGA platform are also highlighted. As the two controllers exhibit benefits and drawbacks under different circumstances, this research suggests as well a hybrid controller scheme as an attempt to integrate the benefits of both control units. To evaluate its performance, the hybrid controller is tested on the same pre-defined trajectories and the corresponding results are compared to that of the fuzzy logic and the neural network based controllers. For further demonstration of the capabilities of the wall-following controllers in other applications, the fuzzy logic and the neural network controllers are used in a <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> <b>system.</b> We see this work to be a stepping stone for further research work aiming at real world implementation of the controllers on Application Specified Integrated Circuit (ASIC) type of environment...|$|E

50|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>parking</b> is {{a method}} of <b>parking</b> a vehicle <b>parallel</b> to the road (hence the term 'Parallel Parking'), in line with other <b>parked</b> vehicles. <b>Parallel</b> <b>parking</b> usually {{requires}} initially driving slightly past the <b>parking</b> space, <b>parallel</b> to the <b>parked</b> vehicle {{in front of that}} space, keeping a safe distance, then followed by reversing into that space. Subsequent position adjustment may require the use of forward and reverse gears.|$|R

Also, the optional Intelligent <b>Parking</b> Assist <b>system</b> supports steering operations when <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> and backing into a parking space. Ultrasonic sensors installed on the front of the vehicle detect other parked vehicles and, based on the results, estimate the physical dimensions of a vacant parking space and set the target parking position.|$|R

Driving forward into a parking space on the side of a road is typically not possible unless two successive parking spaces are empty. Reversing into the spot via the <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> technique allows one to take advantage of a single empty space not much longer than the car (in order to complete the parking within three wheel-turns the parking space would generally need to be about one and a half car-length long).|$|R

40|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>parking,</b> in general, is a {{moderate}} difficulty maneuver. Moreover, for inexperienced drivers, {{it can be}} a stressful situation that can lead to errors such as stay far from the sidewalk or damage another vehicle resulting in traffic tickets that range from simple parking violation to crash-related violations. In this work, we propose a computationally effective approach to perform a collisionfree <b>parallel</b> <b>parking.</b> The method will calculate the minimum parking space needed and then the efficient path for the <b>parallel</b> <b>parking.</b> This method is computationally inexpensive in comparison with {{the current state of the}} art. Moreover, it could be used by any car because the parameters needed to perform all computations are taken from the specifications of real cars. Preliminary results of this work were summarized in [1] that was presented at the 15 th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems. The simulation and experimental data show the effectiveness of the method. This effectiveness is specified when the path followed by the driver and the path calculated with the method are compared. The image capture of the vehicle is used to get the path made by the driver for the <b>parallel</b> <b>parking.</b> Furthermore, road surface marks were determined (in a parking lot) as a visual aid for the drivers in order to perform the <b>parallel</b> <b>parking</b> maneuver.
