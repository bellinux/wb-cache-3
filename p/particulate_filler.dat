40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} the fracture strength of direct anterior cantilever fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) fixed partial dentures (FPD) reinforced with 3 types of E-glass fibers preimpregnated with either urethane tetramethacrylate, bisphenol glycidylmethacrylate/polymethyl methacrylate, or bisphenol glycidylmethacrylate monomers and 1 ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fiber. Failure types were also evaluated. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 caries-free, human maxillary central incisors (n = 10 per group) received surface-retained direct cantilever restoration (1 pontic) after etching {{and application of}} bonding agent. Four FRC materials were used (FRC 1 = EverStick; FRC 2 = BR- 100; FRC 3 = Interling; FRC 4 Ribbond), and pontics were built up using 1 <b>particulate</b> <b>filler</b> composite (Clearfil Photo Posterior). After the fracture test, failure types were analyzed. Results: No {{significant difference was found}} between the 4 FRC types veneered with <b>particulate</b> <b>filler</b> composite (893 +/- 459 N to 1326 +/- 391 N) (P =. 1278). Complete pontic fracture at the connector area was most prominent for FRC 4 (90 %), followed by FRC 3 (70 %). Only FRC 2 (10 %) showed some fiber fractures, with half of the fiber remaining attached on the enamel surface of the abutment. Conclusion: The fracture strengths of cantilever FPDs made of 4 FRC materials with different monomer matrices and architectures, veneered with <b>particulate</b> <b>filler</b> composite, did not show significant differences.

The barium micro-filler and the short glass fibers were treated with -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane in cyclohexane using n-propylamine.

Surface treatment of the filler was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Fracture surfaces and the adhesion to the matrix was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The modulus of elasticity and strenght was determined by three point bending flexural test.

In order {{to overcome these}} obvious limitations and to expand their applications in different fields, <b>particulate</b> <b>fillers,</b> such as carbon black, silica, glass, calcium carbonates, carbon nanotubes, nano clays etc. are often added to polymer. <b>Particulate</b> <b>fillers</b> modify physical and mechanical properties of polymers in many ways. Use of carbon black for improving reinforcement properties of an elastomer has been studied extensively in numerous investigations [1, 2]. Amongst the nonblack fillers, mostly silica provides the best reinforcing properties [3].

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Plastics, Rubber and Composites [© Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining] and is also available at: [URL] composites, filled with ultra fine <b>particulate</b> <b>fillers,</b> are alternatives to the conventional filled polymers. The reinforcement of the mechanical properties occurs to a greater extent when ultra fine <b>particulate</b> <b>fillers</b> are used in comparison with the conventional microdimensional fillers. To achieve all the benefits that the ultra fine fillers can provide, optimal dispersion as primary particles is essential. To achieve better dispersion of the inorganic particles in a polymer matrix, the ultra fine particles (UFP) are added to the polymerisation reactor so that they are dispersed in the monomer before polymerisation. Hence, the monomer is polymerised {{in the presence of the}} UFP (in situ). In this paper the effects of the UFP on the initial monomer dispersion are examined. The presence of the inorganic UFP in the polymerisation reactor influences the properties of the monomer phase and affects the drop size distribution.

In this study, a series of bamboo fiber reinforced epoxy composites are fabricated using conventional filler (aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) and silicon carbide (SiC) and industrial wastes (red mud and copper slag) particles as filler materials. By incorporating the chosen <b>particulate</b> <b>fillers</b> into the bamboo-fiber reinforced epoxy, synergistic effects, as expected are achieved in the form of modified mechanical properties. Inclusion of fiber in neat epoxy improved the load bearing capacity (tensile strength) and the ability to withstand bending (flexural strength) of the composites.

Among the particulate filled bamboo-epoxy composites, least value of void content are recorded for composites with silicon carbide filling and for the composites with glass fiber reinforcement minimum void fraction is noted for red mud filling.

Methods: Seven groups of zirconia each consisting of 14 specimens (n= 14) were made.

40|$|Elution of {{antibiotics}} from antibiotic-loaded polymethylmethacrylate (AL-PMMA) increases when soluble <b>particulate</b> <b>filler</b> {{is added to}} increase the permeability of the PMMA. Antibiotic powder is in itself soluble <b>particulate</b> <b>filler.</b> For greater volume fractions of filler, greater elution occurs. The volume of generic tobramycin powder is more than 3. 5  times the volume of proprietary tobramycin powder for a 1. 2  g dose leading to the question: Does generic tobramycin elute from AL-PMMA faster than proprietary tobramycin? We performed elution studies on AL-PMMA beads made with 1. 2  g of either generic tobramycin or proprietary tobramycin per batch of PMMA. Generic tobramycin eluted more than two times faster than proprietary tobramycin. The release mechanism started as dissolution-driven zero-order release for the generic bead set but for the proprietary bead set the released mechanism started as anomalous diffusion. The release mechanism progressed to diffusion-driven first-order release in both. The increased volume of the generic tobramycin caused more tobramycin to be available for release. The increased elution of tobramycin associated with the greater volume of generic tobramycin powder could lead to clinically higher levels of tobramycin in wound fluid and local tissues; however, the higher volume of powder could potentially cause greater mechanical compromise of the PMMA...|$|E
