40|$|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glycoproteins in {{the brain}} central to {{learning}} and memory. The effects of glycosylation on the structure and dynamics of NMDARs are largely unknown. In this work, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations of GluN 1 and GluN 2 B ligand binding domains (LBDs) of NMDARs to investigate these effects. Our simulations predict that intra-domain interactions involving the glycan attached to residue GluN 1 -N 440 stabilize closed-clamshell conformations of the GluN 1 LBD. The glycan on GluN 2 B-N 688 shows a similar, though weaker, effect. Based on these results, and assuming the transferability {{of the results of}} LBD simulations to the full receptor, we predict that glycans at GluN 1 -N 440 might play a potentiator role in NMDARs. To validate this prediction, we perform electrophysiological analysis of full-length NMDARs with a glycosylation-preventing GluN 1 -N 440 Q mutation, and demonstrate an increase in the glycine EC 50 value. Overall, our results suggest an intramolecular <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> glycans on NMDA receptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and biological properties of solubilized envelope proteins of Bordetella pertussis have been examined. Several envelope proteins {{were found to}} be specific for phase I strains of B. pertussis and could be isolated by selective detergent extraction. These proteins had molecular weights of 90, 000, 86, 000, 81, 000, 33, 000, 31, 000, and 30, 000 and were reduced or absent in envelope preparations from Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella parapertussis, or phase IV strains of B. pertussis. When the envelope preparations from phase I B. pertussis were assayed in the mouse intracerebral protection test they {{were found to be}} highly protective, and there was a strong correlation between the protective potency and the lymphocytosis-promoting factor (LPF) content of different preparations. Treatment with glutaraldehyde reduced the LPF activity, toxicity, and protective potency of the envelope extracts. Similarly affinity chromatography of envelope proteins on columns of haptoglobin coupled to Sepharose 4 B reduced both the LPF content and the protective potency. The addition of a small amount of purified LPF to the haptoglobin-treated proteins restored the protective potency. The LPF by itself was nonprotective, indicating a <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> LPF in the mouse intracerebral challenge test...|$|E

40|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{research}} have identified disgust propensity and obsessive beliefs {{to be important}} affective and cognitive processes in contamination symptoms. In non-clinical samples, a previous study integrated these lines of research and found that disgust propensity more strongly predicted two different measures of contamination fears when obsessive beliefs – particularly overestimation of threat – were higher, suggesting that cognitive factors <b>potentiate</b> the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> disgust propensity in contamination fear. The present study aimed to replicate these findings {{in a sample of}} 103 patients with OCD. Unexpectedly, while disgust propensity was related to two self-report measures of contamination fears, obsessive beliefs were not. Moderation analyses failed to reveal an interaction between disgust propensity and obsessive beliefs in predicting contamination fear. It is suggested that disgust propensity is more relevant to clinical contamination fears than are obsessive beliefs – either directly or as a moderating factor.

40|$|AbstractImpaired {{functioning}} of the proteasome pathway {{is one of the}} molecular mechanism underlying neurodegenerative changes in Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, we report that dysfunction of the proteasome pathway in astroglial cells leads to decreased survival and dysregulation of chemokines by differential regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. We further demonstrated that proteasome inhibition augmented interleukin- 1 β- and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced activation of the IκBα kinase and MKK 4 /JNK/c-Jun pathway along with TAK 1 activation.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} recombinant C 5 a on interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) production by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) in vitro and compared them with the release of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In a virtually lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -free culture system, C 5 a by itself did not induce any significant IL- 6 translation. The IL- 6 release in response to low amounts of LPS (500 pg/ml) or IL- 1 beta, however, was markedly increased by the complement fragment. This enhancement of IL- 6 synthesis was dose-dependent, reached its optimum at 5. 8 x 10 (- 9) M rC 5 a and occurred regardless of the presence of serum components. At the level of transcription C 5 a by itself did not induce IL- 6 gene expression, but in the presence of low amounts of LPS the stimulation of monocytes with C 5 a yielded an increase in IL- 6 mRNA. The transcription of IL- 1 beta, however, can be induced by C 5 a alone. These data are interesting, since they indicate a different regulation of IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 by the complement fragment C 5 a. Furthermore, we could show that the C 5 a-mediated IL- 6 production influenced the synthesis of IgG rather than IgM in vitro. These results may be relevant for an understanding of the <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> C 5 a in cytokine-dependent disease processes...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Substance use {{disorder}} (SUD) and {{post-traumatic stress}} disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur. This is of significant concern, given the increased risk for violence perpetration among individuals with this comorbidity. Limited research, however, has examined relationships between SUD, PTSD and violence among individuals longitudinally. Such an investigation is warranted given that substance use and PTSD symptoms can fluctuate over time. This study therefore aims to examine how changes in substance use and PTSD symptom severity {{are associated with the}} perpetration of violent crime over time among individuals with comorbid SUD and PTSD. Method: One-hundred and two men and women who met criteria for SUD and PTSD were interviewed four times over a 9 -month period. These interviews included measures of past-month violent crime perpetration, substance use and dependence, PTSD symptom severity, and depression and state anxiety symptoms. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) modelled associations between substance use, PTSD and violence. Results: Increased substance use, more severe substance dependence and more severe PTSD symptomology were consistently associated with violent crime over time. Multivariate GEE analyses, however, revealed that the PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, specifically, were independently associated with violence over time. Conclusions: This longitudinal study found that PTSD hyperarousal symptoms were consistently associated with the perpetration of violent crime, further highlighting the <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> PTSD hyperarousal in relation to violence among individuals with SUD. These findings indicate that interventions addressing hyperarousal symptoms have the potential to reduce the susceptibility for violence among individuals with this common comorbidity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Huntington's disease (HD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder {{caused by a}} polyglutamine-encoding CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene. Iron accumulates in the brains of HD patients and mouse disease models. However, the cellular and subcellular sites of iron accumulation, as well as significance to disease progression are not well understood. We used independent approaches to investigate the location of brain iron accumulation. In R 6 / 2 HD mouse brain, synchotron x-ray fluorescence analysis revealed iron accumulation as discrete puncta in the perinuclear cytoplasm of striatal neurons. Further, perfusion Turnbull's staining for ferrous iron (II) combined with transmission electron microscope ultra-structural analysis revealed increased staining in membrane bound peri-nuclear vesicles in R 6 / 2 HD striatal neurons. Analysis of iron homeostatic proteins in R 6 / 2 HD mice revealed decreased levels of the iron response proteins (IRPs 1 and 2) and accordingly decreased expression of iron uptake transferrin receptor (TfR) and increased levels of neuronal iron export protein ferroportin (FPN). Finally, we show that intra-ventricular delivery of the iron chelator deferoxamine results in an improvement of the motor phenotype in R 6 / 2 HD mice. Our data supports accumulation of redox-active ferrous iron in the endocytic / lysosomal compartment in mouse HD neurons. Expression changes of IRPs, TfR and FPN are consistent with a compensatory response to an increased intra-neuronal labile iron pool leading to increased susceptibility to iron-associated oxidative stress. These findings, together with protection by deferoxamine, support a <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> neuronal iron accumulation in HD. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{molecular}} foundation of nitric oxide induced relaxation of arteries, {{with or without}} endothelium, of normotensive and spontanously hypertensive rats was re-examined. With this purpose in mind, {{the effects of the}} nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (NaNP), with and without manganese containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD E. C. 1. 15. 1. 1.), on rat renal artery relaxation was strudied. The results show that the relaxation effect of NaNP is two times higher in normotensive, compared to spontaneously hypertensive rats. Similar differences exist in the relaxation effects of NaNP on isolated renal arteries without endothelium, indicating that besides the difference in the function of an endothelium, concerning basal NO production in normotensive and hypertensive rats, there is a difference with respect to NO relaxation in the smooth muscle that is induced by hypertension. MnSOD decreased the relaxation effect of NaNP in all the examined renal arteries, more in normotensive than in hypertensive ones regardless of the presence of an endothelium. These results show that MnSOD, by modifying the chemical versatility of NO into redox active forms - nitrosonium (NO+) and nitroxyl (NO-), produces different relaxation effects in normotensive and hypertensive arteries of rats, with or without an endothelium, <b>potentiating</b> the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> nitroxyl induced relaxation in sponteneously hypertensive rats. The results prove the need for the synthesis of complex NO donors, as the mechanisms of artery relaxation are different due to an endothel and smooth mouscle changes in hypertensive, as compared to normotensive rats...|$|R
40|$|The light–organ {{symbiosis}} {{between the}} squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri offers {{the opportunity to}} decipher the hour-by-hour events that occur during the natural colonization of an animal's epithelial surface by its microbial partners. To determine the genetic basis of these events, a glass-slide microarray was used to characterize the light-organ transcriptome of juvenile squid {{in response to the}} initiation of symbiosis. Patterns of gene expression were compared between animals not exposed to the symbiont, exposed to the wild-type symbiont, or exposed to a mutant symbiont defective in either of two key characters of this association: bacterial luminescence or autoinducer (AI) production. Hundreds of genes were differentially regulated as a result of symbiosis initiation, and a hierarchy existed in the magnitude of the host's response to three symbiont features: bacterial presence > luminescence > AI production. Putative host receptors for bacterial surface molecules known to induce squid development are up-regulated by symbiont light production, suggesting that bioluminescence {{plays a key role in}} preparing the host for bacteria-induced development. Further, because the transcriptional response of tissues exposed to AI in the natural context (i. e., with the symbionts) differed from that to AI alone, the presence of the bacteria <b>potentiates</b> the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> quorum signals in symbiosis. Comparison of these microarray data with those from other symbioses, such as germ-free/conventionalized mice and zebrafish, revealed a set of shared genes that may represent a core set of ancient host responses conserved throughout animal evolution...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect(s) of the Green tea extract, as a widely consumed beverage on {{the interaction}} of lipopolysaccharide activated MSCs on neutrophils. Methods: In the present experimental study, after the isolation of mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow of rats was conducted, these cells were stimulated with 10 ng/mL LPS for 1. Then, the supernatant was discarded and washed out to remove LPS cells.   Afterwards, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of green tea (10, 100 and 500 micrograms per ml) for 24 hours. Subsequently, the mesenchymal stem cells were co-cultured with neutrophils and incubated for other 4 h. Finally, the neutrophil function was evaluated. The data were analyzed by Kruskal wallis test. P values less than 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Pro-inflammatory mesenchymal stem cells (Challenged with LPS) caused a decrease in vitality, Neutral Red-uptake and respiratory burst of activated neutrophils. Treatment of pro-inflammatory mesenchymal stem cells with higher concentration of green tea extract potentiated the decrease rate of Neutral Red-uptake and respiratory burst of activated neutrophils. Moreover, the vitality of neutrophils increased in a dose-independent manner by green tea extract.   Conclusion:It seemed that the treatment of mesenchymal stem cells in inflammatory condition with Green tea extract may <b>potentiate</b> the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> mesenchymal stem cells to increase phagocytosis and the respiratory burst of neutrophils cells.  ...|$|R

[3 H]Thymidine-labelled bacteria in stationary phase were incubated {{on the test}} surfaces for 20 min under static or flow (200 =s) conditions. The results showed: (a) increased adherence of the RNAIII mutant to fibrinogen under static conditions, and decreased adherence of the mutant to fibronectin and EC under both static and flow conditions compared with the parental strain; (b) stronger ability of the mutant compared with the parental strain to induce platelet aggregation in suspension; (c) greater adherence of the parental strain and the mutant to EC pre-treated with platelet-rich plasma compared with platelet-poor plasma, and to EC pre-treated with platelet-poor plasma compared with control; (d) increased adherence of S. aureus to EC pre-treated with PMA-activated platelets and decreased adherence to EC pre-treated with tirofiban, a platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitor, which paralleled with increased adherence of PMA-activated platelets and decreased adherence of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa-blocked platelets to EC {{in the absence of}} bacteria; and (e) adherence of the mutant was more sensitive to pre-treatment of EC with plasma and PMA-activated platelets. In conclusion, RNAIII down-regulates S. aureus adherence to fibrinogen under static condition and up-regulates S. aureus adherence to fibronectin and EC under both static and flow conditions. The <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> activated platelets in the presence of plasma in S. aureus adherence to EC is down-regulated by RNAIII, probably due to down-regulation of adherence to fibrinogen, the important plasma protein bridging S. aureus, platelets and EC...|$|E

Employing the above-mentioned culture designs, the monocyte function was studied in aged subjects and in patients with cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The results obtained were as follows. 1) T cell blastogenesis to PHA was enhanced {{in proportion to the}} increase of monocyte counts added, and was more remarkably noticed in the PHA concentration of 3 μg/ml than in that of 15 μg/ml, a conventional dose. 2) There was on difference in the mitogenic response of T cells between autologous and allogeneic co-culture systems. 3) The monocytes from aged subjects were as equally effective as monocytes from young controls in potentiating the blastogenesis of T cells from young controls, but were significantly less effective in the blastogenesis of T cells from aged subjects. 4) In patients with cancer, SLE and RA, a significant decrease was noted in the potentiating effect of monocytes upon the mitogenic responses of T cells from both the patients and healthy controls. 5) It was demonstrated that the culture supernatant of monocytes stimulated by Con A-Sepharose exerted a potentiating effect on PHA-induced T cell blastogenesis. This effect was found to be lower in monocytes of cancer patients than in those of healthy controls. From these results, the decrease of monocyte function in terms of potentiating the T cell blastogenesis was noted among these diseased states. It was also assumed that there was a slight difference in the potentiating manner of monocytes in these disorders...|$|E
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for the <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> corticosterone on axonal degeneration of serotonergic neurones during ageing. Aged rats, 24 months old, were implanted subcutaneously with 2 × 100 mg pellets of corticosterone. Serotonergic and cholinergic (ChAT- and NADPHd-positive) fibre degenerations in the anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AVT) were measured 2 months after corticosterone implantation. Numbers of immunoreactive serotonergic raphe and mesolimbic cholinergic neurones were also quantified. Basal plasma corticosterone and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) concentrations were assayed at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after implantation in the plasma and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks in urine. The degree of serotonergic fibre aberrations in the AVT increased significantly after corticosterone exposure, while that of ChAT-positive and NADPHd-stained axon aberrations showed a modest but nonsignificant increase. A {{positive correlation between}} the magnitudes of serotonergic and cholinergic fibre aberrations appeared in the AVT, {{but only in the}} corticosterone-treated rats. The number of serotonin immunopositive neurones in the raphe nuclei after corticosterone decreased marginally, while that of mesopontine ChAT-positive neurones was not influenced. Measurements of basal plasma corticosterone and ACTH, as well as urine corticosterone, revealed that the steroid implantation increased the plasma corticosterone level for at least 4 weeks and decreased ACTH level for at least 6 weeks. By the week 8, the pituitary-adrenal function was apparently restored. However, at sacrifice, both the weight of adrenal glands and that of thymus remained reduced, indicating the long-lasting effects of corticosterone on target tissues. It is concluded that the raphe serotonergic neurones and their projecting fibres are sensitive to corticosterone excess in aged rats and become more vulnerable to degeneration processes than under normal ageing conditions. Cholinergic neurones of brainstem origin, which also express massive NADPHd activity, are more resistant against corticosterone, but their axon degeneration correlates to serotonergic fibre degeneration. ...|$|E
40|$|MicroRNA (miR) - 125 b {{expression}} is modulated in macrophages {{in response to}} stimulatory cues. In this study, we report a functional <b>role</b> <b>of</b> miR- 125 b in macrophages. We found that miR- 125 b is enriched in macrophages compared with lymphoid cells and whole immune tissues. Enforced expression of miR- 125 b drives macrophages to adapt an activated morphology that is accompanied by increased costimulatory factor expression and elevated responsiveness to IFN-y, whereas anti–miR- 125 b treatment decreases CD 80 surface expression. To determine whether these alterations in cell signaling, gene expression, and morphology have functional consequences, we examined the ability of macrophages with enhanced miR- 125 b expression to present Ags and found that they better stimulate T cell activation than control macrophages. Further indicating increased function, these macrophages were more effective at killing EL 4 tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, miR- 125 b repressed IFN regulatory factor 4 (IRF 4), and IRF 4 knockdown in macrophages mimicked the miR- 125 b overexpression phenotype. In summary, our evidence suggests that miR- 125 b is at least partly responsible for generating the activated nature of macrophages, at least partially by reducing IRF 4 levels, and <b>potentiates</b> the functional <b>role</b> <b>of</b> macrophages in inducing immune responses...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} {{mechanisms}} underlying bone remodeling {{is crucial to}} the development of novel therapeutics. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) localised to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone are thought to {{play a key role in}} mediating aspects of bone development. The influence of isolated GAGs was studied by utilising in vitro murine calvarial monolayer and organ culture model systems. Addition of GAG preparations extracted from the cell surface of human osteoblasts at high concentrations (5 microg/ml) resulted in decreased proliferation of cells and decreased suture width and number of bone lining cells in calvarial sections. When we investigated potential interactions between the growth factors fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF 2), bone morphogenic protein- 2 (BMP 2) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFbeta 1) and the isolated cell surface GAGs, differences between the two model systems emerged. The cell culture system demonstrated a <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> for the isolated GAGs in the inhibition of FGF 2 and TGFbeta 1 actions. In contrast, the organ culture system demonstrated an enhanced stimulation of TFGbeta 1 effects. These results emphasise the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the ECM in mediating the interactions between GAGs and growth factors during bone development and suggest the GAG preparations contain potent inhibitory or stimulatory components able to mediate growth factor activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out whether acute massive {{pulmonary}} embolism can produce myocardial changes visible by light and electron microscopy. Ww therefore produced pulmonary embolism in rats using plastic microspheres (diameter, 15 +/- 5 mu). Two experimental protocols were used: lethal embolism, with a dose of microspheres known to kill in 3 to 15 hours (these rats were killed after 1 hour), and sublethal embolism, with a dose compatible with 100 % survival (these rats were killed after 24 hours). In both groups, the left ventricle was normal. The right ventricle showed two tyes of changes: a) A distinctive lesion of the myocytes, more diffuse after lethal enbolism and different from the "zonal lesion" of shock. It consisted primarily in a localized shredding of the myofibrillar system; hence, the name shredding is proposed. Earlier stages of this lesion were represented by focal dissolution of the Z line (Z lysis). The pathogenesis of these lesions appeared to be primarily mechanical. b) Necrosis was already apparent at 1 hour and was more extensive after 24 hours. The pathogensis of the necrotic lesions is best explained by a temporary ischemia followed by delayed reflow; a possible <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> endogenous catecholamines cannot be excluded. Most capilaries in the necrotic foci remained functional; this explains the rapid rate of the healing process of such lesions. A comparison is drawn between the observed foci of necrosis and the human myocardial lesions knowns as "miliary infarcts" and "myocytolysis. " It is proposed that a factor common to all three is the preservation of the microcirculatory vessels and that our experimental model helps illuminate the pathogenesis of the human lesions. It is concluded that the right ventricle of acute cor pulmonale may develop cellular changes with a complex pathologenesis (mechanical, ischemic, and possibly hormonal). The nature of the changes found in our model could represent the morphologic substrate of right-sided failure; it can be correlated with the electrocardiographic abnormalities found in the comparable human condition...|$|E
40|$|MicroRNAs play central {{roles in}} animal {{development}} by binding 3 ’ untranslated regions of target mRNAs and inducing translational repression and/or degradation. Despite rapid advances in understanding microRNA biogenesis and function, less {{is known about}} how {{the activity of the}} microRNA effector complex, miRISC, is modulated. Specifically, post-translational modifications to miRISC and miRISC interactions with RNA binding proteins require further elucidation. This dissertation describes the <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the conserved serine/threonine kinase CK 2 and the antagonizing function of the RNA binding protein CEY- 1 on microRNA-mediated gene silencing in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We identified casein kinase II (CK 2) in a genome-wide screen to identify factors that regulate small RNA-mediated silencing pathways. Further genetic characterization revealed that CK 2 promotes microRNA function in diverse cellular contexts. While CK 2 is dispensable for microRNA biogenesis and stability of miRISC factors, it is required for efficient target binding and silencing. Importantly, we identified the conserved DEAD-box helicase, CGH- 1 /DDX 6, as a CK 2 substrate within miRISC and demonstrate that CK 2 -mediated phosphorylation of a conserved serine residue in CGH- 1 is required for its function in the microRNA pathway. C. elegans Y-box protein- 1 (CEY- 1) is part of an ancient family of nucleic acid binding proteins that regulates mRNA stability and translation. We discovered loss of cey- 1 potently suppressed lethal defects of a let- 7 microRNA mutant. Furthermore, cey- 1 mutation attenuates the increased expression of the let- 7 target, lin- 41 mRNA, but does not alter let- 7 levels, indicating CEY- 1 antagonizes let- 7 miRISC target silencing but not let- 7 biogenesis. Consistently, CEY- 1 binding sites were identified in the 3 ’UTRs of let- 7 targets, including lin- 41, by high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Taken together, our data support a model where CEY- 1 antagonizes let- 7 pathway by direct binding of common mRNA substrates and positively regulating the stability and/or translation of let- 7 targets. Dysregulation of microRNA activity is a hallmark of several common human diseases. Since CK 2 and CEY- 1 are both conserved in human, understanding their regulation of miRISC will better inform our understanding of human diseases and potentially aid in the development of microRNA-based therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|The {{endogenous}} cannabinoid {{system is}} a new signaling system composed by the central (CB 1) and the peripheral (CB 2) receptors, and several lipid transmitters including anandamide and 2 -arachidonylglycerol. This system is the target of natural cannabinoids, the psychoactive constituents of Cannabis sativa preparations (marijuana, hashish). Acute and chronic cannabis exposure {{has been associated with}} subjective feelings of pleasure and relaxation, but also to the onset of psychiatric syndromes, a decrease of the efficacy of neuroleptics and alterations in the extrapyramidal system regulation of motor activity. These actions points to a tight association of the cannabinoid system with the brain dopaminergic circuits involved in addiction, the clinical manifestation of positive symptoms of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. The present work discuss anatomical, biochemical and pharmacological evidences supporting a role for the endogenous cannabinoid system in the modulation of dopaminergic transmission. Cannabinoid CB 1 receptors are present in dopamine projecting brain areas. In primates and certain rat strains it is also located in dopamine cells of the A 8, A 9 and A 10 mesencephalic cell groups, as well as in hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons controlling prolactin secretion. CB 1 receptors co-localize with dopamine D 1 /D 2 receptors in dopamine projecting fields. Manipulation of dopaminergic transmission is able of altere the synthesis and release of anandamide as well as the expression of CB 1 receptors. Additionally, CB 1 receptors can switch its transduction mechanism to oppose to the ongoing dopamine signaling. Acute blockade of CB 1 receptor <b>potentiates</b> the facilitatory <b>role</b> <b>of</b> dopamine D 2 receptor agonists on movement. CB 1 stimulation results in sensitization to the motor effects of indirect dopaminergic agonists. The dynamics of these changes indicate that the cannabinoid {{system is a}}n activity-dependent modulator of dopaminergic transmission, an hypothesis relevant for the design of new therapeutic strategies for dopamine-related diseases such as the psychosis and Parkinson's disease...|$|R

Persistent infection could be initiated in both newborn and adult mice. For newborns, inoculation with any of several strains of LCMV (Armstrong, E 350, Pasteur, Traub or WE) caused continuous infection, but such infection of adults required a selected lymphotropic variant of LCMV Armstrong (Clone 13). Throughout these animals' lives, viral materials (nucleic acid sequences and proteins) accumulated in multiple tissues, including the beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans; infectious virus was present in blood and tissues, and the LCMV-specific H- 2 restricted CTL response was poor. Adult mice that had been inoculated with virus as newborns displayed neither histopathologic injury nor infiltrates of mononuclear cells in the islets of Langerhans despite moderate viral replication in beta-cells. In contrast, mice inoculated as adults with Clone 13 LCMV consistently developed inflammatory infiltrates in perivascular spaces of the islets of Langerhans, and their beta-cells expressed LCMV antigens. Addition of a subdiabetogenic dose of streptozotocin, a specific beta-cell toxin, magnified the virus-induced abnormality in {{glucose metabolism}}.

Though previous studies of RF in subacute bacterial endocarditis have shown that RF inhibits phagocytosis of microorganisms by granulocytes, the presence of low levels of complement (C) in blood and synovial fluid of patients with the highest titers of RF suggests that an interaction between RF and C may contribute to the inflammatory process in RA. We thus employed a quantitative methodology to examine the effect of RF on complement-dependent phagocytosis of sheep erythrocytes by rabbit granulocytes. Addition of 2500 molecules of IgM RF to sheep cells heavily coated with IgG antibody (195, 000 molecules per cell) resulted in virtually complete inhibition of uptake of C 3 (β 1 c) and prevention of phagocytosis, an effect resulting from inhibition of uptake of C 1 by the cells. When erythrocytes coated with only 34, 000 molecules of IgG antibody were employed, phagocytosis was similarly inhibited. However the effect of RF on such cells was shown to be primarily mediated through inhibition of C 4 rather than C 1 uptake. Although the results do not exclude the participation of an IgM RF of higher avidity, present only in the tissues in rheumatoid inflammation, circulating IgM RF probably does not play a <b>potentiating</b> <b>role</b> in rheumatoid inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Dexmedetomidine is α 2 -adrenergic {{agent and}} {{commonly}} used {{in the intensive care}} setting. It is used primarily to sedate critically ill patients in various surgical, endoscopic and radiologic procedures. This medication gained superiority with other sedatives with a distinct advantage of less depression of the respiratory system. Although dexmedetomidine is often administered to septic patients, the vascular effect has not been fully studied in this clinical setting. In this thesis, rats were administered saline or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1, 10 and 20 mg/kg. Aortic rings were obtained after two, 24 and 72 hours exposure and dexmedetomidine-induced contractions were investigated. Rats could not tolerate prolonged exposure to 20 mg/kg LPS and died during the process. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures were reduced after LPS exposure while heart rates were elevated. Body temperatures were elevated after LPS administration (all doses and time), except a reduction at two hours with 1 mg/kg LPS. LPS increased the plasma levels of tissue necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 6 after two hours LPS administration but not at 24 and 72 hours. In aortic rings with functional endothelium from rats with or without LPS exposure, dexmedetomidine had no effect on resting tension. Dexmedetomidine produced concentration-dependent contractions (10 nM to 10 μμM) after incubation with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME or removal of endothelium in rings without and with exposure to LPS for two, 24, 72 hours. LPS administration dose-dependently attenuated dexmedetomidine-induced contractions. In the presence of 1400 W (inducible NOS inhibitor) the contractile response to dexmedetomidine was <b>potentiated</b> suggesting a <b>role</b> <b>of</b> NO produced by iNOS. Treatment with MnTMPyP attenuated dexmedetomidine-induced contractions indicating that the superoxide dismutase mimetic might increase NO availability by reducing superoxide. A significant <b>role</b> <b>of</b> iNOS was further supported by the detection of iNOS expression in aortic rings after LPS exposure at two, 24, and 72 hours when compared to non-LPS exposed group. Use of selective α 2 A and α 2 B receptor antagonists (BRL 44408 and ARC 239 respectively) showed that dexmedetomidine-induced contractions were mediated mostly via α 2 A receptor subtype as the former but not the latter agent significantly reduced contractions. Serotonin (5 -HT, 10 nM to 100 μμM) and phenylephrine (1 nM to 100 μμM) produced concentration-dependent contractions in aortic rings with and without LPS exposure. The maximal responses to 5 -HT and phenylephrine were increased at 10 mg/kg LPS as compared to a reduction in contractions by dexmedetomidine with LPS exposure at 1 and 10 mg/kg supporting alterations in α 2 receptors occurred after LPS administration. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the vascular contractile responses of dexmedetomidine in the absence of endothelium or in the presence of eNOS inhibition were reduced in the presence of LPS at different time points and at different doses in aortic rings while two other receptor mediated vasoconstrictors, 5 -HT and phenylephrine were affected. Our findings suggest that LPS may preferentially reduce the vascular contractile responses of dexmedetomidine and it is essential to exercise caution when the drug is administered to critically ill patients or with endothelial dysfunction. published_or_final_versionPharmacology and PharmacyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
