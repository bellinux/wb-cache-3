50|$|Haig remonstrated in vain with Derby (10 January) {{about the}} {{promotion}} of his ally Lt-Gen Trenchard from command of the RFC (replaced by Maj-Gen John Salmond) to become Chief of Air Staff. On 14 January Haig wrote to his wife, apropos the loss of Trenchard, that Derby was “like the feather <b>pillow,</b> <b>bear(ing)</b> {{the mark of the}} last person who sat on him” and remarking that he was known in London as the “genial Judas”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{refrigerator}} in {{the kitchen}} is always changing, but prominently features fruit magnets and a sticker bearing the logo of video game developer, Rockstar Games. Jimmy's room changes many times throughout the series (especially after {{the departure of the}} Henry character from the show), but at least one piece of WWE merchandise can be spotted in any given scene in the location, most notable the <b>pillow</b> <b>bearing</b> the WWE logo (however, in the last few episodes of season five, the pillow is turned over, hiding the logo). Jimmy's room also features a vintage Indianapolis Speedway poster (dated May 13, 1914), a dartboard, a small basketball hoop and at times featured a [...] "Shonen Jump" [...] poster and posters of bands such as Less Than Jake and Green Day.|$|E
5000|$|In July 1916 Derby {{returned}} to the government when he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for War by H. H. Asquith, and in December 1916 {{he was promoted to}} Secretary of State for War by David Lloyd George. In this position he was a strong supporter of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff Sir William Robertson and of the Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, Field Marshal Haig. Haig privately had little respect for him, writing to his wife (10 January 1918) that Derby was “like the feather <b>pillow,</b> <b>bear(ing)</b> the mark of the last person who sat on him” and remarking that he was known in London as the “genial Judas”. Robertson's biographer writes that during the crisis over Robertson's removal Derby [...] "made himself ridiculous" [...] by asking everyone, including the King, whether or not he should resign, and then in the end not doing so, only to be removed from the War Office a few weeks later.|$|E

50|$|Established in 1961 as Kongo Bearing Company, NTN Kongo Corporation {{manufactures}} {{and develops}} not only radial ball <b>bearings,</b> <b>pillow</b> block <b>bearings,</b> bearing units and clutch release bearings, but also develops and produces bearing production equipment used by NTN Corporation.|$|R

50|$|Initially, the Simplicity Bearing {{was only}} offered in closed, {{imperial}} sizes. PBC quickly developed an open {{version of the}} bearing {{to be used with}} supported shafts. Open and closed <b>Pillow</b> Blocks, Flanged <b>bearings,</b> die set bearings and bushings followed. The company then developed ISO Metric and finally JIS Metric bearings.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{incredible}} growth that Toyo underwent, the organization decentralized by creating subsidiaries to oversee new products. In 1961, Toyo {{set up a}} joint venture with INA Wälzlager Schaeffler called NTN Wälzlager Europa in order to manufacture needle bearings. Toyo utilized design data from INA Wälzlager Schaeffler to make these products. They also established Kongo Bearing Company to manage the creation of <b>pillow</b> block <b>bearings.</b> One year later, Toyo founded Senyo Kosakuki Kenkyujo, a maker of ball bearing equipment. In 1963, Toyo entered into business with Hardy Spicer to produce Birfield-type constant-velocity universal joints. They also pursued business overseas by establishing NTN Bearing Corporation of America. The following year, working with GKN Transmission, the company fabricated constant-velocity joints in their home country and formed NTN Bearing-GKN while also opening a facility in Europe called NTN France. The year after that, Toyo started manufacturing oil-impregnated sintered bearings and pipe fittings. Four years later in 1968, the company set up yet another facility in North America called NTN Bearing Corporation of Canada.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the {{mechanical}} deformation of the hydrostatic center rest, a numerical simulation concerning pressure field of hydrostatic center rest is studied. CFX of ANSYS {{has been used to}} compute three-dimensional pressure field of gap fluid between workpiece and <b>bearing</b> <b>pillow.</b> This research analyzes the influence of rotation speed on the bearing pressure performance according to lubricating theory and computational fluid dynamics, and it has revealed its pressure distribution law of gap oil film. Results indicate that an improved characteristic will be affected by rotation speed easily, and oil cavity pressure increases by gradually with rotation speed enhancing. The reliability of a hydrostatic center rest can be predicted through this method...|$|R
50|$|In the {{traditional}} {{style of a}} babbitt metal bearing, a cast iron pillow block is assembled as a loose fit around the shaft, with the shaft in approximately its final position. The inner face of the cast iron pillow block is often drilled to form a key to locate the bearing metal as it is cast into place. The shaft is coated with soot as a release agent, {{the ends of the}} bearing are packed with clay, and molten metal poured into the cavity around the shaft, initially half filling the <b>pillow</b> block. The <b>bearing</b> is stripped, and the metal trimmed back to the top surface of the pillow block. Hardened babbitt metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife or sharp chisel.|$|R
40|$|Coherent-Margined Volcaniclastic Dikes (CMVDs) are {{described}} {{for the first}} time from Askja (Dyngjufjöll), Iceland. These dikes display continuous, coherent glassy margins 5 cm thick and have a variety of clastic interiors comprising vitric tephra, <b>pillow</b> and pillow-fragment <b>bearing</b> lapilli tuffs. CMVDs are interpreted to form when basaltic dikes interact with subglacial ice-cemented volcaniclastic sediments. Formation requires chilling of dike margins, drainage of the dike interior and flooding of the cavity by meltwater, followed by non-explosive mingling of magma, clastics and water. Evidence for ice-cementation includes minimal interaction with the host (< 3 mm peperite), local pillowed dike margins and the preservation of continuous glassy coherent margins along the edge of a drained dike cavity. CMVDs should be present at other volcanic centers with ice-cemented sediments, including the Martian cryosphere...|$|R

In {{order to}} solve the thermal {{deformation}} of the hydrostatic center frame in the heavy type horizontal lathe, a simulation research concerning temperature field of hydrostatic center frame is described. The Finite Volume Method of CFX {{has been used to}} compute three-dimensional temperature field of gap fluid between workpiece and <b>bearing</b> <b>pillow.</b> This research theoretically analyzes the influence of angular velocity on the bearing temperature performance according to lubricating theory and computational fluid dynamics, and it has revealed its temperature distribution law of gap oil film.
