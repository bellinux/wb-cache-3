In this review, we discuss how malaria changes syncytiotrophoblast function as evidenced from human, animal, and in vitro studies and, further, how dysregulation of syncytiotrophoblast function may impact fetal growth in utero.

We find that non-centrality of the umbilical cord insertion is strongly and significantly correlated with disk thickness (Spearman's rho= 0. 128, p= 0. 002). Deformed shape is strongly and significantly associated with lower overall thickness and higher variability of thickness with beta between - 0. 173 and - 0. 254 (p< 0. 001). Both lower mean thickness and high variability of thickness are strongly correlated with higher beta (reduced placental efficiency) (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 038 respectively).

40|$|Copyright © 2007 IFPA and Elsevier LtdPlacental {{insufficiency}} {{is thought}} to be a key factor in many cases of intrauterine growth restriction which complicates about 6 % of pregnancies in western countries. Understanding the molecular control of <b>placental</b> and fetal <b>growth</b> is essential to identifying diagnostic and therapeutic targets to improve pregnancy success. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I and IGF-II gene ablation or maternal food restriction reduce tissue and circulating IGF abundance in the fetus, placenta and mother and are associated with both <b>placental</b> and fetal <b>growth</b> restriction. Conversely, in vivo treatment of the pregnant guinea pig with IGF-I or IGF-II from early to mid pregnancy increases fetal weight and enhances placental transport near term. IGF-II, and an IGF 2 R specific analogue, enhanced placental structural differentiation, whereas IGF-I altered maternal body composition. These outcomes demonstrate endocrine roles within the mother for both IGFs, as well as autocrine/paracrine effects of IGF-II in enhancing placentation and pregnancy success. Therefore, factors that alter placental expression of IGF-II, or maternal circulating IGF-I or IGF-II in early pregnancy may affect placental exchange function late in gestation when the demands of the fetus escalate. IGF-II within the fetus may also signal its nutrient demands to the placenta to improve its function to suit. Therefore each IGF of endocrine and local origin has important, but distinct, roles in placental development and function. [URL]...|$|R
