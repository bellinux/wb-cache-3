In service these couplings {{are often}} subjected to dynamic loads, and to maintain a secure connection, they are generally preloaded. The combination of preload and external dynamic loads results in a multiaxial stress distribution over the connection, where the coupling’s threads act as stress raisers, initiating fatigue cracks. In this study the fatigue life of the standard API Line Pipe coupling and two modified coupling configurations is determined experimentally. This way {{the influence of the}} coupling’s global geometry on the connection’s fatigue life is studied. Threaded pipe samples with a nominal size of 1 ″ are tested on a four-point bending fatigue test setup to obtain S-N curves. Both modified coupling configurations exhibit a fatigue life improvement.

Pipelines on the seabed tend to be damaged by unexpected artificial and natural interferences caused by fishing nets, anchors, wave oscillations, and other seabed features and seism [3]. Once pipelines are damaged, a series of problems will be produced, which has negative effects on society, economy, and environment [4]. Therefore, how to connect pipelines reliably as well as related equipment in setting up a subsea oil-gas production system and pipeline repair is a big challenge. Because of the restricted operating environment in the deep sea, non-weld connection is the best choice to connect the subsea pipeline.|$|R

A drift-flux model, evaluated for the local conditions in the riser, {{is used as a}} closure law. The developed model predicts the location of the liquid accumulation front in the pipeline and the liquid level in the riser, so it is possible to determine which type of severe slugging occurs in the system. The numerical procedure is convergent for different nodalizations.

40|$|For {{containment}} structures, such as <b>pipelines,</b> <b>risers</b> and tanks, {{the most}} aggressive type of corrosion attack often {{is considered to be}} pitting corrosion since metal perforation can cause leakage of the contents and thus potentially have serious environmental and economic consequences.

The present paper reports on new field studies performed at Jervis Bay over a total of 3. 5 years of exposure for the welded zone of API X 56 Spec 5 L grade pipeline steel. The corrosion patterns are reported as well as the increase in corrosion mass loss and maximum pit depth with time. It is shown that the development of pit depth and mass loss with time is consistent with earlier observations for mild steel under immersion conditions.

40|$|Pipes and tubular {{members are}} used in {{offshore}} applications as structural elements, such as columns or in transport <b>pipelines,</b> <b>risers,</b> etc. When subjected to dynamic loads, weld defects or geometrical stress raisers can initiate fatigue cracks, causing the columns or pipelines to fail prematurely. In order to investigate the fatigue behavior of pipe joints, a resonant bending fatigue setup was designed, suitable for testing pipes within a diameter range from 6 in. to 20 in. In this setup, the pipe, filled with water, is subjected to a dynamic excitation force with a frequency close to the natural frequency of the filled pipe. The force is applied using a unique drive unit with excentric masses. The pipe is supported in the nodes of its natural wave-form, so that no dynamic forces are transmitted to the setup. The deformation of the pipe is measured at discrete locations using an optical 3 D dynamic measuring system. Through-thickness fatigue cracks can be detected by pressurizing {{the water in the}} pipe and applying a pressure gauge. In this paper, some unique aspects of the design of the resonant bending fatigue setup are discussed by presenting the results of a semianalytical model used for calculating the deformation and bending stress in the excitated pipe and by comparing these results to the deformation measurements made by the dynamic measuring system.

40|$|The Oil and Gas (O&G) {{industry}} has recently turned its interest towards deep and ultra-deep offshore installations {{in order to}} address the global increase of energy demand. <b>Pipelines</b> and <b>risers</b> are key components for the production and transportation of oil and gas both in the offshore and onshore environment. The structural integrity and fracture control of pipes, which are major components for the exploration, production and transportation of fossil fuels {{have been the subject of}} extensive analysis in the past decade using classical fracture mechanics approaches, especially for the offshore case. The main driving force for this line of research was the fact that both the cost and the technical challenges increase disproportionally with water depth. In the deep and ultra-deep water environment the technical challenges include higher permanent and operational loads, extreme environmental conditions and the presence of corrosive agents. All the above mentioned parameters demand the use of modern fracture mechanics approaches. At the same time, the inaccessibility to structures located at depths of two to three kilometers, results in extreme repair costs. Due to the magnitude of environmental and financial consequences in the event of failure, the {{industry has}} established extremely conservative safety requirements resulting from outdated approaches for those types of structures. Furthermore, the O&G industry is reluctant to adopt novel fracture models, unlike other industries, such as the automotive and aerospace. <b>Pipelines</b> and <b>risers</b> need to be evaluated both from a structural and a financial perspective. The current thesis is proposing a new physics-inspired technology and computational capability for the prediction of fracture and structural failure of <b>pipelines</b> and <b>risers</b> operating in extreme conditions, such as deep and ultra-deep water environments subjected to extreme conditions and accidental loads. The computational tool employed in the current study is derived from a variational principle, combined with a cumulative measure of damage that is developed to control the fracture initiation. The calibration process of this methodology is achieved through a hybrid numerical experimental procedure. The material selection for this study was chosen naturally from the O&G and pipeline community. Traditionally, the O&G and pipeline industries have been using not only conventional fracture methods, but also conventional low-grades of steels for <b>pipelines</b> and <b>risers,</b> such as X 60 and X 70. However, deep and ultra-deep applications and the demand for increase of daily flow production pose new challenges in terms of harsh environmental conditions, increase of external diameter and higher operational loads. The industry is well aware of the fact that Advance High Strength Steels (AHSS), such as X 100 and X 120, can address those issues, but is not yet ready to introduce them, due to incomplete understanding of their material properties and structural behavior in the plastic and near failure range. Therefore, the current thesis offers a comprehensive study of two representative grades from both categories (X 70 and X 100), comparing their mechanical properties and completing a preliminary analysis quantifying the financial difference between the two for pipeline construction. <b>Pipeline</b> and <b>riser</b> installations are extremely capital intensive. They need to be evaluated both from a structural and a financial perspective, so that operating companies can quantify the integrity of their investments. The proposed thesis will develop a method using representations of oil prices and material costs along with a fracture mechanics model to improve the decision process of the material, the design, and the operating conditions of pipeline installations. This technique will not only attempt to account for the mechanical properties and structural integrity of the tubular component of interest but also to quantify the financial benefit of AHSS in the Oil and Gas community. by Kirki N.

40|$|When waves {{propagate}} {{through a}} medium with small irregularities {{of the size}} of the order of many wavelengths, a number of interesting phenomena may happen such as wave localization and large sensitivity of the wave field behavior with respect to the medium irregularity variation. These phenomena occur due to the interaction of the incident wave field with the medium small irregularities, and open the possibility of designing the system irregularity to achieve a desired vibratory response. This has a variety of engineering applications, such as the the design of the sea bottom of coastal areas to provide protection against the incoming swells, or the design of the material and geometrical properties of the cross section of <b>pipelines,</b> <b>risers</b> and mooring lines such that vibration transmission is minimized. The objective of this thesis is to understand how to tune the medium small irregularity such that the interaction of the incident wave field with the medium irregularity generates a desired reflected wave field. A particular design problem of interest is the prediction of the minimum amount of changes in the medium irregularity needed to minimize wave transmission to a desired level for a given range of frequencies of interest. As a model problem, we considered disordered chains of repetitive systems with the size of the order of many wavelengths of the incident wave. We applied an asymptotic theory for wave propagation along the non-uniform chain. For weak coupling between subsystems, the asymptotic theory predicted new results, such as exponential small transmission due to wave tunneling and explained localization phenomena as a turning point problem. For strong coupling,(cont.) the asymptotic theory provided fundamental understanding of the effects of the irregularity on wave propagation. Pipelines and risers can be modeled as slender beams under tensile force. To describe well the effects of small irregularity in beams vibration, we derived asymptotically a simpler governing equation for the vibration problem. This new equation is asymptotic with respect to the beam irregularity steepness, but under the restriction of constant product of the flexural rigidity by the mass per unit length and constant tensile force, this new equation is an exact equation for the beam vibration and has a Helmholtz-like form. Inverse scattering methods for the Helmholtz-like equations can be applied to design the beam non-uniformity such that desired wave scattering properties are achieved. We also constructed a high order asymptotic solution for the scattering of mono-chromatic waves by the irregularity in slender beams. The asymptotic method used is the WKB method, which is basically a wave refraction theory, but we improved it such that wave reflection and wave mode conversion were captured. The asymptotic approach developed in the previous problems is extended and applied to the interaction of linear surface gravity waves with a bottom topography which varies slowly with respect to the length scale of the incident wave field. The asymptotic theory captured wave reflection and transmission and wave mode conversion, which leads to a more complete asymptotic representation of the wave field [...] . by Karl Peter Burr.

Additionally, {{in the case}} of free spanning <b>pipelines</b> and <b>risers</b> the pipes may be excited at their resonance frequency by vortex induced vibration (VIV). In some cases the pipes may assume a curved shape after unreeling aboard a pipe laying vessel and this may affect the dynamic behavior of the pipe. The pipe cross section may also have an oval shape due to fabrication tolerances resulting in variations in stiffness around the circumference. In this master thesis the effect of varying the tuning parameters as frequency of rotating mass, inner pressure, position of bearings and magnitude of end masses is studied as well as the influence of oval shape of pipe and variations of the length of the pipe section to the stress distribution around the circumference of the pipe. To be able to do this, an Abaqus model similar to the full scale testing in the lab at Materialteknisk, NTNU, was created. The results in terms of stress distribution was relatively stable for forcing frequencies lower than 33. 8 Hz, but when increasing the rotating frequency of the pendulum above this value, the unevenness of the stress distribution increased drastically, when no other parameters were varied. A small difference in natural frequencies between the two main modes, due to bearings and gravity, had a large impact on the response when operating close to resonance frequency. An oval shape of the pipe had a large impact on the stress distribution around the circumference of the pipe.

40|$|Floating control {{facilities}} (FCFs) {{are designed}} to support fields using only subsea production system. Potential concepts, including Tension Leg Platform (TLP), Spar and semi-submersible can be selected as the FCFs. This paper discusses the philosophy of concept selection for FCFs. Two basic considerations for concept selection for FCFs are functional requirements and costs. Different structure types are first to be sized to meet the functional requirements for given water depths, environmental conditions and soil conditions. Then the costs for the procurement, construction, installation, hook up and commissioning for different concepts are estimated based on the sizes. Finally, the most cost-effective concept is chosen for further study to confirm the feasibilities of the concept by detailed analyses. Global sizing tools assisting concept selection have been developed by Ocean Dynamics LLC (Limited Liability Company) (ODL) over the past years. For a given concept, these sizing tools can find the optimized size based on costs to meet the functional requirements. Capabilities of the sizing tools cover the general layout, weight estimate (hull and deck), riser weight and stiffness estimate, loading conditions (transportation, normal operating, extreme, survival), hydrostatics and stability, natural periods, motions, air gap, environmental loads (wind, current, and mean wave forces), mooring sizing, cost estimate, and optimization based on the total costs. Two case studies in two different water depths, 140 m and 1200 m, are presented to illustrate the procedures and considerations in concept selection for floating control facilities.

40|$|ABSTRACT:In this paper, {{the effects}} of {{nonlinear}} soft clay on dynamic embedment of offshore pipeline were investigated. Seabed embedment by pipe-soil interactions has impacts on the structural boundary conditions for various subsea structures such as <b>pipeline,</b> <b>riser,</b> pile, and many other systems. A {{number of studies have}} been performed to estimate real soil behavior, but their estimation of seabed embedment has not been fully identified and there are still many uncertainties. In this regards, comparison of embedment between field survey and existing empirical models has been performed to identify uncertainties and investigate the effect of nonlinear soil parameter on dynamic embedment. From the comparison, it is found that the dynamic embedment with installation effects based on nonlinear soil model have an influence on seabed embedment. Therefore, the pipe embedment under dynamic condition by nonlinear para- meters of soil models was investigated by Dynamic Embedment Factor (DEF) concept, which is defined as the ratio of the dynamic and static embedment of pipeline, in order to overcome the gap between field embedment and currently used empirical and numerical formula. Although DEF through various researches is suggested, its range is too wide and it does not consider dynamic laying effect. It is difficult to find critical parameters that are affecting to the embedment result. Therefore, the study on dynamic embedment factor by soft clay parameters of nonlinear soil model was conducted and the sensitivity analyses about parameters of nonlinear soil model were performed as well. The tendency on dynamic embedment factor was found by conducting numerical analyses using OrcaFlex software. It is found that DEF was influenced by shear strength gradient than other factors.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of non-linear soil models in <b>pipeline</b> and <b>riser</b> design. A non-linear soil model is typically employed when investigating a complex pipe-soil interaction problem. Two main pipe-soil interactions are frequently studied: the vertical pipe-soil interaction at the touchdown point of the steel catenary riser (SCR) during cyclic heave motion, and the lateral pipe-soil interaction during the pipeline s lateral buckling. Mathematical models for non-linear pipe-soil interaction are presented. The interaction typically is represented using a force-displacement curve found by fitting {{a high number of}} test data points. In the lateral direction, the soil model developed by Verley and Sotberg is widely used in industry for assessing pipeline walking. In the vertical direction, Aubeny proposed a fairly good soil model which can capture important soil behaviour such as suction force and pipe-soil separation. The formulation and implementation of these models are the primarily focus of this thesis. New FORTRAN subroutines are created based on presented models. In lateral pipe-soil interaction, the soil subroutine, which is known as DNVMODEL-Y, includes mathematical models from DNV, PONDUS, and SAFEBUCK JIP. In vertical pipe-soil interaction, the soil subroutine, AUBENY-Z, includes the non-degradation vertical soil model developed by Aubeny. The soil subroutines are implemented inside the SIMLA software package to allow complete pipe-soil interaction analysis. Validation of the soil subroutines is conducted and presented in detail. Two validation methods are employed: comparing the results with related works/software and ascertaining the soil behaviour by various test cases using forced displacement load. Some applications of the developed soil subroutines in practical <b>pipeline</b> and <b>riser</b> analysis are presented in this thesis.

The use of flexible pipes has enabled development of several offshore fields that seemed unfeasible {{with the use of}} rigid pipes due to extensive seabed preparation and large dynamic motions. The lack of knowledge and integrity management tools for flexible pipes is a limiting factor and cause <b>pipelines</b> and <b>risers</b> to be replaced before their service life has been reached. This thesis aims to discover the critical failure modes for flexible pipes and explore conventional and novel techniques for performing inspection and monitoring. By understanding the failures and having access to the necessary technology the remaining lifetime and lifetime extension calculation will be more accurate than to date. Degradations and failure mechanisms will be detected at an early stage giving the operators better time to initiate mitigating and repair measures. By contacting industry experts and performing a study of the latest literature this thesis presents the possible failure modes for flexible pipes, as well as a screening of conventional and novel inspection and monitoring techniques. Reported incidents for Norway, UK {{and the rest of the}} world are presented to reveal the greatest risks for flexible risers. An integrity management strategy is based on the reported incidents, including recommendations and purpose of inspection and monitoring techniques. Based on incident reports and inputs from stakeholders the most frequent and critical failures to flexible pipes caused by to damage to and degradation of the internal and external polymer sheath. Breach of the outer sheath creates a hazardous environment in the annulus leading to an increased risk for several failure mechanisms. Degradation of the internal pressure sheath threatens the fluid containment integrity, and is difficult to inspect for. It is recommended to have a well-functioning annulus vent system attached to a monitoring system to control the annulus environment. Integrated fiber optics is considered as the most promising technique currently under development. This would provide continuous temperature monitoring throughout the <b>riser</b> and <b>pipeline</b> which can be used for outer sheath breach detection and temperature degradation calculations.

40|$|Pipes for <b>pipeline</b> and <b>risers</b> are {{subjected}} to fatigue loading during deployment. Additionally, {{in the case of}} free spanning <b>pipelines</b> and <b>risers</b> may be exited at their resonance frequency by vortex induced vibration. In some situations the pipes may assume a curved shape after unreeling aboard a pipe lying vessel and this may affect the dynamic behavior. Before installation the pipes are tested in a high cycle fatigue test to determine the life time of the pipe in fatigue. In this master thesis the effect of a curved shape is studied. A finite element model was created in the finite element software Abaqus. It was important to make the model as similar to reality as possible; to obtain comparable results. The mesh put on the riser pipe, end masses and end caps is of the size 50 mm. The reason for using such fine mesh is to represent the geometry and the properties of the material used in a best possible way. The results obtained from the finite element model have been compared to the results obtained from the finite element model have been compared to the results obtained in the laboratory and the deviations were very small. The different sources of error are discussed due to the curved shape of the pipes. With this in mind two different solution of how to smoothen the stress distribution along the circumference of the pipe is obtained. There are many different ways to smoothen the stress distribution. In chapter six and seven two different solutions arepresented. In the first solution it is tried to compensate for mass of the rising height by attaching a similar mass at {{the opposite side of the}} rising height. This solution did not function and the errors are commented on. In chapter seven a parameter study for a passive mass damper is presented. Experiments using Abaqus is carried out to verify the assumptions. The passive mass damper is a solution that can operate on pipe with various curvatures. It can be seen that the stress distribution along the circumference of the pipe smoothens when a passive mass damper is attached. The difficulties with this solution are to get the displacements of the mass damper limited to a reasonable value. With this in mind an alternative position for the passive mass damper were found. By placing the passive mass damper near the supports thedisplacements of the mass damper is limited and the functionality of the passive mass damper is extant.  </p...|$|R

The latter must consider large displacements, very often large rotations, and possibly even large strains. These numerical solutions must be computationally efficient and be capable of running on generally available computer hardware, i. e. minicomputers. To achieve this efficiency, attention must be paid to programming considerations, and a new suite of data management modules has been developed and is described in this thesis, which minimise disk storage and speed program development. In addition, the structural modelling was carried out almost exclusively using the Semiiaaf thin shell element. The work described in this thesis considers most of the components which contribute to the numerical {{ultimate strength}} analysis of steel tubular members. Theoretically, attention has been focused in two areas, namely the geometric nonlinearity and the automatic solution of the resulting nonlinear equations. A detailed study has been carried out to understand fully the main methods of accounting for geometric nonlinearity from fundamentals of continuum mechanics. The study has considered both the Green-Lagrange and Logarithmic strain measures with a Total Lagrangian, Updated Lagrangian and Eulerian description of motion. These formulations have been included in the Semiiaaf shell element, firstly using a continuum mechanics based approach, and secondly using the more orthodox stress resultant approach. At all stages within the thesis attention is drawn to the effects of the approximations which have been made and their resulting limitations in the respective formulations. The solution of the nonlinear equations is also covered in detail using Newton-type algorithms coupled with line searches. The solution algorithms have been derived for a constrained environment where {{a modified version of the}} generalised arc-length constraint has been used. The inclusion of material nonlinearity has been well developed previously but has been included for completeness. To demonstrate the performance and limitations of the theory presented, several carefully chosen numerical examples have been included which include the analysis of tubular steel T and X joints connections and residual strength assessment of a dented <b>pipeline</b> <b>riser.</b> Where possible, results have been compared with experimental tests. The thesis concludes that for general engineering structures, the Total Lagrangian approach based on the stress resultant model gives good engineering results, even in the presence of moderately large rotations. Of the alternative formulations the Updated Lagrangian layered approach is probably the most effective for large rotations and small to moderate strains...|$|R
40|$|A rather general {{absolute}} coordinate formulation is presented {{for the analysis}} of flexible pipe structure. The present formulation uses a similar line of approach adopted by Paulling and Webster (1986), which avoids the need of having to use infinitestiminal or finite rotations as nodal variables at the local floating frames of reference by expressing the structural response characteristics in terms of globally based position coordinate and its derivative to allow an accurate non-linear description of the pipe kinematics to be made, and extend the idea to include bending–torsion coupling, axial–radial coupling and bend restriction effect. The present formulation is also capable of handling internal flow effect, pre-bent section and irregular seabed interaction with friction effect, thus allowing an alternative general tool to be developed for <b>riser,</b> <b>pipeline</b> and flexible hose analyses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFailure of a subsea {{crude oil}} API 5 L X 52 steel {{pipeline}} {{which led to}} oil leakage {{has been reported to}} occur after 27 years in service. Some leaks were found to form {{at the bottom of the}} horizontal API 5 L X 52 steel pipeline near an elbow section which connected the <b>pipeline</b> to a <b>riser.</b> The present investigation aims to analyze the main cause of failure by conducting standard failure analysis methods including visual examination, chemical and mechanical characterizations, metallurgical examinations using optical microscopy in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and corrosion test using a three-electrode potential technique. Results of this investigation suggest that the cause of failure is electrochemical corrosion combined with mechanical process known as flow-induced corrosion. The failure mechanism is discussed with specific attentions are paid to fluid flow rate and chloride-containing water phase...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work investigates the dynamics {{characteristics of the}} offshore <b>riser</b> <b>pipeline</b> due to vortex flow {{and to develop a}} model that could predict its vortex induced responses. A riser made of Glass-fiber Reinforced Plastic (GRP) is used for this study. The mathematical model is derived based on Hamilton’s principle and modeled by using a finite-element method. The riser is subjected to sea wave and current and the hydrodynamic forces are calculated using Morison’s equation. A direct integration method namely Newmark integration scheme is proposed to solve the equation of motion. A MATLAB program code was developed to obtain the simulation results. The model used is validated by comparing the results with the analytical method and it shows a very good agreement. The simulation results are obtained to illustrate the dynamic characteristic of GRP pipe when subjected to combined sea wave and current. The effect of vortex shedding frequency and internal flow velocity on the response of riser are investigated and discussed in this study...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{national}} {{oil industry}} requires {{the evaluation of}} the existing infrastructure, as soon as better designs of the pipes and risers capable to assuring an optimal level of security, for that, the evaluation and retrofit of the existing pipelines is necessary, as well to create new <b>pipelines</b> or <b>risers</b> for transportation and distribution of oil products. Then, it is common to get situations, in the performance of fixed offshore platforms, in which risers might be found with lowly internal pressure or empty due to maintenance or repairing, this condition could represent an unfavorable situation that might become highly critical. Consequently, this research is focused to study the buckling of the steel pipes with helicoidally weld under combined load. In particular, for safety prediction, the failure modes and uncertainties involved in each loading condition need to be incorporated in the analysis in order to specify the pipelines use thresholds that keep them over acceptable safety levels within their operating lifetimes. The study is carried out through two types of analysis; buckling shell theory and numerical analysis by finite element method using techniques of bifurcation numerical analysis or EULER, where the shell wall and weld line are modeled with solid elements. The numerical models of the steel pipes included non-linear analysis with the mechanical models of the steel material such as Ramberg-Osgood law. The pipes are modeled as circular cylindrical thin structures, the combining action considered are, external pressure pe, axial compression N and bending moment M; the critical external pressure is obtained by stability analysis...|$|R
30|$|A {{literature}} survey has revealed a few papers discussing {{the interactions between}} the isolation tool and the fluid in the pipe. Most of the available studies are mechanical designs or have a commercial basis. Tveit and Aleksandersen (2000) introduced a PSI Smart Plug to isolate high pressure in <b>pipelines</b> and <b>risers.</b> Selden (2009) showed a successful application case of a PSI Smart Plug. The isolation tool is developed from a smart Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) and in-pipe robot in engineering. Dynamic analyses of the PIG model under different conditions were carried out (Nieckele et al. 2001; Yeung and Lima 2002; Xu and Gong 2005; Saeidbakhsh et al. 2009; Lesani et al. 2012; Zeng et al. 2014). Minami and Shoham (1995) developed a pigging model and analyzed PIG transient operations, coupling it with the Taitel simplified transient model. Nguyen et al. (2001 a, b, c) proposed a computational scheme to estimate the pigging dynamics. Solghar and Davoudian (2012) investigated the transient PIG motion in natural gas pipelines by basic differential forms of the mass and linear momentum equations and validated it using experimental data. Minami and Shoham (1995) developed a dynamic model considering {{the length of the}} pig. In in-pipe robot designs, researchers mainly focused on the mechanical design analysis (Minami and Shoham 1995; Nguyen et al. 2001 a, b, c; Ono and Kato 2004; Wang et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2010; Vahabi et al. 2011; Solghar and Davoudian 2012; Mirshamsi and Rafeeyan 2012, 2015) and control techniques (Roh et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|In the oil & gas {{industry}} {{there is a}} trend towards more subsea activities. To improve gas recovery from existing and new fields at greater depths, the produced gas will be compressed, processed and transported via subsea templates and underwater networks (<b>pipelines,</b> flexible <b>risers,</b> etc.). Besides the huge consequences for the subsea installation itself (reliability, maintenance, etc.), it also has consequences for underwater wildlife through the underwater source vibrations leading to sound radiation. Regulations aimed at managing the impact of underwater sound on marine life {{have been put in}} place by different nations [e. g. 1, 2]. Many offshore operations require an assessment of the potential impact of underwater noise on the environment, which requires knowledge of the sound transmitted by the subsea components. Until now very {{little is known about the}} underwater source mechanisms, the acoustic strength of these underwater networks, the coupling of the emitted source sound to the surrounding medium and the impact of the sound on the underwater wildlife. The dynamic behavior of networks for compressing and transporting gas, and the translation into emitted noise into air are rather well understood. However, due to the presence of the water the dynamic behavior from such subsea installation is very different than in air. To predict the dynamic behavior, the presence of the water cannot be neglected and has to be taken into account. This paper presents a simplified model for a subsea high speed turbo-compressor coupled to the KrakenC normal mode propagation model. With this combined model the noise at remote locations can be predicted and compared with the ambient noise and other anthropogenic noise sources such as for instance shipping, dredging and wind farm operation noise...|$|R
