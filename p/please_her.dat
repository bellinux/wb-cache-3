5|$|Maria Theresa was {{not just}} {{critical}} of Marie Antoinette. She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, who enjoyed her mother's complete confidence, though she failed to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> mother in one aspect – she did not produce any surviving children.|$|E
5|$|Shira and Yochay remain {{distant from}} one another afterwards, and he announces {{that he plans to}} move with Mordechai to marry the widow in Belgium. Shira, {{pressured}} by her family, agrees to go forward with the engagement to Yochay, believing it to be the best scenario for everyone. However, the rabbi realizes that Shira is acting to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> family and refuses to condone the marriage.|$|E
5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to <b>please</b> <b>her.</b> His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife– without irony– if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.|$|E

25|$|Clark {{later was}} the hostess of two more specials, another one for NBC {{and one for}} ABC—one which served as a pilot for a {{projected}} weekly series. Clark declined the offer in order to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> children, who disliked living in Los Angeles. Clark starred in the BBC television series This is Petula Clark, which aired from mid-1966 to early 1968.|$|E
25|$|Jones married Mary Joanna ("Janie") Brady (born 1866), {{whose father}} owned the {{boarding}} house where Jones was staying. Since she was Catholic, {{he decided to}} convert and was baptized on November 11, 1886, at St. Bridget's Catholic Church in Whistler, Alabama, to <b>please</b> <b>her.</b> They were married at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Jackson on November 25, 1886. They bought a house at 211 West Chester Street in Jackson, where they raised their three children. By all accounts he was a devoted family man and teetotaler.|$|E
25|$|Cordelia {{arrives at}} the library and unwittingly {{releases}} Vampire Willow, who immediately attacks her, but Wesley intervenes and drives the vampire away. At the Bronze, although Anya exposes Willow's disguise, Buffy defeats the other vampires, then captures the returning doppelganger. Anya returns vampiric Willow to her own timeline, where the alternate Oz immediately kills her. The next day, Percy, thoroughly intimidated by Willow's doppelganger (and believing she was the real Willow), shows up for tutoring with all his work completed and makes it clear he intends to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> from now on.|$|E

25|$|In 1928 Murphy sailed for New York, {{planning}} {{to continue her}} music studies while staying with a well-off great-uncle on Staten Island. Lured by Manhattan, she soon struck off on her own, playing piano for a while at a cafeteria near Columbia University, where she’d befriended students. Unfamiliar with American popular songs, she failed to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> audience but earned a few dollars dishing out food. She was fired from a subsequent job as a restaurant cashier because of her confusion over U.S. coins. With the Great Depression under way and jobs hard to find, she began coloring picture postcards for subsistence wages.|$|E
25|$|Her main {{argument}} was that sex and domestic economics went hand in hand; {{for a woman}} to survive, she was reliant on her sexual assets to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> husband so that he would financially support his family. From childhood, young girls are forced into a social constraint that prepares them for motherhood by the toys that are marketed to them and the clothes designed for them. She argued {{that there should be no}} difference in the clothes that little girls and boys wear, the toys they play with, or the activities they do, and described tomboys as perfect humans who ran around and used their bodies freely and healthily.|$|E
25|$|Malfatti {{is thought}} to have been rather {{discouraged}} from her reception of her highly debated exposition and so it would make sense that she would try to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> audience. However, at the same time, other artists such as Tarsila do Amaral were becoming highly evolved in their search for the Brazilian identity and culture. Although Malfatti's courage and formally trained style introduced a new development to Brazilians, she almost sacrificed her artistic career simply to pave the path for other artists to forge ahead. However she will always be celebrated as the artist who brought Modernism to Brazil and, as that is no small feat, her impact is legendary.|$|E
60|$|I {{was glad}} I {{had not been}} too impetuous. My reply evidently <b>pleased</b> <b>her.</b> She chuckled all over.|$|R
60|$|The {{action was}} more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to indulge in: somehow it <b>pleased</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred {{is aware that}} she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts {{it out with a}} lesson ("A Spoonful of Sugar"). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming.|$|E
25|$|Droste's {{earliest}} {{poems are}} derivative and conventional but in 1820 her work {{began to show}} marked originality when she embarked on a cycle of religious poems, Das geistliche Jahr ("The Spiritual Year"). Droste intended to write one poem for each Sunday and Feast Day of the church year and the cycle was meant to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> devout grandmother, but when Droste had completed 25 poems, she realised they were too personal and showed too many traces of spiritual doubt, so she shelved the work until 1839 when a friend persuaded her to complete the series. Even then she did not publish the poems and they were only offered to the public posthumously in 1851.|$|E
25|$|Terry {{married three}} times and was {{involved}} in numerous relationships. In London, during her engagement at the Haymarket Theatre, {{she and her sister}} Kate had their portraits painted by the eminent artist George Frederic Watts. His famous portraits of Terry include Choosing, in which she must select between earthly vanities, symbolised by showy but scentless camellias, and nobler values symbolised by humble-looking but fragrant violets. His other famous portraits of her include Ophelia and Watchman, and, with Kate, The Sisters. He proposed marriage to Terry in spite of his being three decades her senior. She was impressed with Watts's art and elegant lifestyle, and she wished to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> parents by making an advantageous marriage. She left the stage during the run of Tom Taylor's hit comedy Our American Cousin at the Haymarket, in which she played Mary Meredith.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe was not {{accustomed}} to being waited upon by white people, {{and to have a}} repast prepared for her by this cook of high degree flattered her vanity and wonderfully <b>pleased</b> <b>her.</b> Her soul warmed toward the good woman who was warming and cheering her body.|$|R

25|$|When he was 19, Riley met 15-year-old Marlene Olive while dealing {{drugs at}} her high school. He {{developed}} {{a crush on}} her and began to pursue her. Although she was initially put off by his weight, the couple eventually had sex and began a relationship largely controlled by Marlene Olive. Riley provided her with free drugs, gifts, and transportation, listened to her problems, and sometimes helped her carry out sexual or criminal fantasies. She frequently threatened to break up with Riley unless he did what she wanted and claimed to have magical powers of control over him, in which he reportedly believed. He was anxious to <b>please</b> <b>her</b> {{in order to continue}} the relationship and twice attempted suicide when she briefly broke up with him. As she had with previous boyfriends, Marlene Olive soon began to ask Riley for help or advice in killing her mother or suggest that he himself kill her parents. Jim and Naomi Olive initially approved of their daughter dating Riley, finding him polite and responsible.|$|E

6000|$|She colored {{a little}} at the tribute to her candor, and it <b>pleased</b> <b>her,</b> though it had just <b>pleased</b> <b>her</b> as much to forget {{that she was not}} like any other young girl who might be simply and irresponsibly happy in flowers {{gathered}} for her by a young man. [...] "I won't tell him, either!" [...] she cried, willing to grasp the fleeting emotion again; but it was gone, and only a little residue of sad consciousness remained.|$|R

500|$|A popular Greek legend turned Alexander the Great's sister, Thessalonike, into a mermaid {{after her}} death, {{living in the}} Aegean. She would ask the sailors on any ship she would {{encounter}} only one question: [...] "Is King Alexander alive?" [...] ( [...] ;"), to which the correct answer was: [...] "He lives and reigns and conquers the world" [...] (Greek: [...] "Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμον κυριεύει"). [...] This answer would <b>please</b> <b>her,</b> and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell. [...] Any other answer would enrage her, and she would stir up a terrible storm, dooming the ship and every sailor on board.|$|E
500|$|In 1834 {{a second}} edition was {{published}} {{under the name}} Les Chouans ou La Bretagne en 1799. It had been heavily revised, as per Balzac's style of constantly reworking texts, even after their release. He had been corresponding with Ewelina Hańska, who wrote to him anonymously in 1832. In an attempt to <b>please</b> <b>her,</b> he changed some of the language in Les Chouans for its second edition. [...] "If only you knew," [...] he wrote to her, [...] "how much there is of you in every altered phrase of Chouans!" [...] The second edition also demonstrates the author's maturing political philosophy (softening his representation of the royalists), and the evolved female characters testify to his relationship with Hańska.|$|E
