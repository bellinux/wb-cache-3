5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E

25|$|A spinner is an {{aircraft}} component, a streamlined fairing fitted over a <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> {{or at the}} centre of a turbofan engine. Spinners both make the aircraft overall more streamlined, reducing aerodynamic drag and also smooth the airflow so that it enters the air intakes more efficiently. Spinners also fulfill an aesthetic role on some aircraft designs.|$|E
50|$|The engine chosen was a new, higher-power and lighter-weight {{version of}} the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 that had been {{developed}} for the Douglas DC-6. <b>Propeller</b> <b>hubs</b> were taken from F4U Corsairs, four-blade propellers and spinners from DC-7s.|$|R
50|$|Other {{solutions}} to avoiding the propeller arc include passing the gun's barrel through the <b>propeller's</b> <b>hub</b> or spinner (the {{nose of the}} aircraft) - first used in production military aircraft with the World War I French SPAD S.XII - or mounting guns in the wings.

50|$|The {{company is}} {{noted for its}} use of the Clark Y airfoil, {{infinite}} blade angle adjustment, {{as well as for}} the very low rotating inertia of its designs, a key wear factor on lightweight engine gearboxes. The propeller blades are constructed of carbon fiber and aramid pre-preg cloth with a foam core, and cured in an autoclave. The company's Apex series of two to five bladed <b>propeller</b> <b>hubs</b> were CAD/CAM designed and are created on a Haas VF-4 CNC vertical milling station.|$|R
25|$|The G-6/U4 variant {{was armed}} with a 30mm (1.18in) MK 108 cannon mounted as a Motorkanone firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> instead of the 20mm MG 151/20. The G-6 was very often seen during 1943 fitted with {{assembly}} sets, used to carry bombs or a drop tank, {{for use as a}} night fighter, or to increase firepower by adding rockets or extra gondola-style, underwing gun pod mount ordnance.|$|E
25|$|The {{armament}} of the Bf 109 F was {{revised and}} now {{consisted of the}} two synchronized 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17s with 500 rpg above the engine plus a Motorkanone cannon firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub.</b> The pilot's opinion on the new armament was mixed: Oberst Adolf Galland criticised the light armament as inadequate for the average pilot, while Major Walter Oesau preferred to fly a Bf 109 E, and Oberst Werner Mölders saw the single centreline Motorkanone gun as an improvement.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} March 2001 Antonov's first deputy designer-general Dmitri Kiva {{provided}} {{further details}} about the cause announcing that the accident was caused by disintegration of the oil line leading to the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> pitch mechanism that attaches to the engine. Kiva said that the pilots attempted {{to compensate for the}} loss of power by increasing the settings of the remaining three engines. At some point another D-27 automatically shut off after the safe RPM limit has been exceeded.|$|E

25|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{configuration}} was to free up space for the heavy main armament, a 37mm (1.46in) Oldsmobile T9 cannon firing {{through the center of}} the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> for optimum accuracy and stability when firing. This happened because H.M. Poyer, designer for project leader Robert Woods, was impressed by the power of this weapon and pressed for its incorporation. This was unusual, because fighter design had previously been driven by the intended engine, not the weapon system. Although devastating when it worked, the T9 had very limited ammunition, a low rate of fire, and was prone to jamming.|$|E
25|$|As the DB 601 E {{was not yet}} {{available}} in numbers, the pre-production F-0 (the only F variant to have a rectangular supercharger intake) and the first production series F-1/F-2 received the 1,175PS (1,159hp, 864kW) DB 601N engine driving a VDM 9-11207 propeller. The F-0/F-1 and F-2 only differed in their armament; the F-1 being fitted with one 20mm MG FF/M Motorkanone firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub,</b> with 60 rounds. The F-1 first saw action in the Battle of Britain in October 1940 with JG 51. The most experienced fighter aces, like Werner Mölders, were {{the first ones to}} fly the Bf 109 F-1s in combat in October 1940. A total of 208 F-1s were built between August 1940 and February 1941 by Messerschmitt Regensburg and the Wiener Neustädter Flugzeugwerke (WNF).|$|E
25|$|Tank {{introduced}} a further refinement to this basic concept. He suggested placing {{most of the}} airflow components on the propeller, {{in the form of}} a oversized propeller spinner whose outside diameter was the same as the engine. The cowl around the engine proper was greatly simplified, essentially a basic cylinder. Air entered through a small hole at the centre of the spinner, and was directed through ductwork in the spinner so it was blowing rearward along the cylinder heads. To provide enough airflow, an internal cone was placed in the centre of the hole, over the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub,</b> which was intended to compress the airflow and allow a smaller opening to be used. In theory, the tight-fitting cowling also provided some thrust due to the compression and heating of air as it flowed through the cowling.|$|E
50|$|In {{larger and}} more modern engines, a rubber bushing transmits the torque of the drive shaft to the <b>propeller's</b> <b>hub.</b> Under a {{damaging}} load the friction of the bushing in the hub is overcome and the rotating propeller slips on the shaft, preventing overloading of the engine's components. After such an event the rubber bushing may be damaged. If so, it may continue to transmit reduced power at low revolutions, but may provide no power, due to reduced friction, at high revolutions. Also, the rubber bushing may perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed failure load.|$|R
50|$|On 31 January 2017, {{commanded}} by CAPT Joseph Carrigan, Antietam ran aground in Tokyo Bay near its home port of Yokosuka, Japan. Antietam was anchored {{off the coast}} in 30 knot winds and a strong tide when the crew noticed the ship was dragging its anchor. They got the ship underway, but shortly after doing so, they felt the ship shudder as it lost all pitch control in both propellers. They had run aground on a shoal with damage to both propellers {{and one of the}} <b>propeller</b> <b>hubs,</b> causing 1100 gal of hydraulic oil to leak into the water. No personnel were injured during the incident. Repairs are expected to cost at least $4.2 million.|$|R
25|$|To {{meet this}} requirement, Folland {{designed}} the Nighthawk, a wooden two-bay biplane. An initial order for 150 Nighthawks {{was placed in}} August 1918, well before prototypes or flight-ready engines were available, with the first prototype, serial number F-2909 flying in April or May 1919. By this time, {{it was clear that}} the Dragonfly had serious problems, being prone to extreme overheating (which was so severe as to char <b>propeller</b> <b>hubs),</b> high fuel consumption and severe vibration (inadvertently being designed to run at its resonance frequency). When the engine could be persuaded to work, the Nighthawk showed excellent performance, but in September 1919, it was finally recognised that the Dragonfly was unsalvagable and the engine programme was cancelled, although by this time 1,147 engines had been delivered.|$|R
500|$|In November 1940, Nikolai Polikarpov {{proposed}} a heavy cannon-armed fighter for bomber escort duties and ground attack missions. The new ITP was designed around either the 1,230kW (1,650hp) Klimov M-107P or the Mikulin AM-37 inline engines. Two armament configurations were planned. The first {{consisted of a}} [...] cannon firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> and two synchronized [...] ShVAK cannon mounted {{on each side of}} the fuselage nose. The 37mm cannon was provided with 50 rounds and the ShVAK had 200 rounds each. The second configuration substituted an additional ShVAK with 200 rounds for the 37mm cannon. It had racks for eight unguided RS-82 rockets underneath the wings.|$|E
500|$|Sergey Ilyushin's {{concept to}} meet the 1947 {{requirement}} for a superior aircraft to the Il-10 in performance and firepower was a heavily armored, single-engine, all-metal, low-wing monoplane powered by the newly developed M-47—also known as the MF-45Sh or M-45Sh—liquid-cooled engine, which developed [...] at takeoff. The design's most notable feature was the pilot's cockpit mounted directly above the engine, reminiscent of the Blackburn Blackburn and Blackburn Cubaroo. Furthermore, the cockpit was situated directly behind the four-bladed propeller to maximize pilot visibility. The windshield extended down to the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> and provided the pilot with a 37° downward field of view; in a medium dive he could view targets directly underneath the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Now, {{promoted}} to Oberstleutnant, {{he continued to}} lead JG 26 in 1941 against the RAF fighter sweeps across northern Europe. In early 1941, most of the Luftwaffes fighter units {{were sent to the}} Eastern Front, or south to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO), only leaving JG 26 and Jagdgeschwader 2 (JG 2) as the sole single-engine fighter Geschwader in France. By this time, JG 26 were being re-equipped with the new Bf 109F, normally equipped with a 15mm (or later a 20mm) cannon firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> and two cowl-mounted 7.9mm MG 17. Galland felt the model was grossly under-armed and so tested a series of 109 [...] "specials"– one with a unique armament of an MG 151/20 cannon and two cowl-mounted 13mm MG 131 machine guns, and another with integral wing-mounted 20mm MG FF cannons.|$|E
5000|$|Hispano-Suiza 8C - A Spanish-designed engine {{commonly}} referred-to as [...] "the Rolls-Royce Merlin of the First World War" [...] out {{of respect}} for its technological advancement, superior performance and overall importance, it so greatly exceeded (by a factor of ten times) French testing standards of the period that they {{had no choice but to}} allow its adoption. The [...] "Hisso" [...] powered almost every high-performance allied fighter plane of the First World War - including all French Spads. Certain variants (including one that equipped the Spad VII) allowed weapons as large and powerful as 37mm cannon to be fired through their <b>propeller</b> <b>hubs,</b> thus side-stepping any need to synchronize their firing with the propeller's movement. The engine itself consisted of an ultra-lightweight aluminum monobloque with steel-sleeved cylinders, enabling it the strongest power-to-weight ratio of any engine built during the First World War.|$|R
5000|$|They were {{delivered}} via the ALSIB (Alaska-Siberia) air ferry route. The aircraft had its baptism of {{fire at the}} end of June 1942. The Soviets were dissatisfied with the four [...]30-calibre Browning machine guns — themselves only capable of firing at a top rate of 600 rounds per gun per minute — and replaced them with the faster-firing, 7.62mm calibre ShKAS, capable of up to 1800 rounds per gun per minute. During the summer of 1942, the Bostons flew ultra-low-level raids against German convoys heavily protected by flak. Attacks were made from altitudes as low as 33 ft (10 metres) and the air regiments suffered heavy losses. By mid-1943 Soviet pilots were very familiar with the A-20B and A-20C. The general opinion was that the aircraft was overpowered and therefore fast and agile. It could make steep turns with an angle of up to 65°, while the tricycle landing gear made for easier take-offs and landings. The type could be flown even by crews with minimal training. The engines were reliable but sensitive to low temperatures, so the Soviet engineers developed special covers for keeping <b>propeller</b> <b>hubs</b> from freezing up.|$|R
40|$|Presently, the {{majority}} of podded propulsion systems are of the pulling type, because this type provides better hydrodynamic efficiency than the pushing type. There are several possible explanations for the better overall performance of a puller type podded propulsor. One {{is related to the}} difference in hub shape. Puller and pusher <b>propellers</b> have opposite <b>hub</b> taper angles, hence different hub and blade root shape. These differences cause changes in the flow condition and possibly influence the overall performance. The current study focuses on the variation in performance of pusher and puller propellers with the same blade sections, but different hub taper angles. A hyperboloidal low order sourcedoublet steady/unsteady time domain panel method code was modified and used to evaluate effects of hub taper angle on the open water propulsive performance of some fixed pitch screw propellers used in podded propulsion systems. The modified code was first validated against measurements of two model propellers in terms of average propulsive performance and good agreement was found. Major findings include significant effects of hub taper angle on propulsive performance of tapered <b>hub</b> <b>propellers</b> and noticeable effects of hub taper angle on sectional pressure distributions of tapered <b>hub</b> <b>propeller</b> blades.

500|$|A {{variety of}} other tests and other {{projects}} were conducted using MiG-3s. Leading edge slats were evaluated in 1941 although they were not fitted on production aircraft, but were used by the I-210. A six-bladed propeller was fitted on one aircraft to increase thrust at high altitude to enable the fighter to catch the high-flying Junkers Ju 86P aircraft then overflying Moscow. A new <b>propeller</b> <b>hub</b> was made that mounted six standard VISh-61 blades, but nothing more is known of the project.

500|$|The {{aircraft}} was designed around a French-made 12-cylinder Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine with a Hispano-Suiza HS.404 [...] autocannon mounted between the cylinder {{banks of the}} engine and firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub.</b> This powerful [...] engine combined with the hub-firing cannon mandated {{the use of a}} metal fuselage. Other armament consisted of two synchronised French-made [...] Darne machine guns, mounted under and to each side of the engine. The wing was braced with two struts {{on each side of the}} fuselage; the fixed conventional landing gear was spatted and mounted off the wing struts. [...] The fixed tailwheel was also spatted. [...] The enclosed cockpit was located behind the wing. The horizontal stabilizer on each side was braced from below with two rigid braces from the lower tailcone, and tied from above with two flying wires from the vertical stabilizer. The three-bladed propeller was manually adjustable in pitch.|$|E
500|$|Autocannon {{have largely}} {{replaced}} machine guns in aircraft, {{due to their}} greater firepower. [...] The first airborne cannon appeared in World War II, but each airplane could carry only one or two, as cannon are heavier than machine guns, the standard armament. They were variously mounted, often in the wings, but also high on the forward fuselage, where they would fire through the propeller, or even through the <b>propeller</b> <b>hub.</b> Due both to the low number of cannon per aircraft, and the lower rate of fire of cannon, machine guns continued to be used widely early in the war, as there was a greater probability of hitting enemy aircraft. However, as cannon were more effective against more heavily armored bomber aircraft, they were eventually integrated into newer fighters, which usually carried between two and four autocannon. The Hispano-Suiza HS.404, Oerlikon 20mm cannon, MG FF, and their numerous variants became among {{the most widely used}} autocannon in the war. Nearly all modern fighter aircraft are armed with an autocannon, and most are derived from their counterparts from the Second World War. The largest, heaviest, and most powerful airborne cannon used by the military of the United States is the GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type rotary cannon; it is surpassed only by the specialized artillery pieces carried on the AC-130 gunship.|$|E
40|$|The {{designed}} propellers with extinguishing {{structures of}} hub and winglets show great potential in saving energy {{by providing the}} strong thrust with a rotating speed.

Hub structures in convex, concave, dome, and dome coping with a small Center propeller located {{on the front of the}} hub are tested with a rotating speed under the RPM of 100 rev/min in manipulation under the standard k - e turbulence model. The shear stress transport turbulence model is carried out to study the potential dynamic properties of four propellers (the Convex propeller, the Dome propeller, the Center propeller, and the Winglet propeller) under the RPM less than 3000 rev/min. The mass flow through the inlet, interfaces, and the outlet is applied to determine the stability of the fluid flow. The present study shows a relative mass flow of each propeller compared with the Convex propeller which is chosen to be the reference model in this dissertation. Through CFD simulations in ANSYS CFX, we evaluate the dynamic performances of the designed propellers.

40|$|The {{protection}} of the Turkish Straits against maritime terrorism is an important security problem that must be solved because the straits are highly vulnerable to terrorist attacks. The main purpose {{of this research is}} to increase the security of the Turkish Straits against maritime terrorism by designing an underwater system that can stop a terrorist ship by impeding its propeller efficiency.

40|$|This paper aims {{to predict}} the {{hydrodynamic}} forces on a <b>propeller</b> with different <b>hub</b> taper angles and a podded drive unit in azimuthing conditions. In order to evaluate the propulsive performance of the podded drive system, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solver is employed. The method has been first verified by a single <b>propeller</b> with different <b>hub</b> taper angles. The performance curves of the propellers, obtained by numerical methods, have been compared to and validated with experimental results. In the next step, the method has been extended to the podded drive unit for both puller and pusher configurations. The yaw angles of the podded drives are set to vary from - 300 to + 300 with 50 increments. The propulsive characteristics, including the torque and thrust of the propeller, the axial force, and the side force of the unit are presented as functions of the advance velocity ratio and yaw angle. Computational results are compared to the available experimental data. Finally, it is shown there is good agreement between the experimental measurements {{and the results of}} the present numerical method. 9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the difference in performance of puller and pusher type podded propulsors.

Results are presented here of an experimental study focused on the variation in performance of pusher and puller propellers with the same blade sections, but different hub taper angles, both in cavitating and noncavitating open water conditions. In {{the first phase of the}} study, three model <b>propellers</b> with different <b>hub</b> taper angles were tested in open water conditions. In the second phase, a similar study was carried out in a cavitation tunnel. Both of the studies were done to investigate the effect of hub taper angle on performance at different operating conditions. The open water propeller data is used to provide a comparison with the cavitation performance. From the open water study, it is concluded that hub taper angle has a significant effect on propulsive performance, especially at the highly loaded condition, where the puller propellers perform better than the pusher ones. From the cavitation tunnel study, it is concluded that the puller configuration propellers do not have better performance than the pusher configuration propellers under all cavitating conditions.
