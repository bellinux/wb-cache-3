(submitted to Nucl. Inst. and Meth. A) 2 1) Introduction Silicon strip detectors are used in high energy physics for their excellent spatial resolution. This resolution depends on many parameters: the silicon detector characteristics, the read-out pitch, the presence of intermediate floating strips, the coupling with the read-out electronics and the noise level of the read-out electronics. In principle, {{it should be possible to}} estimate the influence of any of these parameters on the detector performance.

40|$|Floor-by-floor {{survey of}} {{installed}} elements of an elevator shaft using coordinate method and tacheometer is also inhibited by {{the necessity to}} determine device installation points for floors of every mounting horizon that leads to additional measurements due to conditions of the completed building framework and presence of {{a great number of}} situational disturbances and then it entails significant time expenditure and diminution of accuracy in the obtained results. Technical capabilities of the modern electronic tacheometer substantially simplify an accomplishment of the mission because the device can be applied not only in function of vertical projection but it can be used for preand post-construction survey of the elevator shaft with the help of advanced radiation method. While using the given method the electronic tacheometer equipped with diagonal ocular is installed over a bearing sign in the elevator pit and control points of the elevator shaft are determined with the help of specially developed <b>portable</b> <b>beam</b> deflector in the form of disc with radius   r, which is fixed to a handle rod and orientated perpendicularly to a laser beam. An innovation diagram for preand post-construction survey of elevator shaft has been developed while applying this type of deflector.

The paper proposes a new method for pre and post construction survey of the elevator shaft using the electronic tacheometer while applying specially developed beam deflector that ensures a geometric fixing of one or simultaneously two surveying points to spatial coordinate system where the preand post-construction survey is carried out.

40|$|Soft tissue {{images from}} <b>portable</b> cone <b>beam</b> {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) scanners {{can be used}} for diagnosis and detection of tumor, cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, and so forth. Due to large field of view, X-ray scattering which is the main cause of artifacts degrades image quality, such as cupping artifacts, CT number inaccuracy, and low contrast, especially on soft tissue images. In this work, we propose the X-ray scatter correction method for improving soft tissue images. The X-ray scatter correction scheme to estimate X-ray scatter signals is based on the deconvolution technique using the maximum likelihood estimation maximization (MLEM) method. The scatter kernels are obtained by simulating the PMMA sheet on the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) software. In the experiment, we used the QRM phantom to quantitatively compare with fan-beam CT (FBCT) data in terms of CT number values, contrast to noise ratio, cupping artifacts, and low contrast detectability. Moreover, the PH 3 angiography phantom was also used to mimic human soft tissues in the brain. The reconstructed images with our proposed scatter correction show significant improvement on image quality. Thus the proposed scatter correction technique has high potential to detect soft tissues in the brain...|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{distribution}} {{performance will}} be improved with {{the installation of}} a new synchronization equipment (slave clock) in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Cor-poration's (NTT's) network. In the slave clock system, the PLL has been optimally de-signed so that the total phase-time variation in the whole network is significantly less than 10 ps. This phase-time variation is recommended by International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT). The design method and PLL control algo-rithm enable both an optimum time constant of the PLL and a frequency departure of 10 - 12 in a holdover operation. The functions of the frequency distribution system has the intrinsic capability of being expanded and applied to a time transfer system. Since the frequencies are syn-chronized, a phase-time of the standard frequency signal can be synchronized to a coordinate time scale by an initial time setting, c. g., using portable clocks. Time synchroniza t ion capability {{is determined by the}} relative phase-time variation of standard frequency signals and the time accuracy of the initial phase-time setting.

40|$|In {{support of}} {{stockpile}} stewardship {{and other important}} missions, Los Alamos is continually looking for fast and effective ways of inspecting and evaluating industrial parts. Thus, Los Alamos is continually striving to improve our radiography and computed tomography (CT) capabilities. Cormack [1] and Hounsfield [2] received the Nobel Prize in 1979 for their pioneering work in computed tomography {{that led to the}} development of medical scanners. Copley et al. [3] provides a good history of the development of industrial CT systems. The early systems collect data via a single detector or linear detector array. While CT offers greatly increased spatial resolutions over radiography, CT inspections with a linear array are slow and costly. To improve the viability of CT for NDT applications, Feldkamp, Davis, and Kress [4] reported a cone beam reconstruction technique that speeds up the CT process by using image data rather than data collected by a linear array. Because it potentially offers processing speeds up to 10 times faster than CT systems that use a linear array, we are building a cone beam CT for use with our 20 MV x-ray source and Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) neutron sources.

40|$|Species {{variations}} in formaldehyde solutions and gases were investigated {{by means of}} infrared spectral analysis. Double beam infrared spectrometry in conjunction with sodium chloride wafer technique and solvent compensation technique were employed. Formaldehyde species in various solutions were investigated. Formalin 37 % was stable for many months. Refrigeration had no effects on its stability. Spectral changes were detected in 1000 ppm formaldehyde solutions. The absorbances of very diluted solutions up to 100 ppm were lower than the detection limit of the instruments. Solvent compensation improved resolution, but was associated with an observed lack of repeatability. Formaldehyde species in animal chambers containing animals and in mobile home air were analyzed with the infrared spectrophotometer equipped with a 10 cm gas cell. Spectra were not different from the spectrum of clean air. A <b>portable</b> single <b>beam</b> infrared spectrometer with a 20 meter pathlength was used for reinvestigation. Indoor formaldehyde could not be detected in the spectral; conversely, an absorption peak at 3. 58 microns {{was found in the}} spectra of 3 and 15 ppm formaldehyde gas in animal chambers. This peak did not appear in the spectrum of the control chamber. Because of concerns over measurement bias among various analytical methods for formaldehyde, side-by-side comparisons were conducted in both laboratory and field measurements. The chromotropic acid method with water and 1 % sodium bisulfite as collection media, the pararosaniline method, and a single beam infrared spectrometer were compared. Measurement bias was elucidated and the extent of the effects of temperature and humidity was also determined. The problems associated with related methods were discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{hydrogen}} and hydrogenic (one-electron) ions {{is an area}} of rapid progress and one of great potential for future frequency standards. In 1997, the two-photon 1 S- 2 S transition in the hydrogen atom was included in the list of approved radiations for the practical realisation of the metre, and since then revolutions in optical frequency metrology have reduced the uncertainty in its frequency by more than an order of magnitude, to 1. 8 parts in 10 " 1 " 4. Hydrogenic systems are simple enough that the frequencies of their transitions can be calculated in terms of the Rydberg constant with an accuracy that can approach or exceed the measurement uncertainty. Transitions in such systems {{can be thought of as}} forming a natural frequency scale, and offer the prospect of a set of quantum frequency standards which are directly related to the fundamental constants. The Rydberg constant is currently best determined from optical frequency measurements in hydrogen. However, to take full advantage of the recent high accuracy 1 S- 2 S frequency measurement requires: Improved measurements of other transition frequencies in the hydrogen atom; Reduced uncertainty in the quantum electrodynamic (QED) contributions to the energy levels, in particular the two-loop binding corrections; An improved value for the proton charge radius. In He"+ and one-electron systems of higher atomic number Z, the two-loop binding corrections are a fractionally larger part of the Lamb shift due to their rapid scaling with Z. Measurements of the Lamb shift in medium-Z hydrogenic ions can therefore provide tests of these corrections, and feed in to the theoretical understanding of hydrogen itself Although both theory and experiment are less accurate at higher Z, there is the potential for a new range of X-ray standards, providing that the QED corrections are well understood and new absolute measurement techniques can be developed. A number of areas are suggested for future investigation: Improving the accuracy of hydrogen 2 S-nS/D measurements, contributing to an improved Rydberg constant determination; Spectroscopy of cooled, trapped hydrogen atoms; Improved calculations of the two-loop binding corrections complete to all orders in Z#alpha#; Lamb shift measurements in medium-Z hydrogenic ions by laser excitation, to check the two-loop binding corrections; Experiments to resolve discrepancies arising from the proton charge radius; Development of a small <b>portable</b> electron <b>beam</b> ion trap (EBIT) capable of producing high yields of hydrogenic ions; Development of techniques for absolute measurement of X-ray transitions observed in an EBIT.

40|$|My name is Isaac Lopez and I am {{a junior}} at the University of Houston majoring in Mechanical Engineering Technology. I will be {{completing}} my first tour at the NASA-Johnson Space Center ("JSC") as a Mechanical Engineer within the Human Interfaces Branch. Throughout my tour, I was {{given the opportunity to}} work on multiple projects that have expanded my knowledge and interest in acoustics and engineering design. One of the projects I worked on at JSC consisted of doing acoustic simulation of the EVA comm. cap. While working on the comm. cap headset, my main duty consisted of simulating the acoustics of the headset to find a solution to the condensing water that can accumulate and block the acoustic tube, causing attenuation or complete loss of audio in one ear for an astronaut using the EVA. For this project, I had to create a Creo model of the comm. cap so that I would be able to import it into Comsol for acoustic simulation. I also had the opportunity to design a <b>portable</b> and lightweight <b>beam</b> degrader for the EEE Parts and Radiation team. With the help of Creo, I was able to make a CAD design and put together a small working prototype for the radiation team to demonstrate the capabilities that the beam degrader had. In addition to these projects, JSC allowed me to work closely on projects with other interns. I had the opportunity to help another intern with his acoustic diverter, intended to improve the sound quality in Node 1 of the ISS. During this project, I helped with some of the acoustic testing inside the anechoic chamber as well as helping record data during testing at the ISS mock up. During the course of my first tour, I was able to learn and continually improve on my CAD drafting skills. With each project I worked on, I acquired new ways to create and improve various designs with various constraints. Furthermore, I also had the opportunity to work with electrical engineers and learn about the electronic components that would provide control of the beam degrader functions. I was able to take the knowledge, skills and designs I had acquired during my tour at JSC (such as Finite Element Analysis) and apply them to my work on the Comsol Multiphysics software for acoustics simulation. I was also able to use it to do some stress analysis on a proposed design for a proposed Habitat structure. My time at JSC has been invaluable as it helped me grow and more fully-comprehend my major as well as spark an interest in acoustics and how much it relates to mechanical engineering.
