For above the line, voters are instructed to number at least their first six preferences; however, a [...] "savings provision" [...] is in place to ensure that ballots will still be counted if less than six are given. For below the line, voters are required to number at least their first 12 preferences. Voters are free to continue numbering as many preferences as they like beyond the minimum number specified.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the preferences in clothing fabrics and preferences in home furnishing fabrics are similar or different in color, design size, and line. The relationships of age, education, and training in color and design to agreement of clothing fabrics and home furnishing fabrics preferences were also investigated. Thirty slides from the Compton Fabric Preference Test (CFPT) were used to measure color and design size preference in clothing; thirty slides from Hada's Furniture Fabric Preference Test (FFPT) were used to measure color and design size preference in home furnishings. Twelve slides for clothing and twelve slides for home furnishings were developed by the investigator to measure straight and curved <b>line</b> <b>preferences.</b> These slides were similar in appearance to the CFPT and the FFPT and were combined with them.

30|$|The {{syringes}} {{used with}} power infusion pumps {{are small and}} must therefore be changed frequently. The changeover between vasoactive drug infusion pumps (CVIP) can induce a brief change in the drug flow rate manifesting as hemodynamic instability [7]. Various methods for performing manual or automatic changeovers {{have been developed to}} prevent episodes of hemodynamic instability [6, 8]. In the quick change method (QC), a full syringe is loaded into a new pump then connected to the three-way stopcock, which is turned to open the new and close the old infusion. This new <b>primed</b> <b>line</b> is set at the same flow rate as the running pump. QC has been proven simple and effective for manual CVIP [7, 9, 10] but does not completely eliminate the risk of instability. In addition, QC generates considerable work and stress for the nurse.|$|R

50|$|The {{election}} will be conducted by the Electoral Commission of South Australia (ECSA), an independent body answerable to Parliament. Like federal elections, South Australia has compulsory voting and uses full-preference instant-runoff voting for single-member electorates in the lower house. Additionally, following similar Senate changes which took effect from the 2016 federal election, South Australia's single transferable vote in the proportionally represented upper house is changing from group voting tickets to optional preferential voting − instructions for above the line votes will be to mark '1' and then further preferences optional as opposed to preference flows from simply '1' above the line being determined by group voting tickets, while instructions for voters who instead opt to vote below the line will be to provide at least 12 preferences as opposed to having to number all candidates, and with a savings provision to admit ballot papers which indicate at least 6 below the <b>line</b> <b>preferences.</b>|$|R

30|$|Free {{radicals}} are the chemical species which contains unpaired electrons. These unpaired electrons make these species very reactive due {{to which they}} cause oxidative stress by reacting with other biological compounds. Oxidative stress {{is involved in the}} pathogenesis of many ailments, like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. It can damage lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and DNA in the cells (Ratnam et al. 2006). Antioxidants stand for a <b>prime</b> <b>line</b> of protection in opposition to the reactive oxygen species and free radicals. Plants hold a group of phenolic compounds that have the potential to scavenge free radicals and thus act as natural antioxidants. Herbal medicines that have antioxidant potential are being used worldwide for the treatment of various diseases. Medicinal plants are being focused for the extraction of natural antioxidants that can replace synthetic additives because of the toxicological risks associated with synthetic antioxidants (El-Haci et al. 2013; Drummen et al. 2004).|$|R

40|$|Subjects made speeded object {{decisions}} about target line drawings which were preceded by semantically related or unrelated <b>prime</b> <b>line</b> drawings. One hundred of the targets depicted real objects and 50 others were unrecognizable non-objects. Similar {{to a recent}} picture-matching study, the ERPs from this study generated a larger negativity for unrelated than for related target pictures, be-tween 325 and 550 msec (N 400). Although these differences had a similar time course to those seen for the N 400 component in semantic priming lexical decision tasks, they were more frontally distributed and were larger over the left rather than the right hemisphere. Non-objects, which were the picture equivalent of pseudowords, produced an even larger negativity with a somewhat different distribution.

25|$|In South Australia, the Australian Democrats {{negotiated}} a crucial preference swap with Family First that prevented the Greens winning the final vacancy. If the Democrats had polled better, {{they would have}} collected Family First and Liberal preferences and won the final vacancy. Former Democrat Leader Meg Lees also contested the Senate in South Australia, but was eliminated late in the count. However, Lees did have some impact on the outcome, as there were large numbers of below the <b>line</b> <b>preferences</b> for both the Progressive Alliance (as well as One Nation) which were widely spread rather than flowing to the Democrats. When the Democrats were excluded, preferences flowed to Family First which prevented the Greens' Brian Noone passing the third Labor candidate. This resulted in a seat that could otherwise have been won by the Greens instead being won by Labor on Green preferences. The flow of One Nation preferences to Labor {{made it impossible for}} either Family First or the Liberal Party to win the final vacancy. Labor's Dana Wortley was elected to the final vacancy. The end result in South Australia was split 3 Liberal, 3 Labor.|$|R
