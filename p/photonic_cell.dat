40|$|The {{possibility}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of solar cells by a restriction of the maximal angle of emission has been proposed for several times. Typically, this is achieved by applying a directionally selective filter on top of the solar cell. This filter leads to a reflection of emitted light under certain angles back into the cell, where it then can be reabsorbed. A system where the emission process itself is inhibited for certain angles (<b>photonic</b> solar <b>cell)</b> is in principle a better system, because then optical losses in the system can be suppressed as the emission in fact does not take place. In this contribution, we focus on a <b>photonic</b> solar <b>cell,</b> where the cell and the filter are combined in one single optoelectronic device. This means that the solar cell itself has a photonic structure or is implemented into a photonic crystal. The interesting question is how such a device could look like and how it performs. Here, design concepts for <b>photonic</b> solar <b>cells</b> are shown and simulated optically. An interesting system could be an integration of a solar cell as defect layer into a thin film stack. To get an idea of the potential of such systems, the emission out of a <b>photonic</b> solar <b>cell</b> has to be compared to the emission out of a standard solar cell. To this end, a scattering-matrix-formalism is used. First estimations of the possible system efficiencies are given as indication of the system quality...|$|R

We show that, theoretically, for an optimal design enhancement factors of up to 60 are possible in the region of slow light. However, the overall transmission of bulk photonic crystals, and thus the performance of the device, i s limited by fluctuations of the pore diameter.

40|$|Restricting {{the angular}} {{emission}} {{characteristics of a}} solar cell results in a reduction of entropy generation and allows for higher solar cell efficiencies. In this paper, we present {{the concept of a}} <b>photonic</b> solar <b>cell</b> which exhibits the combination of a solar <b>cell</b> and a <b>photonic</b> crystal. The basic idea is to structure a solar cell {{in such a way that}} the applied structure is a photonic crystal consisting of the solar cell material. The aim of having a solar cell in the form of a photonic crystal is to restrict the emission of the solar cell into certain angles This reduction reduces the radiative losses and results in a higher VOC and, consequently, a higher efficiency of the cell. To calculate the efficiency of a <b>photonic</b> solar <b>cell</b> we introduce an adaptation of the detailed balance approach. This adaptation takes into account the reduced radiative losses due to the presence of a photonic band structure. In the second part of the paper we use this approach to calculat e the efficiency for an exemplary system. The exemplary system is an idealized edge filter, similar to a Bragg stack. The idealization concerns the reflection characteristic of this filter and its dependence on the polarization.

Reconfigurable architectures need fast, accurate and robust {{procedures for the}} tuning and stabilization of their working point, counteracting temperature drifts originated by environmental fluctuations and mutual thermal crosstalk from surrounding integrated devices. In this contribution, we report on our recent achievements on the automated tuning, control and stabilization of silicon photonics architectures. The proposed control strategy exploits transparent integrated detectors to monitor non-invasively the light propagating in the silicon waveguides in key spots of the circuit. Local monitoring enables the partitioning of complex architectures in small <b>photonic</b> <b>cells</b> {{that can be easily}} tuned and controlled, with need for neither preliminary circuit calibration nor global optimization algorithms. The ability to monitor the Quality Of of Transmission (QoT) of the optical paths in Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) is also demonstrated with the use of channel labelling and non-invasive light monitoring. Several examples of applications are presented that include the automatic reconfiguration and feedback controlled stabilization of an 8 Ã 9 ̆ 78 switch fabric based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and the realization of a wavelength locking platform enabling feedback-control of silicon microring resonators (MRRs) for the realization of a 4 Ã 9 ̆ 710 Gbit/s wavelength-division-multiplexing transmitter.

We are developing high-throughput tools for studying bacteria one cell at a time, allowing us to unravel the complicated dynamics of population, gene expression, and metabolic function in mixed microbial communities. Three microfluidic technologies have been developed to enable these studies: (1) automated 16 S rRNA FISH for identification of microbial cells in a mixed sample, (2) <b>photonic</b> force <b>cell</b> sorting for selectively isolating a species of interest (3) encapsulation of individual cells in picoliter-volume droplets, followed by genetic analysis. These three technologies can be coupled to one another, allowing, e. g. FISH-based identification of a rare species, followed enrichment of the rare species of interest by <b>photonic</b> force <b>cell</b> sorted, followed by single-cell encapsulation and PCR analysis. The droplet technology in particular allows us to scale down conventional (microliter-volume) assays, such as PCR, into much smaller reaction volumes better suited to the size of an individual microbe. By dramatically reducing the reaction volume, the effective concentration of template is increased, reducing amplification artifacts that often arise in single-cell reactions carried out at a conventional scale. Droplets can be generated rapidly (hundreds per second), with very good uniformity in size (< 5 percent variation in droplet diameter), allowing high throughput experiments to be conducted with much better precision than is possible with conventional emulsion techniques. These technologies are currently under development with simple laboratory strains of E. coli and other well-characterized organisms such as D.

30|$|Due to the {{abundance}} and a nonpoisonous feature, Si-based solar cells are still dominating the photovoltaic market. As silicon {{is a kind}} of an indirect band gap material, the light absorption of Si is poor. In order to meet the requirement of light harvesting, the thickness of Si active layer should be no less than 100  μm. What is more, costly processes, such as purification and crystallization, must be implemented to ensure the efficient collection of photon-generated carriers. As a result, the cost of bulk of Si solar cells is high, which hinders the commercialization of Si solar cells. To overcome this problem, thin-film solar cells have been proposed, which not only reduces the cost of Si solar cells but also improves the collection of carriers because of the reduced diffusion length [1]. However, the reduction of the thickness of Si solar cells leads to poor absorption of the longer wavelengths (near the band gap) [2]. The absorption length of ζ grows rapidly as the wavelength increases [3], which exceeds 2  μm at a wavelength of 700  nm and reaches 5  μm at a wavelength of 800  nm. The absorption length of light in longer wavelengths exceeds the thickness of the thin-film Si, which leads to the poor absorption. In order to solve this issue, recently, lots of light-trapping structures, including randomly structured surfaces [4, 5], periodic gratings [6 - 8], photonic crystals [9], plasmonic structures [10 - 13], Si nanowire arrays (SiNWs) [14 - 16], and Si nanocone arrays(SiNCs) [17, 18] have been proposed and investigated widely. The SiNWs layer can reduce the reflection efficiently because it can serve as a buffer layer to diminish the refractive index mismatch between the air and the Si wafer [16]. The SiNCs can further reduce the reflection because the refractive index changes gradually from the top {{to the bottom of the}} SiNCs [17]. Similarly, nanodome arrays [19] have also been investigated by using the same strategy to reduce the reflection. Kuo and Hsieh [20] have proposed a novel way to optimize the shape of ZnO nanocone arrays (NCs) located at the front surface of CZTS solar cells. By changing the parameter of ‘order of taper (OT),’ the shape of the NCs could be changed for optimizing the performance of the solar <b>cell.</b> The dual <b>photonic</b> crystal-based solar <b>cells</b> can trap the incident light by diffraction, the Bloch modes coupling, the excitation of SPRs, and multiple scattering effects [21 - 23]. Thus, the dual <b>photonic</b> crystal <b>cells</b> have great potentials in the field of light harvesting. However, the influences of the shapes and the heights of the top NCs and bottom NCs on the light-trapping performance have not been investigated and discussed systematically.|$|R
