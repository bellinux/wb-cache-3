40|$|<b>Polaprezinc,</b> a chelate {{compound}} consisting of zinc and l-carnosine, is clinically {{used as a}} medicine for gastric ulcers. It {{has been shown that}} induction of heat shock protein (HSP) is involved in protective effects of <b>polaprezinc</b> against gastric mucosal injury. In the present study, we investigated whether <b>polaprezinc</b> and its components could induce HSP 70 and prevent acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity in mouse primary cultured hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were treated with <b>polaprezinc,</b> zinc sulfate or l-carnosine at the concentration of 100  µM for 9  h, and then exposed to 10  mM APAP. <b>Polaprezinc</b> or zinc sulfate increased cellular HSP 70 expression. However, l-carnosine had no influence on it. Pretreatment of the cells with <b>polaprezinc</b> or zinc sulfate significantly suppressed cell death as well as cellular lipid peroxidation after APAP treatment. In contrast, pretreatment with <b>polaprezinc</b> did not affect decrease in intracellular glutathione after APAP. Furthermore, treatment with KNK 437, an HSP inhibitor, attenuated increase in HSP 70 expression induced by <b>polaprezinc,</b> and abolished protective effect of <b>polaprezinc</b> on cell death after APAP. These results suggested that <b>polaprezinc,</b> in particular its zinc component, induces HSP 70 expression in mouse primary cultured hepatocytes, and inhibits lipid peroxidation after APAP treatment, resulting in protection against APAP toxicity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Polaprezinc,</b> an anti-ulcer drug, is a chelate {{compound}} consisting of zinc and L-carnosine. <b>Polaprezinc</b> {{has been shown}} to prevent gastric mucosal injury. The anti ulcer effects of <b>polaprezinc</b> have been ascribed to its antioxidative property. The effect of <b>polaprezinc</b> on ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis was studied in the jejunal epithelial crypt cells of rats. Seven-to eight week-old Wistar rats, which were treated with 100 mg/kg of <b>polaprezinc</b> orally 1 h before irradiation or 2 % carboxymethyl cellulose sodium in controls, were exposed to whole body X-ray irradiation at 2 Gy. The number of apoptotic cells per jejunum crypt was counted in haematoxylin and eosin stained sections at 0 - 6 h after irradiation. TUNEL positive cells and immunopositive cells for active caspase- 3 per crypt were also counted. Accumulation of p 53, p 21 ^ and Bax expression in the jejunum after irradiation were examined by Western blot analyses. <b>Polaprezinc</b> treatment given prior to radiation resulted in a significant reduction in numbers of apoptotic cells, TUNEL positive cells and active caspase- 3 immunopositive cells in jejunal crypt cells. <b>Polaprezinc</b> treatment resulted in decreases of p 53 accumulation, p 21 ^ and Bax expression after irradiation. <b>Polaprezinc</b> has a protective effect against ionizing radiation induced apoptosis in rat jejunal crypt cells...|$|E
40|$|Aims : The {{purposes}} of this study were to compare the efTects of <b>polaprezinc</b> and zinc chloride on serum zinc and copper concentrations in elderly bedridden patients receiving enteral nutrition, and to examine the efTects of <b>polaprezinc</b> on pressure ulcer healing in those patients. Methods : Seven elderly bedridden patients receiving enteral nutrition entered into a crossover study of 2 -week treatment periods with <b>polaprezinc</b> or zinc chloride, separated by a 4 week washout period. Serum zinc and copper concentra- tions were compared between both treatment periods. Then, another five elderly patients with pressure ulcers were treated with <b>polaprezinc</b> for 8 weeks. The assessment of pressure ulcers was made weekly using the PUSH tool 3. 0. Results: After 2 weeks, <b>polaprezinc</b> significantly increased serum zinc concentrations, decreased serum copper/zinc ratios, but did not change serum copper concentrations. Zinc chloride did not change these three parameters. <b>Polaprezinc</b> also produced a significant improve- ment in PUSH score and a reduction of 81 96 in ulcer area after 8 weeks. Conclusion: The efficiency of absorption of zinc from <b>polaprezinc</b> may be much higher than that from zinc chloride in elderly bedridden patients receiving enteral nutrition. <b>Polaprezinc</b> may also have a beneficial efTect on pressure ulcer healing in those patients...|$|E
40|$|Paclitaxel, an anticancer drug, {{frequently}} causes painful peripheral neuropathy. In this study, {{we investigated}} the preventive effect of <b>polaprezinc</b> on paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats. <b>Polaprezinc</b> (3  mg/kg, p. o., once daily) inhibited {{the development of}} mechanical allodynia induced by paclitaxel (4  mg/kg, i. p., on days 1, 3, 5 and 7) and suppressed the paclitaxel-induced increase in macrophage migration in dorsal root ganglion cells. In addition, <b>polaprezinc</b> {{did not affect the}} anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel in cultured cell lines or tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest a clinical indication for <b>polaprezinc</b> in the prevention of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy...|$|E
40|$|We treated {{patients}} with C-viral chronic hepatitis (CH) and liver cirrhosis (LC) with <b>polaprezinc</b> and determined prospectively {{the effect on}} long-term outcome. 62 patients were enrolled. Of these, 32 were administered 1. 0  g <b>polaprezinc</b> and the remainder were not administered <b>polaprezinc.</b> We measured the serum zinc concentrations using conventional atomic absorption spectrometry and conducted a prospective study to determine the long-term outcome of the <b>polaprezinc</b> therapy. Changes of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the <b>polaprezinc</b> administration group were significantly {{lower than those of}} the untreated group. The decrease in platelet count was clearly less than that of the untreated group. The factors that inhibited increases in serum zinc concentrations following administration of <b>polaprezinc</b> included low serum zinc concentration states. Furthermore, the reductions of AST and ALT levels in the low zinc group were significantly greater than those of the high zinc group. When the patients who were administered <b>polaprezinc</b> were divided into two groups whose zinc concentrations increased (zinc responders) or remained stable or decreased (zinc non-responders), the zinc responders had a clearly lower cumulative incidence of HCC than the zinc non-responders. We conclude zinc supplementation improved the long-term outcome in C-viral CH and LC patients...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} the specific binding proteins of Zinc-L-carnosine (<b>Polaprezinc)</b> using Polaprezinc-affinity column chromatography in vitro. A protein having a 70 -kDa molecular mass was eluted by the linear gradient of 01. 0 mM <b>Polaprezinc</b> from the affinity column and the protein was identified as the molecular chaperone HSP 70 by immunoblotting. The chaperone activity of HSP 70 was completely suppressed by <b>Polaprezinc.</b> The ATPase ac-tivity of HSP 70 was affected to some extent by the reagent. In the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum, the secondary structure of HSP 70 was changed in the pres-ence of <b>Polaprezinc,</b> i. e. it decreased in the a-helix. We have determined the Polaprezinc-binding domain of HSP 70 by using recombinant HSP 70 N- and C-domains. Although <b>Polaprezinc</b> could bind to both the N-terminal and the C-terminal of HSP 70, the HSP 70 N-domain has a high affinity to the drug. Regarding the peptide cleavage of the HSP 70 N- and C-domains with proteinase K, the intact HSP 70 N still remained {{in the presence of}} <b>Polaprezinc.</b> On the other hand, the quantity of the intact C-domain slightly decreased under the same conditions along with the newly digested small peptides appeared. It has been suggested that <b>Polaprezinc</b> binds to HSP 70 especially in the N-domains, suppresses the chaperone activity and delays an ATPase activities of HSP 70...|$|E
40|$|Cav 3. 2 T-type Ca 2 + {{channels}} {{targeted by}} H 2 S, a gasotransmitter, participate in cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis and bladder pain. Given that zinc selectively inhibits Cav 3. 2 among T-channel isoforms and also exhibits antioxidant activity, we examined whether <b>polaprezinc</b> (zinc-l-carnosine), a medicine for peptic ulcer treatment and zinc supplementation, reveals preventive or therapeutic effects on bladder inflammation and/or {{pain in the}} mouse with cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, a model for interstitial cystitis. Systemic administration of cyclophosphamide caused cystitis-related symptoms including increased bladder weight and vascular permeability, and histological signs of bladder edema, accompanied by bladder pain-like nociceptive behavior/referred hyperalgesia. All these symptoms were significantly attenuated by oral preadministration of <b>polaprezinc</b> at 400  mg/kg. The same dose of <b>polaprezinc</b> also prevented the increased malondialdehyde level, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, and protein upregulation of cystathionine-γ-lyase, an H 2 S-generating enzyme, but not occludin, a tight junction-related membrane protein, in the bladder tissue of cyclophosphamide-treated mice. Oral posttreatment with <b>polaprezinc</b> at 30 – 100  mg/kg reversed the nociceptive behavior/referred hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the increased bladder weight. Together, our data show that zinc supplementation with <b>polaprezinc</b> prevents the cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis probably through the antioxidant activity, and, like T-channel blockers, reverses the established cystitis-related bladder pain in mice, suggesting novel therapeutic usefulness of <b>polaprezinc...</b>|$|E
40|$|Protection of {{the small}} {{intestine}} from mucosal injury induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including acetylsalicylic acid is a critical issue {{in the field of}} gastroenterology. <b>Polaprezinc</b> an anti-ulcer drug, consisting of zinc and L-carnosine, provides gastric mucosal protection against various irritants. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of <b>polaprezinc</b> on acetylsalicylic acid-induced apoptosis of the RIE 1 rat intestinal epithelial cell line. Confluent rat intestinal epithelial cells were incubated with 70  µM <b>polaprezinc</b> for 24  h, and then stimulated with or without 15  mM acetylsalicylic acid for a further 15  h. Subsequent cellular viability was quantified by fluorometric assay based on cell lysis and staining. Acetylsalicylic acid-induced cell death was also qualified by fluorescent microscopy of Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide. Heat shock proteins 70 protein expression after adding <b>polaprezinc</b> or acetylsalicylic acid was assessed by western blotting. To investigate the role of Heat shock protein 70, Heat shock protein 70 -specific small interfering RNA was applied. Cell viability was quantified by fluorometric assay based on cell lysis and staining and apoptosis was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We found that acetylsalicylic acid significantly induced apoptosis of rat intestinal epithelial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. <b>Polaprezinc</b> significantly suppressed acetylsalicylic acid-induced apoptosis of rat intestinal epithelial cells at its late phase. At the same time, <b>polaprezinc</b> increased Heat shock protein 70 expressions of rat intestinal epithelial cells in a time-dependent manner. However, in Heat shock protein 70 -silenced rat intestinal epithelial cells, <b>polaprezinc</b> could not suppress acetylsalicylic acid -induced apoptosis at its late phase. We conclude that polaprezinc-increased Heat shock protein 70 expression might be an important mechanism by which <b>polaprezinc</b> suppresses acetylsalicylic acid-induced small intestinal apoptosis, a hallmark of acetylsalicylic acid-induced enteropathy...|$|E
40|$|AuthorAims: Cirrhotic {{patients}} commonly have a liver zinc deficiency, {{which may}} aggravate liver fibrosis {{due to the}} lack of antioxidative effects of zinc. This study examined the ability of <b>polaprezinc,</b> N-(3 -aminopropionyl) -Lhistidinato zinc, to prevent fibrosis in a rat model of thioacetamide (TAA) -induced hepatic fibrosis. Main methods: Liver cirrhosis was induced by orally administering TAA for 20 weeks. The rats were cotreated with one of the following for the last 10 weeks of TAA treatment: (1) <b>polaprezinc</b> (50 or 200 mg/kg/day); (2) L-carnosine (155 mg/kg/day),which contained equal amounts of L-carnosine as 200 mg/kg/day polaprezinc; (3) zinc sulfate (112 mg/kg/day) or (4) zinc-L-aspartic complex (317. 8 mg/kg/day). Both zinc supplementations contained equal amounts of zinc as high-dose <b>polaprezinc.</b> Key findings: Hepatic zinc levels fell significantly in rats treated with TAA for 20 weeks. Cotreating with high-dose <b>polaprezinc</b> and zinc-L-aspartic complex for 10 weeks prevented hepatic zinc loss. Hepatic hydroxyproline and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 1 (TIMP- 1) were significantly higher in rats treated with TAA for 20 weeks than 10 weeks, whereas <b>polaprezinc</b> prevented changes in these fibrosis markers and reduced hepatic transforming growth factor-β 1 protein concentration, macroscopic and histologic changes. TAA caused oxidative stress-related changes in the liver that were prevented by high-dose <b>polaprezinc</b> and partially by zinc-L-aspartic complex. Treatment with L-carnosine, low-dose <b>polaprezinc</b> or zinc sulfate for 10 weeks did not affect liver fibrosis progression or oxidative stress-related changes. Significance: Polaprezincmay prevent ongoing fibrosis by preventing zinc depletion, oxidative stress and fibrosis markers in cirrhotic livers...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{hemodialysis}} (HD) patients, zinc depletion {{caused by}} inadequate intake, malabsorption, and removal by HD treatment leads to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) hyporesponsiveness. This {{study investigated the}} effects of zinc supplementation in HD patients with zinc deficiency on changes in the erythropoietin responsiveness index (ERI). Methods: Patients on HD with low serum zinc levels (< 65 μg/dL) {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups: The <b>polaprezinc</b> group (who received daily <b>polaprezinc,</b> containing 34 mg/day of zinc) (n = 35) and the control group (no supplementation) (n = 35) for 12 months. All the 70 patients had been taking epoetin alpha as treatment for renal anemia. ERI was measured with the following equation: Weekly ESA dose (units) /dry weight (kg) /hemoglobin (g/dL). Results: There were no significant changes in hemoglobin levels within groups or between the control and <b>polaprezinc</b> groups during the study period. Although reticulocyte counts were increased immediately after zinc supplementation, this change was transient. Serum zinc levels were significantly increased and serum copper levels were significantly decreased in the <b>polaprezinc</b> group after three months; this persisted throughout the study period. Although there was no significant change in the serum iron or transferrin saturation levels in the <b>polaprezinc</b> group during the study period, serum ferritin levels significantly decreased following <b>polaprezinc</b> treatment. Further, in the <b>polaprezinc</b> group, ESA dosage and ERI were significantly decreased at 10 months and nine months, respectively, as compared with the baseline value. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that the change in the serum zinc level was an independent predictor of lowered ERI. Conclusions: Zinc supplementation reduces ERI in patients undergoing HD and may be a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with renal anemia and low serum zinc levels...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>polaprezinc</b> combined with triple therapy was compared with triple therapy alone in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. A randomized, parallel-group, open-label, controlled, prospective multicenter {{study was conducted in}} 11 cities in China. Treatment-naive patients with H. pylori-associated gastritis were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three arms for a 14 -day treatment: Arm A triple therapy (omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, each twice daily) plus <b>polaprezinc</b> 75 mg twice daily; Arm B triple therapy plus <b>polaprezinc</b> 150 mg twice daily, or Arm C triple therapy alone. The rate of H. pylori eradication was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were symptom improvement and lower incidence of adverse events. 303 patients completed the study- 106, 96, and 101 patients in Arms A, B, and C, respectively. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that the rate of H. pylori eradication was significantly higher for Arms A (77. 0 %) and B (75. 9 %) compared to Arm C (58. 6 %) (P < 0. 01), whereas there was no difference between Arms A and B (P = 0. 90). Per-protocol (PP) analysis showed that the rate of H. pylori eradication was significantly higher for Arms A (81. 1 %) and B (83. 3 %) compared to Arm C (61. 4 %) (P < 0. 01), whereas there was no significant difference between Arms A and B (P = 0. 62). All three groups reported significant symptom improvement at 7, 14, and 28 days after treatment, compared to baseline (P < 0. 0001). The adverse event rate for Arm B (5. 1 %) was higher than for Arms A (2. 8 %) (P = 0. 04) and C (1. 9 %) (P = 0. 02). There were no serious adverse events in any group.

This study focused on patients with genotype 2, which is more sensitive to interferon than genotype 1 b, and used consensus interferon (CIFN) with or without zinc. METHODS: We randomized 83 patients with chronic hepatitis C to CIFN at 18 MIU six times/wk for 4 wk, followed by CIFN at 18 MIU six times/wk for another 20 wk, in combination with <b>polaprezinc</b> 300 mg (regimen A, n = 41) or as monotherapy (regimen B, n = 42). Thirty-one patients in regimen A and 33 patients in regimen B completed the clinical trial; the remaining patients withdrew because of side effects or a transfer to another hospital. RESULTS: Sustained biochemical response, defi ned as a normal aminotransferase level {{at the end of the}} 6 -mo post-treatment observation, was 68 % and 69 %, and sustained virological response, defi ned as undetectable HCV-RNA at the end of the 6 -mo post-treatment observation, was 54 % and 67 % for regimens A and B, respectively. CONCLUSION: CIFN treatment combined with zinc did not enhance the effect of CIFN as shown by biochemical, virological criteria.

40|$|<b>Polaprezinc</b> (PZ), a chelate {{compound}} consisting of zinc and l-carnosine (Car), is an anti-ulcer drug developed in Japan. In the present study, we investigated whether PZ suppresses mortality, pulmonary inflammation, and plasma nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α levels in endotoxin shock mice after peritoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and how PZ protects against LPS-induced endotoxin shock. PZ pretreatment inhibited {{the decrease in}} the survival rate of mice after LPS injection. PZ inhibited the increases in plasma NO as well as TNF-α after LPS. Compatibly, PZ suppressed LPS-induced inducible NO synthase mRNA transcription in the mouse lungs. PZ also improved LPS-induced lung injury. However, PZ did not enhance the induction of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 in the mouse lungs after LPS. Pretreatment of RAW 264 cells with PZ suppressed the production of NO and TNF-α after LPS addition. This inhibition likely resulted from the inhibitory effect of PZ on LPS-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. Zinc sulfate, but not Car, suppressed NO production after LPS. These results indicate that PZ, in particular its zinc subcomponent, inhibits LPS-induced endotoxin shock via the inhibition of NF-κB activation and subsequent induction of proinflammatory products such as NO and TNF-α, but not HSP induction...|$|E
40|$|Zinc {{is often}} {{deficient}} {{in patients with}} liver cirrhosis, and treatment with zinc provides short-term improvement in protein metabolism. However, {{the long-term effects of}} zinc have not been fully clarified. The present study aimed to analyze the effect of zinc on the long-term clinical course, especially hepatocarcinogenesis, in type C liver cirrhosis. Am- ong patients with type C liver cirrhosis visiting our hospital between June 1998 and January 2009, th- ose with a serum albumin level ≤ 3. 5 g/dL and a serum zinc level ≤ 70 μg (1. 07 μmol) /dL were selected. Thirty-seven patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: group B (12 g/day branched-chain amino acid granules) and group BZ (same as group B plus 100 mg/day - 600 mg/day zinc sulfate or 150 mg/day - 225 mg/day <b>polaprezinc).</b> Multivariate analysis revealed that the administration of zinc was not a significant determinant, but pretreatment serum zinc levels (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 921; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 853 – 0. 994) and serum zinc levels less than 80 μg (1. 22 μmol) /dL 12 months after beginning this study (HR, 6. 866; 95 % CI, 1. 399 - 33. 707) were significant determinants of carcinogenesis and death. Serum albumin levels in patients whose serum zinc levels had not increased up to 80 μg/dL by the third year of this study were significantly lower (p = 0. 023) than those of patients that had increased up to 80 μg/dL. Conclusions: In type C liver cirrhosis with zinc deficiency, administration of zinc does not improve cancer-free survival.
