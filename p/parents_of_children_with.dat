40|$|Background: Coping in {{parents with}} a higher stress level has been a {{neglected}} research topic so far. Method. Multivariate analyses of variance are computed to compare stress and coping between three groups <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> (N = 150) of a 6 - to 14 -year-old <b>child</b> (43 couples <b>of</b> a normally developed <b>child,</b> 53 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome and 54 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> externalizing behavior problems). Results: <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome reported more family related stress and stress with regard to social isolation, but reported also the highest scores <b>of</b> dyadic coping. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> externalizing behavior problems perceived more parenting stress, psychological distress {{and a lack of}} dyadic coping. Conclusion: Dyadic coping reveals to be an important issue in parent's coping with daily hassles...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Harmful {{nature of}} {{epilepsy}} {{can affect the}} patient and their parent. Stigma, arising from it, affects the patient and their family. To relieve it understanding the experiences <b>of</b> the <b>parent</b> are useful. This study was aimed at understanding the experiences <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy in Iran. Methods: In this interpretative phenomenological study, 10 parents who took care <b>of</b> their <b>child</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy were participated. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews. After transcription, {{data were analyzed using}} Van Manen’s method. Results: Family stigma emerged as a main theme in data analysis with three subthemes including becoming verbally abusive, a dull and heavy shadowed look, and associates interference. Conclusion: Family stigma is a major challenge for <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy need to special attention by health system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the attitudes <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> and {{teachers}} to the use of pharmacological management or intervention for the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ADHD in the classroom. Particular focus was placed on differences in attitude toward the use of stimulants, for the management of emotional/behavioural, cognitive/academic, social and classroom organizational behaviours <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ADHD. Thirty female Western Australian primary school teachers and 90 female parents participated in the present investigation. Participants included: (a) <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> non-medicated <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ADHD, (b) <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> medicated <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ADHD, (c) teachers in regular primary schools, and (d) <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> non-affected <b>children.</b> These participants were given an attitude questionnaire to determine their attitudes towards the use <b>of</b> stimulant medications <b>with</b> <b>children</b> who have ADHD. Teachers held significantly less positive attitudes toward the pharmacological management <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ADHD, than did the <b>parents</b> surveyed. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> medicated <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ADHD were significantly more positive in their attitudes towards pharmacological management, than were <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> non-medicated <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ADHD. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> medically diagnosed <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ADHD, collectively held significantly more positive attitudes toward pharmacological management for these <b>children,</b> than <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> non-affected <b>children.</b> Findings are discussed in relation to previous research, which suggests that differences in attitudes may be related to a respondent 2 ̆ 7 s current knowledge and experiences with pharmacological management for children who have ADHD.

25|$|Improving the {{surrounding}} {{home and school}} environment can improve the behavior of children with ADHD. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ADHD often show similar deficits themselves, and thus {{may not be able}} to sufficiently help the child with his or her difficulties. Improving the parents' understanding of the child's behavior and teaching them strategies to improve functioning and communication and discourage unwanted behavior has measurable effect on the children with ADHD. The different educational interventions for the parents are jointly called Parent Management Training. Techniques include operant conditioning: a consistent application of rewards for meeting goals and good behavior (positive reinforcement) and punishments such as time-outs or revocation of privileges for failing to meet goals or poor behavior. Classroom management is similar to parent management training; educators learn about ADHD and techniques to improve behavior applied to a classroom setting. Strategies utilized include increased structuring of classroom activities, daily feedback, and token economy.|$|E
500|$|Some autistic {{people have}} {{advocated}} {{a shift in}} perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex syndromes rather than diseases that must be cured.

[...] Impairment in social interaction is sometimes not in evidence until a child attains an age at which these behaviors become important; social disabilities are often first noticed when children encounter peers in daycare or preschool. [...] Diagnosis is most commonly made between the ages of four and eleven, and one study suggests that diagnosis cannot be rendered reliably before age four.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} on parental caregivers has {{focused primarily on}} caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, rather than focusing specifically on <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>children</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most {{research on}} ASD has centered on <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> young <b>children</b> <b>with</b> this diagnosis, but not on <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD. Understanding the experiences <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> caring for adult <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD is important given {{the increase in the}} prevalence of individuals with ASD and the lack <b>of</b> information regarding <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD. A nonexperimental, quantitative, correlational design was used to examine effects of caring for an adult <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD on parents’ quality of life (QOL; n= 320). To be included in the sample, participants had to be at least 50 years of age and have an adult <b>child</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> ASD. Participants completed a web-based survey, including a demographic questionnaire and five measures examining burden, financial impact, health, and formal and informal social support. In addition to the online portion, 51 parents also participated in an individual interview focused on their experiences of caring for an adult <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD. Overall, the findings emphasized the negative relationship between burdens that parents experience and their QOL. Social workers can use these findings to develop services, service delivery models, and interventions that acknowledge the needs (including burdens, QOL), realities, and experiences <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD. The growth in the prevalence of individuals affected by ASD is expected to add to casework for social workers, who are expected to play an increasingly important role in assisting parents who may feel overwhelmed by their continued responsibility for their adult children. As these parents age, their lives will continue to be affected by their efforts to support their adult <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD. To deliver services effectively, social workers need to understand the reality of the lives <b>of</b> both <b>parents</b> and adult <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD, as well as understanding the QOL and caregiver burden with which the parents are living...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess {{information}} needs and information seeking behaviour <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> and caregivers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> mental illness at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) in Tanzania. The study mainly assessed the information needs <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> and caregivers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> mental illness, their preferable sources of health information, and their constraints on information seeking. Design/methodology/approach - A case study research design was used in this study, where 168 structured questionnaires were distributed to <b>parents</b> and caregivers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> mental illness at the Neurological Pediatrics Outpatient Clinic (NPOC) of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical centre (KCMC). The rate of response was 89. 3 %. Findings - The study found that health information needs <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> and caregivers were mainly associated with health care (for example, nutrition, treatment), and health education. <b>Parents</b> and caregivers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> mental illness used the internet as the main source of information about their children's health, which was followed by printed books and television. Health information seeking behaviour appeared similar across gender categories, but there were differences on the use of print and electronic information sources according to age and level of education. The main factors that hindered access to health information included low level of education, lack of funds and health information illiteracy. Practical implications - The paper provides practical suggestions that would facilitate information seeking and use among <b>parents</b> and caregivers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> mental illness in Tanzania and other countries with similar conditions. Originality/value - Previous studies on the topic are scanty and, therefore, the paper provides important insights into the information needs and information seeking behaviour <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> and caregivers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> mental illness in a developing country setting...|$|R
