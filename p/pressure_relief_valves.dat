The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure, which was not sufficient to fight the fire. It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust the valves arrived at the scene.|$|E
2500|$|These were {{specifically}} {{made for}} the Photo-Reconnaissance Spitfires, including the PR Mk X and XI; no armament was fitted and the [...] "D" [...] shaped leading edges of the wings, ahead of the main spar, were converted into integral fuel tanks, each carrying 66 gallons. To avoid the expansion of fuel in hot weather damaging the wing, <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves,</b> incorporating small external vent pipes, were fitted near the wing tips.|$|E
2500|$|In {{commercial}} laser systems, hazard mitigations such as {{the presence}} of fusible plugs, thermal interrupters, and <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> reduce the hazard of, for example, a steam explosion arising from an obstructed water cooling jacket. [...] Interlocks, shutters, and warning lights are often critical elements of modern commercial installations. [...] In older lasers, experimental and hobby systems, and those removed from other equipment (OEM units) special care must be taken to anticipate and reduce the consequences of misuse as well as various failure modes.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with most}} technologies, {{compressed}} air has safety concerns, mainly catastrophic tank rupture. Safety regulations {{make this a}} rare occurrence {{at the cost of}} higher weight and additional safety features such as <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves.</b> Regulations may limit the legal working pressure to less than 40% of the rupture pressure for steel bottles (safety factor of 2.5), and less than 20% for fiber-wound bottles (safety factor of 5). [...] Commercial designs adopt the ISO 11439 standard. High pressure bottles are fairly strong so that they generally do not rupture in vehicle crashes.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Bramah, an {{inventor}} and locksmith living in London, registered a patent at the London Patent Office on 29 April 1812, which was principally about a provision {{of a public}} water supply network, but included a secondary concept {{for the provision of}} a high-pressure water main, which would enable workshops to operate machinery. The high-pressure water would be applied [...] "to a variety of other useful purposes, to which the same has never before been so applied." [...] Major components of the system were a ring main, into which a number of pumping stations would pump the water, with pressure being regulated by several air vessels or loaded pistons. <b>Pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> would protect the system, which he believed could deliver water at a pressure of [...] "a great plurality of atmospheres", and in concept, this was how later hydraulic power systems worked.|$|E
2500|$|The P {{class had}} a more {{streamlined}} hull shape than previous Zeppelins, with only 60m (197ft) of the 163.5m [...] (536 5in) overall length being parallel sided. [...] Power was initially provided by four [...] Maybach CX six cylinder engines. Later examples were fitted with four [...] Maybach HSLu engines. [...] The [...] framework was divided into sixteen 10m (32ft 9in) bays, with an intermediate frame between each of the principal wire-braced ring frames to reduce lateral loads on the triangular section longitudinal girders, of which there were 17, the uppermost of which was doubled to form a W-section girder. [...] The 16 gasbags were usually made from three layers of goldbeater's skin on a cotton backing, but shortages meant that sometimes heavier rubberised cotton was used instead. [...] Automatic <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> were placed {{at the bottom of}} the gasbags: there was no trunking to carry vented hydrogen to the top of the craft and waste gas simply diffused upwards in the space between gasbags and the covering, whose top surface was left undoped to allow the hydrogen to escape. [...] Some gasbags were also fitted with a manually operated manoeuvering valve at the top. [...] The ship was controlled from the forward gondola, which was divided into two structurally separate sections in order to avoid transmission of engine vibration to the crew accommodation: the small gap between the two sections was faired over with fabric. [...] The forward section was divided into three compartments, with the control area at the front; aft of this was the radio compartment, and then the officer's rest area, the windows of which had a machine-gun mounting either side. [...] The engine compartment contained a single engine driving a propeller at the rear through a reduction gear. [...] The aft engine gondola carried three engines arranged in line, the aft engine driving a propeller at the back of the gondola and the other two driving a pair of propellers mounted either side of the hull. [...] These were reversible to aid manoeuvering during mooring. [...] As in the forward gondola, a machine-gun mounting was fitted either side. [...] Further defensive armament consisted of a single machine gun in a small cockpit at the stern behind the rudders and a gun position mounting two or three machine guns on top of the hull, which was reached by a ladder from the forward gondola. [...] The bomb load was slung from the keel girders, the bombs being electrically released from the control car.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{function}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is to protect pressure vessels, piping systems, and other equipment from pressures exceeding their design pressure {{by more than a}} fixed predetermined amount. The permissible amount of overpressure is covered by various codes and is a {{function of}} the type of equipment and the conditions causing the overpressure. It is not the purpose of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> to control or regulate the pressure in the vessel or system that the valve protects, and it does not take the place of a control or regulating valve. The aim of safety systems in processing plants is to prevent damage to equipment, avoid injury to personnel and to eliminate any risks of compromising the welfare of the community at large and the environment. Proper sizing, selection, manufacture, assembly, test, installation, and maintenance of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> are critical to obtaining maximum protection...|$|R

50|$|The {{emergency}} <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> in {{the tank}} is called a hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> It is designed to open if the pressure {{in the tank}} is dangerously high, thus releasing some vapour to the atmosphere to reduce the pressure in the tank. The release of a small quantity of vapour reduces the pressure in the tank, which causes some of the liquid in the tank to vaporise to re-establish equilibrium between liquid and vapour. The latent heat of vaporisation causes the tank to cool, which reduces pressure even further.|$|R
