5|$|Lead {{is used in}} {{high voltage}} <b>power</b> <b>cables</b> as {{sheathing}} material to prevent water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as lead is being phased out. Its use in solder for electronics is also being phased out by some countries {{to reduce the amount}} of environmentally hazardous waste.

5|$|On 30 January 1968, Vulcan B.2 XM604 crashed {{following}} {{a loss of}} control during an overshoot at RAF Cottesmore. The rear crew members were killed though both pilots ejected. The captain ejected at a very late stage and only survived because his deploying parachute was snagged by some <b>power</b> <b>cables.</b> The accident was caused by failure of an Olympus 301 LP turbine disc after the aircraft {{had returned to the}} airfield following indications of a bomb-bay overheat.|$|E
5|$|Dibnah {{had watched}} the {{activities}} of steeplejacks throughout his childhood, and witnessed his first chimney felling from his father's allotment near Bolton's greyhound track at Raikes Park. The steeplejacks first removed {{the top of the}} chimney and then created a hole in its base, propped with blocks of wood. They then lit a fire, destroying the supports and causing the chimney to collapse. Unfortunately, on this occasion the chimney fell in the wrong direction, onto the greyhound track's dog kennels, a local cafe and a series of <b>power</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|E

This paper focuses on modeling of <b>power</b> <b>cable</b> joints. A cascaded transmission line model is proposed for 10 kV oil-filled PILC-PILC straight <b>power</b> <b>cable</b> joint in thefrequency range of 300 kHz- 800 MHz. It can be applied to interpret PD signal transmission and reflection behavior in <b>power</b> <b>cable</b> connections. The model is verified by S-parameter measurement...|$|R

This paper adopts wireless technology to design the temperature monitoring system of <b>power</b> <b>cable</b> joint. Monitoring terminal collection temperature data located in each <b>power</b> <b>cable</b> joint collects the measured data in the cable branch boxthrough the near distance micro-consumption electronic wireless technology to data concentrators located at the bottom of the cable branch box, then transmits to the monitoring center through CAN bus network. The system realizes the low cost and on-line reliable monitoring of <b>power</b> <b>cable</b> point temperature of the urban cable branch box...|$|R
50|$|Power beaming of {{electromagnetic}} energy such as microwaves, like a <b>power</b> <b>cable,</b> requires a ground-based power source. However, {{compared to a}} <b>power</b> <b>cable,</b> <b>power</b> beaming carries much less weight penalty as altitude increases. The technology has been demonstrated on small models but awaits practical development.|$|R
5|$|Construction {{started in}} May 1965 and NTNF {{planned to use}} {{as much of the}} mining company Kings Bay's {{facilities}} as they could. NTNF was allowed to use buildings as needed for free. In exchange, NTNF maintained the entire village and paid insurance on the buildings they used. Movable property used by NTNF was bought for a moderate price. NTNF had to build several new buildings in addition to utilities such as <b>power</b> <b>cables</b> and water, sewer and heating pipes. The new pipes had to be installed after the previous pipes, installed in 1956, had been subject to frost burst. Instead of building the pipes in a culvert, they were instead placed in wooded boxes above ground. During the summer of 1965, 65 people were working on construction, although it fell to between 40 and 45 during the winter. The following winter, only five people overwintered.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and <b>power</b> <b>cables,</b> and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, more than 1,000 Electricity Supply Board (ESB) {{personnel}} were deployed to restore power. In some areas, locals worked together to provide others with fresh food after electricity was lost. Fire brigades were sent on patrol to quell any looting. In Galway, ESB repair crews worked through labor and supply shortages to restore power and telephone service despite recent strikes in the company. By September 23, officials in the city appealed to the Government for funding to deal with the aftermath of the hurricane. Uncertainty over whether some of the cost could be footed by landowners themselves resulted in disagreement over how much aid to request. Due to the severity of damage to the electrical grid, there were numerous requests made to the ESB to build underground <b>power</b> <b>cables,</b> especially in Galway.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{more than}} 20 years, cable {{rejuvenation}} {{has been used}} at electric utilities to extend <b>power</b> <b>cable</b> life. Most cable rejuvenation {{has been carried out}} in residential subdivisions. However, with the latest improvements in injection fluids, industrial customers are beginning to adopt cable rejuvenation for chemical, industrial, and power plants as an insurance policy against <b>power</b> <b>cable</b> failures. For about one-half the cost of replacement, <b>power</b> <b>cable</b> life can be extended up to 40 years...|$|R
5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with <b>power</b> <b>cables</b> that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E
5|$|Empire City {{is built}} on three islands, and the player must work through main story {{missions}} on each island before being able to access the next one, though future missions may require the player to return to an earlier island. Each island is divided {{into a number of}} sectors, {{at the start of the}} game controlled by three different gangs, the Neon District being controlled by Sasha and her Reaper Gang, the Warren District being controlled by Alden and the Dust Men Gang, and the Historic District being controlled by Kessler and the First Sons. The player can undertake a side mission in each sector, once certain main story requirements have been met, to free that sector from gang control, reducing or eliminating the presence of the gang in that sector. Other side missions may also unlock medical stations where Cole will re-awaken should he die. Though Cole must travel on foot he eventually gains powers that allow him to grind along <b>power</b> <b>cables</b> and powered, elevated train rails and to hover for a short time. Scattered around the city are hundreds of 'Blast Shards' which Cole can collect to increase the amount of electricity he can store. There are 32 'Dead Drop' satellite transmitters that help to reveal more of the back-story in the game, all being narrated by John White, or being recordings of Kessler and his experiments.|$|E
