40|$|Abstract: Opportunities for {{dendrochronology}} in {{the tropics}} are rare because few locations experience sea-sonality strong enough to induce annual (or even dependably cyclic) ring formation in trees. Consequently, any such opportunities that exist are valuable and identifying them is worth investing time and effort. West Indian pine (Pinus occidentalis Swartz) is endemic to the island of Hispaniola (19 N, 71 W). It has pre-viously been shown not to produce useful rings in low-elevation (< 2000 m) stands. We investigated its potential in small (411 tree) sample sets from four sites between 2000 m and 3000 m where seasonality of temperature and precipitation is more pronounced. Primary growth rings were distinct at all sites. False <b>rings,</b> diffuse <b>rings,</b> <b>pinching</b> <b>rings</b> and micro-rings were also present, and their number varied considerably by site. Quality of ring formation appeared to increase with both moisture stress (elevation, exposure, edaphic factors) and cold stress (elevation, exposure, cold-air drainage). We were able to cross-date sam-ples (average interseries correlation 0. 44; average mean sensitivity 0. 44) from nine trees at the highest-elevation site, and that chronology correlated significantly (r 0. 45, P< 0. 001) with monthly and sea-sonal maximum temperatures from a nearby meteorological station. This finding suggests a centuries-long reconstruction of temperature may be possible for this subtropical location. We conclude that, with careful site and tree selection, oversampling to allow exclusion of problematic specimens and greater use of com...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{software}} for CNC filament winding of fibre reinforced plastics {{has been linked}} to typical finite element codes by automating the generation of finite element models of filament wound components. The algorithms required for this process have been created and encoded as computer programs. The program FILFEM I generates models of components manufactured using the CADFIL I CAD/CAM system for the filament winding of axisymmetric components. The suite of programs named FILFEM II achieves the same objective for non-axisymmetric components manufactured using CADFIL II although its method of operation is quite different from that of FILFEM I. FILFEM I has been tested by automatically generating models of a pinched cylindrical filament-wound tube manufactured from glass-reinforced polyester resin. The results from these models generally compared well with results obtained from experiments and from an analytical solution extended by the author from work by Calladine. However, the validity of a comparison with experiment depends upon the accuracy of the material properties assumed in the analyses. The material property values required for the analyses were investigated experimentally. Tests based upon <b>pinched</b> <b>rings</b> and a modified split-disc method are described together with more conventional tests of material properties. A method is presented for the determination of unidirectional material properties from the experimentally-measured properties of laminates. Difficulties in obtaining consistent results were attributed to problems with the quality of the specimens, inadequacies in the orthotropic model of material behaviour, and to material damage occurring during the experiments. In order to provide a test component for FILFEM II, a number of filament wound elbows were manufactured although some problems with winding quality remain. The fibre paths files used in manufacturing the elbows were used to test the operation of FILFEM II and further work including experimental verification is proposed...|$|R

Orbital-based arguments allow rationalization of this transition between homoaromaticity and hyper(conjugative) antiaromaticity. More generally, the hyperconjugative ring current in a family of C- 2 v planar-constrained geometries of (CR 2) CN- 1 HN- 1 q homoannulenes (R = H, F) can be switched from paratropic (antiaromatic) to diatropic (aromatic) by variation of ring size, charge, and bridge substituent.

For this model we will consider transport between {{the northern and southern}} gyres separated by an eastward jet. We will focus on the use of techniques from dynamical systems theory, particularly lobe dynamics, in the forming of geometric structures that govern transport. By "govern", we mean they can be used to compute Lagrangian transport quantities, such as the flux across the jet. We will consider periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic velocity fields, and thus assess the effectiveness of dynamical systems techniques in flows with progressively more spatio-temporal complexity.

40|$|Vortex ring {{formation}} in a starting axisymmetric buoyant plume is considered. A model describing {{the process is}} proposed and a physical explanation based on the Kelvin–Benjamin variational principle for steady vortex rings is provided. It is shown that Lundgren et al.

50|$|Floating {{south along}} the South American {{continental}} slope, the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) carries North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) into the South Atlantic. At about 8°S and {{at a depth of}} 2200 - 3500 m, the DWBC breaks into anticyclonic eddies during periods of strong meridional overturning circulation. One such NADW eddy was observed in 2003 and the researchers speculated that a deeply penetrating Agulhas <b>ring</b> <b>pinched</b> it off the NADW slope current. Spinning at , these deep-water eddies move around the southern tip of the Agulhas Bank and into the Indian Ocean. Most of the NADW flow (more than 7 Sv) meanders east around the Agulhas Plateau together with the surface Agulhas Return Current, but a smaller portion (3 Sv) continue north along the African east-coast as the Agulhas Undercurrent.Of 89.5 Sv released from the North Atlantic, 3.6 Sv leaves the South Atlantic south of the Agulhas Bank. However, 0.9 Sv recirculate in the basin north of the Walvis Ridge for centuries, of which 50-90% end up flowing south of the Agulhas Bank within 300 years, increasing the net inter-oceanic exchange with 4.1-4.5 Sv.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Warm {{core ring}} (WCR) 82 -H was sampled in September- October (1982) as a Gulf Stream meander pinched off {{and became a}} ring. It is {{compared}} with the 3 -month-old WCR 81 -D, visited September —October (1981). Although the rings have different histories, their phytoplankton assemblages share some characteristics. Using cluster analyses based on quantitative group counts, a station from one ring occasionally clusters most closely with a station from the other ring, showing a similar balance of organisms. The younger ring {{at the time of}} sampling, WCR 82 -H, had lower diversity, fewer shelf species, and greater consistency between stations, except for a high level of Oscillmoria in the meander before the <b>ring</b> <b>pinched</b> off. Interaction with slope water was seen principally at the ring margin. WCR 81 -D, on the other hand, showed a great deal of structure, and immediate dilutions with slope water and the Gulf Stream were apparent, with higher diversity before and a week after such interactions.

40|$|Gulf Stream (GS) {{separation}} {{near its}} observed Cape Hatteras (CH) separation location, and its ensuing path and dynamics, is a challenging ocean modeling problem. If a model GS separates much farther north than CH, then northward GS meanders, which pinch off warm core eddies (rings), are not possible or are strongly {{constrained by the}} Grand Banks shelfbreak. Cold core <b>rings</b> <b>pinch</b> off the southward GS meanders. The rings are often re-absorbed by the GS. The important warm core rings enhance heat exchange and, especially, affect the northern GS branch after GS bifurcation near the New England Seamount Chain. This northern branch gains heat by contact with the southern branch water upstream of bifurcation, and warms the Arctic Ocean and northern seas, thus playing {{a major role in}} ice dynamics, thermohaline circulation and possible global climate warming. These rings transport heat northward between the separated GS and shelf slope/Deep Western Boundary Current system (DWBC). This region has nearly level time mean isopycnals. The eddy heat transport convergence/divergence enhances the shelfbreak and GS front intensities and thus also increases watermass transformation. The fronts are maintained by warm advection by the Florida Current and cool advection by the DWBC. Thus, the GS interaction with the DWBC through the intermediate eddy field is climatologically important...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} pinch-off of axisymmetric vortex rings and the evolution of pressure in the shear layer being entrained into the vortex rings. A piston-cylinder apparatus was used to generate the vortex rings, and five cases of constant piston acceleration over distances ranging from zero (impulsive start) to eight piston diameters were investigated. It was determined that increasing the distance over which the piston accelerated increased the dimensionless formation time at which the vortex <b>ring</b> <b>pinches</b> off, consistent with previous observations. A limiting value of vortex ring formation number of approximately seven is approached when the piston is accelerated over more than six piston diameters. For each case, the evolution of pressure in the shear layer was calculated based on PIV measurements of the velocity field and spatial integration of the corresponding pressure gradients using a recently developed algorithm. Plots of the shear layer pressure in X-T diagrams aided in identifying key features of the pressure associated with the evolution of vortex rings, including a high-pressure region that forms behind the leading ring. By extrapolating the motion of this high-pressure region back to the nozzle exit plane in the X-T diagram, its time of first appearance can be estimated. It is found that the appearance of the extrapolated local pressure maximum in the shear layer at the nozzle exit plane coincides with vortex ring pinch-off, as conventionally quantified by the vortex ring formation number...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} and pinch-off of non-axisymmetric vortex rings is considered experimentally. Vortex rings are generated using a non-circular piston–cylinder arrangement, {{and the resulting}} velocity fields are measured using digital particle image velocimetry. Three different nozzle geometries are considered: an elliptical nozzle with an aspect ratio of two, an elliptical nozzle with an aspect ratio of four and an oval nozzle constructed from tangent circular arcs. The formation of vortices from the three nozzles is analysed {{by means of the}} vorticity and circulation, as well as by investigation of the Lagrangian coherent structures in the flow. The results indicate that, in all three nozzles, the maximum circulation the vortex can attain is determined by the equivalent diameter of the nozzle: the diameter of a circular nozzle of identical cross-sectional area. In addition, the time at which the vortex <b>rings</b> <b>pinch</b> off is found to be constant along the nozzle contours, and independent of relative variations in the local curvature. A formation number for this class of vortex rings is defined based on the equivalent diameter of the nozzle, and the formation number for vortex rings of the three geometries considered is found to lie in the range of 3 – 4. The implications of the relative shape and local curvature independence of the formation number on the study and modelling of naturally occurring vortex rings such as those that appear in biological flows is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of vortex rings generated by an impulsively started jet {{in the presence}} of uniform background co-flow is studied experimentally to extend previous results. A piston–cylinder mechanism is used to generate the vortex rings and the co-flow is supplied through a transparent shroud surrounding the cylinder. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) is used to measure the development of the ring vorticity and its eventual pinch off from the generating jet for ratios of the co-flow to jet velocity (R_v) in the range 0 – 0. 85. The formation time scale for the ring to obtain maximal circulation and pinch off from the generating jet, called the formation number (F), is determined as a function of R_v using DPIV measurements of circulation and a generalized definition of dimensionless discharge time or ‘formation time’. Both simultaneous initiation and delayed initiation of co-flow are considered. In all cases, a sharp drop in F (taking place over a range of 0. 1 in R_v) is centred around a critical velocity ratio (R_crit). As the initiation of co-flow was delayed, the magnitude of the drop in F and the value of R_crit decreased. A kinematic model based on the relative velocities of the forming ring and jet shear layer is formulated and correctly predicts vortex <b>ring</b> <b>pinch</b> off for R_v > R_crit. The results of the model indicate the reduction in F at large R_v {{is directly related to the}} increased convective velocity provided to the ring by the co-flow...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of cardiology, the current ability to {{accurately}} detect diastolic dysfunction is unsatisfactory {{due to the lack}} of an effective diagnostic index. Currently, assessments of diastolic dysfunction are based on echocardiographic measurements that are assumed to be correlated with progression from mild dysfunction to more severe disease. However, relying on existing ultrasonic indices for diagnosis of diastolic failure leads us to underestimate the progress of dysfunction. The presence of vortical flow that develops along with a strong propulsive trans-mitral jet during diastole in a normal left ventricle has been demonstrated by different imaging modalities. Thus, physical characteristics of these vortical structures may provide more effective indices of diastolic function than existing ones. In the first few chapters of this thesis, I fully describe the relationship between physical characteristics of these vortices and the dynamics of mitral valve during diastole. We found that regardless of the valve size and the pressure drop time-constant, the mitral annuls recoil computed would be maximized when the trans-mitral vortex <b>ring</b> <b>pinches</b> off in a range of formation time between three and five. In chapter five, I introduce a novel technique that can estimate the viscoelastic properties of the left ventricle based on harmonic behavior of the ventricular chamber. Elastic deformations resulting from the changes in the ventricular mechanical properties of myocardium are represented as a time-varying spring, while the viscous components of the model include a time-varying viscous damper, representing relaxation and the frictional energy loss. In the final chapter, I discussed about effect of isovolumic relaxation phase on diastolic rapid filling in the process of post-infarction cardiac remodeling in sheep. The results of this study confirmed that the post-infarction changes in isovolumic relaxation phase have direct influence on diastolic rapid filling phase, which leads to complex variations in end-diastolic lengthening and end-systolic shortening of the LV contractile elements...|$|R
40|$|The {{recent work}} of Gharib, Rambod, and Shariff [J. Fluid Mech. 360, 121 (1998) ] studied vortex rings formed by {{starting}} jets generated using a piston-cylinder mechanism. Their {{results showed that}} vortex rings generated from starting jets stop forming and pinch off from the generating jet for sufficiently large values of the piston stroke to diameter ratio (L/D), suggesting a maximization principle may exist for propulsion utilizing starting jets. The importance of vortex <b>ring</b> formation and <b>pinch</b> off to propulsion, however, rests on the relative contribution of the leading vortex ring and the trailing jet (which appears after pinch off) to the impulse supplied to the flow. To resolve {{the relative importance of}} the vortex ring and trailing jet for propulsion, a piston-cylinder mechanism attached to a force balance is used to investigate the impulse and thrust generated by starting jets for L/D ratios in the range 2 – 8. Two different velocity programs are used, providing two different L/D values beyond which pinch off is observed, {{in order to determine the}} effect of vortex <b>ring</b> <b>pinch</b> off. Measurements of the impulse associated with vortex ring formation show it to be much larger than that expected from the jet velocity alone and proportionally larger than that associated with a trailing jet for L/D large enough to observe pinch off. The latter result leads to a local maximum in the average thrust during a pulse near L/D values associated with vortex rings whose circulation has been maximized. These results are shown to be related to the nozzle exit over-pressure generated during vortex ring formation. The over-pressure is in turn shown to be associated with the acceleration of ambient fluid by vortex ring formation in the form of added and entrained mass...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Pulsatile jet propulsion {{can be accomplished}} using a fully-pulsed jet (i. e., a periodic series of starting jets or pulses), the unsteady nature of which engenders vortex ring formation. The significance of vortex ring formation {{for this type of}} propulsion is studied experimentally using a piston-cylinder mechanism to generate starting and fully-pulsed, round jets of water into water at a maximum jet Reynolds number of 13, 000. Starting jets are considered separately since they are the limiting case of a fully-pulsed jet at zero pulsing frequency. Direct measurements of the total impulse per pulse (starting jets) and time-averaged thrust (fully-pulsed jets) are made using a force balance. Hotfilm anemometry is used to measure the jet velocity and Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) is used to measure vortex ring position, vorticity, energy, circulation, and impulse. The pulses for both types of jets are generated using piston stroke to diameter ratios (L/D) in the range 2 to 8 for piston velocity programs in a generally positive-sloping (PS) or negative-sloping (NS) family. The range of L/D considered brackets the transition between the case where an individual vortex ring is produced with each pulse (small L/D) and the case where the vortex ring stops growing and pinches off from its generating jet, producing a trailing jet (large L/D). This transition occurs at a higher L/D for the PS ramps, allowing the effects of vortex <b>ring</b> formation and <b>pinch</b> off to be illuminated by comparison of the results for the NS and PS ramps. The significance of vortex ring formation is first analyzed for starting jets. Measurements of the total impulse per pulse as a function of L/D show that a leading vortex ring adds more impulse per unit L/D than a trailing jet. This leads to a maximum in the average thrust during a pulse at the L/Ds just before vortex <b>ring</b> <b>pinch</b> off is observed for both the PS and NS ramps. The propulsive benefit provided by a leading vortex ring over a trailing jet is connected to over-pressure at the nozzle exit plane during vortex ring formation. DPIV measurements demonstrate that nozzle exit over-pressure also makes an important contribution to energy and circulation. It is shown that this over-pressure can be related to the momentum that must be supplied by the forming vortex ring to ambient fluid in the form of added and entrained mass. A model is proposed for nozzle exit over-pressure near the initiation of an impulsive velocity program where entrainment can be ignored. The model readily accounts for the pressure contribution to circulation in the NS ramps, but modeling of entrainment is required to properly determine impulse and energy. For the fully-pulsed jet experiments, a normalized thrust, [ [...] . ], is introduced to characterize the pressure effects associated with vortex ring formation. The pulsing frequency is expressed in dimensionless form as [ [...] . ], which is between 0 and 1 for all fully-pulsed jets. A propulsive benefit from pressure ([ [...] . ]) is observed for all L/D and [ [...] . ] considered. At low [ [...] . ], the results are similar to those for the starting jets. At higher [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] decreases with L/D as with the starting jets, which is related to the existence of vortex <b>ring</b> <b>pinch</b> off for all observed [ [...] . ]. At a fixed L/D, two dominant decreasing trends in [ [...] . ] with [ [...] . ] appear and seem {{to be related to the}} effects of previously ejected pulses on forming vortex rings. No dramatic increase in [ [...] . ] with [ [...] . ] (associated with the increased convective velocity of multiple coaxial vortex rings over that of individual vortex rings) is observed since (a) the ring separation is never reduced low enough to see an increase in the ring velocity (even for [ [...] . ]), and (b) the vortex rings don't remain coaxial or coherent as [ [...] . ]...|$|R
