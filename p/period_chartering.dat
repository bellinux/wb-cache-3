40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} conceptually how charter market default risk will vary with freight market conditions, charter duration, and the financial situation of the charterer. The primary contribution is the development of a mathematical framework and numerical methodology to simulate the dynamic economic value of a <b>period</b> <b>charter</b> and the related risk of default, based on a fully functional stochastic spot freight rate model, which enables us to evaluate the sign and magnitude of the risk premium attributable to default risk. The results support the assertion that the risk premium attributable to charter default risk is positive and increasing in the spot freight rate level and <b>period</b> <b>charter</b> duration. The primary application is the evaluation of the economic value and financial risk inherent in period timecharters, for instance, by lending banks and credit rating agencies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple argument, based on logic and maritime economic theory alone, for rejecting {{the applicability of}} the expectations theory in bulk shipping freight markets.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the cost benefit analysis of the mothership concept and the investigation of the optimum chartering strategy, which brings financial and operational benefits. This is achieved by performing operational simulations in the offshore wind operational expenditure and logistics planning tool StrathOW-OM, which is developed by the University of Strathclyde and commercial partner organisations. In this paper, a fixed accommodation platform concept, two mothership concepts and different vessel <b>chartering</b> <b>periods</b> are simulated. The simulation results are compared with a base case scenario, in which the O&M activities are performed through a conventional onshore base. The simulation results show that significant travel time is spent in far offshore, if only a single conventional onshore base is utilised in the operations.

30|$|With the {{overthrow}} of the Derg regime and coming into power of Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democracy Front (EPRDF) in 1991, Ethiopia’s foreign policy turf underwent changes in tune with domestic and international changes. The transitional charter, notably, mentioned that the transitional government “will conduct its foreign relations {{on the basis of the}} principles of respect for the sovereignty and equality of states and non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs as well as the promotion of mutual interest” (Transitional <b>Period</b> <b>Charter</b> of Ethiopia Negarit Gazetta 1991, p. 2). Subsequent constitutional principles have also reiterated, among others, the need for promoting development and operating within the broader globalized world by way of “creating a conducive environment for making use of available market and investment opportunity and getting technical assistance, loans and aid for the development and democratization endeavor of the country” (Ethiopian Foreign Policy Document 2002 : pp. 2 - 15). The foreign policy document also mentions the need for realizing the twin objectives of bringing about democracy and development for which external economic support through economic diplomacy is needed (FDRE, Foreign Affairs and National Security Policy and Strategy 2002 : 23 - 24).

5000|$|Throughout this tumultuous <b>period,</b> <b>Charter</b> {{never quite}} lost its {{carefree}} atmosphere and wild touch—best exemplified perhaps by the infamous Initiation Night of 1988. In 1988, Charter counted as members {{most of the}} Varsity Football Team, including many of the '89 section's officers. It was some of these gridiron heroes who allegedly planned the raucous celebration of the admission of the new sophomore section which led to 45 members sent to McCosh Infirmary or Princeton Medical Center for alcohol-related reasons. The Princeton Borough Police quickly rounded up the Charter officer corps, and criminal charges were brought against the president and social chair, who were convicted of serving alcohol to minors, fined $500, and sentenced to 30 days in jail. The sentences were later overturned by a Mercer County Court judge, and the two undergraduate officers received probation and were ordered to perform community service. [...] To prevent a similar occurrence, but also to commemorate forever this fateful night, Charter now conducts formal initiations a week after all the other eating clubs, and on what would otherwise be initiation night officially [...] "goes dry."

40|$|The {{value of}} {{virtually}} any contract or asset in bulk shipping depends {{primarily on the}} stochastic dynamics of the forward freight rate curve. In {{the absence of a}} liquid and transparent market for forward freight agreements, the dynamics of the forward freight rate curve must be derived from the dynamics of the spot freight rate and the risk premium in the freight market. This thesis is an attempt to improve our understanding of the stochastic dynamics of freight rates and the nature and sources of risk in the freight markets. Two new spot freight rate models are proposed and estimated, applying nonparametric estimation in an effort to avoid misspecification. It is found that while a one-factor Markovian model can capture the mean reversion and level effect in the spot freight rate very well, an extension to a multi-factor non-Markovian model is required in order to account for the observed lag effects in the conditional mean and variance. New theory governing the risk premium in the freight markets is proposed, which suggests that the theoretical risk premium should be time varying and, in general, depend {{on the state of the}} freight market and the duration of the <b>period</b> <b>charter</b> in a systematic fashion. Empirical tests suggest that the implied risk premium changes over time, but are not able to confirm the dependence on the state of the spot freight market. by Road Os. Adland. Thesis (Ph.
