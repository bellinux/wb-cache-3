40|$|Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is {{currently}} performing a demonstration {{program for the}} Department of Energy (DOE) which <b>processes</b> spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> from the Experimental Breeder Reactor (EBR-II). One of the key steps in this demonstration program is electrorefining of the spent fuel in a molten LiCl-KCl/liquid cadmium system using a pilot scale electrorefiner (Mk-IV ER). This article summarizes experimental observations and engineering aspects for electrorefining spent fuel in the molten LiCl-KCl/liquid cadmium system. It {{was found that the}} liquid cadmium pool acted as an intermediate electrode during the electrorefining process in the ER. The cadmium level was gradually decreased due to its high vapor pressure and vaporization rate at the ER operational temperature. The low cadmium level caused the anode assembly momentarily to touch the ER vessel hardware, which generated a periodic current change at the salt/cathode interface and improved uranium recovery efficiency for the process. The primary current distributions calculated by numerical simulations were used in interpreting the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} series of {{investigations}} examining the corrosion <b>process</b> of used <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> under permanent disposal conditions. The motivation of the project is that the safety assessment of deep geological disposal of spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> requires a fundamental understanding of the processes controlling fuel corrosion {{which could lead to}} the release of radionuclides to the geosphere from a failed container. One primary objective of this project was to develop a computational model in order to simulate fuel corrosion under the disposal conditions. A series of simulations based on COMSOL were designed and developed to determine the influence of redox conditions, with the emphasis on Î±-radiolysis and steel vessel corrosion products, on the corrosion rate of spent fuel. A second objective of this project was to develop a more detailed understanding of the H 2 O 2 decomposition process and its influence on UO 2 (<b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel)</b> corrosion. The radiolytically produced H 2 O 2 is the primary driving force for <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> corrosion under disposal conditions. The influence of several variables (potential, pH, carbonate/bicarbonate, and fission products) on the reactivity of H 2 O 2 has been evaluated. Their influence on the surface composition and electrical conductivity of UO 2 was found to significantly affect the surface redox reaction rates and alter the overall fuel corrosion rate. The analytical techniques include electrochemical measurements (CV, CSV, ECORR, LPR, EIS) and surface/solution analyses (SEM, XPS, ICP-AES) ...|$|R

40|$|North Korea is {{unlikely}} to relinquish its nuclear program because of its importance to the perpetuation of the Kim regime. This conclusion arises from the observation that the nuclear program has been a long-term project spanning several decades, culminating in denuclearisation negotiations, which have followed a cyclical pattern in which the North has provoked crises to extract concessions and gain leverage vis-a-vis regional states. It {{is clear that the}} nuclear program has great intrinsic value to Pyongyang. First, this paper argues that the sunk costs of previous investment in the nuclear program, as evidenced by the infrastructure for the country's <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> cycle, create forward momentum favouring continuation of the nuclear program.

40|$|An electrometallurgical {{process is}} being {{developed}} at Argonne National Laboratory to treat spent metallic <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel.</b> In this <b>process,</b> the spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> is electrorefined in a molten salt to separate uranium from the other constituents of the fuel. The treatment process generates a contaminated chloride salt that is incorporated into a ceramic waste form. The ceramic waste form, a composite of socialite and glass, contains the fission products (rare earths, alkalis, alkaline earth metals, and halides) and transuranic radionuclides that accumulated in the electrorefiner salt. These radionuclides are incorporated into zeolite A, which can fully accommodate the salt in its crystal structure. The radionuclides are incorporated into the zeolite by high-temperature blending or by ion exchange. In the blending process the salt and zeolite are simply tumbled together at > 450 C (723 K), but in the ion exchange process, which yields a product more highly concentrated in fission products, the molten salt is passed through a bed of the zeolite. In either case, the salt-loaded zeolite A is mixed with glass frit and hot isostatically pressed to produce a monolithic leach resistant waste form. Zeolite is converted to sodalite during hot pressing. This paper presents experimental results on the fission product uptake of the zeolite {{as a function of}} time and salt composition...|$|R
30|$|The {{reprocessing}} of spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels</b> {{is one of}} the key <b>processes</b> in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> cycle. As {{the conventional}} method suffers from many drawbacks in reprocessing of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> from the view point of cost and minimization of waste, the development of a new process involving cost-effectiveness coupled with minimizing waste amount is a great challenge for the next generation reprocessing. Liquid-liquid extraction was one of the most promising methods of separating REEâ€™s material. The repeated use of different organic solvents for this process results in severe corrosion to the equipment, and usage of lots of volatile organic solvents may lead to severe environmental pollution. The real picturisation of the role of extractant-diluent pair (EDP) is not still well defined in spite of work by many workers in this field (Laxmi et al. 2015; Thirumaran and Jayakumar 2009; Liu et al. 2016; Mahapatra et al. 2014;Â Mastumiya et al. 2014; Bhatanagar et al. 2010; ï»¿ Joshi et al. 2010; Patel and Parsania 2010; Palani and Kalavathy 2011; Sakthipandi et al. 2012; Srivastava et al. 2014; Aswar and Chudhary 2014; Giri and Nath 2015). Thus, an optimal concentration or range of concentration of extractants with particular diluents is a serious concern in the solvent extraction or purex process. Thus, the aim of the present investigation is to make an attempt to find an optimum concentration of EDP used for extraction process. The accurate concentration of EDP and their variation with different physical factors can be well studied by the propagation of ultrasonic wave in the concerned medium.|$|R
