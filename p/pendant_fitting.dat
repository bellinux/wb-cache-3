Walls have a smooth rendered finish to the north and part of the walls to the west. Other walls are lined in v-jointed boards. The lower sections of the internal walls are lined with plywood and timber battened sheeting. The ceiling is lined with decorative pressed metal sheeting with large pressed metal cornices finished with leaf-shaped cornice mitres in the internal corners. Two decorative circular pressed metal ceiling vents are located on the ceiling. Metal ceiling roses (former <b>pendant</b> <b>fittings</b> have been removed) are also located on the ceiling. Wall and window trims are clear finished timber. Floors are timber tongue and groove boards. A door formerly accessing a dumbwaiter is located in a small alcove on the southern side of the room. A concrete wash tub is located in the north-west corner of the room.|$|R

60|$|In the end his {{outlook on}} life and the world became different, and this {{not so much because}} of what he learned from his esoteric teachers, as through some change in his {{internal}} self. He grew to appreciate the vastness of things and the infinite possibilities of existence. Indeed, his spiritual education was a <b>fitting</b> <b>pendant</b> to his physical study of the heavens, peopled with unnumbered worlds, each of them the home, doubtless, of an infinite variety of life, and each of them keeping its awful secrets locked in its floating orb. He trembled in presence of the stupendous Whole, of which thus by degrees he became aware, and though it frightened him, thought with pity of the busy millions of mankind to whom such mysteries are nothing at all; who are lost in their business or idleness, in their eating, drinking, sleeping, love-making, and general satisfaction of the instincts which they possess in common with every other animal. The yearning for wisdom, the desire to know, entered his young heart and possessed it, as once these did that of Solomon, to such a degree indeed, that standing on the threshold of his days, he would have paid them all away, and with them his share in this warm and breathing world, could he have been assured that in exchange he would receive the key of the treasure-house of the Infinite.|$|R

We have not merely to decide whether we will give a Constitution to the Orange River Colony, but whether, having given a Constitution to the Transvaal, we will deliberately withhold one from the Orange River Colony; and that is an argument which multiplies the others which I have used. On what ground could we refuse that equal treatment of the Orange River Colony? There is only one ground which we could assign for such a refusal, and that is that in the Orange River Colony there is sure to be a Dutch majority. I cannot conceive any more fatal assertion that could be made {{on the part of the}} Imperial Government than that on this specific racial ground they were forced to refuse liberties which otherwise they would concede. I say such a refusal would be an insult to the hundreds and thousands of loyal Dutch subjects the King has in all parts of South Africa, I say that this invidious treatment of the Orange River Colony would be the greatest blunder, a <b>fitting</b> <b>pendant</b> to all that long concatenation of fatal mistakes which has marked our policy in South Africa for so many years; and I say it would be a breach of the spirit of the terms of peace, because we could not say, [...] "We promised you self-government by the terms of peace, but what we meant by that was that before you were to have self-government, enough persons of British origin should have arrived in the country to make quite sure you would be out-voted." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{different}} areas of the Central European Barbaricum, the Przeworsk Culture territory included, there is evidence in the Early Roman Period of some a certain standardization of belt fittings attributed to the warrior class. This observation applies not only to belt fastenings and strap ends, but also to fittings attached to the perimeter of the belt. They served a decorative function but, presumably, even more so a utilitarian one. Found among them are fittings commonly understood to have served in suspending from the belt objects belonging to the so-called personal equipment of warriors, namely: belt hangers, belt <b>pendants</b> and belt <b>fittings</b> with a pendent ring. A special attention was paid to this type of belt fitting during analysis of warrior belts of Early Roman Period data found in site at Illerup Ådal in Jutland (J. Ilkjær 1993 a). Belt hangers known from Przeworsk Culture assemblages come in several variants depending on the shape of the bar and rivet-plates which attached them to the leather strap. Depending on the differences {{in the shape of the}} bar three variants may be distinguished: 1. with a bar made of folded wire, approximately W-shaped (Fig. 1; List 1, Fig. 4); 2. with a U-shaped bar (Fig. 2; List 2, Fig. 5); 3. with a frame-like bar (Fig. 3; List 3, Fig. 6). The shape of the rivet-plates is not in a correlation with the shape of the bar. In the Przeworsk Culture territory belt hangers appear in phase B 1 of the Early Roman Period (variants 1 and 2). Their largest number, irrespective of their shape, has been recorded in assemblages dated to phase B 2 b. All three belt hanger variants are documented in the Late Roman Period, chiefly in phase C 1 a. Elsewhere in the Central European Barbaricum analogous belt hangers have been recorded with the same frequency and within the same chronological confines (phase B 1 -C 1 a), as in the Przeworsk Culture territory. Metal belt sets of which belt hangers formed part have a similar character both in the territory of the Przeworsk Culture settlement as in other regions of the Central European Barbaricum. Most of them belonged to belts worn by warriors. In the Przeworsk Culture (Fig. 7 : 1) in phase B 1, similarly as in the Elbian Circle, in the Bohemian Basin (Fig. 12 : 1) and in Lower Austria, belt hangers were used on belts fastened with buckles with an eight-shaped frame (group A) and fitted with profiled strap ends. In phase B 2 there is an increase in the number of belts provided with belt hangers. Some of these belt sets are reminiscent stylistically to those of the preceding chronological period in that they include profiled strap ends (Fig. 8 : 1, 10 : 2). On the other hand, in phases B 2 b and C 1 a everywhere in the Central European Barbaricum belts with belt hangers (mostly variants 2 and 3), dissimilar in style design become widespread. These belts tended to be fastened with a buckle having a rectangular frame, mostly of type G 16, and were usually fitted with a strap end type 4 – 6 or 9 (Fig. 7 : 3, 8 : 2. 3, 9 : 1 11 : 1). Belt hangers were used in belts worn by the local elites (Fig. 13 : 2). In the outfit of the Przeworsk Culture warriors belt hangers (variants 2 and 3) appear also as an element of wide belts which were fastened with a heavy buckle of group G, with a double prong (Fig. 10 : 1). In phase C 1 a, in the Przeworsk Culture, we find a very small number of belt hangers forming part of new belt sets which include buckles with a D-shaped frame set on an axis, type D 17 (variant 1; Fig. 7 : 2). Singly belt sets of this type, with belt hangers, variants 2 or 3, have been recorded in the Elbian Circle, the Luboszyce Culture on the one hand, and the territory of the Dollkeim-Kovrovo Culture on the other. From the territory of the Przeworsk Culture settlement we also have a record on belts fitted with belt hangers identified with women’s outfits dating to phase B 2 b (Fig. 11 : 2). A very small number of belts with belt hangers attributed to women has been recorded in the Elbian Circle, the Wielbark Culture and the Luboszyce Couture, as well as in south-western Slovakia. Moreover, belt hangers are an element of so-called Sambian belts, typical for women’s outfits in the Dollkeim-Kovrovo Culture. In the Przeworsk Culture territory belt pendants are much less frequent finds (Fig. 14, 15). They differ both in the proportions of their top part and the shape of their lower part, used for suspending objects, and have been distinguished on this basis into five variants: 1. with the top part passing to a rectangular frame (Fig. 14 : 1 - 4; List 4, Fig. 15); 2. with the top part passing to a single loop (Fig. 14 : 5. 6; List 5, Fig. 16); 3. with the top part passing to a double loop (Fig. 14 : 7 - 11; List 5, Fig. 16); 4. with the top part passing to D-shaped loop (Fig. 14 : 12; List 5, Fig. 16); 5. with the top part in the form of a rectangular bar with a D-shaped loop (Fig. 14 : 13. 14; List 5, Fig. 16). In the Przeworsk Culture territory belt pendants as elements of belts are more characteristic for phase C 1 a than for phase B 2 b, and are documented also in phase C 1 b (variants 1 and 2). A small number of earlier belt pendants dating to phases B 2 a (variant 2) and B 2 b (variants 1 and 5) originate for the most part from the eastern range of the Przeworsk Culture, whereas younger specimens are known primarily from the western range of that culture. Elsewhere in the Central European Barbaricum a small number of belt pendant finds have a similar chronological position as in the Przeworsk Culture. Specimens known at present represent all belt pendant variants known from the Przeworsk Culture, except for variant 4. On the other hand, belt pedants recorded elsewhere in the Central European Barbaricum (Fig. 17 : 1. 2) lack analogies in the Przeworsk Culture materials. In the Przeworsk Culture territory, similarly as in other areas of the European Barbaricum, belt pendants were characteristic for belts worn by warriors fastened with buckles with a rectangular frame, group G, mostly type G 16 (Fig. 18 : 1. 2), often with strap ends. As in the case of belt hangers in the Przeworsk Culture environment belt pendants were also, on very rare occasions, attached to belts fastened with buckles with a D-shaped frame, group D (Fig. 18 : 3. 4). There is no conclusive evidence that belt pendants formed part of the outfit of women of the Przeworsk Culture people. Another form of metal belt fitting serving a function analogous to that of belt hangers and belt <b>pendants</b> are <b>fittings</b> with a single pendent ring. Not that these fittings were necessarily associated functionally with leather straps forming part of clothing, they could also belong to straps used for suspending drinking horns or in strapping swords. The main argument assisting the identification of fittings with a pendent ring as elements of belts is that they have been found in context with other metal elements of the belt set. In the Przeworsk Culture territory two variants of fittings have been set apart: 1. with a narrow fitting and a relatively thickset ring (Fig. 19 : 1 - 6; List 6, Fig. 20), 2. with a relatively small body fitting, usually lightly expanded at the top, and a relatively small ring (Fig. 19 : 7 - 9; List 6, Fig. 20). Belt fittings variant 1, mostly made of bronze, are recorded during phase B 2 a in the eastern zone of the Przeworsk Culture settlement; variant 2 (bronze or iron) are noted during phase B 2 and in C 1 a. Bronze variant 1 fittings found in the Przeworsk Culture territory are a characteristic form used in women’s belts fastened with buckles, group D, type 1, without metal strap ends (Fig. 21 : 1). On the other hand, variant 2 belt fittings occur mainly in the male outfit, used in belts fastened with a buckle having a rectangular frame, group G (Fig. 10 : 2), or a D-shaped frame, group D (Fig. 8 : 1). Outside the Przeworsk Culture territory belt sets with belt fittings with a pendent ring, variants 1 and 2, have been recorded in areas of the Central European Barbaricum and were in use mostly in phases B 2 and C 1. The source of impulse which led to the emergence in the outfit of warriors of barbarian Europe as early as in phase B 1 of belts with fittings which allowed for suspension of objects belonging to the so-called personal equipment is hard to pinpoint. Personal equipment is represented by fire striking sets consisting of a firesteel and a pin, or just one of these items (Fig. 22). In phases B 2 b and C 1 a in grave inventories in the Central European Barbaricum are seen to include assorted objects of which some could have been secured at the belt, e. g., knives in leather sheaths, awls, tweezers, whetstones. Some variant 3 belt hangers are very thickset, suggesting that even quite heavy objects may have been suspended from them. It may be conjectured that Przeworsk Culture warriors wore belts with pouches attached to them (Fig. 7 : 3). As for women’s belts, they may have had keys suspended from them (Fig. 21 : 1. 2). Fire striking tools surviving in the Przeworsk Culture territory and elsewhere in the Central European Barbaricum dating to the horizon of phases B 2 b–C 1 a were fixed to belt hangers and pendants by means of short linking pieces which could have reduced the functionality of such a set (Fig. 11 : 1, 22 : 3 - 6). Consequently, its funerary purpose may not be ruled out. On the other hand, a very modest number of longer linking pieces has been recorded (Fig. 22 : 1. 2, 23). It is remarkable that some belt hangers and belt pendants recovered in the Central European Barbaricum and dating to phases B 2 b and C 1 a include small fittings (Fig. 24 : 1 - 4) allowing introduction of narrow and long thongs and only on them suspension of e. g., firemaking tools, obviously making it easier to use them. Moreover, firesteels and tweezers found with a surviving fitting prove that they could have been attached to the belt on narrow straps, or suspended from them using the fittings discussed here (Fig. 8 : 2, 9 : 1, 18 : 1. 3). Not to be ruled out either is that use was made of the loop of the firesteels themselves to wear them at the belt suspended on a narrow leather strap (Fig. 25 : 4. 5). In discussing the functionality of belts with objects suspended from them (R. Articus 2004) other reconstructions have been put forward as well (Fig. 25 : 1 - 3). The greatest uniformity of belt sets associated with outfit of warriors and suspension from belts of the so-called personal equipment is observed in the Central European Barbaricum in phases B 2 b-C 1 a. It may be recognized with some confidence as the result of contacts between groups of warriors hailing from different cultural environment and their mobility. This could be related to settlement and culture shifts observed at this time, intimated also by the modest written sources at hand (K. Godłowski 2000, p. 26 - 30) ...|$|R
