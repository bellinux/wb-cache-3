Using auditor salary as a proxy for <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> quality, I hypothesize and find that higher personnel quality leads to better audit output. First, clients of auditors paying higher salaries have higher audit quality, as evidenced by a lower likelihood of a future restatement of current year’s financial statements, lower discretionary accruals, and a lower likelihood to receive a failed internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) opinion. Moreover, higher-paid auditors earn higher audit fees and are more likely to become national and city-level leaders in a specific industry.

30|$|Auditor knowledge-acquisition {{activities}} affect audit quality. Auditors’ {{learning on}} the job has a favorable impact on audit quality. Auditors can enrich their knowledge accumulation by performing audit services. Lately, audit procedures have devote more emphasis in understanding client’s industry and business environment. Knechel et al. (2013) stated that audit quality is a carefully designed audit process that recruits talented employees to be properly motivated and trained to understand inherent uncertainty and adjust audit strategy to a unique client situation. The U.K.’s Financial Reporting Council (FRC) (2008) identified five drivers of audit quality: (1) the culture within an audit firm, (2) the skills and personal qualities of audit partners and staff, (3) {{the effectiveness of the}} audit process, (4) the reliability and usefulness of audit reporting, and (5) factors outside the control of auditors affecting audit quality. The National Audit Office of the Taiwan aims to evaluate the audit quality in the following five areas: leadership, <b>personnel,</b> <b>auditing,</b> clients, and continual improvement. The purpose of auditors’ recommendations is to eliminate the government deficiency. Based on these areas auditors are expected to provide independent insight and to be forward-looking, as well as offering advice to improve the efficiency of government authorities they serve.|$|R

30|$|According to {{examples}} from other countries, the National Audit Office of Taiwan evaluates audit quality in five areas: leadership, <b>personnel,</b> <b>auditing,</b> clients, and continual improvement. To improve communication among audited units, audit authorities {{should understand that}} reprimanding people or challenging policies is not {{the main purpose of}} a performance audit. Auditors should focus on the outcomes of a policy to obtain insightful results and recommendations for governing without interfering with the executive branch. Therefore, audit authorities positively affect society by increasing the economic value of audited units. Because the main aim of a performance audit is to improve government performance, audit authorities should strive to develop collaborative partnerships with the executive and legislative branches to aid in enhancing governance. Leaders should recognize that developing cooperative goals among team members is essential for reinforcing these values and ensuring the credibility. Our study showed that the evaluation, performance, and value of outputs and outcomes evidently rely on auditors’ self-efficacy as well as profession and experience. Auditors should maintain a strong and professional relationship with audited units, enabling them to appropriately communicate audit results, thereby effectively improving governing performance. Thus, the key to quality audit involves inspecting policies from an international perspective to provide insight, predictions, and warnings. According to the mission statement of the American Accounting Association, the auditing profession should “foster excellence in the teaching, research, and practice of auditing and assurance services.” Accordingly, the core competencies of auditors are as follows: (a) communication ability and leadership for inspiring people to achieve common goals; (b) the ability to conduct comprehensive financial analyses, provide insight, and offer constructive recommendations; and (c) an awareness of new technological trends and the ability to apply advanced technology to increase client and employee value. Audit authorities should operate on the basis of public governance perspectives and focus on regulatory and performance auditing to ensure that the executive branch utilizes funds legally, enabling it to economically and efficiently achieve goals.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were {{to examine the effects of}} six variables on auditor independence and the reliability of financial statements as perceived within the Irish commercial environment and to explore the reasons underlying these perceptions. The six variables comprised of audit firm size, audit market competition, audit committees, audit tenure, provision of nonaudit services (NAS) and client employment. From a combination of questionnaire and interview approaches, the study sought to obtain supportable and useful insight as to the perceptions held. The approach builds on and develops previous research conducted outside the Irish market. The results of the study showed that auditor independence and the reliability of financial statements were perceived to be significantly impaired when the audit was performed by a non-Big Six firm, the audit environment was highly competitive, no audit committee existed, audit tenure was long, NAS were provided by <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> to <b>audit</b> clients, and the auditor took up an employment position with a former audit client. Some of the reasons underlying these perceptions were as follows. The importance of reputation to, and. the international profile of, the Big Six firms allowed interviewees to have greater confidence in their independence. A highly competitive audit market was perceived to impair auditor independence by encouraging auditors to cut back on the amount of audit work performed in order to maintain audit fee income. Audit committees were perceived to enhance auditor independence by reducing the power that management could exert over the auditor. Long audit tenure was perceived to impair auditor independence by encouraging auditors to become cosy in their relationships with their clients. The lack of confidence as a result of NAS provision was associated with the audit firm's dependency on such services for fee income. Client employment was perceived to provide the ex-auditor with power to influence auditor-client relationships...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Performance {{appraisal}} of employees is traditionally {{one of the}} most criticised human resource management functions. Performance appraisal is however a critical element in the success of especially a service organisation, because the employees are the most important asset in a service organisation. This asset has to be developed and managed to contribute to the achievement ofthe organisation's vision, mission and objectives. Performance appraisal {{is more than just a}} task that is performed once a year. It is a continuous management process. This study focuses specifically on performance {{appraisal of}} <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> and the performance management process of small to medium audit firms. The study identifies the different appraisal methods, criteria for appraisal, the performance management processes and the linking of performance appraisal and reward management.

The ranking of importance of the competencies used, as criteria for evaluating <b>audit</b> <b>personnel,</b> by employees and management of small to medium audit firms, were reviewed. Although performance appraisal is often neglected in a small to medium audit firm, it is still an essential component that will facilitate employee development and success of the organisation. The results of the research show that employee development should be the primary goal of performance appraisal and that fairness, honesty and continuous feedback are critical for a successful performance management process...|$|R

The study provides an empirical analysis of input supplied by a sample of 173 professional auditors across 67 companies from 5 major sectors of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Subjects were tested of their perception on the application of audit technology tools in automated controls monitoring of financial transactions processing and assurance reporting. Although audit technology tools have been accessible for over a decade, the outcome of the study suggested that internal auditors and audit departments in Nigerian companies are not making substantial use of available tools. Internal auditors mostly have adopted audit software on an ad hoc basis with some repetitive use. In addition, most internal audit departments and units do not have formal strategies and plans for integrating technology in their internal audit processes with the exclusion of the financial services sector. The study also discovered that the most significant factors inhibiting the use of technology tools in other sectors were audit software inaccessibility and training costs alongside lack of senior management support from additional comments obtained from survey instrument.

Certain areas will have old mines and underground cavities which need investigation. The ground investigation should be given enough time to be conducted before works are designed, this may involve in predicting ground condition at various times of the year. Due to the potential flexibility and size of an investigation, adequate supervision, equipment, testing, <b>personnel,</b> and <b>audits</b> should be provided in a safe manner. The extent of the GI can depend on many variables such as, character of site, availability of equipment and personnel and costs of methods.

Intrusive investigations should be sited, spaced and backfilled with care. The GI should give sufficient information to make good decisions on design, construction material selection. The condition and accessibility on site may affect the equipment used. As the determination of groundwater conditions is important - the use of piezometers are at times used.
