5|$|The <b>proximate</b> <b>cause</b> of the {{conflict}} was {{the death of a}} Praying Indian named John Sassamon in 1675. Sassamon had been an advisor and friend to King Philip; however, Sassamon's conversion to Christianity had driven the two apart. Accused in the murder of Sassamon were some of Philip's most senior lieutenants. A jury of twelve Englishmen and six Praying Indians found the Native Americans guilty of murder and sentenced them to death. To this day, some debate exists whether King Philip's men actually committed the murder.|$|E
5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The <b>proximate</b> <b>cause</b> of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E

30|$|Studies on LULC (for example, Turner II et al. 1993, 1995; Lambin et al. 2001) {{showed that}} {{socio-economic}} and biophysical variables {{act as the}} driving forces of land use changes. Driving forces are generally subdivided into two groups: <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> and underlying <b>causes.</b> <b>Proximate</b> <b>causes</b> are the activities and actions that directly affect land use, e.g. wood extraction or road building.

Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the <b>proximate</b> <b>cause</b> of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E
5|$|In {{many parts}} of the world {{football}} evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. The Côte d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final <b>proximate</b> <b>cause</b> for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.|$|E
5|$|The First World War, {{also known}} as the Great War and in the United States as World War I, was a global {{military}} conflict that embroiled most of the world's great powers, assembled in two opposing alliances: the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance. More than 70 million military personnel were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. The main combatants descended into a state of total war, directing their entire scientific and industrial capabilities into the war effort. Over 15 million people were killed, {{making it one of the}} deadliest conflicts in history. The <b>proximate</b> <b>cause</b> of war was the assassination on 28 June 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Soon after, a system of alliances were activated that would see Europe at war.

40|$|Small-scale farmers on {{marginal}} {{land in the}} Loess Plateau of China are adapting their livelihood to new situations and changes such as varying climate, new land-use policies, changing employment opportunities and new market situations. To avoid generalising explanations with regard to land-use change, interactions between <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> and underlying driving forces adopted from a meta-analysis model are explored through 23 in-depth interviews. This was done through collaborative work with farmers in northern Shaanxi Province {{and focused on the}} land-use situation between 1982 and 2005. The result reveals five categories of land-use change. The interaction pattern is broken down into eight <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> and four underlying driving forces. The dominant underlying driving forces are economic forces with short time horizons arising partly from compensation through policies, changes in crop demand from an expanding nearby market and a need for cash because of an increasingly cash-based lifestyle. The direct <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> were vividly described by the farmers as tools or means by which they are adapting to more abstract and indirect factors. These factors were identified as underlying driving forces. Hence, the knowledge and ability to separate the interaction into <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> and underlying driving forces are crucial in policy-making...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMany {{animal species}} exhibit {{behavioural}} syndromes, groups {{of two or}} more behaviours that are linked together across different environments or time points. Behavioural syndromes give rise to stable behavioural profiles and have been likened to personality in humans. However, the <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> (or mechanisms) that underlie the clustering of behaviour are not well understood. In this review, we examine the <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> of the aggression-boldness behavioural syndrome, which constitutes a positive correlation between aggression, boldness and exploratory activity. In particular, we will focus on novel insights that have been gained from zebrafish, a genetically tractable behavioural model which can be used to study the mechanistic basis of behaviour. Studies of the <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> of behavioural syndromes provide us with the opportunity to understand the clustering of behaviours [...] and perhaps even the basis of personality [...] at the molecular level. Thus, this exciting field not only promises to bring novel insights into animal behaviour, but also forces us to rethink our own personalities as well...|$|R

During the famine approximately 1 million people died and a million more emigrated from Ireland, causing the island's population to fall by between 20% and 25%. The <b>proximate</b> <b>cause</b> of famine was a potato disease commonly known as potato blight.

Probably in late 659, but perhaps in 657, a revolt led by three Mercian noblemen—Immin, Eata, and Eadberht—installed Penda's son Wulfhere as ruler of the Mercians and drove out Oswiu's supporters. Oswiu remained {{a force to be}} reckoned with, and political settlement rather than open warfare appears to have resolved the crisis. Oswiu's kinsman Trumhere was named to be Wulfhere's bishop. While Wulfhere extended Mercian influence and authority in southern Britain, he apparently continued to recognise Oswiu's primacy.|$|E
40|$|Governments facing {{high levels}} of crime and {{violence}} must act through their criminal justice systems to increase safety while delivering justice. To do this rigorously, governments need to improve their measurement tools. This paper examines the measurement tools employed today in two developing countries—Jamaica and the Dominican Republic—showing how existing data might be analyzed and presented more effectively. We describe the many tactics used by police, prosecutors, and other institutions within {{the criminal justice system}} as falling under two broad strategies: (1) removing criminals from society, and (2) reducing the <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> of crime. All countries depend on some combination of these two strategies, but while governments tend to favor the first, the second usually produces greater crime reduction. We show how improving five specific performance indicators can help governments reduce the <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> of crime, maximizing the contribution of criminal justice systems to public safety. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of lifespan {{is a central}} question in evolutionary biology, begging the question why there is so large variation among taxa. Specifically, a central quest is to unravel <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> of ageing. Here, we show {{that the degree of}} unsaturation of liver fatty acids predicts maximum lifespan in 107 bird species. In these birds, the degree of fatty acid unsaturation is positively related to maximum lifespan across species. This is due to a positive effect of monounsaturated fatty acid content, while polyunsaturated fatty acid content negatively correlates with maximum lifespan. Furthermore, fatty acid chain length unsuspectedly increases with maximum lifespan independently of degree of unsaturation. These findings tune theories on the <b>proximate</b> <b>causes</b> of ageing while providing evidence that the {{evolution of}} lifespan in birds occurs in association with fatty acid profiles. This suggests that studies of proximate and ultimate questions may facilitate our understanding of these central evolutionary questions. Peer reviewe...|$|R
