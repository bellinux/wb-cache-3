40|$|Tightening {{monetary}} policy excessively as an initial {{response to the}} East Asian crisis has been frequently criticized, albeit without empirical support. In this paper, we examine the extent that monetary/financial shocks are magnified in the Korean economy via the credit channel. We find that spreads, which capture credit channel effects, do indeed influence economic activity, and these effects are disproportionately larger for small and medium-sized enterprises. Consequently, policy makers who neglect credit channel effects might be “overkilling the economy ” and altogether overlooking the incommensurate sectoral effects of monetary/financial shocks. ______________________________________________________________________________ * Ilker Domaç and Giovanni Ferri are <b>economist</b> and <b>principal</b> financial <b>economist</b> in the East Asia Pacific Region, respectively.

40|$|One of the <b>principal</b> Soviet <b>economists</b> {{actively}} involved in the government's efforts to reform the prevailing system is L. Abalkin. Hence, his lead article in our current issue ("Restructuring the Economy: The Soviet Point of View") may be taken as a fairly authoritative summary statement of what is commonly referred to as "the new political and economic thinking. " Perhaps the basic point of departure in this new thinking is that socialist society and its economic system must be conceived not only as a "negation of the past," but also as capable of assimilating "all the best" that has emerged from the earlier history of human civilization. This is the context in which Abalkin invokes the relevance to the Soviet system of the market mechanism, cooperatives, economic competition, entrepreneurship, and "democratic institutions and moral norms. " As for the projected extension of the market mechanism, Abalkin makes it clear that this is intended to encompass "a credit market, and a market for investment resources and securities. " This is obviously connected with the new conception of "centralized management" as involving reliance on instruments like taxes, interest rates, rents, and prices rather than the more familiar "directive" assignments in order to implement planning objectives. ...|$|R
