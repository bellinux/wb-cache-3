The antioxidant properties of carotenoids are postulated to protect the roots from PPD (basically an oxidative process). Finally, tolerance was also observed in a waxy-starch (amylose-free) mutant.

The ability to experience reward increased with the number of ‘Met’ alleles. Also, the effect of different genotype was greater for events that were felt as more pleasant. The effect size of genotypic moderation was quite large: Subjects with the val/val genotype generated almost similar amounts of subjective well-being from a ‘very pleasant event’ as met/met subjects did from a ‘bit pleasant event’. Genetic variation with functional impact on cortical dopamine tone has a strong influence on reward experience in the flow of daily life. In one study participants with the met/met phenotype described an increase of positive affect twice as high in amplitude as participants with the val/val phenotype following very pleasant or pleasant events.|$|E

Other authors have disagreed and have stated that these traits can overlap and vary within the two (Crockford 1999; Harrison 1973). Wolf cubs have similar relative skull proportions as adult dogs and this was proposed {{as evidence that the}} domestic dog is a neotenic wolf.

A 2004 study that used 310 wolf skulls and over 700 dog skulls representing 100 breeds concluded that the evolution of dog skulls can generally not be described by heterochronic processes such as neoteny although some pedomorphic dog breeds have skulls that resemble the skulls of juvenile wolves.

40|$|Single-gene {{speciation}} {{is considered}} to be unlikely, but an excellent example is found in land snails, in which a gene for left-right reversal has given rise to new species multiple times. This reversal might be facilitated by their small population sizes and maternal effect (i. e., "delayed inheritance", in which an individual. s phenotype is determined by the genotype of its mother). Recent evidence suggests that a <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of the speciation gene on anti-predator survival may also promote speciation. Here we theoretically demonstrate that, without a <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effect,</b> in small populations the fixation probability of a recessive mutant is higher than a dominant mutant, but they are identical for large populations and sufficiently weak selection. With a <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effect</b> that increases mutant viability, a dominant mutant has a higher fixation probability if the strength of viability selection is sufficiently greater than that of reproductive isolation, whereas a recessive mutant has a higher fixation probability otherwise. Delayed inheritance increases the fixation probability of a mutant if viability selection is weaker than reproductive isolation. Our results clarify the conflicting effects of viability selection and positive frequency-dependent selection due to reproductive isolation and provide a new perspective to single-gene speciation theory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Pleiotropic {{effects of}} a drug are actions other than those for which the agent was {{specifically}} developed. These effects may be related or unrelated to the primary mechanism of action of the drug, and they are usually unanticipated. <b>Pleiotropic</b> <b>effects</b> may be undesirable (such as side effects or toxicity), neutral, or, as is especially the case with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), beneficial. <b>Pleiotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of statins include improvement of endothelial dysfunction, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory responses, and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. These and several other emergent properties could act {{in concert with the}} potent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effects of statins to exert early as well as lasting cardiovascular protective <b>effects.</b> Understanding the <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of statins is important to optimize their use in treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which statins are beneficial are incompletely understood. While the lowering of low-density lipoprotein concentration is associated with regression of atherosclerosis, the observed benefit of statin therapy begins within months after its initiation, making regression an unlikely cause. Although LDL-C lowering is the main mechanism by which statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events, evidence suggests {{that at least some}} of the beneficial actions of statins may be mediated by their <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effects.</b> Thus, statins may modulate the function of cardiovascular cells and key signalling proteins, including small G-proteins, to ultimately exert their <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effects.</b> Sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) is a naturally occurring bioactive lysophospholipid that regulates diverse physiological functions in a variety of different organ systems. Within the cardiovascular system, S 1 P mediates cardioprotection following ischemia/reperfusion injury, anti-inflammatory response, improvement of endothelial function, increased mobilization and differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells, inhibition of oxidation, and anti-atherogenic and anti-thrombotic actions. Early evidence suggests that the <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of statins may be related to an increase in S 1 P signalling. This review focuses on S 1 P signalling as the potential mechanism underlying the <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of statins. An improved understanding of this mechanism may be vital for establishing the clinical relevance of statins and their importance in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease. Key points Several studies have demonstrated a benefit from lowering serum LDL-C with statins in patients with and without clinical evidence of CAD. These may be mediated by the <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of statins-the mechanisms of which are incompletely understood. Early evidence suggests that statins may increase S 1 P signalling pathways through upregulation of the expression of S 1 P receptors and an increase in plasma levels of S 1 P to ultimately exert their <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effects.</b> Future clinical trials and basic science research aimed at the underlying mechanisms of the <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of statins should enlighten us to their relative clinical relevance and importance...|$|R

40|$|Pleiotropy {{refers to}} the shared effects of a gene or genes on {{multiple}} phenotypes, {{a major reason for}} genetic correlation between phenotypes. For example, for osteoporosis, bone mineral densities at different skeletal sites may share common genetic factors; thus, examining the shared effects of genes may enable more effective fracture treatments. To date, methods are not available for estimating and testing the pleiotropic effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genetic association studies. In this dissertation, we explore two types of methods to evaluate the SNP-specific <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effect</b> based on multivariate techniques. First, we propose two approaches based on variance components (VC) analysis for family-based studies, which quantify and test the <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effect</b> by examining the contribution of specific genetic marker(s) to polygenic correlation or covariance of traits. Second, we propose a multivariate linear regression approach for population-based studies with samples of families or unrelated subjects. This method partitions the specific effect of the marker(s) from phenotypic covariance. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods in simulation studies, compare them to existing multivariate analysis methods and illustrate their application using real data to assess candidate SNPs for osteoporosis-related phenotypes in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study. In contrast to existing methods, our newly proposed approaches allow the quantification of pleiotropic effects. The bootstrap resampling percentile method is used to construct confidence intervals for statistical hypothesis testing. Simulation results suggest that the VC-based approaches are affected by the polygenic correlation level. The covariance analysis approach outperforms the VC-based approaches, with unbiased estimates and better power, which remain consistent regardless of the polygenic correlation. In addition, the covariance analysis approach is simple to implement and can be applied to both family data and genetically unrelated data. Using simulation, we also show that existing methods, such as MANOVA, can have high rejection rates when a SNP has a large effect on a single trait, which prevent us from using them for <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effect</b> analysis. In summary, this dissertation introduces promising new approaches in multiple phenotypic models for SNP-specific <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E
