5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum <b>peat</b> <b>moss,</b> sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, <b>peat</b> <b>moss,</b> gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E

5|$|Like all milk caps, L.volemus forms ectomycorrhizae, {{mutually}} beneficial symbiotic associations with various tree species. In this association, the fungal hyphae grow around {{the root of}} the plant and between its cortical cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward into the soil, increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil. It is found growing at the base of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in <b>peat</b> <b>moss</b> beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, the British Moss Litter Company was formed, from an {{amalgamation}} of the Hatfield Chase <b>Peat</b> <b>Moss</b> Litter Company, the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Company, {{and most}} of the other companies working on the moors. They gained control of works at Creyke's Siding and Moorends to the west, Medge Hall to the south, Swinefleet to the east, and Old Goole in the north, together with the mill on Hatfield Moors. Old Goole mill closed in 1902, although peat was stored there for another twelve years. The new company did not have complete control of the moors, as there were several small independent peat works on Crowle Moor. The company was restructured in 1899, by winding up the original company and creating a new one with the same name but additional working capital. At the same time, Swinefleet Works was formally purchased, whereas it had been leased by the old company. Sales of peat rose steadily from 39,444 tons in 1893 to 74,948 tons in 1898.|$|E

40|$|Heat waves, {{which are}} {{projected}} to be more frequent and intense in a warmer climate, could become {{a serious threat to}} plants that rely on water surplus availability, such as bryophytes. Here, I take the advantage of the European summer 2003 climate anomaly {{to assess the impact of}} an extreme heat wave on <b>peat</b> <b>mosses</b> of the genus Sphagnum, a group of bryophytes forming the bulk of living and dead biomass in peatlands. With this aim, 20 selected bogs in the Italian Alps were checked for Sphagnum survival in the years following the heat wave. Over the study area, the period May–September 2003 was characterized by higher mean monthly air temperature (13. 5 C) and lower mean monthly precipitation (87 mm) compared with normal climatic conditions (11. 5 C and 117 mm, respectively) so that the heat wave coincided with a drought spell. As a consequence of the unusual water stress, I documented an increased mortality of <b>peat</b> <b>mosses</b> forming high hummocks. In particular, at habitat scale, the distribution of desiccated <b>peat</b> <b>mosses</b> was restricted to the hummock face receiving the greatest amount of solar irradiation. However, at regional scale, the present study identified a climatic threshold, simply defined by the ratio of precipitation to temperature (P : T), which triggered an irreversible desiccation of <b>peat</b> <b>mosses</b> when mean monthly P : T dropped below 6. 5 (mm:C) during May–September 2003. The absence of any sign of recovery after 4 years since the drought must be seen as a harbinger of the deleterious effects of extreme heat waves on organisms not adapted to cope with abrupt climate anomaly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ombrotrophic peatlands in North America are {{harvested}} mainly for horticultural purposes. Following intense exploitation, these peatlands are generally abandoned to natural regeneration. The abandoned sites usually remain barren or poorly revegetated {{by a few}} vascular plants for several years. The post-harvested sites are not usually recolonized by Sphagnutn species (<b>peat</b> <b>mosses),</b> which are the key species to restore peatland functions. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop restoration techniques for post-harvested peatlands. The experiments centred on Sphagnum reintroduction, since <b>peat</b> <b>mosses</b> are responsible for peat accumulation. Vegetative Sphagnutn fragments were used as diaspores. Various methods of Sphagnum reintroduction were tested to ensure reliable colonization. A microrelief formed of ridges and depressions provided humid conditions in depressions which favored Sphagnutn establishment. Reintroducing Sphagtlritrl diaspores in combination with such companion plant species as Eriophorurn arzgrtstifoliutn also had a positive effect on the survival of <b>peat</b> <b>mosses.</b> A phosphorus amendment led to improved establishment of Sphagna and companion plant species.

25|$|Sphagnum is a genus of {{approximately}} 380 accepted species of mosses, {{commonly known as}} <b>peat</b> <b>moss.</b> Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for {{a wide array of}} peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. <b>Peat</b> <b>moss</b> can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.|$|E
25|$|Individual <b>peat</b> <b>moss</b> plants {{consist of}} a main stem, with tightly {{arranged}} clusters of branch fascicles usually consisting {{of two or three}} spreading branches and two to four hanging branches. The top of the plant, or capitulum, has compact clusters of young branches. Along the stem are scattered leaves of various shapes, named stem leaves; the shape varies according to species. The leaves consist of two kinds of cells; small, green, living cells (chlorophyllose cells), and large, clear, structural, dead cells (hyaline cells). The latter have the large water-holding capacity.|$|E
25|$|Decayed, dried {{sphagnum}} moss has {{the name of}} peat or <b>peat</b> <b>moss.</b> This {{is used as a}} soil conditioner which increases the soil's capacity to hold water and nutrients by increasing capillary forces and cation exchange capacity. This is often necessary when dealing with very sandy soil, or plants that need increased or steady moisture content to flourish. A distinction is sometimes made between {{sphagnum moss}}, the live moss growing on top of a peat bog, and 'sphagnum peat moss' (North American usage) or 'sphagnum peat' (British usage), the latter being the slowly decaying matter underneath.|$|E
