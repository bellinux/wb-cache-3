A theoretical model is developed for a market where these externalities are particularly relevant: the intra-day credit market, which {{is crucial for}} the operation of an efficient payments system. A central bank participating actively in this market has two features that distinguishes it from the other banks: first, it is a <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> <b>bank</b> and may therefore be considered as maximizing welfare; secondly, it cannot become illiquid, and therefore it does not impose any systemic risk on other banks.

40|$|Due to {{the unknown}} future {{economic}} situation of students, private banks {{are unwilling to}} provide student loans {{in the absence of}} collateral. This market failure requires government intervention to prevent socially sub-optimal and regressive outcomes. Income contingent loans, whose repayment depends on the borrowers' future capacity to pay, can offer a possible solution to this problem. In this paper, we compare alternative income contingent loans for financing tuition fees at German universities. Several German states have introduced tuition fees at their universities since summer 2007 and <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> <b>banks</b> have started to offer student loans to cover these fees. Our empirical findings highlight the benefits of income contingent loans and demonstrate that tuition fees at German universities could increase considerably if an income contingent loan system would be implemented to provide students with the financial resources they need to pay these fees.

40|$|At least 12 European Union {{member states}} used {{publicly}} created asset management companies (AMCs), {{otherwise known as}} a "badbanks" {{to respond to the}} recent financial crisis. This tool remains an option for future bank resolutions under the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. We assess the design of AMCs in the recent crisis and why their form has changed. Through its role as definer of statistical concepts used under the Stability and Growth Pact, Eurostat has affected the design of AMCs. Increasingly stringent rulings on whether AMCs count as debt have pushed member states to create similar types of AMCs, namely those with majority private-sector ownership. We argue that privately owned AMCs act differently to <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> ones. In particular, private AMCs usually impose larger haircuts on the price they pay for the assets they acquire. This haspositive benefits for how profitable the AMC will be and how much it will help in avoiding the creation of zombie banks and zombie badbanks. There are important caveats. The effect of Eurostat's accounting rules on decision-making is stronger in countries with more strained budgets. Also, when the public <b>owns</b> a failed <b>bank,</b> Eurostat rulesare likely to have little impact on AMC ownership decisions. Governments tend to use <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> bad <b>banks</b> to resolve <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> failed <b>banks.</b> This is because it is difficult to compel private sector involvement in these situations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{an important}} contemporary issue; namely {{the implementation of}} the Basel Accord worldwide. The Basel Accord provides a series of measures to improve the stability of the world’s financial system but its implementation poses a number of challenges for both developing and emerging economies. Pakistan faces a number of unique challenges in this regard due to its recent economic expansion {{and the fact that the}} rate at which the Basel Accord is being adopted lags behind that of other countries. This paper throws light on this and a number of related issues due to a combination of the novelty of the survey data from risk managers coupled with a rigorous statistical analysis. Results reflect that the Basel Accord is generally well regarded due to its underlying aims of improved capital standards and a scientific treatment of risk. However, operational risk emerges as a key barrier to implementation in Pakistan. A number of further obstacles are highlighted, which, do seem to have been addressed although only with a partial degree of success. Privately <b>owned</b> <b>banks</b> appear to be more technically competent and more favourably disposed towards implementation than <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> <b>banks.</b> ...|$|R

This enabled us to investigate the efficiency of these banks pre- and- post liberalization. However, the periods were before the consolidation exercise of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) headed by both Soludo and Sanusi. This enabled us compare the results with the outcome of those consolidation exercises. The result shows that on the average Nigerian banks were not efficient within the periods of study. However, it showed that liberalization improved the efficiency of banks in Nigeria, though the improvement did not last as some of the banks started sliding in efficiency with continued liberalization. This tends to support the consolidation exercises which were actions taken along with the liberalization exercise to save the banks. Furthermore, the study shows that some of the banks that collapsed during the 2006 consolidation exercise had their efficiencies continuously on the decline. Same with some of the banks that were declared problematic by Sanusi.

50|$|According to economists, Yemen's {{financial}} services sector is underdeveloped and {{dominated by the}} banking system. Yemen has no public stock exchange. The banking system consists of the Central Bank of Yemen, 15 commercial banks (nine private domestic banks, four of which are Islamic banks; four private foreign banks; and two state-owned banks), and two specialized state-owned development banks. The Central Bank of Yemen controls monetary policy and oversees the transfer of currencies abroad.

40|$|<b>Publicly</b> <b>owned</b> or {{commissioned}} <b>banks</b> {{were common}} in Europe from the 15 th century. This survey argues {{that while the}} early public banks were characterized by great experimentation in their design, a common goal {{was to create a}} liquid and reliable monetary asset in environments where such assets were rare or unavailable. The success of these banks was, however, never guaranteed, and even well-run banks could become unstable over time as their success made them susceptible to fiscal exploitation. The popularization of bearer notes in the 18 th century broadened the user base for the public banks' money but was also accompanied by increased fiscal abuse. Wartime demands of the Napoleonic Era resulted in the reorganization or dissolution of many early public banks. A prominent exception was the Bank of England, whose adept management of a fiscally backed money provided a foundation for the development of central banks as they exist today...|$|R
40|$|Government-owned {{development}} {{banks have}} often been justified {{by the need to}} respond to financial market imperfections that hinder the establishment and growth of promising businesses, and as a result, stifle economic development more generally. However, evidence on the effectiveness of these banks in mitigating financial constraints is still lacking. To fill this gap, this paper analyzes the impact of Bancoldex, Colombia's <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> development <b>bank,</b> on access to credit. It uses a unique dataset that contains key characteristics of all loans issued to businesses in Colombia, including the financial intermediary through which the loan was granted and whether the loan was funded with Bancoldex resources. The paper assesses effects on access to credit by comparing Bancoldex loans to loans from other sources and study the impact of receiving credit from Bancoldex on a firm's subsequent credit history. To address concerns about selection bias, it uses a combination of models that control for fixed effects and matching techniques. The findings herein show that credit relationships involving Bancoldex funding are characterized by lower interest rates, larger loans, and loans with longer terms. These characteristics translated into lower average interest rates and larger average loans for firms that used Bancoldex credit. Average loans of Bancoldex' beneficiaries also exhibit longer terms, although this effect can take two years to materialize. Finally, the findings show evidence of a demonstration effect of Bancoldex: beneficiary firms that have access Bancoldex credit are able to significantly expand the number of intermediaries with whom they have credit relationships. ...|$|R
