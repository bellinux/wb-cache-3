One bottom trawler can put more than 10 {{times the amount of}} suspended solids pollution per hour into the water column than all the suspended solids pollution from all the sewerage, industrial, river and dredge disposal operations in Southern California combined. These turbidity plumes can be seen on Google Earth in areas where they have high resolution offshore photos (see Bottom trawling). When the turbidity plumes from bottom trawlers are below a thermocline, the surface may not be impacted, but less visible impacts can still occur, such as <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> transfer into the pelagic food chain.|$|E
25|$|DDT is a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> that {{is readily}} adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as {{long-term}} sources of exposure affecting organisms. Depending on conditions, its soil half-life {{can range from}} 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water. Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties. DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the Arctic by the phenomenon of global distillation, where they then accumulate in the region's food web.|$|E
25|$|International catastrophes such as {{the wreck}} of the Amoco Cadiz oil tanker off the coast of Brittany in 1978 and the Bhopal {{disaster}} in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage. The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. Most recently the term <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as PBDEs and PFCs among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity {{such as the}} Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.|$|E

Solid waste containing <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> is of special concern, since <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> are <b>persistent,</b> toxic and of high risk to {{human health and the}} environment. The objective of this investigation was to identify critical points in the Serbian system of solid waste and <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> management, to assure the life cycle management of <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> and products containing these chemicals, including prevention and final destruction. Data were collected from the Serbian competent authorities, and led us to identify preventive actions for {{solid waste management}} that should reduce or minimise release of <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> into the environment, and to propose actions necessary for <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> solid waste. The adverse impact of <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> is multidimensional. Owing to the lack of treatment or disposal plants for hazardous waste in Serbia, the only option at the moment to manage <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> waste is to keep it in temporary storage and when conditions are created (primarily financial), such waste should be exported for destruction in hazardous waste incinerators. Meanwhile, it needs to be assured that any <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> management activity does not negatively impact recycling flows or disturb progress towards a more circular economy in Serbia...|$|R

[...] Polychlorinated biphenyls were once widely deployed as dielectric and coolant fluids in electrical apparatus, carbonless copy paper and in heat transfer fluids. [...] Because of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a host of problems were identified. Because of PCBs' environmental toxicity and classification as a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant,</b> PCB production was banned by the United States Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PCBs cause cancer in animals and are probable human carcinogens. Many rivers and buildings including schools, parks, and other sites are contaminated with PCBs, {{and there have been}} contaminations of food supplies with the substances.|$|E
