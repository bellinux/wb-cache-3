40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the effect degranulation of B cells on their immunohistochemical detection and to evaluate whether this effect depends on the technique of immunological detection. The biological model is the pancreatic insulin-containing B cell. To decrease the insulin content of the <b>pancreas,</b> <b>insulin</b> release <b>was</b> stimulated by five intraperitoneal injections of glibenclamide (2 mg/kg). Specimens of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>were</b> taken for <b>insulin</b> extraction and quantitation by radioimmunoassay (RIA), ultrastructural analyses and immunocytochemistry. The sections were treated either by polyclonal or monoclonal anti-insulin serum at various concentrations and peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique eventually followed by silver amplification. The B-cell insular fraction or relative B-cell area (RBA) was measured with an automatic image analyser. The reference value for the relative B-cell area was established in control rats and corresponds to the ratio of the insular area occupied by immunostained B cells to the islet area. Its value was confirmed by calculation of the area occupied by non-B cells. RIA indicates a decrease of 83 % of the insulin content in treated rats while the number of B granules decreases by 72 % at the ultrastructural level. In usual conditions (polyclonal serum, 1 / 1500) the degranulation leads to a 16 % underestimation of the B-cell insular fraction. This underestimation increases when monoclonal antibodies are used and further increases when higher dilutions are tested. The silver amplification does not prevent this underestimation and, in this particular model, exclusively acts by increasing the contrast. The only means of restoring the correct level of detection is to use the serum at a higher concentration. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

50|$|Diabetes is a {{metabolic}} disorder {{where the body}} is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either {{because of a lack}} of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Both of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and <b>insulin</b> resistance. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> the organ responsible for the secretion of <b>insulin.</b> <b>Insulin</b> <b>is</b> a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions. If the <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the insulin-producing cells in the <b>pancreas</b> could <b>be</b> damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the <b>insulin</b> that the <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.|$|R

PRESENTATION OF CASEA 40 -year-old woman, who underwent hysterectomy, left oophorectomy, omentectomy and lymp node dissection for leiomyosarcoma of the uterus. At the follow up, the patient complained of non-specific abdominal discomfort. Preoperative diagnosis were pancreatic pseudocyst, cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. At laparotomy, a cystic mass {{was found in the}} tail of the <b>pancreas</b> which <b>was</b> invased to the transverse colon mesenterium and the spleen.
