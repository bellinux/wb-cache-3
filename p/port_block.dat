50|$|The FNC's barrel {{features}} a flash suppressor {{that is also}} used to launch NATO standard 22mm rifle grenades (only the standard rifle model has this capability). The gas block contains a gas valve setting that is used to isolate the gas system, providing an increased volume of propellant required to fire a rifle grenade. The sheet-metal gas valve switch when pulled upright, acts as a V-notch sight used for aiming the rifle grenades. The piston head and extension, as well as the gas <b>port</b> <b>block,</b> barrel bore and chamber, are hard-chrome plated to minimize the effects of propellant fouling.|$|E

50|$|<b>Port</b> <b>blocking</b> {{includes}} the deliberate decision by ISPs to deny onward transmission of traffic, or delivery of traffic, to an intended recipient. ISPs {{do not have}} a legitimate reason to deny onward packet transmission to specific customers of other ISPs. The ISPs have contractually committed to carry any and all packets from the former ISP without regard for the identity and marketplace success of that ISP’s customers (on a first-come, first-served basis). However, an ISP is more likely to have higher incentives for <b>port</b> <b>blocking</b> when the ISP is vertically and horizontally integrated because those integrated companies attempt to enhance the marketplace attractiveness of corporate affiliates. For example, AT&T blocked Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) because the company was concerned that the VoIP service might threaten its wireless and wired telephony service. Thus, an ISP can engage in <b>port</b> <b>blocking</b> for VoIP traffic when giving preference to an affiliated telephone company.|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} issue in multicast communication {{is how to}} identify multicast groups. In the Internet, multicast addresses and port numbers distinguish multicast groups from each other. Multicast addresses are used within the network to route the multicast traffic to its destination hosts, whereas port numbers are used within the hosts to demultiplex multiple traffic among the host processes. For a process to join a multicast group, it must join both the address and the port number of the group. Within a host, port numbers {{can be considered as}} a limited resource. In general, if a port is already allocated to a process, it cannot be assigned to another one at the same time. This implies that a process {{may not be able to}} join a multicast group if the port number of that group is already occupied in the host by another process. This paper focuses on the <b>port</b> <b>blocking</b> problem. Mainly, the paper introduces models and techniques to measure multicast <b>port</b> <b>blocking.</b> First, it presents an experimental work in the study of the problem of <b>port</b> <b>blocking.</b> Second, it introduces two models of the problem: analytical model and simulation model. Results obtained from both the experimental work and the developed models show that <b>port</b> <b>blocking</b> plays an active role in multicast address management and the overall multicast communication. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The steam {{needs to}} be fed into {{the end of the}} {{cylinder}} {{at just the right time}} in the cycle to push the piston in the correct direction. In the other direction, the steam {{needs to be}} allowed to escape from the cylinder. As the crankshaft rotates, the piston rod moves up and down (or side to side in the case of a vertical cylinder) as well as in and out. Because the piston rod is rigid and the piston itself is long relative to its diameter, this causes the cylinder to rock, or [...] "oscillate" [...] on its special mounting (trunnion). In the design usually found in a toy or model engine, a hole in the side of the cylinder (one at each end for a double-acting cylinder) and a pair of holes in the <b>port</b> <b>block</b> are arranged so that this rocking motion lines up the holes at the correct times, allowing steam to enter the cylinder in one direction and to escape into the atmosphere or condenser in the other direction.|$|E

CORE Generator is mainly {{used to create}} high density, high performance designs in Xilinx FPGAs in less time. The CORE Generator is included with the ISE WebPack and ISE Foundation software and comes with an extensive library of Xilinx LogiCORE IP. These include DSP functions, memories, storage elements, math functions {{and a variety of}} basic elements. Xilinx provides a flexible Block Memory Generator core to create compact, high-performance memories running at up to 450 MHz.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel measurement-based effort to {{quantify}} the prevalence of Internet “port <b>blocking.</b> ” <b>Port</b> <b>blocking</b> {{is a form of}} policy control that relies on the coupling between applications and their assigned transport <b>port.</b> Networks <b>block</b> traffic on specific ports, and the coincident applications, for technical, economic or regulatory reasons. Quantifying <b>port</b> <b>blocking</b> is technically interesting and highly relevant to current network neutrality debates. Our scheme induces a large number of widely distributed hosts into sending packets to an IP address and port of our choice. By intelligently selecting these “referrals, ” our infrastructure enables us to construct a per-BGP prefix map of the extent of discriminatory blocking, with emphasis on contentious ports, i. e. VPNs, email, file sharing, etc. Our results represent some of the first measurements of network neutrality and aversion. ...|$|R

40|$|This project geneates a vga {{signal and}} {{displays}} {{a set of}} characters generated from character ROM. The rom entity itself was generated using the Xilinx CORE Generator. The XStend board is not needed in this project, {{except for the fact}} that I possibly still have some pin references to it. Xilinx Core Generator The XSA- 100 board frequency must be set to 25 MHz! The core generator provides a nice interface to generate cores for Xilinx chips, duh! After starting a “project ” (a place to store information related to building a new core) and answering a few questions a core is generated in the form of an EDIF file. The core generator was used in this project to generate a character rom entity. Follow these steps to recreate the char_rom. edn file. 1) Open Core Generator (version 5. 1. 03 i) and start a new project. 2) Set target architecture to Spartan 2 (this project is targeted at XSA- 100 board). Also under “Design Entry ” select “Exemplar”. Why? Because if you leave the setting at “ISE ” you will most likely get an error. I found reference to this error on the Xilinx site, which claimed that it’s more of a warning, but I don’t get the EDIF file I need, so select Exemplar. 3) Select “Memories & Storage Elements”, and then select “RAMs & ROMs”. 4) Select a “Single <b>Port</b> <b>Block</b> Memory ” (version 4). A dialog will open asking all sorts of questions. 5) Name the component. I call it “char_rom”. Set “Port Configuration ” to “Read Only ” and select “Memory Size ” width to be 8 bits, by Depth of 512. 6) Click “Next> ” twice to move to page 3. Nothing to do on page 2. 7) I selected the “Select Primitive ” option and specified 512 x 8. This should use the Xilinx primitive for a Block Ram resource. 8) On the last page, page 4, click on “Load Init File ” and select the charRomData. coe file. This file describes the initial contents of the block ram. It contains all the character data. 9) Click on “Generate ” at the bottom of the page to create the char_rom. edn file to be included in your project. Just copy the file to the root directory location (the one with make. bat and clean. bat) so that it will be found...|$|E

50|$|While {{the network}} {{neutrality}} debate continues, network providers often enter into peering arrangements among themselves. These agreements often stipulate how certain information flows should be treated. In addition, network providers often implement various policies such as <b>blocking</b> of <b>port</b> 25 to prevent insecure systems from serving as spam relays, or other ports commonly used by decentralized music search applications implementing peer-to-peer networking models. They also present {{terms of service}} that often include rules {{about the use of}} certain applications as part of their contracts with users. Most consumer Internet providers implement policies like these. The MIT Mantid <b>Port</b> <b>Blocking</b> Measurement Project is a measurement effort to characterize Internet <b>port</b> <b>blocking</b> and potentially discriminatory practices. However, the effect of peering arrangements among network providers are only local to the peers that enter into the arrangements and cannot affect traffic flow outside their scope.|$|R
