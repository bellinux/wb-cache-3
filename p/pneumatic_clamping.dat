40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{allows the}} measurement of the thermal conductance across a thin sample clamped between metal plates, including thermal boundary resistances. It allows in-situ variation of the clamping force from zero to 30 lb (133. 4 N), and variation of the sample temperature between 40 and 300 K. It has a special design feature that minimizes the effect of thermal radiation on this measurement. The apparatus includes a heater plate sandwiched between two identical thin samples. On the side of each sample opposite the heater plate is a cold plate. In order to take data, the heater plate is controlled at a slightly higher temperature than the two cold plates, which are controlled at a single lower temperature. The steady-state controlling power supplied to the hot plate, the area and thickness of samples, and the temperature drop across the samples are then used in a simple calculation of the thermal conductance. The conductance measurements can be taken at arbitrary temperatures down to about 40 K, as the entire setup is cooled by a mechanical cryocooler. The specific geometry combined with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamping</b> force control system and the steady-state temperature control approach make this a unique apparatus...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to outline the path and methods used to design a {{specimen}} fixture for the testing and analysis of fiber reinforced composites subjected to impact loading. This design is done {{in support of the}} California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo Structures and Composites Laboratory. The design request was made at the request of Dr. Eltahry Elghandour to support the graduate students Kodi A. Rider and Y. Vanessa Wood in their master’s degree thesis projects. The design request involved the design of a specimen fixture compatible with the existing impact apparatus located in the laboratory. The apparatus is an Instron Dynatup 8250 HV Drop Weight Impact Testor. The design must adhere to the requirements of the testing standard ASTM D 7136 except as noted by Dr. Elghandour where the testing fixture was to be operated by a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamping</b> system. The specimen fixture was designed to be made of 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy. Finite element analysis was used to determine the maximum impact load that the specimen fixture could safely withstand. According to the operator’s manual of the impact tester, the maximum impact load that the specimen fixture would need to withstand was 100 lb at a velocity of 6 m/s, which translates to a force of about 31000 lbf. After structural analysis using SolidWorks Simulation FEA, the highest impact load the specimen fixture design could withstand was 45000 lbf, at which point plastic deformation would begin to occur at the welds of the central core tubular support assembly. This load far exceeds the load as specified in the operator’s manual. The specimen fixture was then fabricated and assembled by myself and installed into the Dynatup 8250 apparatus with the aid of Kodi A. Rider. The fixture was then tested using a ½ inch thick foam and carbon fiber sandwich plate at maximum velocity and showed no signs of plastic deformation or fracture failure...|$|E
40|$|Hot forging {{of complex}} part is usually {{performed}} as multi-stage process. Therefore, forming sequence design together with preform shapes {{is a very}} challenging engineering problem with numerous possible solutions. In past, the conventional approach to the forming sequence design has been empirical and mainly based on trial and error procedure that is time and money consuming. Nowadays, with development of CAE technique and software packages {{it is possible to}} design entire forging process in digital environment, more effectively and more reliably. In this paper hot forging process of part with complex geometry such is <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamp</b> (yoke like element), is considered. The shape of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamp</b> is very unfavorable for forging technology and therefore defects and part inaccuracy as well short lifetime of forging tools are common. In order to overcome the existing problems Finite Volume (FV) analysis of forging process has been conducted by using Simufact.

50|$|Milling {{operations}} tend {{to involve}} large, straight cuts that produce lots of chips and involve varying force. Locating and supporting areas must usually be large and very sturdy {{in order to}} accommodate milling operations; strong clamps are also a requirement. Due to the vibration of the machine, positive stops are preferred over friction for securing the workpiece. For high-volume automated processes, milling fixtures usually involve hydraulic or <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamps.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{spatially}} controlled {{synthesis of}} nanowire bundles of the functional crystalline coordination polymer (CP) Ag(I) TCNQ (tetracyanoquinodimethane) from previously fabricated and trapped monovalent silver CP (Ag(I) Cys (cysteine)) using a room-temperature microfluidic-assisted templated growth method is demonstrated. The incorporation of microengineered <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamps</b> in a two-layer polydimethylsiloxane-based (PDMS) microfluidic platform was used. Apart from guiding {{the formation of}} the Ag(I) Cys coordination polymer, this microfluidic approach enables a local trapping of the in situ synthesized structures with a simple <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamp</b> actuation. This method not only enables continuous and multiple chemical events to be conducted upon the trapped structures, but the excellent fluid handling ensures a precise chemical activation of the amino acid-supported framework in a position controlled by interface and clamp location that leads to a site-specific growth of Ag(I) TCNQ nanowire bundles. The synthesis is conducted stepwise starting with Ag(I) Cys CPs, going through silver metal, and back to a functional CP (Ag(I) TCNQ); that is, a novel microfluidic controlled ligand exchange (CP → NP → CP) is presented. Additionally, the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamps</b> can be employed further to integrate the conductive Ag(I) TCNQ nanowire bundles onto electrode arrays located on a surface, hence facilitating the construction of the final functional interfaced systems from solution specifically with no need for postassembly manipulation. This localized self-supported growth of functional matter from an amino acid-based CP shows how sequential localized chemistry in a fluid cell can be used to integrate molecular systems onto device platforms using a chip incorporating microengineered pneumatic tools. The control of clamp pressure and in parallel the variation of relative flow rates of source solutions permit deposition of materials at different locations on a chip that could be useful for device array preparation. The in situ reaction and washing procedures make this approach a powerful one for the fabrication of multicomponent complex nanomaterials using a soft bottom-up approach. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} primary {{stability}} of two minimally invasive procedures of Achilles tendon (AT) repair, namely a modified percutaneous repair of ruptured AT and the Achillon suture configuration. METHODS: Eighteen (nine matched pairs) frozen ovine ATs were tenotomized 5 cm from the calcaneal insertion. In each pair, one tendon was randomly allocated {{to one of}} the two techniques: a modified percutaneous repair group and the Achillon device suture configuration. Specimens were tested performing an unidirectional tensile load to failure using a servo-hydraulic testing device (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN, USA), controlled by an electropulse e 3000 INSTRON machine (Instron Ltd, Buckinghamshire, UK). The tendons were then loaded to failure at a rate of 10 mm/s. RESULTS: Two of the nine pairs of specimens were discarded because one specimen for each of the pair pulled out of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamp</b> during mechanical testing. The remaining seven matched pairs were successfully tested. There were no differences in mean strength, mean maximum load, mean failure elongation, tension, stiffness and mode of failure between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The Achillon-like configuration and the modified percutaneous repair of ruptured AT provided similar biomechanical performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been made on the cam-clamping device. In this article, we consider specifically the calculations of cam geometry, calculations of clamping force and clamping torque, conditions for self-locking, and conditions for contact strength. Machine fixtures are essential {{in the process of}} mechanical manufacturing. There are many different types of fixtures, such as manual jig, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamps,</b> hydraulic fixtures, electric fixtures, etc. There are also many ways of clamping, such as incline clamp, screw clamp, eccentric circle clamp, hinge clamp [1], among which the eccentric circle clamp finds wide applications, especially in fast-clamping devices. Although the circular eccentric fixture possesses the advantages of simple structure, convenient manufacturing, and low cost, it suffers the drawbacks of small clamping force, short clamping-surface travel distance, and unreliable self-locking mechanism. The cam-clamping device discussesed in this article involves replaceing the eccentric circle with a cam, as shown in Fig. 1. The cam profile curve can be designed according to any requirements. The advantages of this replacement are obvious, in addition to preserving the advantages of the circular eccentric fixture, the cam-clamping can be designed according to the actual needs of clamping paths and selection of the appropriate cam profile to improve the self-locking...|$|R
40|$|The human aortic valve, {{in cases}} of disease, can be {{substituted}} with a stentless biological prosthesis that is made of both porcine aortic root and leaflets. In particular, the aortic root plays {{a very important part}} in the opening mechanics of the valve. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of the prosthesis, a knowledge of the mechanical characteristics of each element constituting the system is useful. For a structural and mechanical characterisation of the porcine aortic root wall tissue, specific measuring devices are made. A uni-axial tensile apparatus, operating in a temperature-controlled saline bath, is equipped with special <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamps.</b> A test rig for the measurement of the specimen cross-sectional area is developed. To determine the porcine aortic root wall mechanical properties, 189 tensile tests are carried out. Specimens of both natural and chemically fixed tissue are used to consider the conditions of both natural valves and prostheses. Tensile tests are carried out on both axial and circumferential specimens taken from 12 areas of one-sixth of the entire aortic root, with the aim of identifying the anisotropic and non-homogeneous behaviour of the tissue. The behavior changes considerably depending on the direction in which the specimen is strained, the chemical treatment and the zone from which it has been taken. The paper presents the stress-strain characteristics of fresh and fixed tissue in all zones of the aortic wall, both in circumferential and axial directions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{examine the}} {{longitudinal}} migratory force required to cause disconnection of the bifurcated distal body component from the tubular proximal {{body of a}} fenestrated stent-graft. MethodsUsing a previously reported mathematical model distal distraction forces were calculated prior to performing in vitro pullout testing. The top end of the proximal body and the iliac limbs of the distal body were attached to the grips of a tensile tester via plastic sealing plugs and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamps.</b> Channels within the plugs allowed pressurisation of {{the inside of the}} stent-graft. Pullout tests were conducted in the vertical plane. Force and displacement data were recorded and tests repeated 8 times at room temperature with the stent-grafts either dry or wet and unpressurized, at 100  mmHg or at 120  mmHg. ResultsThe median maximum pullout force was 2. 9  N (2. 6 – 4. 1) when dry, 3. 9  N (3. 5 – 5. 4) when wet and unpressurized, 6. 3  N (4. 8 – 8. 3) when wet and pressurized at 100  mmHg and 6. 5  N (4. 8 – 7. 2) when wet and pressurized at 120  mmHg. There was a significant difference between pressurized and unpressurized conditions (P <  0. 01). ConclusionsThe force required to distract the distal bifurcated component of a fenestrated stent graft is much lower than the reported proximal fixation strength of both a standard and fenestrated Zenith stent graft. Although this helps protect the fenestrated proximal body from the effects of longitudinal migration forces in vivo the current strength of the body overlap zone may actually be unnecessarily weak and requires careful surveillance in follow up...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} modification of an immobilized single crystal in a fluid cell is reported, whereby a material with switching functions is generated in situ by generating a chemical reagent in the flow. Crystals of the insulating organic crystal of TCNQ (tetracyanoquinodimethane) were grown in a microfluidic channel and were trapped using a pneumatic valve, a nascent technique for materials manipulation. They were subsequently reduced using solution-deposited silver {{to provide a}} conducting material in situ by a heterogeneous reaction. Removal of the new material from the chip proved {{it to be the}} silver salt of reduced TCNQ. Uniquely, conducting atomic force microscope (CAFM) studies show three regions in the solid. The localized original neutral organic material crystal is shown to be an insulator but to produce areas with Ohmic conducting characteristics after reduction. This inhomogeneous doping provides an opportunity for probing electrical materials properties side by side. Measurements with the CAFM witness this conducting material where the TCNQ is fully transformed to the silver salt. Additionally, an intermediate phase is observed that exhibits bipolar resistive switching typical of programmable resistive memories. Raman microscopy proves the conversion of the material in specific regions and clearly defines the intermediate phase region that could be responsible for the switching effect in related materials. This kind of >on crystal chemistry> exploiting immobilization and masking by a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>clamp</b> in a microfluidic channel shows how material can be selectively converted to give different functionalities in the same material piece, even though it is not a single crystal to single crystal conversion, and beckons exploitation for the preparation of systems relevant for molecular electronics as well as other areas where chemical manipulation of single crystals could be beneficial. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

5000|$|Regardless of {{the collet}} design, the {{operating}} principle is the same: squeeze the collet radially against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction. Under correct conditions, it holds quite securely. Almost all collet chucks achieve the radial squeezing motion via moving one or more male-female pairs of tapered (conical) surfaces axially, which produces the radial squeezing in a highly concentric manner. Depending on the collet design, it can be either pulled (via a threaded section {{at the rear of}} the collet) or pushed (via a threaded cap with a second taper) into a matching conical socket to achieve the clamping action. As the collet is forced into the tapered socket, the collet will contract, gripping the contents of the inner cylinder. (The axial movement of cones is not mandatory, however; a split bushing squeezed radially with a linear force—e.g., set screw, solenoid, spring <b>clamp,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> or hydraulic cylinder—achieves the same principle without the cones; but concentricity can only be had to the extent that the bushing's diameters are perfect for the particular object being held. Thus only in toolroom contexts, such as machine tool tooling creation and setup, is this common.) ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, manufacture, and test a pair of cheap {{gripping}} assemblies with mount adapters to the Instron TT-C tensile testing machine, which is currently out of service in the Materials Laboratory of Central Washington University’s Hogue Technology Building. The gripping assemblies would enable tensile, or pulling force, tests on tensile specimens up to 20, 000 lbs, being able to test high carbon steel. The gripping assemblies and mounting adapters were designed and manufactured completely by a Central Washington University Mechanical Engineering Technology student who used the cumulative knowledge gained from engineering analysis and manufacturing courses over the span of his four years at Central. All design and manufacturing were done using the Central Washington University facilities and laboratories {{with the exception of}} heat treatments which were outsourced. It is estimated that the initial device construction will cost $ 771. 00 and 440 man hours. Most gripping assemblies in industry cost anywhere between $ 6, 000 and $ 15, 000 for assemblies with a 20, 000 lb load capacity. The design of the gripping assemblies is simple with no luxury of hydraulic, <b>pneumatic,</b> or mechanical <b>clamping</b> capabilities. The manufacture of the initial pair of gripping assemblies was unreasonable and robust due to limitations governed by the capabilities of Central Washington University’s lab facilities which also added unreasonable hours to the amount of man hours required. In common industrial factories/warehouses owned by testing machine manufacturers, the amount of man hours would be significantly less...|$|R

The facility has compressed air supply, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and a lightweight robotic arm for {{operation of the}} remote tools. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) developed and tested multiple tools to perform the gasket replacement tasks. Separate pneumatic snap-ring removal tools that use the connector skirt as a reaction surface were developed for removal of the snap ring and spent gasket on both vertical and horizontal Hanford connectors. A <b>pneumatic</b> tool that <b>clamps</b> and centers on the jumper pipe ID was developed to simultaneously install the new gasket and snap ring. A pneumatic snap-ring-loading tool was developed that compresses the snap ring and places it in a groove in the installation tool. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. The entire system has been successfully tested using MSM's to manipulate the various tools. Deployment of the entire system is expected during FY 08. The Hanford connector gasket replacement tooling has been successfully tested using MSM's to manipulate the various tools. Nitric acid is used {{in many of the}} decontamination processes performed in the REDC, where the tooling will be deployed. Although most of the tool components were fabricated/purchased with nitric acid and radioactive service in mind, some of the prototype parts must be replaced with parts that are more compatible with nitric acid/radioactive service.
