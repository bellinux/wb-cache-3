50|$|The {{pictures}} from early Plumbicon cameras were susceptible to comet tails and blooming and, although these effects {{had not been}} a major concern in the previous generation of cameras, which employed vidicon or image orthicon tubes, they were an annoying feature of Plumbicon tubes. The problems arose when the beam current of a <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> was insufficient to fully discharge the target in very bright areas of an image. Reducing the target voltage and increasing the beam current of the <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> helped to mitigate the problem but, with early Plumbicons, this resulted in loss of resolution and increased lag.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 1960s, {{following}} RCAâ€™s lead, other {{versions of}} the 4-tube cameras were produced (see below for details). In many cases, advantage was taken of a newly available <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> (the Plumbicon). This new tube allowed cameras to be smaller and lighter than before.|$|E

50|$|Early cameras used {{thermionic}} valves (vacuum tubes) in {{the first}} stages of the head amplifiers but later FET amplifiers were introduced, such cameras being designated type 2001/1. All other circuitry in the cameras, apart from the <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes,</b> was solid state.|$|R
50|$|The {{circuitry}} in the 2001 was all {{solid state}} {{apart from the}} <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes</b> and, in the early cameras, {{the first stage of}} the head amplifiers. The circuitry made extensive use of the 'ring-of-three' amplifier configuration, shown simplified in the figure. This circuit was easily adapted for various uses.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{application}} {{is a similar}} arrangement in some fuel tanks used in control line model airplanes, where it is called a [...] "uniflow" [...] tank, where the tank venting tubing goes {{to the end of}} the prismatic tank, close to the fuel <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> that feeds the engine; thus, when fuel is consumed, the uniflow tank supplies approximately the same pressure, regardless of the quantity of fuel that remains in the tank for the rest of the flight, which keeps the same carburetor calibration and air-fuel ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Compressed air {{enters the}} inlet port and passes over a needle valve orifice {{attached}} to a <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube.</b> This tube - often equipped with a sintered bronze filter - is submerged into a reservoir bowl filled with light machine oil. Oil is pulled up by the venturi effect, and emitted as an aerosol at the outlet port.

50|$|Basically {{the same}} engine as a Space Bug but {{included}} a two piece fuel tank which was cheaper to make {{than the original}} Space Bug tank. The tank itself is turned aluminium while the tank back is red, yellow or blue plastic from the Space Bug Junior but is modified to include an aluminium <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> and a larger hole to expose the venturi that is integral to the aluminium tank. The later Babe Bee tank was simply a further developed version of this tank. This engine was only produced during 1955 and sold as a mid range sport engine for $5.95. As such not many exist today which makes them very rare and collectible selling for over $300US in 2008 and $1000+ in 2012. Beware of fakes! Some unscrupulous sellers have been selling fake Strato Bugs that have a CNC machined tank and a Space Bug Junior back-plate.|$|E

(Interestingly, this very configuration was {{to be used in the}} Russian 4-tube camera type KT-116M.) ...|$|R
50|$|The EMI 2001 used a 4-way prism {{assembly}} {{to split the}} light into its components, using the same novel principles that had been developed by Philips for their 3-way splitter. These new assemblies used the property of total internal reflection, within the prisms, to direct the light to the <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes.</b> The techniques were described in a patent first filed in 1961. The 3-way prism was also described in {{a description of the}} LDE3 camera.|$|R
50|$|After the EMI board granted {{approval}} for the new camera, in late 1964, work on it progressed rapidly. The camera was to use four Plumbicon <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes,</b> to use solid state circuitry, include a zoom lens as standard and to use prism optics. After the late start, the first fully operational prototype was shown to the BBC and others in 1966, only {{just in time to}} meet BBC time-scales for the introduction of their new colour service.|$|R
5000|$|Rank Taylor Hobson {{declined}} {{to offer a}} zoom lens for EMI's new camera, claiming they were fully committed elsewhere, but the Angenieux Company (see Pierre Angenieux) expressed their interest in supplying zoom lenses for the project. The French company offered two zoom lenses for the camera; {{the first was a}} 10:1 zoom for studio use and the second a larger unit for outside broadcasts. Both could be accommodated within the body of the camera, although the O.B. lens did protrude a little. [...] To accommodate a 4-way prism splitter, extra distance was needed, {{from the back of the}} lens to the image focal plane, when compared to a 3-tube splitter. This set severe demands for the lens designer, but Angenieux were able to achieve EMI's requirements, provided that field flattening lenses were fitted in front of each <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube.</b> Early cameras used this arrangement, but with later zoom designs these lenses became unnecessary.|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for calculating the {{volume flow rate}} in an eccentric-tube centrifugal oil pump for reciprocating compressors. The oil pump assembly consists of a <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> with an inclined inlet that is mounted off-center with the crankshaft symmetry axis. The <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> {{is connected to the}} shaft channel; a helical groove machined on the crankshaft that facilitates the supply of lubricant to the bearings. The analytical models for the <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> and shaft channel were developed independently and were coupled via a numerical procedure to determine the steadystate volume flow rate in the assembly. The steady-state results were verified against a CFD model, which was also used to evaluate the oil flow in the pump assembly during a start-up transient. A parametric analysis was conducted to quantify the influence of the pump geometric parameters, i. e., the <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> diameter and the shaft eccentricity...|$|E

5000|$|Up to 1962, {{television}} studios used 3-tube {{image orthicon}} cameras for programmes in colour. For example, RCA offered the TK-41, GE the PC-15 and PC-25, Marconi the BD848/B3200. [...] They were all big, heavy, cameras (for example, the TK-41 with zoom lens was 5 ft long and it weighed 500 lbs). However, when properly set up, these image orthicon cameras could give pleasing pictures, {{which had the}} sharp crisp look that was a characteristic of the I.O. <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes</b> (see Video camera tube - Image orthicon).|$|R
5000|$|Following their visit, EMI quickly made an {{experimental}} 4-tube camera by cobbling together parts from an EMI Type 203 image orthicon studio camera with parts from an EMI Type 204 three-vidicon industrial colour camera [...] This camera was demonstrated to the BBC {{and received a}} lukewarm reception there. It produced sharp pictures, as expected, but there were problems with colorimetry. [...] Pictures of this camera {{can be found on}} various websites (it is not a pretty camera!). A production version of this camera, the EMI 2000, contained a similar complement of <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes,</b> but was never built.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, {{in order}} to address these {{stability}} problems, RCA announced their prototype four-tube camera. The aims of the designers of the camera were, firstly, to produce a camera that was more tolerant to mis-registration and, secondly, to achieve a lighter camera by using smaller vidicon tubes to replace some of the large heavy IO tubes. The camera had an image orthicon tube for the luminance channel and three vidicon tubes for the colour channels. In addition, the camera was fully transistorized, apart from the four <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes.</b> The camera went into full production in 1963 and sales of several hundred of the model were achieved over the next few years.|$|R
40|$|Although {{avalanche}} amorphous selenium (a-Se) is a {{very promising}} photoconductor {{for a variety of}} imaging applications, it is currently restricted to applications with electron beam readout. This is performed with a vacuum <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> called a High-gain Avalanche Rushing Photoconductor (HARP) Vidicon. The electron beam readout is compatible with high definition television (HDTV) applications, but for use in medical imaging devices it should be replaced by an solid-state electronic readout with a two-dimensional array of metal pixel electrodes. However, due to the high electric field required for avalanche multiplication, it is a technological challenge to avoid dielectric breakdown at the edges, where electric field experiences local enhancement. We show that this problem can be overcome by the use of a Resistive Interface Layer (RIL) deposited between the uniform a-Se layer and the array of metal electrodes. By detailed analysis of charge transport properties we demonstrate that RIL enables stable avalanche operation in a-Se photoconductor without degradation in charge transport or avalanche multiplication gain. Our results showed that a stable gain of 200 is reached at 104 V/?m for a 15 -?m thick a-Se layer, which is the maximum theoretical gain for this thickness. We conclude that RIL is an enabling technology for practical implementation of solid-state avalanche a-Se image sensors...|$|E
40|$|The world energy {{consumption}} will {{increase in the}} next decades. However, many aging oil fields are showing a steady decline in oil production. And they are producing increasing amounts of water, making {{the separation of the}} oil from the oil-water mixture an important processing step. In-line separation equipment using swirling flow can provide a light-weight, compact solution for offshore platforms and deepsea production sites, for which the use of large gravity-based separation vessels is very costly. In a collaborative project such an in-line separator has been investigated. The separator consists of a pipe, in which the internal swirl element (ISE) is placed. The ISE is equipped with vanes, which generate the swirling flow. Downstream of the ISE, the oil is extracted by a concentrically placed <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube.</b> In the pipe, the radial distribution of the axial velocity is W-shaped with an annular region of reversed flow and positive axial velocity {{in the center of the}} pipe and near the wall. The distribution of the azimuthal velocity shows a solid-body rotation in the center and a potential-flow vortex type of distribution at larger radius. A parameter study has demonstrated that the flow pattern in the separator is complex and that its dependence on the input parameters is complicated. For two-phase flow, the simulations predict good separation performance. However, the numerical results overpredict the separation efficiency, in some extreme cases by 50 %. The differences in results between experimental and numerical work decreases substantially when for the simulations an inlet droplet size is used, which corresponds more closely to the one in the flow loop at Delft University. Moreover, the inclusion of an anisotropic turbulent dispersion model in the computation may improve the numerical predictions. The result for poly-dispersed two-phase flow show only a modest increase in the Sauter mean diameter from 50 to about 80 Âµm in the center of the pipe. Although much progress has been made, further research is required to achieve a better prediction of the two-phase flow in a centrifugal separator...|$|E
5000|$|For {{the final}} optical {{arrangement}} in the EMI 2001, the 'green' prism {{was changed to}} have a fully silvered mirror at about 45 degrees, to deflect the green light sideways, resulting in the final 4-spoke arrangement. (When viewed {{from the back of}} a camera the four tubes were seen as a diagonal cross). This optical arrangement defined the cross-section dimensions of the camera (which was not small - 380 x 380 mm), but it did allow the zoom lens to be located within the camera body. Also the removal of individual <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes</b> was possible without any need to remove the scanning coils, as the tube bases were easily accessible at the outer corners ...|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} the BBCâ€™s lukewarm {{reception}} of the experimental camera EMI persisted with the 4-tube concept, but now using Plumbicon tubes, as suggested by Wood although there was some delay before the work started. There were several reasons for the delay. Firstly, EMIâ€™s board hesitated to provide the financial investment needed for the project. Secondly, there was indecision regarding where to place the work but, eventually, the Colour TV Department of the Research Labs. was chosen in preference to the Broadcast Equipment Division (the existing supplier of EMI's monochrome cameras and studio equipment). Thirdly, there was concern regarding the reliability of supply of Plumbicon tubes, as Philips was the only supplier. Fourthly, there were concerns regarding the variable quality standards of the early Plumbicon <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes,</b> as some tubes were found to produce unstable pictures. Although most issues with tube quality were quickly resolved by Philips, there remained concerns regarding 'comet tails' and 'blooming'.|$|R
5000|$|EMI {{engineers}} {{visited the}} USA in 1963, {{in order to}} view RCA's new four-tube colour camera, the TK42. Immediately following this visit, EMI Research Labs. embarked on a program to build an experimental camera using the same format. The construction took only six weeks of intensive effort, aided by the cannibalization of parts from existing EMI cameras. Items were taken from an EMI Type 203 image Orthicon monochrome studio camera, for the luminance channel, and a Type 204 industrial colour camera, for the colour channels. This camera contained 3 Vidicon tubes and a colour-splitting system using plate glass dichroic mirrors. In addition, a Varotal III zoom lens was integrated {{into the body of}} the experimental camera. The camera was housed in a simple box-shaped structure with ribs of extruded aluminium and with plain side panels. The experimental camera was demonstrated to the BBC in 1963 where it received a mixed reception. At that time, the BBC was evaluating an early Philips 3-tube camera which used some newly available Plumbicon <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes.</b> It had been set up by BBC engineers to give highly saturated colour pictures and they were unimpressed by the 'tinted' pictures of the EMI camera. [...] In order to better judge the performance of the then existing cameras, the BBC organized comparison tests between the experimental EMI camera, a Philips camera, and a Marconi three I.O. camera. In these tests, the colorimetry of the pictures from the EMI camera compared unfavourably with the other two, but it did give the sharpest pictures.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} Danelectro {{company was}} founded by Nathan [...] "Nat" [...] Daniel in 1947. Throughout the late 1940s, the company produced amplifiers for Sears, Roebuck and Company and Montgomery Ward. In 1954, Danelectro started producing the Danelectro lines of solidbody electric guitars and amplifiers. The company also made guitars and amplifiers under contract that were branded {{with the names of}} various store brands, such as Silvertone (Sears) and Airline (Montgomery Ward). Later Danelectro manufactured hollow-bodied guitars, which they constructed out of Masonite and plywood to save costs and increase production speed. These were distinguished by Silvertone's maroon vinyl covering, and Danelectro's light tweed covering. They used concentric stacked tone/volume knobs on the two-pickup models of both seriesâ€”and [...] "lipstick-tube" [...] pickups, which contained the <b>pick-up</b> inside lipstick <b>tubes,</b> which have been said to be [...] "war surplus" [...] but which, in fact, Daniel ordered and bought directly from the manufacturer. Danelectro's goal was to produce no-frills guitars of reasonably good tone at low cost. In 1956, Danelectro introduced the six-string baritone guitar. The baritone guitar never became especially popular, but found an enduring niche in Nashville for [...] "Tic-tac" [...] bass lines. In 1966, Danelectro was sold to MCA. A year later, in 1969, they introduced the Coral line, known for its hollow-bodies and electric sitars. In 1969, Danelectro closed down, due to MCA's attempt to market Danelectros to small guitar shops rather than large department stores.|$|R
