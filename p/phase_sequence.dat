2500|$|A {{standing}} back handspring {{begins with}} a three <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> known as [...] "up, sit, jump". In the up phase, the gymnast stands up straight on flat feet, with arms in front at an angle slightly above horizontal. In the sit phase, the gymnast swings the arms down by {{the sides of the}} torso, bends knees, and sits back as if sitting in a chair; while in this position, the gymnast is unbalanced. Together, the sit and jump phases impart angular momentum to the body, causing it to rotate. In the jump phase, the gymnast swings both arms up by the ears and jumps into the air while transitioning to an arch position, with the head in a neutral position, arms and legs straight, and feet together; this body shape is maintained until the hands contact the floor. With hands on the floor, the body's angular momentum is used to transform the gymnast's body shape from an arch, through a linear shape, to a [...] "hollow" [...] shape. The hands are then pushed against the floor, causing the body to lift off from the floor while the body continues its feet-first rotation. Finally, the feet land on the floor, behind the body's center of gravity, and the remaining angular momentum is depleted as it carries the gymnast to a stationary standing position.|$|E
50|$|Waveform and <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> {{are fixed}} by the {{construction}} of the generator and its connections to the system. During installation of a generator, careful checks are made to ensure the generator terminals and all control wiring is correct so that the order of phases (<b>phase</b> <b>sequence)</b> matches the system. Connecting a generator with the wrong <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> will result in a short circuit as the system voltages are opposite to those of the generator terminal voltages.|$|E

(Counter-clockwise on the corresponding plug.) Since some wiring may be reversed, which would make motors turn backward, many machines on construction sites feature a phase swap plug that allows the L2 and L3 phase pins to be swapped, thereby reversing the <b>phase</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1943 Edith Clarke {{published}} a textbook giving {{a method of}} use of symmetrical components for three-phase systems that greatly simplified calculations over the original Fortescue paper. [...] In a three-phase system, one set of phasors has the same <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> as the system under study (positive sequence; say ABC), the second set has the reverse <b>phase</b> <b>sequence</b> (negative sequence; ACB), and in the third set the phasors A, B and C are in phase with each other (zero sequence, the common-mode signal). Essentially, this method converts three unbalanced phases into three independent sources, which makes asymmetric fault analysis more tractable.|$|E
5000|$|Hebb viewed {{motivation}} and learning as related properties. He believed that {{everything in the}} brain was interrelated and worked together. His theory was that everything we experience in our environment fires a set of neurons called a cell assembly. This cell assembly is the brain's thoughts or ideas. These cell assemblies then work together to form <b>phase</b> <b>sequences,</b> which are streams of thoughts. [...] Once these cell assemblies and <b>phase</b> <b>sequences</b> are formed, they can be activated by stimulation from the environment. Therefore, the more stimulating and rich the environment, the more the cell assemblies grow and learn. This theory played into his beliefs in education. Hebb believed that the environment {{was very important to}} learning in children. Children learn by building up these cell assemblies and <b>phase</b> <b>sequences.</b> An enriched environment with varied opportunities for sensory and motor experiences contribute to children developing the cell assemblies and <b>phase</b> <b>sequences</b> necessary for continued learning in adulthood. To attempt to prove this, Hebb and his daughters raised pet rats at home. By raising them in an enriched environment, the rats showed improved maze learning in adulthood. [...] This research into environmental enrichment contributed {{to the development of the}} Head Start Program used today.|$|R
40|$|Hebb {{proposed}} that synapses between neurons that fire synchronously are strengthened, forming cell assemblies and <b>phase</b> <b>sequences.</b> The former, on a shorter scale, are ensembles of synchronized cells that function transiently as a closed processing system; the latter, {{on a larger}} scale, correspond to the sequential activation of cell assemblies able to represent percepts and behaviors. Nowadays, the recording of large neuronal populations allows {{for the detection of}} multiple cell assemblies. Within Hebb’s theory, the next logical step is the analysis of <b>phase</b> <b>sequences.</b> Here we detected <b>phase</b> <b>sequences</b> as consecutive assembly activation patterns, and then analyzed their graph attributes in relation to behavior. We investigated action potentials recorded from the adult rat hippocampus and neocortex before, during and after novel object exploration (experimental periods). Within assembly graphs, each assembly corresponded to a node, and each edge corresponded to the temporal sequence of consecutive node activations. The sum of all assembly activations was proportional to firing rates, but the activity of individual assemblies was not. Assembly repertoire was stable across experimental periods, suggesting that novel experience does not create new assemblies in the adult rat. Assembly graph attributes, on the other hand, varied significantly across behavioral states and experimental periods, and were separable enough to correctly classify experimental periods (Naïve Bayes classifier; maximum AUROCs ranging from 0. 55 to 0. 99) and behavioral states (waking, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep; maximum AUROCs s ranging from 0. 64 to 0. 98). Our findings agree with Hebb’s view that assemblies correspond to primitive building blocks of representation, nearly unchanged in the adult, while <b>phase</b> <b>sequences</b> are labile across behavioral states and change after novel experience. The results are compatible with a role for <b>phase</b> <b>sequences</b> in behavior and cognition...|$|R

50|$|For two {{electrical}} {{systems to}} be synchronized, both systems must operate {{at the same}} frequency, and the phase angle between the systems must be zero (and two polyphase systems must have the same <b>phase</b> <b>sequence).</b> Synchroscopes measure and display the frequency difference and phase angle between two power systems.

5000|$|The {{stability}} {{of a system}} refers {{to the ability of}} a system to return to its steady state when subjected to a disturbance.

50|$|Usage of the Perilex {{connectors}} {{is usually}} confined {{to small businesses}} (e.g. bakeries, restaurants), medical facilities (hospitals, laboratories) and homes, where it {{has the advantage of}} a smaller form factor and better cleanability. However, at construction sites and industrial facilities, the IEC connectors are preferred due to their better robustness and due to being approved for medium-term outdoor use. Furthermore, it is unwise to connect three-phase electrical motors to Perilex sockets due to the afore-mentioned ambiguity regarding the <b>phase</b> <b>sequence.</b> Since 1 January 1975, the use of the Perilex system has been outlawed in Germany for new industrial installations but continues to be legal in homes, hospitals and small businesses. However, even there, it is being superseded by the IEC 60309 system used throughout Europe. The fact that East Germany used a completely different system (TGL 4176), resulting in two incompatible non-IEC systems in re-unified Germany, also contributes to this trend.|$|E
