5|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>qualification</b> most {{relevant}} to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E

25|$|United States naval {{aviation}} manpower {{had climbed}} to 37,407 when the First Armistice at Compiègne ended hostilities on 11 November 1918.

The number of qualified pilots was approximately 1,600. Awarding of naval aviator precedence list numbers in the sequence of <b>pilot</b> <b>qualification</b> did not begin until January 1918; and some duplicate or fractional numbers were awarded in subsequent attempts to appropriately place pilots qualified before that date.|$|E

500|$|The {{objective}} of regulation is to [...] "promote {{high standards of}} safety {{in all aspects of}} aviation", and this is the main area of interaction between the CAA and the GA sector. Efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness, <b>pilot</b> <b>qualification,</b> the rules for the movement of aircraft, and equipment to be carried. The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972. In 1991 it started working within the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) framework to implement agreed common standards, known as the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), throughout the European Union (EU). In 2003 this was taken a step further when the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities. The CAA acts as an agency of EASA on these issues, retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to EASA. Proposed developments seek to establish EASA as the single authority throughout the EU, taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope of EASA.|$|E

In July 1911 the Army adopted as its standard to be a military pilot the licensing requirements of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (F.A.I.), which the F.A.I. ruled on June 26, 1912 that he met, issuing FAI Certificate No. 140. In the meantime the Army published its own <b>pilot</b> <b>qualification</b> standards on April 20, 1912, and Foulois became the fifth army pilot to be rated a Military Aviator, on July 13.

2500|$|Whiting was {{credited}} with establishing many basic tenets of carrier aviation, largely worked out during his first Langley tour. He established the first pilot ready rooms aboard Langley. He had a hand-cranked movie camera film every landing on the carrier {{to aid in the}} evaluation of landing techniques, and had a darkroom and photography laboratory installed on board to allow the landing films to be developed at sea. Langleys pilots had no signaling system with which shipboard personnel could assist them in landing, so when not flying himself, Whiting observed all landings from the aft port corner of Langleys flight deck. where he was visible to pilots in critical touchdown attitudes when the nose of the aircraft might obscure their view straight ahead as they approached the ship to land. Pilots found Whitings body language helpful and suggested an experienced pilot be assigned to occupy that position as a [...] "landing signal officer" [...] or [...] "landing safety officer" [...] (LSO), using signals to guide them to safe landings. In an advanced form, the LSO concept survives aboard aircraft carriers to this day. Whiting also was influential in the U.S. Navys decision to make <b>pilot</b> <b>qualification</b> a requirement for command of an aircraft carrier.|$|E
