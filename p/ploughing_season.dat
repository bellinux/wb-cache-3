5000|$|The group {{consists}} of 40 elderly women {{all in their}} late 50s. Alongside the ZEBRAS troupe from Mathathane, BDF X1 provides the most cherished form of entertainment, not only in Bobirwa but throughout the country. Their movements {{are determined by the}} occasion for which they are hired to perform, be it a wedding celebration, or even sometimes political rallies. In 2004, the group spent a month in China where they had been selected to perform and display Setswana culture. The group leader stressed that it broadened their horizons. “To be honest, everybody was impressed by our performance and we left behind a good image of our country. We are now flexible, even if BDF X1 football club could invite us to interact with them after the league, we are okay.”BDF X1 has also been to Zimbabwe. As old as they are Falala Ngala maintains that the time they spend at rehearsals does not in any way overstretch their schedules. “We have adjusted well to doing our personal things and going for practice.” She adds that the spirit of cooperation, commitment and a thirst to keep their culture alive is the only force behind the group’s 27 years success. However, the traditional singing is often put on hold during <b>ploughing</b> <b>season</b> as it is against the Sebirwa culture to beat drums at a time when rain is needed most. During such seasons they only prepare if they had been hired to perform somewhere outside the area. During practices, every one of them strictly abides by the command from the leader. The songs they emphasize on are the ones used to pray for the rain, <b>ploughing</b> <b>season</b> and those that were sung during night outs. Members believes that they mostly sing songs that convey a useful meaning to listeners combined with beautiful dance techniques that also appeal to the audience. Youth have found it difficult to join the troupe as they often fail to withstand the intense cultural practices maintained by the group.The group does not only keep the culture through dance but also conducts initiation on young girls and gives them advice on how to handle their husbands once they are married. “We do not allow a situation where a girl can have more than one man and there is no revenge if a man is playing around. Re ba ruta gore monona ha tshwarwe madeudeu.”Currently the group survives from the little they raise from performances and weave their own dance gear that includes beads and matlhowa. They even go as far as South Africa to fetch indigenous tree fruits that they use in dance gear. However they have expressed worry that the money is too little for the 40 of them to share. They appealed to the general public to donate anything that could help them survive in their endeavour to maintain Sebirwa cultural practices. “Even a roll of material to make a uniform is more than welcome because our uniform is now torn and we are not working yet we have a passion for our tradition.” BDF X1 troupe’s main concern is that they have been the backbone of the Bobirwa Trade Fair since its inception but they say the government has done nothing so far to acknowledge their presence. “We are desperately in need of donors and the government has turned a deaf ear to us.” ...|$|E

40|$|Batswana {{communities}} have always relied on cultural frameworks {{for economic development}} and Tswana norms and values have established acceptable standards for sustainable livelihoods. As such, individuals and families were (and still are) expected to activate and maintain cultural systems in order to earn a living. The cultural economic system is organized around {{the head of the}} family (father or mother), the ward head or headman (kgosana), and the chief (kgosi) who leads the community's food production and development. The cultural process followed a calling (pitso) principle where community members and the chief would invoke ancestors to mark the commencement of the <b>ploughing</b> <b>season.</b> In this way, the chief authorized the <b>ploughing</b> <b>season,</b> thereby safeguarding the community's culture. As a result, developmental strategies that ignores cultural principles, values, and norms, risk being viewed as totally inappropriate by the community. This study posited that lack of reference to indigenous knowledge systems and processes render modern developmental methods and institutions ineffective. It is based on a review of professional experience, and informal conversations with custodians of culture on methods of promoting culturally appropriate developmental processes in Botswana. It also adopted a social work perspective that encourages agents of change to pay attention to cultural processes when facilitating development programmes. Lack of reference to cultural systems was reported as one of the factors that destabilize communities and threatened social development levels in Botswana...|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{differential}} attraction of pathogen vectors to vertebrate animals is investigated for novel repellents which {{when applied to}} preferred host animals turn them into non-hosts thereby providing a new paradigm for innovative vector control. For effectively controlling tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), vectors of African trypanosomosis, causing nagana, repellents more powerful than plant derived, from a non-host animal the waterbuck, Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa, have recently been identified. Here we investigate these repellents {{in the field to}} protect cattle from nagana by making cattle as unattractive as the buck. To dispense the waterbuck repellents comprising guaiacol, geranylacetone, pentanoic acid and δ-octalactone, (patent application) we developed an innovative collar-mounted release system for individual cattle. We tested protecting cattle, under natural tsetse challenge, from tsetse transmitted nagana in a large field trial comprising 1, 100 cattle with repellent collars in Kenya for 24 months. The collars provided substantial protection to livestock from trypanosome infection by reducing disease levels > 80 %. Protected cattle were healthier, showed significantly reduced disease levels, higher packed cell volume and significantly increased weight. Collars > 60 % reduced trypanocide use, 72. 7 % increase in ownership of oxen per household and enhanced traction power (protected animals ploughed 66 % more land than unprotected). Land under cultivation increased by 73. 4 %. Increase in traction power of protected animals reduced by 69. 1 % acres tilled by hand per household per <b>ploughing</b> <b>season.</b> Improved food security and household income from very high acceptance of collars (99 %) motivated the farmers to form a registered community based organization promoting collars for integrated tsetse control and their commercialization. Clear demonstration that repellents from un-preferred hosts prevent contact between host and vector, thereby preventing disease transmission: a new paradigm for vector control.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the soil physical properties affected by cover crop, rotation and soil management in a long-term experiment in South Brazil. The experimental site was cultivated for 10 years in a conventional system. Subsequently, the field experiment was established in 1986, and treatments combined six winter cover crop species, and two tillage systems (conventional tillage - CT and no-tillage - NT). The treatments were laid out using a split-plot design in three blocks. The soil samples were collected in October 2005 from trenches at six depths. The bulk density, aggregate size fractions and porosity were determined. The NT system contributed to increase the formation of coarse aggregates and improved the soil aggregation parameters. In the first upper layers, the soil disturbance due to <b>ploughing</b> every <b>season,</b> enhanced the macroporosity and diminished the microporosity on conventional system comparatively to NT.

The highlands comprise only 40 % of the country's total land area but carry 79 % of livestock heads and 80 % of the human population results in higher pressure on the arable land and feed resources. The use of crossbred dairy cows for both milk production and draught is one possible alternative option to intense the farming systems {{in the region and}} make more efficient use of the limited farm resources. The present study was carried out to compare the on farm draught performance of F 1, crossbred dairy cows with that of local oxen. Thirty-six F 1 crossbred dairy cows were distributed to 18 farmers of three categories of defined resource endowment in 1995 in Wolmera and Dendi woredas. Similarly, 36 local oxen were randomly selected from another 18 farmers of three resource endowment categories. Draught performance parameters include force (N), speed (m/sec),distance traveled (m), power output (kW), work output (MJ), energy expenditure (MJ) and area cultivated (m 2) were studied in 1996 <b>ploughing</b> <b>season</b> for F 1 crossbred cows and zebu oxen. Crossbred cows and local oxen exerted similar horizontal draught force that averaged 736 N but sustained it at different level of pull. Crossbred cows worked at a speed which was 0. 16 m/s faster than that of local oxen and generated 107 W more power. Area ploughed and total net energy expended by crossbred cows over one hour period was significantly larger than that of local oxen. Local oxen required 12 % more metabolizable energy per Kg W 0. 75 compared to crossbred cows for ploughing one m 2 area of land. This might indicate that crossbred cows utilize metabolizable energy more efficiently for ploughing. This study has revealed that crossbred cows have a promising potential to perform ploughing activities and can complement or substitute oxen for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|Conference Theme: Knowledge Production, Planning, and Networks in East Asia and Their InfluencePanel 7 : New Cultural Histories and East Asian Intellectual History (新文化史與東亞知識史研究) Sometime during 1723 - 1735, the Yongzheng雍正Emperor {{commissioned}} {{an image}} that can be translated into English as the Picture of [the emperor] personally ploughing or the Qinggeng Tu 親耕圖. This representation depicts the monarch of China taking his own hands to a plough and pushing it for some paces. Beginning in the Zhou dynasty (c. 1100 - 479 BCE), Chinese rulers have enacted this ceremony {{in accordance with the}} Book of Rites or Li Ji 禮記. The emperor chose a propitious day to inaugurate the <b>ploughing</b> <b>season.</b> This activity, which not every Chinese monarch has performed, nonetheless has served as an ideal petition in which the emperor appeals to the benevolence of nature to ask for a prosperous harvest. For the Yongzheng Emperor pictorially recording this act appeared to have great importance for him. Prior to his representation, the earliest-known picture of an emperor ploughing appears {{in the form of a}} humble woodblock print in the Book of Agriculture or Nong Shu 農書by Wang Zhen王禎 (act. 1300 s). Written by 1303, the earliest extant version dates to 1530 and features a nameless figure identified as the emperor as pushing the plough. Yongzheng is portrayed as personally pushing the plough in a very long and ambitious handscroll painted by the famous Jesuit painter Giuseppe Castiglione (1688 - 1766). Within fifty years after Yongzheng’s production, at least two European rulers (or in one case king-to-be) are represented in printed versions of the Picture of [the emperor] personally ploughing. Louis Auguste, the 25 th Dauphan, the future King of France Louis XVI (r. 1774 - 1791) was represented as performing the ploughing ceremony in 1768. In 1769, Joseph II (r. 1765 - 1790), the Holy Roman emperor and brother of Louis Auguste’s future wife, Marie Antoinette (1755 - 1793), would likewise be represented in the same agrarian ceremony. As text and possibly imagery about the activities of the Chinese emperors entered Europe through Jesuits’ and travelers’ accounts, intellectuals of the period (at times successfully) sought to encourage European monarchs to emulate their ceremonies. This paper starts by considering the Yongzheng Emperor’s motivation to commission such a lavish representation of this ceremony and then moves on to explore the appeal of the same type of imagery for 18 th-century European rulers and audiences...|$|E
40|$|Landscapes {{represent}} the stage {{setting of the}} ecosystem, the great theatre where {{the evolution of the}} environment, the changing of things and plant and animal life are played out; the diversity of landscapes derives from the combination, over time, of different environmental factors having perceptibly different roles, {{as in the case of}} climate, vegetation and human activity. Less perceptible and scarcely known is the role of soil, which has the ability not only to diversify the ecosystem&rsquo;s landscapes but also to differentiate its level of productivity and liveability. The role of soil as part of the landscape is not always so evident, especially when it is covered by vegetation that precludes observation. At times, however, soils show themselves conspicuously, at least on the surface, when the colours of the epipedons invade the landscape and &ndash; in the <b>ploughing</b> <b>season</b> &ndash; dominate it. While it may be reassuring to see neatly cultivated fields and crops growing luxuriantly and homogeneously, the increasingly marked and evident signs of soil degradation or erosion are a cause for concern. In the recent past, the relationship between man and soil resources was strongly influenced by natural factors inside and outside the soil itself, socio-economic conditions and above all the labour force, i. e. the people employed in the primary sector; consequently, it was based on such factors that crop-growing choices were adapted to the different ecosystems, resulting in a diversification of rural landscapes. Starting from the second half of the twentieth century, the introduction of chemicals, mechanisation and exploitation of various forms of energy drastically transformed land use in the space of just a few years, with a logic aimed at improving the production capacity of farmland and forest land in both qualitative and quantitative terms. As a consequence, farming choices that were formerly adapted to the natural and socio-economic conditions of different ecosystems are now &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; through investments and the use of considerable energy resources, where little account is taken of the actual sustainability of soil use or the progressive loss of natural fertility; moreover, the rural landscape, by virtue of an increasingly intense and localised single-crop specialisation, has become organised into areas displaying a uniform, regular and often monotonous appearance. However, the greatest source of worry lies in the progressive consumption of soil, which particularly affects flatlands and low hills. This phenomenon is tied not only to the relentless expansion of developed areas, but also to an irrational distribution of residential, industrial and commercial property, resulting in the segmentation and fragmentation of farmland. An irreversible trend that risks destroying the already fragile identity of the rural landscape completely...|$|E
5000|$|As per the {{tradition}} in that area, the chieftain had {{to initiate the}} ploughing of fields after first rains in jyestha month.

On Tejaji's anger she taunted him about his halitosis and on the fact that his wife was in her father's home. This prompted him to go to fetch his wife from his in-laws. The sister-in-law asked Tejaji that before he brings his wife Pemal, he should bring his sister Rajal so that she can receive Pemal on her first arrival to Kharnal. Tejaji was married to Pemal in early childhood at Pushkar with the daughter of Rai Mal Jat of Jhanjhar gotra, chieftain of village Paner [...] After marriage there was a dispute between two families in which the maternal uncle of Pemal and father of Tejaji were killed.

5000|$|In {{southern}} England the danegeld {{was based}} on hidages, an area of agricultural land sufficient to support a family, {{with the exception of}} Kent, where the unit was a sulung of four yokes, the amount of land that could be <b>ploughed</b> in a <b>season</b> by a team of oxen; in the north the typical unit was the carucate, or ploughland, equivalent to Kent's sulung, and East Anglia was assessed by the hundred. Everywhere the tax was farmed (collected) by local sheriffs. Records of assessment and income pre-date the Norman conquest, indicating a system which James Campbell describes as [...] "old, but not unchanging". According to David Bates, it was [...] "a national tax of a kind unknown in western Europe;" [...] indeed, J. A. Green asserts that the national system of land taxation developed to raise the Danegeld was the first to reappear in Western Europe since the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. [...] It was used by William the Conqueror as the principal tool for underwriting continental wars, as well as providing for royal appetites and the costs of conquest, rather than for buying-off the Viking menace. He and his successors levied the geld more frequently than the Anglo-Saxon kings, and at higher rates; the six-shilling geld of 1084 is infamous, and the geld in Ely of 1096, for example, was double its normal rate. Judith Green states that from 1110, war and the White Ship calamity led to further increases in taxation efforts. By 1130 Henry I was taxing the danegeld annually, at two shillings on the hide. That year, according to the chronicle of John of Worcester the king promised to suspend the danegeld for seven years, a promise renewed by Stephen at his coronation but which was afterwards broken. Henry II revived the danegeld in 1155-56, but 1161-62 marks the last year the danegeld was recorded on a pipe roll, and the tax fell into disuse.|$|R
