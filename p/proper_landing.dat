2500|$|The only British {{success of}} the battle was the delayed attack {{on the west bank}} of the Mississippi River, where Thornton's brigade, {{comprising}} the 85th Regiment and detachments from the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, attacked and overwhelmed the American line. The Navy detachment and the Marine detachment were led by Captain Rowland Money and Brevet Major Thomas Adair, respectively. Money was captain of HMS Trave, and Adair was the commanding officer of 's detachment of Marines. The sides of the canal by which the boats were to be brought through to the Mississippi caved in and choked the passage, so that only enough got through to take over a half of Thornton’s force. With these, seven hundred in number, he crossed, but as he did not allow for the current, it carried him down about two miles below the <b>proper</b> <b>landing</b> place. Thornton’s brigade won their battle, but Colonel Thornton was dangerously wounded. This success, though a brilliant one, and a disgrace to the American arms, had no effect on the battle. Army casualties among the 85th Foot were: 2 dead, 1 captured, and 41 wounded. Royal Navy casualties were 2 dead, Captain Rowland Money and 18 seamen wounded. Royal Marine casualties were 2 dead, with 3 officers, 1 sergeant and 12 other ranks wounded. Though both Jackson and Commodore Patterson reported that the retreating forces had spiked their cannon, leaving no guns to turn on the Americans' main defense line, Major Mitchell's diary makes it clear this was not so, as he states he had [...] "Commenced cleaning enemy's guns to form a battery to enfilade their lines on the left bank". General Lambert ordered his Chief of Artillery, Colonel Alexander Dickson, to assess the position. Dickson reported back that no fewer than 2,000 men would be needed to hold the position. General Lambert issued orders to withdraw after the defeat of their main army on the east bank and retreated, taking a few American prisoners and cannon with them. It was later learned that the Americans were so dismayed by the loss of this battery, which would be capable of inflicting such damage on their lines when the attack was renewed, that they were preparing to abandon the town, when they received the news that the British themselves were withdrawing.|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} Columbia came into {{sight of the}} {{shipping}} of Nagasaki. But it was now dark, and a heavy fog was hanging over the harbor, so {{it was impossible to}} make the <b>proper</b> <b>landing</b> before the next day. They came to anchor and the necessary lights were hung out.|$|E

The Japanese were inclined to favor both the Richmond Importing Company and the owners of the vessel, so it was not likely that our friends would lose much in the end. In the meantime the Columbia could be put in a dry-dock and given the overhauling that she needed.|$|E

60|$|Going from Louisville up to St. Louis, I {{crossed the}} Ohio River and passed through parts of Indiana and of Illinois, and, {{striking}} the Mississippi opposite St. Louis, crossed that river also, and then entered the State of Missouri. The Ohio was, as I have said, flooded, {{and we went}} over it at night. The boat had been moored at some unaccustomed place. There was no light. The road was deep in mud up to the axle-tree, and was crowded with wagons and carts, which {{in the darkness of}} the night seemed to have stuck there. But the man drove his four horses through it all, and into the ferry- boat, over its side. There were three or four such omnibuses, and as many wagons, as to each of which I predicted in my own mind some fatal catastrophe. But they were all driven on to the boat in the dark, the horses mixing in through each other in a chaos which would have altogether incapacitated any English coachman. And then the vessel labored across the flood, going sideways, and hardly keeping her own against the stream. But we did get over, and were all driven out again, up to the railway station in safety. On reaching the Mississippi about the middle of the next day, we found it frozen over, or rather covered from side to side with blocks of ice which had forced their way down the river, so that the steam-ferry could not reach its <b>proper</b> <b>landing.</b> I do not think that we in England would have attempted the feat of carrying over horses and carriages under stress of such circumstances. But it was done here. Huge plankings were laid down over the ice, and omnibuses and wagons were driven on. In getting out again, these vehicles, each with four horses, had to be twisted about, and driven in and across the vessel, and turned in spaces to look at which would have broken the heart of an English coachman. And then with a spring they were driven up a bank as steep as a ladder! Ah me! under what mistaken illusions have I not labored all the days of my youth, in supposing that no man could drive four horses well but an English stage coachman! I have seen performances in America--and in Italy and France also, but above all in America--which would have made the hair of any English professional driver stand on end.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, promote {{moderate}} land circulation with farmers at the core, {{speed up}} the reform of the rural system by centralizing the land circulation system, and boost the development of modern scale agriculture. Instead of prohibiting land management by household, the essence of centralized land circulation is to achieve the <b>proper</b> <b>land</b> circulation with farmers as decision makers. As <b>land</b> circulation and <b>proper</b> <b>land</b> management improve, administrative intervention should be carried out with limitation and caution. Fundamentally, land circulation is not the ultimate goal. However, {{as shown in the}} Thousand-Village Survey, the interest of agricultural workers is usually impeded when farmland circulates. A set of nationwide standardized laws and detailed regulations for farmland circulation is required, while still allowing local conditions to be taken into consideration. A stable system of farmland circulation will increase individual income through production of scale as well as through non-agricultural employment.|$|R
