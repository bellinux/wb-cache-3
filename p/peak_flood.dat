40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new Regional Estimation of Extreme <b>Flood</b> <b>Peaks</b> by Selective Statistical Analyses (REFSSA) method to estimate extreme <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> from regional <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> data. The method differs from current regional flood frequency analysis (RFFA) methods or approaches in that an additional separate statistical analysis is performed on "record maximum flood peaks" within a "similar hydrological region". Suitability {{of the method}} is demonstrated for the estimation of extreme <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> with annual exceedance probabilities between 0, 001 (1 / 1 000) and 0, 0001 (1 / 10 000) for two major hydrological regions in South Africa, and for catchment sizes between 100 and 7 000 km². The applicability of the method for catchments outside these regions and limits has not been fully tested mainly due to a shortage of verified data. The theory and a practical example are presented. Excellent results have been obtained so far, displaying high correlation coefficients between extreme <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> data and regression lines, namely 0, 99 on average on log-normal scale. The method is considered to have universal application, especially in climates experiencing outlier type of extreme <b>flood</b> <b>peaks...</b>|$|R

40|$|The storm {{hyetograph}} {{is critical}} in drainage design since it determines the <b>peak</b> <b>flooding</b> volume in a catchment and the corresponding drainage capacity demand for a return period. This study firstly compares the common design storms such as the Chicago, Huff, and Triangular curves employed to represent the storm hyetographs {{in the metropolitan area}} of Guangzhou using minute-interval rainfall data during 2008 – 2012. These common design storms cannot satisfactorily represent the storm hyetographs in sub-tropic areas of Guangzhou. The normalized time of peak rainfall is at 33 ± 5 % for all storms in the Tianhe and Panyu districts, and most storms (84 %) are in the 1 st and 2 nd quartiles. The Huff curves are further improved by separately describing the rising and falling limbs instead of classifying all storms into four quartiles. The optimal time intervals are 1 – 5 min for deriving a practical urban design storm, especially for short-duration and intense storms in Guangzhou. Compared to the 71 observed storm hyetographs, the Improved Huff curves have smaller RMSE and higher NSE values (6. 43, 0. 66) than those of the original Huff (6. 62, 0. 63), Triangular (7. 38, 0. 55), and Chicago (7. 57, 0. 54) curves. The mean relative difference of <b>peak</b> <b>flooding</b> volume simulated with SWMM using the Improved Huff curve as the input is only 2 %, − 6 %, and 8 % of those simulated by observed rainfall at the three catchments, respectively.

40|$|Flood {{frequency}} analysis is usually performed as a univariate analysis of <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> using a suitable theoretical probability {{distribution of the}} annual maximum <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> or peak over threshold values. However, other flood attributes, such as flood volume and duration, are necessary {{for the design of}} hydrotechnical projects, too. In this study, the suitability of various copula families for a bivariate analysis of <b>peak</b> discharges and <b>flood</b> volumes has been tested. Streamflow data from selected gauging stations along the whole Danube River have been used. Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient (tau) quantifies the dependence between <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> discharge and <b>flood</b> volume settings. The methodology is applied to two different data samples: 1) annual maximum <b>flood</b> (AMF) <b>peaks</b> combined with annual maximum flow volumes of fixed durations at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 60 days, respectively (which can be regarded as a regime analysis of the dependence between the extremes of both variables in a given year), and 2) annual maximum <b>flood</b> (AMF) <b>peaks</b> with corresponding <b>flood</b> volumes (which is a typical choice for engineering studies). The bivariate modelling of the extracted <b>peak</b> discharge - <b>flood</b> volume couples is achieved {{with the use of the}} Ali-Mikhail-Haq (AMH), Clayton, Frank, Joe, Gumbel, Hüsler-Reiss, Galambos, Tawn, Normal, Plackett and FGM copula families. Scatterplots of the observed and simulated <b>peak</b> discharge - <b>flood</b> volume pairs and goodness-of-fit tests have been used to assess the overall applicability of the copulas as well as observing any changes in suitable models along the Danube River. The results indicate that for the second data sampling method, almost all of the considered Archimedean class copula families perform better than the other copula families selected for this study, and that for the first method, only the upper-tail-flat copulas excel (except for the AMH copula due to its inability to model stronger relationships) ...|$|R
