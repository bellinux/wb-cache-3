5|$|On 22 September the German battle {{group in}} Norway was {{attacked}} by several British midget submarines. This raid inflicted significant damage on Tirpitz, leaving the battleship unable to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> until repairs were complete. Once this was known to the Allies, {{the commander of the}} Home Fleet, Admiral Bruce Fraser, judged that the changed balance of forces would allow his force to assume a more offensive role by attacking German shipping off Norway and restarting the Arctic Convoys to the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|During {{its time}} in Port Adelaide, a John Bosh and a Mr. Christian where apprehended under a warrant {{and charged with}} being absent without leave from the Iserbrook. The pair denied the charge, and stated {{they had gone to}} town to obtain from Mr.Amsberg, German Consul, some papers they wanted to take home, and that they were willing to return on board. By request of Captain Krüger, both man were ordered to be {{detained}} at the police station till the vessel was ready to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> (which was the same afternoon). From Port Adelaide, the brig continued to Batavia (Dutch East Indies) via Melbourne.|$|E
60|$|Towards {{evening the}} party were once more {{safe and sound}} on board the Red Eric, where they found {{everything}} repaired, and the ship in a fit state to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> immediately.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 January 2012, {{the strike}} group <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> for pre-deployment {{training}} and its Composite Training Unit Exercise.|$|R
50|$|Vernon County {{participated in}} {{exercises}} over the succeeding days before <b>proceeding</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> at 23:00 hours on 19 August 1969 to evade Typhoon Cora. Subsequently, she <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> Taiwan for rest and recreation {{at the port}} of Keelung.|$|R
50|$|On 22 January 1973 Batfish ran hard aground at Charleston while <b>proceeding</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea.</b> She {{was pulled}} free by tugs and {{returned}} to port where extensive damage to her bottom was repaired.|$|R
6000|$|The {{materials}} {{they had}} been discussing were examined, and a chart was prepared to show {{the course of the}} Gulf Stream at that season of the year. Two revenue cutters were then appointed to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> in search of the steamer, and Maury was requested to [...] "furnish them with instructions." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had seen}} little of Jim, since the trouble began; as leave was, {{for the most}} part, stopped--the ships of war being in {{readiness}} to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea,</b> at a moment's notice, to engage an enemy, or to protect merchantmen {{coming in from the}} attacks of the Spanish ships and gunboats, across at Algeciras.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will make}} it my {{business}} to watch that vessel. I know not whether any good can come of it, but I would fain be doing something. If the wind changes she will doubtless <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea,</b> {{and if they are}} still on board of her they will come ashore, and I could see their numbers and where they put up." ...|$|E
50|$|Three days later, Wilkes was {{detached}} from the formation and <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> Trinidad, where she refueled before sailing for the Virginia capes and arrived at Norfolk on 25 July. The destroyer then made two coastal runs to New York before getting underway from that port on 19 August and steaming for Halifax harbor, Nova Scotia, where she arrived on 21 August. She remained moored off Greenoch until 5 September. At that time, she <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> escort USAT Siboney to New York. She then spent the remainder of September conducting various exercises in Casco Bay, Maine.|$|R
5000|$|The respite {{afforded the}} {{destroyer}} escort {{was a brief}} one, however, for she got underway on 1 November for Hollandia and Seeadler Harbor, escorting a convoy. Entering Humboldt Bay on the 4th, Willmarth anchored there {{over the next two}} days before <b>proceeding</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> screen the sortie of TG 78.4 — , 12 LSM's, 4 LCI's, 8 LCI(G)'s, [...] and [...] — on the 7th.|$|R
5000|$|After {{patrolling the}} {{approaches}} to Guantanamo Bay {{for nearly two}} weeks, Welles - transporting 10 enlisted men - sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, with the remainder of her division (Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 67): , , and division flagship [...] on 14 March. Mooring at the navy yard and discharging her passengers on the 17th, the destroyer <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> on 6 April, bound for the Caribbean.|$|R
60|$|When {{the tide}} again {{began to run}} out Edmund {{determined}} at all risks to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea.</b> The moorings were cast off from the shore and the Dragon suffered to drift down. Men with poles took their stations in her bows and sounded continually, while at her stern two anchors were prepared in readiness to drop at a moment's notice. Several times the water shoaled so much that Edmund was {{on the point of}} giving orders to drop the anchors, but each time it deepened again.|$|E
60|$|The weather still {{continued}} clouded and menacing. Betts was of opinion, therefore, that {{it might}} be well to stow the provisions and water they intended to use in the pinnace, while she was on the stocks, as they could work round her so much the more easily then than afterwards. Accordingly, the breakers were got out, on board the ship, and filled with fresh water. They were then stuck into the raft. A barrel of beef, and one of pork followed, with a quantity of bread. At two trips the raft carried all the provisions and stores that were wanted, and the cargoes were landed, rolled up {{to the side of the}} pinnace, hoisted on board of her, by means of the throat-halliard, and properly stowed. Two grapnels, or rather one grapnel, and a small kedge, were found among the pinnace's materials, everything belonging to her having been stowed in the same part of the ship. These, too, were carried round to the ship-yard, got on board, and their hawsers bent. In a word, every preparation was made that might be necessary to make sail on the pinnace, and to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> in her, at once.|$|E
60|$|Among {{the other}} {{measures}} to which Alfred resorted in this emergency was {{the attempt to}} encounter the Danes upon their own element by building and equipping a fleet of ships, with which to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea,</b> {{in order to meet}} and attack upon the water certain new bodies of invaders, who were on the way to join the Danes already on the island--coming, as rumor said, along the southern shore. In attempting to build up a naval power, the greatest difficulty, always, is to provide seamen. It is much easier to build ships than to train sailors. To man his little fleet, Alfred had to enlist such half-savage foreigners as could be found in the ports, and even pirates, as was said, whom he induced to enter his service, promising them pay, and such plunder as they could take from the enemy. These attempts of Alfred to build and man a fleet are considered the first rude beginnings from which the present vast edifice of British naval power took its origin. When the fleet was ready to put to sea, the people thronged the shores, watching its movements with the utmost curiosity and interest, earnestly hoping that it might be successful in its contests with the more tried and experienced armaments with which it would have to contend.|$|E
50|$|Rodman {{returned}} to England the same day, <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> again on 30 June; and, after a 3-day stop at Belfast, got underway for the Mediterranean {{to participate in}} Operation Dragoon ("Anvil"), the invasion of southern France. Arriving at Mers-el-Kebir on 11 July, she was en route to Sicily on 16 July, and into August operated between that island, the coast of Italy, and Malta.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 July, Bangust sailed {{in company}} with the escort {{carriers}} , , [...] and , and their screen, , [...] and , to rendezvous with TG 30.8 — the task group assigned the job of logistics support to the fast carriers of TF 38, during the strikes on Tokyo and other areas of northern Japan. After making the rendezvous on 5 July, Bangust operated with TG 30.8 until detached on 18 to return to Ulithi, where she arrived on 23 July. Underway on 25 July 1945, Bangust carried out an antisubmarine sweep to cover the exit of the heavy ships from Ulithi, and then <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> join TG 30.8 on 29 July.|$|R
50|$|In December 1869, Henderson {{offered his}} {{services}} to the master and owners, to pilot a steam vessel Tybee out of the port of New York, but they refused to employ him. They <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> without having on board any pilot of the port. A judgment wad made in the district court of New York City in favor of Joseph Henderson for thirty-eight dollars and eighteen cents, besides costs for fees for pilotage.|$|R
60|$|I thereupon summoned my {{constitutional}} advisers, {{the heads}} of all the departments, to meet on Sunday, the 20th day of April, 1861, {{at the office of}} the Navy Department, and then and there, with their unanimous concurrence, I directed that an armed revenue cutter should <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> to afford protection to the commercial marine, and especially the California treasure ships then on their way to this coast. I also directed the commandant of the navy-yard at Boston to purchase or charter and arm as quickly as possible five steamships for purposes of public defense. I directed the commandant of the navy-yard at Philadelphia to purchase or charter and arm an equal number for the same purpose. I directed the commandant at New York to purchase or charter and arm an equal number. I directed Commander Gillis to purchase or charter and arm and put to sea two other vessels. Similar directions were given to Commodore Dupont, with a view to the opening of passages by water to and from the capital. I directed the several officers to take the advice and obtain the aid and efficient services, in the matter, of his Excellency Edwin D. Morgan, the Governor of New York, or in his absence George D. Morgan, William M. Evarts, R. M. Blatchford, and Moses H. Grinnell, who were by my directions especially empowered by the Secretary of the Navy to act for his department in that crisis in matters pertaining to the forwarding of troops and supplies for the public defense.|$|E
60|$|As Caesar had {{possession}} of the island of Pharos and of the harbor, Ganymede could not cut him off from receiving such re-enforcements of men and arms as he might make arrangements for obtaining beyond the sea; nor could he curtail his supply of food, as the granaries and magazines within Caesar's quarter of the city contained almost inexhaustible stores of corn. There was one remaining point essential to the subsistence of an army besieged, and that was an abundant supply of water. The palaces and citadels which Caesar occupied were supplied with water by means of numerous subterranean aqueducts, which conveyed {{the water from the}} Nile to vast cisterns built under ground, whence it was raised by buckets and hydraulic engines for use. In reflecting upon this circumstance, Ganymede conceived the design of secretly digging a canal, so as to turn the waters of the sea by means of it into these aqueducts. This plan he carried into effect. The consequence was, that the water in the cisterns was gradually changed. It became first brackish, then more and more salt and bitter, until, at length, it was wholly impossible to use it. For some time the army within could not understand these changes; and when, at length, they discovered the cause the soldiers were panic-stricken at the thought, that they were now apparently wholly at the mercy of their enemies, since, without supplies of water, they must all immediately perish. They considered it hopeless to attempt any longer to hold out, and urged Caesar to evacuate the city, embark on board his galleys, and <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E
6000|$|It {{does not}} appear that he has given any {{communication}} whatsoever to his colleagues in office of those extraordinary transactions. Nothing appears on {{the records of the}} Council of the receipt of the presents; nor is the transmission of this account mentioned in the general letter to the Court of Directors, but in a letter from himself to their Secret Committee, consisting generally of two persons, but at most of three. It is to be observed that the Governor-General states, [...] "that the dispatch of the 'Lively' had been protracted from time to time; that this delay was of no public consequence; but that it produced a situation which with respect to himself he regarded as unfortunate, because it exposed him to the meanest imputations, from the occasion which the late Parliamentary inquiries have since furnished, but which were unknown when his letter was written." [...] If the Governor-General thought his silence exposed him to the meanest imputations, he had the means in his own power of avoiding those imputations: he might have sent this letter, dated the 22d May, by the Resolution. For we find, that, in a letter from Captain Poynting, of the 26th May, he states it not possible for him to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> with the smallest degree of safety without a supply of anchors and cables, and most earnestly requests they may be supplied from Calcutta; and on the 28th May we find a minute from the Secretary of the Council, Mr. Auriol, requesting an order of Council to the master-attendant to furnish a sloop to carry down those cables; which order was accordingly issued on the 30th May. There requires no other proof to show that the Governor-General had the means of sending this letter seven days after he wrote it, instead of delaying it for near seven months, and because no conveyance had offered. Your Committee must also remark, that the conveyance by land to Madras was certain; and whilst such important operations were carrying on, both by sea and land, upon the coast, that dispatches would be sent to the Admiralty or to the Company was highly probable.|$|E
5000|$|Following an {{availability}} and refresher training, Vernon County departed Yokosuka in company with gunboat [...] She was diverted to Subic Bay {{to meet an}} additional two gunboats to escort to Vietnamese waters. Necessary upkeep items, however, could only be completed by Vernon County and gunboat , which then <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> as scheduled <b>to</b> resume the transit to Cam Ranh Bay. Once within South Vietnamese waters on 29 September 1970, Welch proceeded independently, leaving Vernon County <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> Vung Tau to relieve Westchester County as Operation Market Time support LST.|$|R
50|$|However, the respite {{provided}} by that in-port period was brief, for Wadsworth <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> on 17 July, {{as part of}} the escort for troop-laden transports slated to put their combat-garbed marines and soldiers ashore on Guam. Wadsworth patrolled off that isle as those men splashed ashore and, while engaged in that duty 26 mi offshore, picked up eight natives of Guam, who had escaped from the Japanese, on the morning of 22 July. The destroyer quickly transferred them to , because they possessed valuable intelligence information on Japanese dispositions ashore.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the next}} two {{minesweeping}} operations that followed Auk served as the flagship for the detachment commander, Capt. Roscoe C. Bulmer, a highly regarded man, revered by the men he commanded. Capt. Bulmer embarked {{for the first time}} at Kirkwall on 7 July 1919 when he broke his broad pennant in Auk shortly before she <b>proceeded</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea.</b> That day, she teamed with Oriole in sweeping a portion of the field that had been laid on 13 October of the previous year and, on the following day, swept in company with [...] (Minesweeper No. 17).|$|R
50|$|On 10 May 1797 she was {{the first}} American warship to be {{launched}} under the Naval Act of 1794, and the first ship of the United States Navy.

50|$|Vernou {{served a}} second {{tour of duty}} at the Naval Academy from January 1919 to June 1921.

He commanded the Rizal from 12 September, that year, until 5 January 1923, when he was transferred to command the oiler USS Pecos. After a few months in that command, and brief duty at the Naval Station, Cavite, Philippine Islands, he returned to the United States in July 1923.|$|R
50|$|At {{the finish}} {{of the war}} the 4th Infantry left from Vera Cruz, and reached Camp Jeff Davis, Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 23 July 1848.

Ordinary garrison duties were performed until June 1852.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Wilkes escorted Augusta into Casablanca. She then {{returned}} toward the patrol area and resumed patrolling her assigned station. Wilkes {{picked up a}} submarine contact at 2,300 yd and made a shallow depth charge attack, expending four 300-pound and two 600-pound charges without success. Wilkes then abandoned her search and continued her patrol. Little {{more than an hour}} later, two ships in the convoy anchorage area were torpedoed. A U-boat hit a third ship after 26 more minutes had passed. The convoy was ordered to weigh anchor and <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea.</b> Wilkes got underway and took station in the convoy's antisubmarine screen off its starboard bow. The convoy changed base course 20 degrees every 15 minutes for almost two hours to avoid detection.|$|E
50|$|The main {{criteria}} for detention {{is that the}} ship is deemed unsafe to <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> and that the deficiencies on a ship are considered serious by the inspector. These deficiencies must be rectified before the ship may sail again. In the annual report of Paris MOU, it stated that the major deficiencies are:1. Certification of crew2. Safety3. Maritime Security4. Marine Pollution and Environment5. Working and Living Condition6. Operational7. ManagementThese deficiencies {{are the most common}} concern of a PSCO. When these deficiencies are clearly hazardous to safety, health, or the environment, the PSCO would require the hazard to be rectified before the ship can sail or detain the vessel or even issue a formal prohibition of the ship to operate.|$|E
5000|$|After a {{visit to}} Monaco between 13 and 18 August and a period of leave in Malta, the ship {{took part in the}} annual 'SeptEx' for two weeks.
