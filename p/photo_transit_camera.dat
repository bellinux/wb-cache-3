In this system, assistant cameras are installed {{on each side}} of the monitor to help capture the views from left side and right side. A pattern with random dots and Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation are used to help create precise disparity maps that is then used for re-projection. The interpolated views show a smooth <b>transit</b> among <b>cameras</b> on two sides. The experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed method could be extended to produce more robust and accurate disparity maps than most of the existing algorithms from regular stereo images. ...|$|R

40|$|More than 700 exoplanets {{have been}} {{discovered}} and studied using indirect techniques, leading our field into the exciting new era of comparative exoplanetology. However, the direct detection of exoplanetary systems still remains at the sensitivity limits of both ground- and space-based observatories. The development of new technologies for adaptive optics systems and high contrast instruments continues to increase the ability to directly study exoplanets. The scientific impact of these developments has promising prospects for both short and long timescales. In my talk, I will discuss recent highlights from the SEEDS survey and the current instrumentation in use at the Subaru telescope. SEEDS is a high contrast imaging strategic observing program with 120 nights of time allocated at the NAOJ's flagship optical and infrared telescope. I will also describe new instrumentation I designed to improve the SEEDS capabilities and efficiency. Finally, I will briefly discuss the conceptual design of a <b>transiting</b> planet <b>camera</b> to fly as a potential second generation instrument on-board NASA's SOFIA observatory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Near-infrared {{photometry}} of transiting extrasolar planets can be {{of great}} scientific value. It is however not straightforward to reach the necessary millimagnitude precision. Here we report on our attempts to observe transits and secondary eclipses of several extrasolar planets at 2. 2 µm. Best results have been obtained on OGLE-TR- 113 b using the SOFI near-infrared camera on ESO’s New Technology Telescope. Its K-band transit shows a remarkably flat bottom indicating low stellar limb darkening. Secondary eclipse photometry {{has resulted in a}} formal 3 σ detection, but residual systematic effects make this detection rather uncertain. 1. Near infrared observations of transiting planets Near-infrared photometry of transiting extrasolar planets {{can be of}} great scientific value. First of all, since the emergence of wide field near-infrared <b>cameras,</b> <b>transit</b> surveys in J-band targeting M dwarfs have become feasible (see Hodgkin et al., this volume).

We observed one <b>transit</b> withWide Field <b>Camera</b> 3 {{using the}} G 141 lowresolution grism to cover thewavelength range 1. 087 - 1. 678 μm. These time series observations were {{taken with the}} newly available spatial-scan mode that increases the duty cycle by nearly a factor of 2, thus improving the resulting photometric precision of the data. We measure a planetto-star radius ratio of Rp/R* = 0. 117 09 ± 0. 000 38 in the white light curve with the centre of transit occurring at 245 6114. 345 ± 0. 000 133 (JD). We achieve S/N levels per exposure of 1840 (0. 061 per cent) at a resolution of δλ = 19. 2 nm (R ~ 70) in the 1. 1173 - 1. 6549 μm spectral region, providing the precision necessary to probe the transmission spectrum of the planet at close to the resolution limit of the instrument. We compute the transmission spectrum using both single target and differential photometry with similar results. The resultant transmission spectrum shows a significant absorption above the 5 s level matching the 1. 4 μm water absorption band. In solar composition models, the water absorption is sensitive to the ~ 1 m bar pressure levels at the terminator. The detected absorption agrees with that predicted by a 1000 K isothermal model, {{as well as with}} that predicted by a planetary-averaged temperature model. © 2013 The Authors.

40|$|The {{search for}} exo-planets is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most exiting and active topics in astronomy. Small and rocky planets are particularly the subject of intense research, since if they are suitably located from their host star, they may be warm and potentially habitable worlds. On the other hand, the discovery of giant planets in short-period orbits provides important constraints on models that describe planet formation and orbital migration theories. Several projects are dedicated to discover and characterize planets outside of our solar system. Among them, the Wide-Field <b>Camera</b> <b>Transit</b> Survey (WTS) is a pioneer program aimed to search for extra-solar planets, that stands out for its particular aims and methodology. The WTS has been in operation since August 2007 with observations from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, and represents the first survey that searches for transiting planets in the near-infrared wavelengths; hence the WTS is designed to discover planets around M-dwarfs. The survey was originally assigned about 200 nights, observing four fields that were selected seasonally (RA = 03, 07, 17 and 19 h) during a year. The images from the survey are processed by a data reduction pipeline, which uses aperture photometry to construct the light curves. For the most complete field (19 h- 1145 epochs) in the survey, we produce an alternative set of light curves by using the method of difference imaging, which is a photometric technique that has shown important advantages when used in crowded fields. A quantitative comparison between the photometric precision achieved with both methods is carried out in this work. We remove systematic effects using the sysrem algorithm, scale the error bars on the light curves, and perform a comparison of the corrected light curves. The results show that the aperture photometry light curves provide slightly better precision for objects with J < 16. However, difference photometry light curves present a significant improvement for fainter stars. In order to detect transits in the WTS light curves, we use {{a modified version of the}} box-fitting algorithm. The implementation on the detection algorithm performs a trapezoid-fit to the folded light curve. We show that the new fit is able to produce more accurate results than the box-fit model. We describe a set of selection criteria to search for transit candidates that include a parameter calculated by our detection algorithm: the V-shape parameter, which has proven to be useful to automatically identify and remove eclipsing binaries from the survey. The criteria are optimized using Monte-Carlo simulations of artificial transit signals that are injected into the real WTS light curves and subsequently analyzed by our detection algorithm. We separately optimize the selection criteria for two different sets of light curves, one for F-G-K stars, and another for M-dwarfs. In order to search for transiting planet candidates, the optimized selection criteria are applied to the aperture photometry and difference imaging light curves. In this way, the best 200 transit candidates from a sample of 475 000 sources are automatically selected. A visual inspection of the folded light curves of these detections is carried out to eliminate clear false-positives or false-detections. Subsequently, several analysis steps are performed on the 18 best detections, which allow us to classify these objects as transiting planet and eclipsing binary candidates. We report one planet candidate orbiting a late G-type star, which is proposed for photometric follow-up. The independent analysis on the M-dwarf sample provides no planet candidates around these stars. Therefore, the null detection hypothesis and upper limits on the occurrence rate of giant planets around M-dwarfs with J < 17 mag presented in a prior study are confirmed. In this work, we extended the search for transiting planets to stars with J < 18 mag, which enables us to impose a more strict upper limit of 1. 1...|$|R
