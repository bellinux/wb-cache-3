5|$|Niobium is an {{important}} component of high-performance heterogeneous catalysts for the production of acrylic acid by selective oxidation of <b>propane.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August 10, 2008, {{following}} {{a series of}} explosions at a <b>propane</b> facility in Toronto, Highway401 was closed between Highway400 and Highway404 as a precautionary measure, the largest closure of the highway in its history.|$|E
5|$|A {{flex fuel}} {{conversion}} kit is a kit {{that allows a}} conventional equipment manufactured vehicle to be altered to operate on <b>propane,</b> natural gas, methane gas, ethanol, or electricity are classified as aftermarket AFV conversions. All vehicle conversions, except those that are completed for a vehicle to run on electricity, must meet current applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the <b>propane</b> for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get <b>propane</b> for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E
5|$|In September 2003, a {{commercial}} truck delivering <b>propane</b> to customers on the peak knocked down the then-existent KUWZ tower after the vehicle's brakes failed. The {{collapse of the}} tower knocked out power to the mountain for several hours, and while KUWZ borrowed space from neighboring towers for several months thereafter, the station ultimately relocated its transmitter to nearby Aspen Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{during a}} flyby on March 12, 2008, {{revealed}} additional {{chemicals in the}} plume, including trace amounts of simple hydrocarbons such as methane, <b>propane,</b> acetylene and formaldehyde. The plumes' composition, {{as measured by the}} INMS, is similar to that seen at most comets.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium {{is a key}} {{constituent}} of high performing {{mixed oxide}} catalysts for the heterogeneous catalytic selective oxidation of <b>propane</b> to acrylic acid. The surface elemental composition changes dynamically and reversibly with the reaction conditions. In the presence of steam {{the surface of the}} catalyst is enriched in tellurium and vanadium which translates into the enhancement of the acrylic acid production.|$|E
5|$|The molybdenum-based mixed oxides are {{versatile}} catalysts in {{the chemical}} industry. Some examples are the catalysts for the selective oxidation of propylene to acrolein and acrylic acid, the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile. Suitable catalysts and {{process for the}} direct selective oxidation of <b>propane</b> to acrylic acid are being researched.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{compounds}} {{are used}} {{as a catalyst for}} ethylene polymerization. As a metal, yttrium is used on the electrodes of some high-performance spark plugs. Yttrium is used in gas mantles for <b>propane</b> lanterns as a replacement for thorium, which is radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Burns are {{beset by}} cabin fever {{and attempt to}} kill each other. After a vicious struggle, Burns ignites the cabin's <b>propane</b> tank, {{launching}} the building out of the snow and propelling it toward the horrified onlookers. Once {{it comes to a}} halt, Burns reminds everyone of the contest, and all the workers hurry inside. Lenny is the last person in the cabin, and is fired. Burns is informed that the completion time of the competition has set a new record, and decides that no one will be fired after all.|$|E
5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, acetylene, ethane, <b>propane,</b> {{phosphine}} and methane {{have been detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, <b>propane,</b> or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
5|$|By 1951, Dawson Creek {{had more}} than 3,500 residents. In 1952, the John Hart Highway linked the town {{to the rest of}} the British Columbia Interior and Lower Mainland through the Rocky Mountains; a new {{southbound}} route, known locally as Tupper Highway, made the town a crossroads with neighbouring Alberta. The next year, western Canada's largest <b>propane</b> gas plant was built and federal government offices were established in town. In 1958, the extension of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway to the Peace from Prince George was completed, and the village was re-incorporated as a city. Between 1951 and 1961, the population of Dawson Creek more than tripled. The RCAF center reemerged on 1 October 1956 and was declared functional in 1958. It was disbanded a final time in March 1964.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene Harris and Klebold are {{standing}} outside their high school. The player guides {{them to the}} cafeteria to plant their timed <b>propane</b> bombs without being detected by security cameras or hall monitors. After the explosives are set, the two stop {{for a moment on}} a hill outside the school, discussing their alienation and hostility. After the bombs fail to explode as planned, Harris and Klebold decide to enter the school and murder as many people as they can; the final number killed is up to the player. After roaming around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide. A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid <b>Propane</b> Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid <b>propane</b> as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} {{contract for}} the station was won by London-based company Brown & Mason. Before the demolition of the stations' main structures, it was required that they be decommissioned. This involved the removal of hazardous materials and contaminants, to keep in line with Health & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site, along with bottled <b>propane</b> used for welding. The remaining coal in the coal storage area was dispatched to operating power stations {{in other parts of}} the country. The landfill site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled. Asbestos used in the stations was removed prior to the demolition of the stations' structures.|$|E
5|$|Wilkins Peak {{is a small}} {{mountain}} {{located in}} Sweetwater County, Wyoming, between the cities of Green River and Rock Springs. It is primarily used for radio and television station transmitters, but it also serves radio needs of the FAA, EMS, and local businesses such as Questar Gas. In 2003, a tower on the peak was knocked down by a vehicle delivering <b>propane</b> to customers. The tower was owned by Wyoming Public Radio and was serving the local area with programming from National Public Radio. There are numerous access roads to the peak {{and it is not}} gated and open year-round, weather permitting. Along with the radio uses, the mountain is also a popular location for mountain biking and hiking. The mountain contains geology typical of its location in southwestern Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six <b>propane</b> tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Great Notch station, which was falling into disrepair, {{received}} a new paint job, {{changed from the}} red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad paint scheme. The abandoned tool shed made {{out of the old}} wooden boxcar was also removed. Due to the removal of the tool boxcar, the <b>propane</b> tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great Notch station lay abandoned. In June 1979, the State of New Jersey began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great Notch. Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On January 20, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great Notch Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar's {{rapid rise}} to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The Undertaker, which {{involved}} a match at Unforgiven on September 22. The match ended in a double disqualification and Lesnar retained the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at No Mercy, this time in a Hell in a Cell match. Leading up to the match, in the storyline, Lesnar broke The Undertaker's hand with a <b>propane</b> tank. Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match went on as planned. At No Mercy on October 20, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to retain the title. After his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker, Lesnar successfully retained the WWE Championship in a handicap match with Heyman against Edge at Rebellion on October 26.|$|E
5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like <b>propane)</b> may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant was}} laid out roughly north to south {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three <b>propane</b> sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources building (Building 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The main structure of the plant was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant. At {{the north end of the}} plant was the Research and Development building (Building 87), it was located connected to two large storage buildings (Building 1 and 2). On the front of Building 2 was the main offices (Building 85). Building 2 is connected to the largest building, the Manufacturing Building (Building 3), which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House (Building 5) and Glass House 2 (Building 32). Building 32 also served as storage building. Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House Cullet & Mix House (Number 7) and the Compressor & Auxiliary Generator building (Number 9) at the southern end.|$|E
5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, <b>propane</b> jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple <b>propane</b> torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds of yards and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near Flat Rock and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away. A heavy <b>propane</b> tank was lofted and thrown 100 yards from one of the chicken houses, and 19 cattle on the property were killed. Remarkably, a family of four taking shelter inside the house were completely unharmed. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it tore through the rural community of Shiloh, sweeping away numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes and killing 5 people at that location. Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a van was lofted and dropped into a field 400 yards away from where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people. Dozens of homes in Trenton were completely destroyed, 18 others sustained major damage, {{and tens of thousands of}} trees were downed in the area. A grocery store, two apartment complexes, and a funeral home were destroyed as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propane</b> is {{a cleaner}} burning, high {{performance}} fuel derived from multiple sources. It is known by many names including <b>propane,</b> LPG (liquified <b>propane</b> gas), LPA (liquid <b>propane</b> autogas), Autogas and others. <b>Propane</b> is a hydrocarbon fuel {{and is a}} member of the natural gas family.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Propane</b> Gallery {{focuses on}} the {{workings}} of Walter O. Snelling, an American chemist from Allentown who discovered how to distill <b>propane.</b> Items from his laboratory are {{on display at the}} museum including photos from his <b>propane</b> company, American Gasol Co.. Additionally, there is an educational exhibit showing the <b>propane</b> usage in the country during World War II.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propane</b> and butane are gases at {{atmospheric}} pressure {{that can be}} liquefied at fairly low pressures and {{are commonly known as}} liquified petroleum gas (LPG). <b>Propane</b> is used in <b>propane</b> gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles, butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays.|$|E
25|$|Auditory repellents are {{commonly}} used in both agricultural and aviation contexts. Devices such as <b>propane</b> exploders (cannons), pyrotechnics, and bioacoustics are frequently deployed on airports. <b>Propane</b> exploders are capable of creating noises of approximately 130 decibels (Wildlife Control Supplies). They can be programmed to fire at designated intervals, can be remote controlled, or motion activated. Due to their stationary and often predictable nature, wildlife quickly become habituated to <b>propane</b> cannons. Lethal control {{may be used to}} extend the effectiveness of <b>propane</b> exploders (Washburn et al. 2006).|$|E
25|$|ROUSH CleanTech's <b>propane</b> autogas-fueled {{vehicles}} {{have the}} same horsepower, torque and towing capacity as their gasoline-powered equivalents. The shift to a dedicated liquid <b>propane</b> fuel system does not affect vehicle functionality. Ford's factory warranty remains intact on the ROUSH CleanTech vehicles. <b>Propane</b> emits fewer greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxides than gasoline, diesel, heavy fuel oil or E85 ethanol per unit of energy.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017, ROUSH CleanTech has {{deployed}} almost 15,000 Ford {{trucks and}} vans and Blue Bird school buses fueled by <b>propane</b> autogas to fleets throughout the United States. More than 90 {{percent of all}} <b>propane</b> school buses currently operating in the U.S. are equipped with a ROUSH CleanTech fuel system. School districts choose <b>propane</b> over diesel to accommodate tighter budgets and help improve air quality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propane</b> autogas is {{generated}} at the well alongside other {{natural gas and}} oil products. It is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of <b>Propane</b> to the market.|$|E
25|$|Oxy-propane torches {{are usually}} used for cutting up scrap to save money, as LPG is far cheaper joule for joule than acetylene, {{although}} <b>propane</b> {{does not produce}} acetylene's very neat cut profile. <b>Propane</b> also finds a place in production, for cutting very large sections.|$|E
