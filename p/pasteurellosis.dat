500|$|Many breeders take {{a variety}} of {{preventive}} measures to ward off problems. The first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased. Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior. This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month. Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep. Restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems. [...] Excessive stress can compromise the immune system. [...] "Shipping fever" [...] (pneumonic mannheimiosis, formerly called <b>pasteurellosis)</b> is a disease of particular concern, that can occur {{as a result of}} stress, notably during transport and (or) handling. [...] Pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline). [...] Considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria. [...] Because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management.

Pasteurella haemolytica is a species that infects mainly cattle and horses: P. multocida is the most frequent causative agent in human Pasteurella infection. Common symptoms of <b>pasteurellosis</b> in humans include swelling, cellulitis, and bloody drainage {{at the site of}} the wound.

50|$|The {{government}} and international donor community had contemplated considerable improvements for Chad's livestock management, but these plans were {{undermined by the}} Chadian Civil War, political instability, and an inadequate infrastructure. The most successful programs have been animal vaccination campaigns, such as an emergency project carried out in 1983 to halt the spread of rinderpest. The campaign reached some 4.7 million head of cattle across the nation and demonstrated the capabilities of Chad's animal health service when given external support. The Livestock and Veterinary Medicine Institute of Chad (Institut d'Elevage et de Médecine Vétérinaire du Tchad--IEMVT), which was financed by foreign aid, was capable of producing vaccines for Chad {{as well as for}} neighboring countries.

5000|$|Some of the 15 known {{species of}} Photobacterium have evolved into {{pathogens}} of marine life.

The species Photobacterium damselae are among the most virulent and are divided into two subspecies: piscicida and damsela. [...] P. damselae subspecies piscicida is the causative agent of fish <b>pasteurellosis.</b> Bacterial colonies grow on the infected fish's spleen and kidney, eventually leading to mortality. This disease accounts for severe losses in some fish farming enterprises {{with some of the most}} susceptible fish including Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), certain Seabreams (Sparus spp.), Striped bass (Morone saxatilis), and White perch (Morone americana).

50|$|Cherny Zemli Nature Reserve {{was created}} in Russia's Kalmykia Republic in the 1990s to protect the local saiga population. Kalmykia's {{president}} Kirsan Ilyumzhinov announced 2010 as the Year of Saiga in Kalmykia. In Kazakhstan, the number of saiga {{was found to be}} increasing, from around 21,000 {{at the beginning of this}} millennium to around 81,000 in January 2010. However, in May 2010, an estimated 12,000 of the 26,000 Saiga population in the Ural region of Kazakhstan have been found dead. Although the deaths are currently being ascribed to <b>pasteurellosis,</b> an infectious disease that strikes the lungs and intestines, the underlying trigger remains to be identified. In May 2015, what may be the same disease broke out in three northern regions of the country. As of 28 May 2015, more than 120,000 saiga antelope have been confirmed dead in the Betpak-Dala population in central Kazakhstan, representing more than a third of the global population.

50|$|<b>Pasteurellosis</b> is also {{described}} as photobacteriosis (due {{to the change}} in the taxonomic position), is caused by the halophilic bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (formerly Pasteurella piscicida).It was first isolated in mortalities occurring in natural populations of white perch (Morone americanus) and striped bass (M. saxatilis) in 1963 in Chesapeake Bay, USA (Snieszko et al., 1964). Since 1969, this disease {{has been one of the}} most important in Japan, affecting mainly yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) (Kusuda & Yamaoka, 1972). From 1990 it has caused economic losses in different European countries including France (Baudin-Laurencin et al., 1991), Italy (Ceschia et al., 1991), Spain (Toranzo et al., 1991), Greece (Bakopoulos et al., 1995), Turkey (Canand et al., 1996), Portugal (Baptista et al., 1996) and Malta (Bakopoulos et al., 1997). Gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and sole (Solea spp.) are the most affected species in Europe Mediterranean countries, as well as hybrid striped bass (M. saxatilis x M. chrysops) in the USA.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{retrospective}} morphological and microbiological study, 39 of 55 cases of bovine fibrinous pneumonia were diagnosed as fibrinous pleuropneumonia. Twenty-nine of these 39 (74 %) were associatcd with Pasteurella hemolytica, {{but only two}} cases (5 %) with P. multocida. In contrast, of the 16 cases classified as fibrinous bronchopneumonia. one (6 %) was associated with P. hemolytica, and nine (5 6 %) with P. multocida. In eight cases Mycoplasrna and Hernophilus sornnus wcrc found in association with either P. hernolytica or P. multocida but were never isolated alone.
