It will distribute the <b>power</b> from the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> to all the sub-detectors on a string. The reliability of a power supply must match or exceed the rest of the system in which it is installed. The environmental and electrical constrains determine most of the component choices. No custom made power supply exists, which meet the requirements of the detector...|$|R

All the network channels transmit the data with 0.1 delay rate. <b>Junction</b> <b>box</b> to <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> and instrument to instrument connections are implemented with either 1 Gbit/s or 100 Mbit/s data rates. An important connection limit on the <b>junction</b> <b>boxes</b> is that more than 10 components cannot be connected to a single <b>junction</b> <b>box.</b> Instruments can also be linked to either <b>junction</b> <b>boxes</b> or any other instrument with either 1 Gbit/s data rate or 100 Mbit/s data channel. The instruments are the final spot of the each regional network branches. The data flows from the instruments where the edge of each regional branch is located towards UVIC (University of Victoria) DMAS (Data Management and Archive Station) [...] by following a secure and the shortest path as configured by the network configurator used by NEPTSim.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> called the Korg PS-3050, which was for {{controlling}} up to three Korg PS series synthesizers from one keyboard by routing a PS-3001 cable from the keyboard to the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> and then routing separate cables from the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> to the PS synthesizers. The other functionality the PS-3050 <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> added was that octaves could be switched on and off selectively for the PS synthesizers, effectively enabling keyboard splits.|$|R

50|$|A typical {{ceiling fan}} weighs between 15 and 50 pounds when fully assembled. While many <b>junction</b> <b>boxes</b> can support that weight while the fan is hanging still, a fan in {{operation}} exerts many additional stresses—notably torsion—on the object {{from which it}} is hung; this can cause an improper <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> to fail. For this reason, in the United States the National Electric Code (document NFPA 70, Article 314) states that ceiling fans must be supported by an electrical <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> listed for that use. It is a common mistake for homeowners to replace a light fixture with a ceiling fan without upgrading to a proper <b>junction</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

40|$|ISIS- 09 - 103 A {{constructive}} method {{is presented in}} which L m 2 -stability can be guaranteed for networked control of multiple passive plants in spite random time varying delays and data dropouts. The passive plants are interfaced to a wave variable based passive sampler (PS) and passive hold (PH) which allows a passive digital control network to be constructed. A <b>power</b> <b>junction</b> is used to facilitate the interconnection of multiple passive plants and passive digital controllers. The <b>power</b> <b>junction</b> preserves passivity by guaranteeing that the overall power input to the system is {{greater than or equal}} to the power leaving the system. There are numerous ways to implement the <b>power</b> <b>junction</b> including the averaging <b>power</b> <b>junction</b> and the consensus <b>power</b> <b>junction</b> which are studied in this paper. In particular, a detailed steady state analysis is provided which relates the corresponding controller inputs to the plants outputs. The construction of our digital control network is completed by interconnecting the digital controllers to an inner-product equivalent sampler and zero-order hold (IPESH) which allows us to prove L m 2 -stability. Initial simulated results are also presented in which we compare performance using a averaging <b>power</b> <b>junction</b> and a consensus <b>power</b> <b>junction.</b> 1...|$|R
50|$|In most cases, two {{copper wires}} (tip and ring) for each {{telephone}} line run {{from a home}} or other small building to a local telephone exchange. There is a central <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> for the building where the wires that go to telephone jacks throughout the building and wires that go to the exchange meet and can be connected in different configurations depending upon the subscribed telephone service. The wires between the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> and the exchange are known as the local loop, and the network of wires going to an exchange, the access network.|$|R

5000|$|Termination {{points and}} <b>junction</b> <b>boxes,</b> {{in other words}} the entire circuit, must be {{completely}} protected. Often, termination points are left out, providing a weak link. Therefore, some enclosures are needed {{to be used in}} conjunction with MI cables. One may run MI cable into a box in an electrical room. However, just because that room may be a [...] "service room" [...] and may be subject to compartmentalization (fire protection), this does not mean one no longer requires a rated box or wrap around the electrical outlet <b>box</b> or <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> where the wiring is terminated because that box may be disabled {{as a result of a}} fire within the room. The probability of electrical fires are a strong motivating factor for compartmetalisation to begin with. The cable may thus be operable but the circuit as a whole may be defeated because the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> would not have been protected. Such omissions are not entirely uncommon in the field.|$|R
