40|$|We {{have used}} the Spitzer Space Telescope to obtain Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) 24 um {{photometry}} for 37 members of the ~ 100 Myr old open cluster Blanco 1. For the brightest 25 of these stars (where we have 3 sigma uncertainties less than 15 %), we find significant mid-IR excesses for eight stars, corresponding to a debris disk detection frequency of about 32 %. The stars with excesses include two A stars, four F dwarfs and two G dwarfs. The most significant linkage between 24 um excess and any other stellar property for our Blanco 1 sample of stars is with binarity. Blanco 1 members that are photometric binaries show few or no detected 24 um excesses whereas {{a quarter of the}} apparently single Blanco 1 members do have excesses. We have examined the MIPS data for two other clusters of similar age to Blanco 1 [...] NGC 2547 and the Pleiades. The AFGK <b>photometric</b> <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> members of both of these clusters also show a much lower frequency of 24 um excesses compared to stars that lie near the single-star main sequence. We provide a new determination of the relation between V-Ks color and Ks-[24] color for main sequence photospheres based on Hyades members observed with MIPS. As a result of our analysis of the Hyades data, we identify three low mass Hyades members as candidates for having debris disks near the MIPS detection limit. Comment: Accepted to Ap...|$|E

The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{dynamical}} effects of the Galaxy on <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems with physical and orbital charac- teristics {{similar to those of}} the population of known wide <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> with exoplanets. As secondary goal we analyse the possible consequences on the stability of a hypothetical planetary system orbiting one of the stellar components. Methods. We numerically reproduced the temporal evolution of a sample of 3 * 10 5 <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems disturbed by the Galactic potential and passing stars in an environment similar to the solar neighbourhood. Results. Our results show that the dynamical evolution of the population of wide <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> with exoplanets in the solar neigh- bourhood is modelled by the process of disruption of <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems induced by the Galaxy. We found that this process depends mainly on the separation between both stars, whereas it is almost independent of the initial orbital configuration. Moreover, our calcu- lations are in agreement with the results of previous works regarding the indirect influence of the Galaxy on the stability of planetary systems in wide <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b> However, the effects on the planetary region show a dependence on the initial configuration of <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b> Finally, we obtain an indirect test of the impulse approximation model for dynamical studies of <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems.
