40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{effective}} <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>activity</b> of thin ZnO films produced by RF planar magnetron sputtering. The energetic plasma particles which bombard the substrate in the above deposition system increase the substrate temperature, thus causing a gradual variation in film structure during the beginning of the film growth. As a result, a precursor layer is formed which consists of small randomly oriented crystallites, and exhibits poor <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>activity.</b> Hence, the film thickness responsible for <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>activity</b> is generally less than the physical thickness of the film. This leads to an increase in the resonant frequency of the film. For example, a film designed to have a half-wave resonance at 288 MHz, was found to be resonant at 332 MHz.

It represents an innovative technique as it offers the maxillofacial surgeon the opportunity to make precise bone cuts without damaging any soft tissue and providing a blood less surgical field. Correction of facial asymmetries is still a major problem in need of an adequate solution. Neurosensory damage to the inferior alveolar nerve can be an adverse effect of surgical correction of hemimandibular hyperplasia. In this case report, piezoelectric cutting device was used to treat a hemimandibular hyperplasia with inferior alveolar nerve preservation. Presentation of case: A 21 -year-old female presented with lower facial a symmetry which was started when she was 16 years.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Oropharyngeal {{dysphagia}} is {{a common}} feature of patients with myotonic dystrophy and is not usually perceived due to their emotional deficits and lack of interest. The aim was to show the existence and frequency of subclinical electrophysiological abnormalities in oropharyngeal swallowing and to clarify the mechanisms of dysphagia in myotonic dystrophy.  METHODS—Eighteen patients with myotonic dystrophy were examined for oropharyngeal phase of swallowing by clinical and electrophysiological methods. Ten patients had dysphagia whereas 11 patients had signs and symptoms reflecting CNS involvement. Four patients with myotonia congenita and 30 healthy volunteers served as controls. Laryngeal movements were detected {{by means of a}} <b>piezoelectric</b> sensor. EMG <b>activities</b> of the submental muscle (SM-EMG) and needle EMG of the cricopharyngeal muscle of the upper eosophageal sphincter (CP-EMG) were also recorded during swallowing.  RESULTS—In about 70 % of the patients with myotonic dystrophy, the existence of oropharyngeal dysphagia was indicated objectively by means of the technique of "dysphagia limit" and by clinical evaluation. Duration of the swallowing reflex as defined by the laryngeal relocation time (0 - 2 time interval) and submental muscle excitation {{as a part of the}} swallowing reflex (A-C interval) were significantly prolonged in patients with myotonic dystrophy, especially in dysphagic patients. Triggering time of the swallowing reflex (A- 0 interval) also showed significant prolongation, especially in the patients having both dysphagia and CNS involvement. During swallowing, CP muscle activity was abnormal in 40 % of the patients with myotonic dystrophy.  CONCLUSION—Both myopathic weakness and myotonia encountered in oropharyngeal muscles play an important part in the oral and the pharyngeal phases of swallowing dysfunction in myotonic dystrophy. It was also suggested that CNS involvement might contribute to the delay of the triggering of the swallowing reflex and some abnormal EMG findings in the CP sphincter, resulting in oropharyngeal dysphagia in myotonic dystrophy. ...|$|R

METHODS: This test is based on determining piecemeal deglutition; which is a physiological phenomenon occurring when a bolus of a large volume {{is divided into two}} or more parts which are swallowed successively. The combined electrophysiological and mechanical method used to record laryngeal movements detected by a <b>piezoelectric</b> transducer, and <b>activities</b> of the related submental integrated EMG (SM-EMG) -and sometimes the cricopharyngeal muscle of the upper oesophageal sphincter (CP-EMG) -were performed during swallowing. Thirty normal subjects and 66 patients with overt dysphagia of neurogenic origin were investigated after detailed clinical evaluation. Twenty patients with a potential risk of dysphagia, but who were normal clinically at the time of investigation, were also evaluated to determine the specificity of the test. All subjects were instructed to swallow doses of water, gradually increasing in quantity from 1 ml to 20 ml, and any recurrence of the signals related to swallowing within the eight seconds was accepted as a sign of dysphagia limit. RESULTS: In normal subjects {{as well as in the}} patients without dysphagia, piecemeal deglutition was never seen with less than 20 ml water. This volume was therefore accepted as the lower limit of piecemeal deglutition. In patients with dysphagia, dysphagia limits were significantly lower than those of normal subjects. CONCLUSION: The method is a highly specific and sensitive test for the objective evaluation of oropharyngeal dysphagia even in patients with suspected dysphagia of neurogenic origin.

When the ceramic and copolymer phases of a composite film are polarized in the same direction, their piezoelectric activities partially cancel each other, thereby giving almost zero <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>activity</b> at Φ[sub c]~ 0. 4. On the other hand, when the phases of a composite film are polarized in opposite directions, their piezoelectric activities reinforce. However, depolarization of the ceramic phase is observed at high Φ[sub c], leading to {{a decrease in the}} <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>activity.</b> The observed d₃₃ and d₃₁ values for the composite films agree well with theoretical predictions.

40|$|Electrostriction {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the electromechanical behavior of ferroelectrics and describes a phenomenon in dielectrics where the strain varies proportional to the square of the electric field/polarization. Perovskite ferroelectrics demonstrating high piezoelectric performance, including BaTiO 3, Pb(Zr 1 -xTix) O 3, and relaxor-PbTiO 3 materials, have been widely used in various electromechanical devices. To improve the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>activity</b> of these materials, efforts have been focused on the ferroelectric phase transition regions, including shift the composition to the morphotropic phase boundary or shift polymorphic phase transition to room temperature. However, there is not much room left to further enhance the piezoelectric response in perovskite solid solutions using this approach. With the purpose of exploring alternative approaches, the electrostrictive effect is systematically surveyed in this paper. Initially, the techniques for measuring the electrostrictive effect are given and compared. Second, the origin of electrostriction is discussed. Then, the relationship between the electrostriction and the microstructure and macroscopic properties is surveyed. The electrostrictive properties of ferroelectric materials are investigated with respect to temperature, composition, phase, and orientation. The relationship between electrostriction and <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>activity</b> is discussed in detail for perovskite ferroelectrics to achieve new possibilities for piezoelectric enhancement. Finally, future perspectives for electrostriction studies are proposed. 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|Morphology and {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} diphenylalanine microcrystals grown by drying the droplet of methanol and water mixture in various proportions have been studied. We {{have found that}} the increase of water concentration leads to the significant change of the microcrystal morphology from flat dendrite structures to elongated microcrystals: microtubes and microrods. The effect was attributed to increasing of the drying time. The morphology of the dendrite structures was revealed and empirical dependence of the dendrite thickness on diameter was found. Finally, the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>activity</b> of the microtubes was demonstrated using the piezoresponse force microscopy...|$|E
