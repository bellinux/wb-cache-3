40|$|Design {{options are}} {{described}} for the multispectral linear arrays which will provide data and facilities beyond those obtained by LANDSAT 1, 2, 3, and D (the thematic mapper) are considered. The features, uses, and risks of a 10 M fine resolution <b>pointable</b> <b>imager,</b> a 15 M/ 30 M dual resolution <b>pointable</b> <b>imager,</b> a 30 M selectable spectral resolution pointing imager, a 30 M electronically pointable multi-temporal sampler, and a 40 M/ 80 M mixed resolution imager are described. A large format camera scheduled for 1981 shuttle launch which can obtain high spatial ground resolution (approximately 10 M), a relative position accuracy of {{plus or minus}} 14 M, and a relative heightening accuracy, by virtue of stereographic coverage, of between 7 and 28 M depending on the base-to-height ratio used. A potential problem {{of the system is}} that it will orbit in the shuttle...|$|E
40|$|The Ground System {{requirements}} for the Land Resources Management (LRM) type-A and type-B missions of the Earth Observatory Satellite (EOS) program are presented. Specifications for the Thematic Mapper data processing are provided (LRM A mission). The specifications also cover the R and D instruments (Thematic Mapper and High Resolution <b>Pointable</b> <b>Imager)</b> data processing for the LRM type-B mission...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} <b>pointable</b> <b>imager</b> to determine atmospheric parameters was studied. In particular {{the determination of the}} atmospheric extinction coefficient and the path radiance, the two quantities that have to be known in order to correct spectral signatures for atmospheric effects, was simulated. The study included the consideration of the geometry of ground irradiance and observation conditions for a <b>pointable</b> <b>imager</b> in a LANDSAT orbit as a function of time of year. A simulation study was conducted on the sensitivity of scene classification accuracy to changes in atmospheric condition. A two wavelength and a nonlinear regression method for determining the required atmospheric parameters were investigated. The results indicate the {{feasibility of}} using a pointable imaging system (1) for the determination of the atmospheric parameters required to improve classification accuracies in urban-rural transition zones and to apply in studies of bi-directional reflectance distribution function data and polarization effects; and (2) for the determination of the spectral reflectances of ground features...|$|E
40|$|The {{equipment}} {{specifications for}} the thematic mapper and high resolution <b>pointable</b> <b>imager</b> {{for use on}} the Earth Observatory Satellite (EOS) are presented. The interface requirements of the systems are defined. The interface requirements are extracted from the equipment specifications and are intended as a summary {{to be used by}} the system and spacecraft designer. The appropriate documentation from which the specifications of the equipment are established are identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{instrument}} {{constraints and}} interface specifications for the Earth Observatory Satellite (EOS) are discussed. The Land Use Classification Mission using a 7 band Thematic Mapper and a 4 band High Resolution <b>Pointable</b> <b>Imager</b> is stressed. The mission {{and performance of}} the instruments were reviewed and expanded to reflect the instrument {{as a part of}} the total remote sensing system. A preliminary EOS interface handbook is provided to describe the mission and system, to specify the spacecraft interfaces to potential instrument contractors, and to describe the instrument interface data required by the system integration contractor...|$|E
40|$|The functional, performance, {{and design}} {{requirements}} for the Operations Control Center (OCC) of the Earth Observatory Satellite (EOS) system are presented. The OCC controls {{the operations of the}} EOS satellite to acquire mission data consisting of: (1) thematic mapper data, (2) multispectral scanner data on EOS-A, or High Resolution <b>Pointable</b> <b>Imager</b> data on EOS-B, and (3) data collection system (DCS) data.

40|$|A {{summary of}} the {{constraints}} and requirements on the Earth Observatory Satellite (EOS-A) orbit and launch vehicle analysis is presented. The propulsion system (hydrazine) and the launch vehicle (Delta 2910) selected for EOS-A are examined. The rationale for {{the selection of the}} recommended orbital altitude of 418 nautical miles is explained. The original analysis was based on the EOS-A mission with the Thematic Mapper and the High Resolution <b>Pointable</b> <b>Imager.</b> The impact of the revised mission model is analyzed to show how the new mission model affects the previously defined propulsion system, launch vehicle, and orbit. A table is provided to show all aspects of the EOS multiple mission concepts. The subjects considered include the following: (1) mission orbit analysis, (2) spacecraft parametric performance analysis, (3) launch system performance analysis, and (4) orbits/launch vehicle selection...|$|E
40|$|The Braslau-Dave {{atmospheric}} model which calculates the upward monochromatic light fluxes leaving {{the top of}} the atmosphere as a function of viewing angle, sun angle, and ground reflectance was employed to study the effect of atmospheric scattering and attenuation on universal apparent contrast for two EOS remote sensors operated at very large offset or pointing angles: the Thematic Mapper (TM) and the High Resolution <b>Pointable</b> <b>Imager</b> (HRPI). The TM offset off nadir could be plus or minus 20 degrees with an 11 degree scan angle and the HRPI pointing angle off nadir could be plus or minus 45 degrees with a 3 degree scan angle. The reduction of universal apparent contrast of EOS imagery is studied as a function of sun elevation angle, atmospheric aerosol loading, radiation wavelength and sensor look angles...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{performed}} to evaluate various image positioning methods for possible use in the earth observatory satellite (EOS) program and other earth resource imaging satellite programs. The primary goal is the generation of geometrically corrected and registered images, positioned {{with respect to the}} earth's surface. The EOS sensors which were considered were the thematic mapper, the return beam vidicon camera, and the high resolution <b>pointable</b> <b>imager.</b> The image positioning methods evaluated consisted of various combinations of satellite data and ground control points. It was concluded that EOS attitude control system design must be considered {{as a part of the}} image positioning problem for EOS, along with image sensor design and ground image processing system design. Study results show that, with suitable efficiency for ground control point selection and matching activities during data processing, extensive reliance should be placed on use of ground control points for positioning the images obtained from EOS and similar programs...|$|E
