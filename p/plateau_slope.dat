50|$|This {{shear force}} {{develops}} because the canine tibial plateau - the weight-bearing {{aspect of the}} joint - is sloped caudally (downwards towards {{the back of the}} joint)and there is an acute angle between the tibial <b>plateau</b> <b>slope</b> and the patellar ligament. In the TTO procedure, the tibia has three osteotomies (cuts into the bone with a bone saw) performed upon it with the aim of realigning the tibial <b>plateau</b> <b>slope</b> so that it ultimately becomes aligned at right angles to the patellar ligament instead of sloping backwards. By achieving this, shear forces within the joint are neutralised and the joint is stable as the dog weight-bears.|$|E
50|$|The cranial {{cruciate}} ligament {{runs from the}} cranial mid part of the tibial intercondylar eminence to the lateral condyle of the femur. Normally, the CrCL prevents caudal (backward) movement of the Femur relative to the Tibia. Due to selective breeding the tibial <b>plateau</b> <b>slope</b> has become sloped too far backwards {{so there is a}} constant stress on the Cranial cruciate liagment. Over time this leads to a degenerative rupture. When it ruptures, the joint becomes unstable which causes pain and can lead to chronic progressive arthritis in the stifle if untreated.|$|E

50|$|In March 2010, the Perth-based coal company Bathurst Resources {{announced}} it was buying L&M Coal Holdings' hard-coking coal exploration assets and mining permit areas in the Buller District of the West Coast. In June 2010, Bathurst Resources announced plans to develop an opencast coking and thermal coal mine for exporting in 2011 in {{a joint venture with}} Christchurch-based company L&M. The proposal had an exploration target of between 17 and 23 million tonnes of coal in the Denniston area. In early September 2010, Bathurst Resources confirmed plans for a US$57 million hard coking coal opencast mine on the Denniston plateau above Westport. The plan included a slurry pipeline to carry coal down the steep <b>plateau</b> <b>slope</b> from a processing plant to a rail load-out 10 km from Westport. Managing Director Hamish Bohannan said a recent feasibility study had been definitive and had confirmed the technical and economic feasibility of the project.|$|E
5000|$|The Rhondda Fawr has {{its source}} {{on the eastern}} side of Craig y Llyn south of Llyn Fawr in a spring called Ffynnon y Gwalciau at an {{elevation}} of about 544m OD. The main head stream, Nant Carn Moesen (or Nant Carfoesen) runs down a <b>plateau</b> <b>slope</b> for about a mile and drops steeply, joining with the Nant Garreg-lwyd and the Nant Melyn to form the Rhondda. The combined waters then continue descending sharply through a mountain gorge to the foot of Pen Pych. The river runs through Blaenrhondda where it is joined by the Nant y Gwair via a classic example of a hanging valley, and runs down the Rhondda Valley, (Cwm Rhondda). The river then passes through a string of mining towns and villages including Treherbert, Treorchy, Pentre, Ton Pentre, Ystrad Rhondda, Llwynypia, Tonypandy, Dinas, Porth and Trehafod before finally reaching its confluence with the River Taff at Pontypridd.|$|E

[...] The plateau ends abruptly on the north with an escarpment which has up to 350 meters of topographic prominence. A series of deep valleys which drain north toward the Jefara cut into this escarpment. It extends some 250 kilometers within Libya, from just east of the city of Gharyan (about 60 kilometers south of Tripoli) in the east to the city of Wazzin at the Tunisian border in the west.

50|$|Certain {{extraordinary}} {{features were}} produced when the retreat {{of the ice}} sheet had progressed {{so far as to}} open an eastward outlet for the marginal lakes. This outlet occurred along the depression between the northward slope of the Appalachian plateau in west-central New York and the southward slope of the melting ice sheet. When this eastward outlet came to be lower than the south-westward outlet across the height of land to the Ohio or Mississippi river, the discharge of the marginal lakes was changed from the Mississippi system to the Hudson system. Many well-defined channels, cutting across the north-sloping spurs of the plateau in the neighborhood of Syracuse, New York, mark the temporary paths of the ice-bordered outlet river. Successive channels are found at lower and lower levels on the <b>plateau</b> <b>slope,</b> indicating the successive courses taken by the lake outlet as the ice melted farther and farther back. On some of these channels, deep gorges were eroded heading in temporary cataracts which exceeded Niagara in height but not in breadth. The pools excavated by the plunging waters {{at the head of the}} gorges are now occupied by little lakes. The most significant stage in this series of changes occurred when the glacio-marginal lake waters were lowered so that the long escarpment of Niagara limestone was laid bare in western New York. The previously confluent waters were then divided into two lakes. The higher one, Lake Erie, supplied the outflowing Niagara River, which poured its waters down the escarpment to the lower, Lake Ontario. This gave rise to Niagara Falls. Lake Ontario's outlet for a time ran down the Mohawk Valley to the Hudson River. At this higher elevation it was known as Lake Iroquois. When the ice melted from the northeastern end of the lake, it dropped to a lower level, and drained through the St. Lawrence area. This created a lower base level for the Niagara River, increasing its erosive capacity.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} in the literature that topography can influence soil nutrient stocks and dynamics in temperate regions, but for tropical forests, this source of variation has sometimes been ignored. The nature of such variations may depend upon the soil type, which in turn, is closely linked to local or regional topography. This study characterizes the soil and describes the status of carbon and nitrogen in vegetation, litterfall, litterlayer and soil upper layers along the main positions of a topographic gradient (<b>plateau,</b> <b>slope</b> and valley), 60 km north of Manaus, on Cuieiras Reserve watershed. Nitrogen concentrations in living leaves, fresh litterfall, litter-layer and soil upper layers were lower in the valley than in both slope and plateau plots. Carbon concentrations in plant material {{were not significantly different}} among the three topographic positions, resulting in higher C:N ratios in valley plots. Local topography (<b>plateau,</b> <b>slope</b> and valley) clearly was an influential factor in the nutrient distribution along the study locations. Lower rates of N cycling processes in the valley are probably related to its sandy soil texture and seasonal flooding...|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} how effective are {{the influences of}} detector sizes, types of gas field, and the changes of operation temperature on detector characteristics of Geiger Muller viewed from threshold voltage, <b>plateau,</b> <b>slope,</b> and the resolving time. The determination of detector characteristics {{was obtained from the}} detector enumeration with diameter variation, types of gas field, and temperature operation changes on Cs- 137 radiation. Data obtained from detector characteristics’ determination were the data count. Geiger Muller detector manufacturing process was started from the preparation of materials, the cathode tube and tube cap manufacture, installation of the detector and anode cap, vacuum tubes, gas fill, detector characteristic test, and data acquisition. The detector was made of stainless steel, the anode of tungsten wire with the length of 100 mm and diameters of 11 mm, 16 mm, 24 mm, and the anode diameter of 0. 08 mm. The gas field used alcohol argon and bromine argon, while for the temperature variation was increased from the temperature of 30 ºC to 70 ºC. Data obtained from the detector test were in the form of counts per minute (cpm) as a function of operating voltage (V) of the detector. From data of the test, it was illustrated the counting-per-minute graph on the detector’s operation voltage, so that the <b>plateau,</b> <b>slope</b> and resolving time of the detector could be determined. Research results obtained showed that the volume of the detector tube was influential on the detector characteristic curve. When the detector tube was varied, the initial voltage also changed. The change of gas field types also affected the detector characteristic curve. If the gas field type used argon gas having low ionization potential, the initial voltage of the detector would be smaller. Meanwhile, the increment of the detector’s temperature affected the detector’s count number and only slightly affected the length of the plateau while for the slope was relatively the same.

40|$|Zr(Fe xCr 1 -x) 2 (x = 0. 5 - 0. 8) alloys are {{promising}} hydride forming materials with various applications. Pressure-composition isotherms for Zr(Fe xCr 1 -x) 2 -hydrogen systems are determined over temperature range 283. 2 to 352. 2 K in a accurate Sieverts 2 ̆ 7 -type apparatus developed for this investigation. Pronounced hysteresis and <b>sloping</b> <b>plateaus</b> are observed. The degree of hysteresis decreases with increasing temperature, increases with Fe substitution for Cr and increases when determined with small aliquots. Hysteresis and <b>sloping</b> <b>plateaus</b> are reduced {{during the first}} few cycles of hydriding and dehydriding and they increase after the sample is exposed to air. The hysteresis factors, 12 RTlnP f/P d, range from 217 J/mol H for x = 0. 5 at 343. 2 K to 1169 J/mol H for x = 0. 8 at 283. 2 K. The <b>plateau</b> <b>slopes,</b> d(lnP) /(H/M), are about 0. 9 for hydride formation and range from 0. 5 to 1. 1 for hydride decomposition. Hysteresis and <b>sloping</b> <b>plateaus</b> have important effects on the application of hydride forming materials. A comprehensive and critical literature review reveals the complexity of hysteresis and <b>sloping</b> <b>plateaus</b> in metal-hydrogen systems and the existing theoretical models seem not to be adequate to explain the experimentally observed behavior. A model is proposed to identify the nature and origin(s) of hysteresis and <b>sloping</b> <b>plateaus</b> in metal-hydrogen systems, and the effects of temperature, composition, aliquot size, cycling, annealing and particle size are explained. In general, both elastic and plastic accommodation energies in both hydride formation and decomposition contribute to hysteresis and affect <b>plateau</b> <b>slopes.</b> For soft materials with ideal plastic behavior the elastic energy after plastic relaxation is small and the plastic energy is the major cause of hysteresis. For highly strain-hardening materials and brittle materials (most intermetallic compounds including Zr(Fe xCr 1 -x) 2), the elastic component dominates the total accommodation energy and hysteresis is primarily a consequence of the elastic strain energy.

40|$|Based on the {{clinical}} observation that dogs with a steep tibial <b>plateau</b> <b>slope</b> had variable tibial morphology, {{we hypothesized that}} these dogs could be further characterized using measurements developed by examining computer generated models of specific proximal tibial malformations. A 3 D tibial model was created from a normal canine tibia. The model was manipulated to reproduce two specific proximal tibial anomalies repre-senting deformities originating from the tibial plateau or the proximal tibial shaft. Data from these models were used to create specific measurements that would characterize the shape of these anomalies. These measurements included the diaphyseal tibial axis (DTA) /proximal tibial axis (PTA) angle, which defined {{the orientation of the}} proximal portion of the shaft in relation to the tibial mid-shaft. These measurements were then made on radiographs of dogs with and without cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture. Models with tibial plateau and proximal shaft deformities had a steep tibial <b>plateau</b> <b>slope</b> (TPS). Models with proximal shaft deformity had a markedly increased DTA/PTA angle. The model with a 101 proximal shaft deformity had a DTA/PTA angle of 11. 231. Six dogs (9. 0 %) had a DTA/PTA angle larger than 11. 231 (range, 11. 4 – 13. 91). Dogs in this group had ruptured CCL and a steep TPS. Dogs with CCL rupture had higher TPS (mean, 31. 8 ! 4. 11) and DTA/ PTA angle (mean, 6. 0 ! 3. 31) than dogs without CCL rupture (means, 23. 6 ! 3. 41 and 4. 1 ! 2. 21, respec-tively). Dogs with proximal shaft deformity represented a distinct group, which could not be identified using the magnitude of the TPS alone. Characterizing more precisely the shape of the proximal portion of the tibia in dogs contributes {{to our understanding of the}} pathogenesis of steep TPS and may facilitate the optimization of the surgical management of dogs with CCL rupture.
