25|$|The orange is {{a hybrid}} between <b>pomelo</b> (Citrus maxima) and {{mandarin}} (Citrus reticulata). It has genes that are ~25% <b>pomelo</b> and ~75% mandarin; however, {{it is not}} a simple backcrossed BC1 hybrid, but hybridized over multiple generations. The chloroplast genes, and therefore the maternal line, seem to be <b>pomelo.</b> The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced.
