40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present simple and fast methods for {{computing}} control points for <b>polynomial</b> <b>curves</b> and <b>polynomial</b> surfaces given explicitly in terms of polynomials (written as sums of monomials). We give recurrence formulae w. r. t. arbitrary affine frames. As a corollary, it is amusing that we can also give closed-form expressions in the case of the frame (r; s) for curves, and the frame ((1; 0; 0); (0; 1; 0); (0; 0; 1) for surfaces.

50|$|The {{degree of}} the <b>polynomial</b> <b>curve</b> being higher than needed for an exact fit is {{undesirable}} {{for all the}} reasons listed previously for high order polynomials, but also leads to a case where there are {{an infinite number of}} solutions. For example, a first degree polynomial (a line) constrained by only a single point, instead of the usual two, would give an infinite number of solutions. This brings up {{the problem of how to}} compare and choose just one solution, which can be a problem for software and for humans, as well. For this reason, it is usually best to choose as low a degree as possible for an exact match on all constraints, and perhaps an even lower degree, if an approximate fit is acceptable.|$|E
5000|$|For Bézier curves, it {{has become}} {{customary}} {{to refer to the}} -vectors p in a parametric representation [...] p of a curve or surface in -space as control points, while the scalar-valued functions , defined over the relevant parameter domain, are the corresponding weight or blending functions. Some would reasonably insist, in order to give intuitive geometric meaning to the word `control', that the blending functions form a partition of unity, i.e., that the [...] are nonnegative and sum to one. This property implies that the curve lies within the convex hull of its control points.

50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{compensating}} for roll deformation include continual varying crown (CVC), pair cross rolling, and work roll bending. CVC {{was developed by}} SMS-Siemag AG and involves grinding a third order <b>polynomial</b> <b>curve</b> into the work rolls and then shifting the work rolls laterally, equally, and opposite to each other. The effect is that the rolls will have a gap between them that is parabolic in shape, and will vary with lateral shift, thus allowing {{for control of the}} crown of the rolls dynamically. Pair cross rolling involves using either flat or parabolically crowned rolls, but shifting the ends at an angle so that the gap between the edges of the rolls will increase or decrease, thus allowing for dynamic crown control. Work roll bending involves using hydraulic cylinders at the ends of the rolls to counteract roll deflection.|$|E
5000|$|In {{evaluating}} the SiTF curve, the signal input and signal output are measured differentially; meaning, the differential of the input signal and differential of the output signal are calculated and plotted against each other. An operator, using computer software, defines an arbitrary area, with a given {{set of data}} points, within the signal and background regions of the output image of the infrared sensor, i.e. of the Unit Under Test (UUT), (see [...] "Half Moon" [...] image below). The average signal and background are calculated by averaging the data of each arbitrarily defined region. A second order <b>polynomial</b> <b>curve</b> is fitted to the data of each line. Then, the polynomial is subtracted from the average signal and background data to yield the new signal and background. The difference of the new signal and background data is taken to yield the net signal. Finally, the net signal is plotted versus the signal input. The signal input of the UUT is within its own spectral response. (e.g. color-correlated temperature, pixel intensity, etc.). The slope of the linear portion of this curve is then found using the method of least squares.|$|E
