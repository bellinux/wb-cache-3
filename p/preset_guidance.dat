50|$|<b>Preset</b> <b>guidance</b> is the {{simplest}} type of missile guidance. From {{the distance and}} direction of the target, the trajectory of the flight path is determined. Before firing, this information is programmed into the missile's guidance system, which, during flight, maneuvers the missile to follow that path. All the guidance components (including sensors such as accelerometers or gyroscopes) are contained within the missile, and no outside information (such as radio instructions) is used. An example of a missile using <b>Preset</b> <b>Guidance</b> is the V-2 rocket.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Army Air Forces {{continued}} {{development of}} the JB-2 as Project MX-544, with two versions— one with <b>preset</b> internal <b>guidance</b> and another with radar control. Several launch platforms were developed, including permanent and portable ramps, and mobile launching from beneath the wings of Boeing B-17G or Boeing B-29 bombers, much as the Heinkel He 111H-22 had [...] for the Luftwaffe in offensive air-launches of V-1s against the Allies. [...] Testing continued from 1944 to 1947 at Eglin to improve launch and guidance.|$|R
50|$|Testing by the 1st EGMG of the JB-2 was {{performed}} with two versions — the wartime version with <b>preset</b> internal <b>guidance</b> and another version fitted with radar control Testing began at Alamogordo Army Airfield, New Mexico in March 1947 and it spent several months preparing a detachment to depart for cold weather {{testing of the}} JB-2 in Alaska in November 1948. Additional testing was also done at the Santa Rosa Island Range Complex, Florida, and at Wagner Field (Eglin Auxiliary Field #1) from with MB-17Gs were fitted with the JB-2 for airborne launches.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and use of the conceptual framework of ecosystem services (ES) has been very successful in supporting the broad diffusion and application of ES within science and policy communities. However, most of the currently proposed interpretations of the framework neither correlate to environmental planning nor to decision-making contexts at the local and regional scale, which is a potential reason for the slow adoption and practice of the ES conceptual framework. This paper proposes a practice-oriented ES evaluation (PRESET) model specifically adapted to the requirements of local and regional planning and decision-making contexts, and discusses its potential benefits and implications for practice. Through the usage of PRESET we suggest making a distinction between 'offered ES', 'utilized ES', 'human input', and 'ES benefits' as relevant information for decision-making. Furthermore, we consider it important to link these decision-support categories to different value dimensions relevant in planning and management practice. <b>PRESET</b> provides <b>guidance</b> to inject the ES concept into planning, but needs to be implemented together with concrete assessment methods, indicators and data. The planning strategic benefits of using PRESET include its reference to existing legislative objectives, avoiding the risk that monetized ES values might dominate decision-making, clarification of human contributions, and easier identification of land use conflicts and synergies. Examples are given for offered and utilized ES, as well as for respective evaluation approaches and instruments of implementation...|$|R
