Such <b>partitions</b> are already known in several cases: Fano <b>partitions</b> for v = 8 and affine <b>partitions</b> for v = 9 or 10. We construct such <b>partitions</b> for several sporadic orders, namely, Fano <b>partitions</b> for v = 14, 16, 22, 23, 28, and an affine <b>partition</b> for v = 18.

In particular, both Fano and affine <b>partitions</b> exist for v = 3 (6 n) + 1.
