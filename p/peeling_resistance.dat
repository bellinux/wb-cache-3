40|$|The {{technique}} of adhesively bonding steel or fiber-reinforced plastic plates to {{the surfaces of}} reinforced concrete (RC) structural elements is being adopted worldwide to strengthen or repair reinforced concrete buildings and bridges. However, the prevention of premature debonding or peeling of externally bonded plates is a most critical aspect of design. One of the major modes of debonding in plated RC beams is shear peeling induced by the formation of critical diagonal cracks caused by the applied vertical shear forces. In this paper, mathematical models are developed for quantifying the shear <b>peeling</b> <b>resistance</b> of RC beams bonded with plates of different configurations. These models {{are based on the}} simplified theory of plasticity concepts for shear in reinforced concrete beams and also on procedures to compute the bond strength between an adhesively bonded plate and a concrete element. The models are validated against 32 test results from reinforced concrete beams adhesively bonded with either steel plates or steel angles attached to the tension faces, or tension face plated beams additionally bonded with side plates to improve their shear <b>peeling</b> <b>resistance.</b> M.

30|$|The present work {{describes}} pretreatment {{processes of}} thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) material, {{used as an}} adhesive in powder form, that results in the increased <b>peeling</b> <b>resistance</b> of joints. The TPU in powder form is an environmentally-friendly adhesive and provides safer bonding conditions in the shoe manufacturing industry. TPU particles are soft and require an anti-blocking agent to prevent agglomeration. However, particles covered by such an anti-blocking agent may account for a low <b>peeling</b> <b>resistance</b> in the resulting joints. To overcome this disadvantage, two pretreatment processes for the TPU adhesive were evaluated. The results of a two-step wet washing process, representing a conventional solvent-based procedure that involves both {{the application of a}} solvent and a powder separation step, are compared to the performance of a one-step dry plasma treatment process. The process type did not affect the size and agglomeration behavior of the particles, and both processes were effective in improving joint strength according to peeling test results. Spectroscopic investigation of the particle surface after washing or plasma treatment indicated some zinc concentration, which is interpreted to result from the anti-blocking agent. The crystallinity of the TPU, investigated by thermal analysis, was higher after pretreatment. The obtained results indicate that TPU in powder form is a versatile adhesive for the shoe industry with a safer application compared to solvent based adhesive systems.|$|E

40|$|Bio-adaptable 2 -layer polytetrafluoroethylene/polyethylene (PTFE/PE) {{laminated}} sheets {{were prepared}} {{by a new}} adhesion method, a double-step treatment consisting of applying low dose (0. 43 MGy) homogeneous low energy electron beam irradiation (HLEBI) to the 2 -layer assembly where the HLEBI penetrates through the PTFE and PE layers, respectively, prior to hot-press under 5 MPa and 433 K. Although the adhesion of the PTFE/PE sheets cannot be observed without the new double-step treatment, bonding forces were created {{as evidenced by the}} mean adhesive forces of <b>peeling</b> <b>resistance</b> (oFp). The adhesion cannot be observed without HLEBI. On the other hand, application of a small dose of HLEBI (less than 0. 43 MGy) prior to hot-press lamination enhances the oFp at each Pp. The maximum oFp values at each Pp (0. 06, 0. 50 and 0. 94) of the laminated sheet irradiated at 0. 13, 0. 13, and 0. 22 MGy are 5. 44, 10. 7, and 19. 7 Nm 1, respectively. Based on the 3 -parameter Weibull equation, the lowest oFp value at Pp of zero (Fs) could be estimated. An increasing trend in Fs occurs by the double-step treatment applying HLEBI up to 0. 43 MGy reaching a maximum at 2. 66 Nm 1, improving the safety level without radiation damage of PTFE/PE. It was more than 6 times higher than that of PTFE/Polyurethane (PU) (0. 4 Nm 1). When HLEBI cuts the chemical bonds and generates dangling bonds with nonbonding electrons in PTFE and PE, the created adhesion between the laminated sheets can be explained. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) surface analysis of the PTFE/PE laminated sheets after the peeling tests, fluorine (F) was detected on the PE peeled surface, indicating both strong chemical and intermolecular bonds generated by the double-step treatment.

40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} models of connections {{are essential for}} the design of aluminium parts in cars. Today, there exist a few models customized for self-piercing rivets (SPR), but none for self-piercing screws (SPS). This thesis presents an experimental and numerical study on the behaviour of SPR and SPS connections for different loading situations. For the rolled base material, AA 6016 in the T 4 condition, uniaxial tension, plane strain tension and in-plane single shear tests were performed. The Voce isotropic hardening rule and the YLD- 2004 - 18 P anisotropic yield function were calibrated using MatPrePost. The calibration was validated by simulations of the material tests. Cross tests in three directions, single lap-joint tests and peeling tests were performed for SPR and SPS, and a point-connector model developed for self-piercing rivets was calibrated by a reverse engineering approach based on the cross tests. Single lap-joint and peeling tests were used for validation. Forming process simulations were performed to account for initial plastic deformations in bent specimens. In all tests except for pure normal loading, failure of SPR was initiated from the top sheet, while failure of SPS was caused by pull-out from the bottom sheet in all cases. For SPR, good predictions were found, except for over-prediction of the <b>peeling</b> <b>resistance.</b> The model was not able to describe mixed tension and shear loading accurately for SPS, but other tests were well reproduced. Static and dynamic crash box tests were performed and deformation and failure modes of SPR and SPS were characterized. The same progressive buckling mode was found in all tests. Higher force was observed for riveted crash boxes compared to the screwed. Relative movement between the sheets was observed for SPS. During dynamic testing, 7 % of the SPR and 19 % of the SPS connections failed. Simulations of dynamic crash box tests investigated effects of forming history, yield surface and mesh size. The deformation mode was well reproduced, but the force was under-predicted with 5 % to 20 %. The simulations predicted some connection failure for SPS, but not for SPR. A more fundamental understanding of the behaviour of SPS connections is required to develop a new point-connector model. Further studies could include investigation of the effects of screw diameter, sheet thickness, sheet material, screw material and dynamic effects of the connection. </p...|$|E

Isotropic {{reactive ion etching}} (RIE) is applied to form pits in the Si substrate which fill upon application of a polymer via spinning. After curing, interpenetrating polymer lobes form a robust bond with the Si substrate. Adhesion improvements over films on smooth substrates are demonstrated qualitatively through prolonged immersion in heated 40 % potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, and quantitatively through peel tests. Strips of SU- 8 on smooth substrates separate completely within minutes of immersion in KOH, whereas mechanically interlocked strips remain attached throughout.

This phenomenon occurs only 3 - 6 days after ripening induction in specific cultivars such as cv. 925 when stored in saturating humidity conditions. In these conditions, Cavendish cultivars (Grande Naine, cv. GN) are not susceptible to splitting. Cvs. 925 and GN were thus investigated to detect possible determinants associated with splitting. Splitting intensity was tentatively {{found to be associated}} with an inverse water flux at high relative humidity (RH) through an osmotic peel to pulp water flux resulting from the higher sugar content in the pulp than in the peel.

The results gathered for this work have been used to generate a novel empirical tool that predicts the CO 2 laser power required to achieve a viable adhesive bond for this material combination. This predictive tool will enable the packaging industry to achieve markedly increased financial yield, process efficiency, reduced material waste and process flexibility. A laser spot size dependent linear increase in laser line energy was necessary for this material combination, suggesting the minimal impact of thermal strain rate. Moreover a high level of repeatability around this threshold laser line energy was indicated, suggesting that laser activated adhesive bonding of such polymer films is viable. The adhesion between the material combination trialled here responded linearly to thermal load. In particular, when using the smallest diameter laser spot, it is proposed that the resulting high irradiance caused film or adhesive material damage; thus, resulting in reduced <b>peel</b> <b>resistance</b> force.

40|$|The {{adhesive}} applied roofing system (AARS) is a {{new generation}} of built-up roof, gaining popularity in the Canadian low-slope roofing market. All components of the AARS are integrated using adhesive and unlike mechanically attached roofing systems, there are no fasteners used. Thus, an AARS can offer less thermal bridging, air intrusion, air leakage, moisture migration, and corrosion problems. The components are, however, subjected to the combined action of tensile and shearing forces due to the dynamic wind uplift action as a result of wind flow suction over a low-slope roof. As part of an ongoing collaboration between industries, universities, and government departments to quantify the wind uplift resistance standards of the AARS, three different testing methods have been successfully developed: (1) uplift <b>resistance</b> testing, (2) <b>peel</b> <b>resistance</b> testing, and (3) wind uplift testing. Small scale specimens were used for the uplift and <b>peel</b> <b>resistance</b> testing, whereas wind uplift investigations were performed using full-scale mock-ups. This paper focuses on a proposed correlation amongst these three different test methods, namely, "Higher <b>resistance</b> in both <b>peel</b> and uplift tests will result in the same or higher wind uplift resistance. " Four different scenarios of two sets of samples each were constructed by varying only one component between the samples.

Though the Adhesive Applied Roof Systems (AARS) are gaining popularity in North America, systematic review of the existing national and international standards revealed that there is no proper testing procedure established to quantify the <b>peel</b> <b>resistance</b> of AARS. The objective of the present study is to develop a peel testing procedure based on systematic laboratory investigations. Specimens (6 in. x 6 in. or 152 mm x 152 mm) composed of insulation and cover board were adhered together by applying cold adhesives. To represent the realistic conditions of the field construction, specimens were prepared using components from four industrial sources. Specimens were then subjected to a peeling force at two different locations with various peel angles ranging from 7. 5 ° to 45 ° to simulate the blister shape, that can occur on AARS under several wind action. Additional specimen sizes were also tested for selected combinations to evaluate the size effect. A total of 378 specimens with various physical parameters were constructed, cured for 28 days and tested using an Instron machine at a constant loading speed.

Using an EDX investigation, it was possible to verify a reduction of the zinc species in the layer around the TPU particles, without compromising the blocking characteristics of the TPU adhesive following treatment, as the treatments essentially only affected the zinc stearate layer. Particle size investigations with optical microscopy, Beckman Coulter and SEM indicated that the zinc stearate layer is small in comparison to the TPU particle size. Therefore, the treatments acted only on the layer containing the zinc stearate lubricant. The crystallinity test showed a higher value for the TPU adhesive powder after both the white spirit wash and plasma treatments, which was attributed to an increase in the hard segments, which are responsible for the best cohesion and, thus, better <b>peel</b> <b>resistance</b> values.|$|R

On the other hand, the EDX measurement performed with an acceleration voltage of 5  kV revealed a similar zinc concentration for both the treated TPU powders and the original powder. Moreover, for all the TPU powders investigated the zinc concentration obtained from the measurement with 15  kV was lower than that obtained with 5  kV. As the information depth of the measurement with 15  kV is at least twice as big as that of the measurement with 5  kV, which is approximately 1  µm, the latter investigation is more surface sensitive. Therefore, these findings reveal that the zinc containing species are concentrated at the surface of the TPU particles, within a region that has a thickness of approximately 1  µm. Moreover, following the powder treatments the composition of the zinc containing layer appeared to differ from the state of the original powder. Possible effects of this finding are subsequently assessed by measuring the <b>peel</b> <b>resistance</b> and blocking properties to verify the good storage properties of TPU.|$|R

A potential technical hurdle in the form bubbling has been witnessed and described. Bubbling prevented contact between the two laminates and impinged upon the viability of the bonds produced; film handling improvement is recommended as a solution. The Gaussian profile of the laser in concert with the circular laser spot shape and the traverse strategy of the scans used caused the centre of the bond to be over irradiated whilst the edge was under-irradiated.

Respiration rate decreased by more than half following 30 days of storage, while internal CO 2 and O 2 rose and decreased, respectively. Conversely, resistance to CO 2 diffusion increased drastically with time in storage. Waxing significantly decreased respiration rate and doubled resistance to CO 2 diffusion, while anaerobic treatments did not influence physiological parameters. Off-flavour development due to time in storage or wax application strongly affected taste of fruits. Exposition to CO 2 negatively influenced fruit taste also, with respect to control and N 2 exposed fruits. In general, the higher the ethanol content in the juice, the higher the off-flavour score and the lower the acceptability by panellists. The external fruit appearance declined with time in storage. Waxing or anaerobic treated fruits maintained a better freshness than control fruits. From a commercial standpoint the best result was gained with non-waxed nitrogen-treated fruits, which stored satisfactorily for 10 days...|$|R
40|$|Enhancing the {{effective}} <b>peel</b> <b>resistance</b> of plastically deforming adhesive joints through laser-based surface micro-machining Edwin Hernandez Diaz Inspired by adhesion examples {{commonly found in}} nature, we reached out to {{examine the effect of}} different kinds of heterogeneous surface properties that may replicate this behavior and the mechanisms at work. In order to do this, we used pulsed laser ablation on copper substrates (CuZn 40) aiming to increase adhesion for bonding. A Yb-fiber laser was used for surface preparation of the substrates, which were probed with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Heterogeneous surface properties were devised through the use of simplified laser micromachined patterns which may induce sequential events of crack arrest propagation, thereby having a leveraging effect on dissipation. The me- chanical performance of copper/epoxy joints with homogeneous and heterogeneous laser micromachined interfaces was then analyzed using the T-peel test. Fractured surfaces were analyzed using SEM to resolve the mechanism of failure and adhesive penetration within induced surface asperities from the treatment. Results confirm positive modifications of the surface morphology and chemistry from laser ablation that enable mechanical interlocking and cohesive failure within the adhesive layer. Remarkable improvements of apparent peel energy, bond toughness, and effective peel force were appreciated with respect to sanded substrates as control samples...|$|R
