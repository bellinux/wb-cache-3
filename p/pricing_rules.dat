40|$|To control Medicaid's {{expenditure}} on prescription drugs, 1990 legislation {{established a}} rebate program guaranteeing Medicaid a rebate on each unit purchased by Medicaid participants. The rebate {{is the difference}} between the minimum price and the average manufacturer <b>price</b> (minimum <b>price</b> <b>rule)</b> or a proportion of the average manufacturer <b>price</b> (average <b>price</b> <b>rule).</b> We characterize the optimal pricing strategy of a third-degree price discriminating monopolist under these rules. Under the minimum <b>price</b> <b>rule,</b> the minimum <b>price</b> gross of rebate always increases whereas prices gross of rebate in {{at least some of the}} markets always decrease. In contrast, under the average <b>price</b> <b>rule,</b> these <b>prices</b> may move in the same direction in all markets, with all increasing in some circumstances and all decreasing in others. We also examine the effects of such provisions on social welfare. We analyze a modified version of our minimum <b>price</b> <b>rule</b> model suitable for applications beyond Medicaid. ...|$|R
30|$|Energy {{conservation}} {{is an important}} policy problem worldwide. In the near future, demand-side control will become a more important policy for countries and regions because dynamic pricing schemes {{are one of the}} best tools to control the demand of electricity. However, many consumers need to support the dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> to achieve effective control of energy demand. Therefore, we need to consider not only the direct effect of each <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> but also whether consumers want to support such a <b>pricing</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|R
30|$|In the survey, we used {{a choice}} experiment. We {{presented}} respondents information about the demand response (for details on the information given to correspondents is shown in Additional file 1 : Appendix). Respondents were asked to cast eight decisions during the experiment. Although the contents of options changed each time, option 6 (general <b>pricing</b> <b>rule)</b> remained the same. (Option 6 was the general <b>pricing</b> <b>rule.</b> In short, consumers did not change the <b>pricing</b> <b>rule).</b> The general <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> {{is the most common}} option in Japan. The order of the choice set was random, and the contents of the choice set were different for each respondent. Each time, the value of the “monthly fee” (the variable name was “month”) and the “initial cost” (the variable name is “first”) was randomly changed. The initial cost for the introduction of the demand response is one important factor that determines whether consumers join new pricing schemes. To control the initial cost effect for decision making, we added the initial cost as the basic attribute to the questionnaire. Respondents chose one option they found optimal. The general <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> (option 6) did not change the monthly electricity rate. Before asking the question in the choice experiment, we explained each dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> to respondents (see Additional file 1 : Appendix).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a non-linear <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> for the {{valuation of assets}} on financial markets with intermediaries. The non-linearity arises {{from the fact that}} dealers charge a price for their intermediation between buyer and seller. The <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> we propose is an alternative for the wellknown no-arbitrage pricing on markets without frictions. The price of an asset equals the signed Choquet integral of its discounted payo with respect to a concave signed capacity. We show that this <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> is consistent with equilibrium. Furthermore, equilibria are shown to satisfy a notion of constrained Pareto optimality. ...|$|R

Moreover, the limit behaviors of the three models when trading frequency approaches infinity are given, showing that Model 1 acquires a strong-form efficiency, Model 2 acquires the Kyle's (1985) continuous equilibrium, and Model 3 acquires an equilibrium with information released at an increasing speed. ...|$|R

We illustrate our estimation procedure by calibrating this optimal <b>price</b> <b>rule</b> for both the leader and the follower using data on past sales and prices from the mid-size sedan segment of the U.

Thus, the WTP of critical peak pricing (CPP) is {{lower than that of}} other pricing schemes. In addition, the WTP of RTP {{is similar to that of}} DLC.

5000|$|This paper stimulated a {{subfield}} of economics, {{devoted to}} <b>pricing</b> <b>rules,</b> as discussed by Jacques Drèze: [...] "Starting {{with a paper}} in Econometrica by Dierker, Guesnerie and Neuefeind (1985), a theory of general equilibrium has developed for economies with non-convex production sets, where firms follow well-defined <b>pricing</b> <b>rules.</b> In particular, existence theorems of increasing generality cover (to some extent, because of various differences in assumptions) the case of Ramsey-Boiteux pricing. Those interested primarily in applications might express skepticism, perhaps even horrified skepticism, upon realizing that 90 pages of a serious economics journal—a 1988 issue of The Journal of Mathematical Economics—were devoted to existence proofs of equilibrium in non-convex economies, under alternative formulations of the assumption that marginal cost pricing entails bounded losses at normalized prices. Still, I think that economic research must cover the whole spectrum from concrete applications to that level of abstraction." ...|$|E
40|$|Competitive pricing is a <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> that {{combines}} two principles that {{are present in}} competitive markets.

But also {{that they can be}} applied to economies with non-convex production sets (e. g. firms with S-shaped production functions).

40|$|Expected {{revenue and}} allocative {{efficiency}} {{are two of}} the most important considerations in auction design. The Revenue Equivalence Theorem provides conditions under which many single-object auctions generate the same expected revenue, but theory provides little guidance when more than one object is sold. In such settings, the question of which auction format or <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> generates the most expected revenue or the most efficient allocation remains largely an empirical one. In Canada, the central bank (the Bank of Canada) currently uses a multiunit, sealed-bid auction format in conjunction with a discriminatory <b>pricing</b> <b>rule</b> to invest excess government cash in term-deposits at a select set of financial institutions. Winners at these auctions pay their tendered bids, so participants shave their bids in equilibrium and winning allocations can be inefficient.
