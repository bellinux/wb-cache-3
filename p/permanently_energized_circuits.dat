40|$|Computation of {{capacitive}} and {{inductive coupling}} between parallel circuits of power lines allows determination of induced currents and voltages on the <b>energized</b> <b>circuits</b> {{due to the}} voltages and currents on the adjacent <b>energized</b> <b>circuit(s).</b> Various computer tools are now available for these computations.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the workplace hazards generally faced by industrial workers, electricians are also particularly exposed to injury by electricity. An electrician may experience electric shock due to direct contact with <b>energized</b> <b>circuit</b> conductors or due to stray voltage caused by faults in a system. An electric arc exposes eyes and skin to hazardous amounts of heat and light. Faulty switchgear may cause an arc flash incident with a resultant blast. Electricians are trained to work safely and take many measures to minimize the danger of injury. Lockout and tagout procedures are used {{to make sure that}} circuits are proven to be de-energized before work is done. Limits of approach to energized equipment protect against arc flash exposure; specially designed flash-resistant clothing provides additional protection; grounding (earthing) clamps and chains are used on line conductors to provide a visible assurance that a conductor is de-energized. Personal protective equipment provides electrical insulation as well as protection from mechanical impact; gloves have insulating rubber liners, and work boots and hard hats are specially rated to provide protection from shock. If a system cannot be de-energized, insulated tools are used; even high-voltage transmission lines can be repaired while energized, when necessary.|$|R
50|$|In a {{solenoid-operated}} safety shutoff valve, {{a spring}} action closes the valve instantly when an electric current fails and the solenoid {{ceases to be}} <b>energized.</b> The solenoid <b>circuit</b> is generally arranged {{so that it is}} broken upon failure of any element of the system.

5000|$|Standby {{power is}} {{electrical}} power used by appliances and equipment while switched off or not performing their primary function, often {{waiting to be}} activated by a remote controller.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} an electrical safety program that incorporates all workers into the program, not just the electrical workers. It is largely in response to a paper presented at the 2012 ESW by Lanny Floyd entitled "Facilitating Application of Electrical Safety Best Practices to "Other" Workers" which requested all attendees to review their electrical safety program to assure that non-electrical workers were protected as well as electrical workers. The referenced paper indicated that roughly 50 % of electrical incidents involve workers whose primary function is not electrical in nature. It also encouraged all to "address electrical safety for all workers and not just workers whose job responsibilities involve working on or near <b>energized</b> electrical <b>circuits.</b> " In this paper, a program which includes specific briefings to non-electrical workers as well as to workers who may need to perform their normal activities in proximity to energized electrical conductors is presented. The program uses a targeted approach to specific areas such as welding, excavating, rigging, chart reading, switching, cord and plug equipment and several other general areas to point out hazards that may exist and how to avoid them. NFPA 70 E- 2004 was incorporated into the program several years ago and with it the need to include the "other" workers became apparent. The site experience over the years supports the assertion that about half of the electrical incidents involve non-electrical workers and this prompted us to develop specific briefings to enhance the knowledge of the non-electrical worker regarding safe electrical practices. The promotion of "May is Electrical Safety Month" and the development of informative presentations which are delivered to the general site population as well as electrical workers have greatly improved the hazards awareness status of the general worker on site...|$|R

40|$|Use of Renewable Energy {{power sources}} {{is the best}} {{possible}} solution today to reduce increasingly risk of global warming {{and the most important}} type of renewable is Wind and Solar energies which are the most efficient. The green power generation resources are used power generators in Distributed Generation (DGs) sources that are in direct relation with the use of micro capacity power generating units of power system that are installed in distribution level of power systems or all segments that loads and energy consumers are located. Hybrid systems vary in models. The best hybrid model available today is combination of grid connected wind turbines and solar PV cells that can compensate each other in the grid connected state.

Early programming techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, {{one of the first}} being ladder logic, where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder.

40|$|With highly {{accelerated}} {{developments in}} computing and communications technology, society's overall dependence on this equipment {{is becoming increasingly}} acute. In areas such as critical electronic data processing centres and telecommunication hubs, {{one of the main}} protection objectives is to achieve minimum operational disruption, as downtime resulting from a fire condition could lead to huge financial losses. Minimising negative impact on an organization and the need for a sound basis in the decision making process are the fundamental reasons why companies implement fire risk management for their essential information technology systems. For many years a key element used to protect these critical assets was the installation of a fixed Halon 1301 gas extinguishing system. Often, the mere presence of a computer was sufficient justification to install such a system and little thought was given to any systematic fire risk assessment of the installation. This led to the use of Halon 1301 where other fire extinguishing systems and protection techniques could have been applied with equal effectiveness and at comparable costs. The cessation of production of halon {{as a result of the}} Montreal Protocol gave fresh impetus to the development of suitable alternative fire extinguishing agents. It also offered fire protection engineers an opportunity to re-evaluate existing loss control techniques and to examine alternative fire protection strategies. However, it is argued in this study, that an appropriate level of automatic fire protection can only be determined by the use of a suitable quantitative risk assessment and a number of such methodologies are critically examined. There are a significant number of contributing factors that must be considered when deciding which fire suppression system to select for a new installation or whether to retrofit fire suppression on a legacy platform. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a methodology to quantify any fire suppression technology by its life cycle cost and then to apply informed technical opinion into this system. The results of this assessment procedure offer a number of possible fire engineering solutions including a quite diverse range of automatic fire extinguishing techniques and these are discussed and evaluated in detail. Inevitably, a high proportion of such critical risks will require the installation of an automatic fire suppression system. The main halocarbon and inert replacement extinguishing agents are therefore critically compared and contrasted for their suitability in protecting these facilities. A complete review of these extinguishing agents was conducted which focused on suppression mechanisms; quantification of their performance and qualities; interaction with a fire and potential damage to electrical equipment from the release of a given agent. It is shown that all the post-halon extinguishing agents are deficient in some important areas. Major issues such as the formation of thermal decomposition products, the protection of continuously <b>energized</b> electrical <b>circuits</b> and the adequacy of the specified design and extinguishing concentrations have generally not been adequately addressed. Unfortunately, some of these issues are not even resolved in the current gaseous fire extinguishing standards which offer minimal advice from either a design or installation standpoint. This study demonstrates that existing international design standards are deficient in some fundamental areas and that, in a number of circumstances, systems installed to these standards are inadequate to fully protect the hazard in question. A number of recommendations are presented to address some of these deficiencies. Finally, a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology for the selection of suitable extinguishing agents is proposed. Initially, this attempts to synthesize the results derived from the critical extinguishing agent review and then applies an application weighting factor based on expert consensus to provide a final score for a particular suppression mechanisms suitability to protect a given application...|$|R
