5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to both people and property.|$|E

Among the other active volcanoes of the South Volcanic Zone are Mount Hudson, Llaima, and Villarrica.

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{does not}} act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only reaction is alarm calling. Predators include snakes, weasels, squirrels, and blue jays, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and hawks and cats, which <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to both young and adults. As of 2007, the oldest known American goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|In South Africa and Australia, two of {{the three}} centers of species diversity, the natural {{habitats}} of these plants are undergoing a high degree of pressure from human activities. Expanding population centers (such as Queensland, Perth, and Cape Town) threaten many such habitats, as does the draining of moist areas for agriculture and forestry in rural areas. The droughts that have been sweeping Australia over the last 10 years also <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to many species by drying up previously moist areas.|$|E
5|$|In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott, Barry J. Kellett and David J. Stickland {{identified}} {{this system}} as a candidate to evolve into a Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable. At a distance of 150light years, this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the Earth. However, {{in the time it}} will take for the system to evolve to a state where a supernova could occur, it will have moved a considerable distance from Earth but may yet <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Katrina, 150,000people and 120,000head of cattle in central Cuba were evacuated, {{according to a}} broadcast by Havana radio. As a result, Cuban Civil Defense officers issued a storm alert for five provinces. A hurricane watch was declared for the central and eastern Bahamas. Along the southeast coast of Florida, small craft were advised to remain close to port. However, the storm was not expected to, and did not, <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Infections {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{acquired in the}} urban environment. In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in {{the areas in which}} it is common, and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, and might <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} a long history of {{association}} with humans, having been extensively hunted as a pest and furbearer for many centuries, as well as being represented in human folklore and mythology. Because of its widespread distribution and large population, the red fox is one of the most important furbearing animals harvested for the fur trade. Too small to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to humans, it has extensively benefited from the presence of human habitation, and has successfully colonised many suburban and urban areas.|$|E
5|$|Those {{targets that}} did <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> {{automatically}} triggered {{the switch to}} engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt {{to pick out the}} warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E

5|$|When the {{hurricane}} appeared to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Bermuda, its government issued a hurricane watch. Around 24hours before Erin made its closest approach, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Initial forecasts indicated Erin would pass within 15miles (24km) of the island. As a result, ferry and bus transport was suspended. Officials prepared a {{school to be}} used as an emergency shelter, though few people used it.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the highly populated region.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{show that}} up to 500,000people living in the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 {{individuals}} being considered to be at high risk. Lahars <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchina, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating {{that the threat of}} a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E

5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat,</b> {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|His successor, Tanutamun, {{also made}} a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia. He {{successfully}} defeated Necho, the native Egyptian puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards. Tantamani (Tanutamun) was heavily routed and fled back to Nubia. The Assyrian army sacked Thebes {{to such an extent}} it never truly recovered. A native ruler, Psammetichus I was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, and the Nubians were never again to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to either Assyria or Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania {{was ruled}} {{during the early}} 13th century {{by a number of}} dukes and princes {{presiding}} over various fiefdoms and tribes. They were loosely bonded by commonalities of religion and tradition, trade, kinship, joint military campaigns, and the presence of captured prisoners from neighboring areas. Western merchants and missionaries began seeking control of the area during the 12th century, establishing the city of Riga, Latvia in 1201. Their efforts in Lithuania were temporarily halted by defeat at the Battle of Saule in 1236, but armed Christian orders continued to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b> The country had also undergone incursions by the Mongol Empire.|$|E
