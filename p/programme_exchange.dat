50|$|Television was {{introduced}} in Western Europe in the early 1950s but came late to most Nordic countries. Denmark started regular broadcasts in 1954, Sweden in 1956, Finland in 1957, while Norway did not begin until 1960. Sweden, Finland and Norway have a large territory but a relatively small population, and {{one reason for the}} late introduction of television was related to the feasibility a transmitter system that would provide {{the majority of the population}} with access. Moreover, the government policy for example in Sweden concentrated efforts and financial resources on the construction of a network of stations rather than on increasing programming hours. Thus, a regional <b>programme</b> <b>exchange</b> was also seen as a solution to programme supply, particularly in categories with high productions costs, such as entertainment and drama. In this context, television was seen as having a potential to make a major contribution towards developing and fostering Nordic cooperation. Whilst the more extensive European exchange system Eurovision already existed since 1955, the programming it provided was focused on sports, news and cultural events, due to the technological constraints posed by live transmissions and language differences as it would not have been possible to provide subtitles. Mainly because of the late start of television in Norway, Nordvision began later than its wider European counterpart. Denmark and Sweden had begun cooperating in TV production as early as the summer of 1958, but the official start of the Nordic exchange did not take place until October 1959.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{alignment}} {{level is}} commonly 0 dBu (Equal to 0.775 Volts RMS) in broadcast chains and in professional audio what is {{commonly known as}} [...] "0VU", which is +4dBu (Equal to 1.227 Volts RMS) in places where the signal exists as analogue voltage. Under normal situations the [...] "0VU" [...] reference allowed for a headroom of 18dB or more above the reference level without significant distortion. This is largely due to the use of slow responding VU meters in almost all analog professional audio equipment which, by their design, and by specification responded to an average level, not peak levels. It most commonly is at −18 dB FS (18 dB below full scale digital) on digital recordings for <b>programme</b> <b>exchange,</b> in accordance with EBU recommendations. Digital equipment must use peak reading metering systems to avoid severe digital distortion caused by the signal going beyond 'full scale' or maximum digital levels. 24-bit original or master recordings commonly have alignment level at −24 dB FS to allow extra headroom, which can then be reduced to match the available headroom of the final medium by audio level compression. FM broadcasts usually have only 9 dB of headroom as recommended by the EBU, but digital broadcasts, which could operate with 18dB of headroom, given their low noise floor even in difficult reception areas, currently operate in a state of confusion, with some transmitting at maximum level while others operate at much lower level even though they carry material that has been compressed for compatibility with the lower dynamic range of FM transmissions.|$|E

40|$|Over recent decades, {{the flow}} of {{television}} programmes and services between nations has prompted concerns about `Cultural Imperialism', {{the idea that the}} powerful metropolitan nations at the centre of the world system are breaking down the integrity and autonomy of the peripheral countries. New Patterns in Global Television challenges that notion by showing that some of the countries outside the traditionally dominant centres have now developed strong television industries of their own, and have been expanding into regional markets, especially - but not exclusively - where linguistic and cultural similarities exist. This book brings together contributions from specialist researchers on the most dynamic of these regions: Latin America, India, the Middle East, Greater China and, in the English-speaking world, Canada and Australia. It provides the first comprehensive overview of the new patterns of flow in international television <b>programme</b> <b>exchange</b> and service provision in the satellite era, patterns unrecognised by the perspective of the prevailing theoretical orthodoxies in international communication research and policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this diploma thesis {{belongs to the}} field of {{language}} acquisition and language learning. It aims to explore Czech as a second and foreign language of speakers whose mother tongue is German, namely concerning the pronunciation of the r-sound and its perceptual acceptability for Czech native speakers. The theoretical part summarizes the area of pronunciation learning and acquisition in a second and foreign language and outlines various pronunciation difficulties German speakers tend to have in Czech. It deals with the rhotics in general and subsequently focuses on the r- sound, both in Czech and in German, as well as in mutual comparison. In the last chapter, the combinatorial qualities of the r-sound which are used as a basis for the practical part are discussed. The practical part describes the conducted research. Five recordings of German students were collected. The students were staying in Prague for one semester with the Erasmus <b>programme</b> <b>exchange</b> and were learning Czech for the first time. For the recordings a written text was constructed which the students read individually. The text emphasized words including the r-sound. From the recordings, various key words were cut off and a perceptual test was compiled and given to Czech native speakers to evaluate the pronunciation of the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Video {{standards}} {{have been designed}} {{in the past to}} strike a particular compromise between quality, cost, transmission, or storage capacity, and compatibility with other standards. The three main formats that were in use until roughly 1980 apply picture rates of 50 or 60 Hz for interlaced video, and 24, 25, or 30 Hz for film material. Conversion between these formats was required for movie broadcast and international <b>programme</b> <b>exchange</b> With the arrival of videoconferencing, high-definition television (HDTV), workstations, and personal computers (PCs), many new video formats have appeared. As indicated in Figure 16. 1, these include lowend formats such as common intermediate format (CIF) and quarter CIF (QCIF) with smaller picture size and lower picture rates, progressive and interlaced HDTV formats at 50 and 60 Hz, and other video formats used in multimedia PCs, while high-end television displays appeared on the market with high picture rates, 75 – 240 Hz, to prevent flicker on cathode ray tube (CRT) -displays [11], or to improve the motion portrayal on liquid crystal displays (LCDs) [18]. Despite many attempts to globally standardize video formats, the above observations suggest that video format conversion (VFC) is of a growing importance This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 16. 1, we shall discuss motion estimation. Next, we will elaborate on de-interlacing in Section 16. 2. Both motion estimation and de-interlacing are crucial parts in the more advanced picture-rate converters. Finally, picture-rate conversion methods are discussed in Section 16. 3...|$|E

Paulo (Denise Bernuzzi de Sant???Anna) and the Asociaci??n M??dica Argentina (Vicente Enrique Mazzafero Mart??n). Designed as a textbook especially destined for post-graduate students, the main purpose of this book is to make access easier to a diversified set of documents considered of great significance to illustrate relevant content in terms of health and welfare dynamics. The book is organized into three parts (Health and Welfare; Perspectives on Gender and Health; Migration, Urbanization and Health), that start with a general introduction to the subject, followed by a small presentation, and in some cases, problematization, of the documents. Each chapter ends with a bibliographic list of the most recent and/or most important titles, according to the chapter authors??? perspective, for the subject in analysis. Issues in Europe and Latin America are the focus of the book. The linguistic diversity of the project partners was assumed as an added-value that we wanted to preserve, not only taking into account the book???s potential public-target ??? students, researchers and professors of diverse countries, with expertise in several languages ??? but also as a way to escape from the imposition of a singlely language for science, without obviously denying the importance of the English as an international language...|$|E
