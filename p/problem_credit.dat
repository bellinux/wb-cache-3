In practice, such decisions are often made by applying a fixed cutoff to the maximum likelihood estimate of a parametric model of the default probability. Following (Elliott and Lieli, 2007), we argue that this practice might contradict the lender's economic objective and, using German loan data, we illustrate the use of "context-specific" cutoffs and an estimation method derived directly from the lender's problem.

ACO {{is one of the}} important naturally inspired intelligent techniques. It is based on the foraging behavior of real ants in nature. The proposed ACO is combined with a number of nearest neighbor classifiers. The resulting ACO algorithm is applied to classify credit risk using data belonging to 1, 411 firms obtained from a leading Greek commercial bank. The objective is to classify subject firms into several groups representing different levels of credit risk. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with those of others including SVM, CART, and with two other metaheuristic algorithms using tabu search and genetic algorithms, both of which use nearest neighbor classifiers in the classification phase. The results suggest that the proposed method is more accurate than others that have been tested in classifying credit risk.

The cycle has a period of around 10 years. We also detect longer term movements in default probabilities and default correlations. Our findings {{have important implications for}} portfolio credit risk analysis. First, a static analysis of portfolio credit risk can underestimate credit risk significantly by not accounting for the dynamic and cyclical behaviour of default probabilities. Second, estimating default correlations over long horizons without accounting for time variation may lead to misspecified risk management models. We highlight the main effects in an actual credit risk experiment, addressing the issue of pro-cyclicality in ratings and capital buffer formation. It turns out that dynamic models anticipate much better on required capital buffer increases than rating strategies based on recent historical data. In this way, dynamic credit risk models may help to alleviate part of the pro-cyclicality <b>problem.</b> <b>credit</b> risk; pro-cyclicality; capital requirements; dynamic models; common factors; credit cycles; time varying parameters...|$|E

The model will be implemented, tested, and validated for individual auto loans using real life bank data. The neural network is used as the learner and the fuzzy logic is used as the implementer. The neural network will fine tune the fuzzy sets, remove redundant input variables, and extract fuzzy rules.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} a general approach for classifying objects using mathematical programming algorithms. The approach {{is based on}} optimizing a utility function, which is quadratic in indicator parameters and is linear in control parameters (which need to be identified). Qualitative characteristics of the utility function, such as monotonicity in some variables, are included using additional constraints. The methodology was tested with a "credit cards scoring" <b>problem.</b> <b>Credit</b> scoring {{is a way of}} separating specific subgroups in a population of objects (such as applications for credit), which have significantly different credit risk characteristics. A new feature of our approach is incorporating expert judgments in the model.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the nature of {{long-term}} liquidity contracts that arise between lenders and borrowers in the absence of perfect enforceability and when both parties are financially constrained. We study an infinite horizon dynamic contracting model between a borrower and a lender with the following features: The borrower, is credit-constrained, faces a stochastic project arrival process every period, can choose to renege each period, and can save through the lender. Projects are indivisible. The lender is resource- constrained, and can commit to the terms of the contract as long as it is ex-ante individually rational to do so. We show that: (i) Enforcement problems and endogenous resource constraints can severely curtail the possibility of financing projects, (ii) the economy exhibits investment cycles, (iii) credit is rationed if either the lender has too little capital or the borrower has too little financial collateral. This paper’s technical contribution is to show the existence and characterization of financial contracts that are solutions to a non- convex dynamic programming <b>problem.</b> <b>Credit</b> Rationing, Investment Cycles, Limited Enforceability, Liquidity Provision, Resource Constraints...|$|E
40|$|A {{historical}} {{example is}} considered which conflicts with Laudan's Problem Solving Model [1981]. In the period 1840 - 85 chemists preferred a theory with 3 major conceptual problems (the Liebig Theory of Acids) to Lavoisier's which {{had only one}} major conceptual problem (why are the halogen hydrides acids?). The overall conceptual merits of Lavoisier's scheme have been revived in the modern Lux-Flood classification of Acids. Larry Laudan [1977], [1981] proposed a problem solving model of scientific rationality which not only applied to global theories but, if one takes the final paragraph of his [1977] seriously, also applies to sub theories, auxiliary hypotheses and sub auxiliary hypotheses {{all the way down}} the line. According to Laudan [1981] science progresses just in case successor theories solve more problems than their predecessors. Laudan claims that theory evaluation must be a comparative affair since he feels that Popper's criteria of verisimilitude and cumulative retention are inadequate. He advocates a 'cost benefit analysis ' approach in which credit is assigned to a theory for the number of problems it has successfully solved, modified by a weighting factor for the relative importance of each <b>problem.</b> <b>Credit</b> = I w, p wn pn where w = weighting of problem importance p = problem Laudan also allows for a kind of 'infant industry ' philosophy in which he allows that it is rational to develop a promising new theory which solves a major conceptual problem not solved by its predecessor although the overall problem solving ability of the new theory is much less. However, he makes it clear that such a theory is definitely 'on probation ' and there is no question that the predecessor theory is to be abandoned because of one and only one flaw...|$|E

40|$|The high {{debt burden}} {{continues}} to hamper the growth prospects of {{many developing countries}} and is increasing their vulnerability. Bilateral official aid has declined sharply and financing by multilateral organizations is low. Developing countries have experienced net negative resource transfers, reducing their ability to invest. Finally, growth in these countries has lagged worldwide growth, particularly in Latin America and Africa. Poorer countries depend heavily on support of official institutions. Aid to poorer countries has diminished {{and in many cases}} their debt burden appears to be unsustainable. Countries with access to market borrowing on the other hand, have been affected by high volatility in international capital markets, while having fewer policy options than in the past to absorb shocks. Debt sustainability assessments normally focus on the behaviour of the external debt to GDP ratio, which depends on the behavior of debt, interest rates, the behaviour of GDP, and the movements in the real exchange rate. In crisis situations, countries can have recourse to debt restructuring or reduction, but such action cannot be a regular means of dealing with external financing problems, as it affects access to new financing. The process is defective and new solutions are required. There is good evidence on indicators and predictors of external debt crises. There are key macroeconomic indicators which, in general have a good capacity to predict debt problems, but they work with variable lags, and are not reliable in all cases. Thus, a good tracking system needs to be based on several of these indicators. The impact of sovereign credit ratings on access of developing countries to capital markets and on the terms of borrowing is significant. Worsening ratings can have adverse consequences on debt sustainability. To avoid this <b>problem,</b> <b>credit</b> agencies should expand their use of indicators, and take a broader view of developments than at present, including with regard to programmes that countries are undertaking {{with the support of the}} international financial institutions. ...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{three aspects}} {{important}} of performance for Zambia commercial banks. Specifically, the thesis addresses {{the aspect of}} cost efficiency and the factors that affect inefficiency performance. The study also empirically answers the policy question regarding the banks' exercise of market power and the low degree of competition. Using a richly assembled panel data set obtained from the Bank of Zambia on individual banks from 1998 to 2006, the thesis utilises theoretically sound methodologies in addressing these research questions. The results from the analysis reveal the following. Firstly, using stochastic frontier estimation approach, cost inefficiency {{was estimated to be}} 8 percent. This means that mismanagement of resources was an impediment to the efficiency performance. Nonetheless, we observed a reduction in cost inefficiency over time, with domestic private banks displaying remarkable improvement. A combination of bank-specific and exogenous factors deterred banks from attaining optimal cost efficiency. Notably, impaired loans, asset concentration and macroeconomic instability undermined the banks' ability to operate optimally. Regulatory factors did not exacerbate cost inefficiency. Secondly, Zambian banks operated in an oligopolistic set-up. Based on a methodology anchored in the New Empirical Industrial Organisation literature, the results of a competitive test showed that banks earned their revenue under conditions of monopolistic competition. This finding was buttressed by the estimated time varying Lerner Index, a measure of market power. The index showed that commercial banks set their prices above marginal cost by more than 50 percent. However, the degree of market power narrowed {{towards the end of the}} sample period. Market concentration, efficiency performance, diversity in revenue sources and regulatory intensity accounted for much of the banks' exercise of market power. On the other hand, the high proportion of interbank deposits, credit risk exposure and inflation dampened the banks' exercise of market power. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in Zambia. Therefore, the results of the thesis have important policy implications. More significantly, since there is room for deepening the degree of competition and furthering efficiency gains, regulatory authorities should strengthen measures aimed at ameliorating risk problems in the banking industry in a bid to lower the banks' exercise of market power. The authorities should also accelerate should also accelerate efforts of reducing recourse to Treasury bills as a deficit financing tool in order to negate the banks' appetite for securities as a source of revenue. This can be done by placing more emphasis on the legal and institutional framework for resolving <b>problem</b> <b>credit</b> situations. This will intensify competition and propagate efficiency gains in the banking market. The authorities should also expeditiously tackle instability in the macroeconomic environment, particularly the high rate of inflation which hampered the banks' revenue performance and exacerbated the exercise of market powe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} <b>problems</b> in <b>credit</b> risk {{management}} is the correlated default. In large portfolios, computing the default depen-dencies among issuers {{is an essential part}} in quantifying the portfolio’s credit.

This paper aims at introducing a new methodology for credit risk management based on Bayesian copulas. In this paper, the focus is specifically on a new method of simulating the joint distribution of default risk. This methodology joins the use of cop-ulas and Bayesian models. Using copulas, the joint multivariate prob-ability distribution of a random vector can be separated into individ-ual components characterized by marginal distributions. The model is based on a jump diffusion process for the intensities. Another important <b>problem</b> in <b>credit</b> risk management is the lack of data, which influences the parameter estimation.

Different from the literature, {{a new kind}} of agency problem, structural agency <b>problem</b> under <b>credit</b> risk, is investigated, and a compound option pricing method is applied to quantify the agency cost in this study. Under the specific setting of this model, the shareholders will take advantage of the debt holders by taking more risky projects under a situation where the firm cannot issue new equity or debt and yet is capable of making debt payments. Even under no asymmetric information between shareholders and debt holders, the agency problem exists since it results from a structural difference under credit risk. In this case, applying Geske’s compound option pricing model (1977 & 1979) 1 is able to quantify the magnitude of structural agency cost under credit risk in a multi-period setting. Several possible solutions are also proposed to alleviate this agency problem. Finally, a case study of Lucent Technologies Inc. is provided to demonstrate the existence of the structural agency <b>problem</b> under <b>credit</b> risk...|$|R
