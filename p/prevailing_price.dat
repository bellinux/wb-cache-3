25|$|The ETF {{tracking}} error {{is the difference}} between the returns of the ETF and its reference index or asset. A non-zero {{tracking error}} therefore represents a failure to replicate the reference as stated in the ETF prospectus. The tracking error is computed based on the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price</b> of the ETF and its reference. It is different than the premium/discount which {{is the difference between}} the ETF’s NAV (updated only once a day) and its market price. Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the underlying index. Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid, allowing for full replication. In contrast, some ETFs, such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs, do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure, or the reference asset or index is illiquid. Futures-based ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields, as seen in the VIX futures market.|$|E
6000|$|The typewriting {{business}} was less varied and more definite. Those {{were the days}} before the violent competition of the half-educated had brought things down to an impossible tenpence the thousand words, and the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price</b> was as high as one-and-six. Calculating that Ethel could do a thousand words in an hour and that she could work five or six hours in the day, it was evident that her contributions to the household expenses would be by no means despicable; thirty shillings a week perhaps. Lewisham was naturally elated at this discovery. He could find no advertisements of authors or others seeking typewriting, but he saw that a great number of typewriters advertised themselves in the literary papers. It was evident Ethel also must advertise. [...] "'Scientific phraseology a speciality' might be put," [...] meditated Lewisham. He returned to his lodgings in a hopeful mood with quite a bundle of memoranda of possible employments. He spent five shillings in stamps on the way.|$|E

5000|$|In {{econometrics}} it {{is often}} desirable to have {{a model of the}} cost of production of a given output with given inputs - or in common terms, what it will cost to produce some number of goods at <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices,</b> or given <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> and a budget, how much can be made. Generally there are two parts to a cost function, the fixed costs and the variable costs involved in production.|$|R

40|$|Among {{the ways}} {{a product or}} labor market might operate is the following: All firms quote the same price or wage. Customers or job-seekers search among sellers until they find one willing to sell them or employ them. They {{do not need to}} {{consider}} the possibility that another seller or employer might offer a better deal, since all offers are identical, under <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> or wages, the small participants in the market [...] customers and workers [...] have very limited responsibilities for processing information. By contrast, where markets are equilibrated by conscious search for the best price or wage, the small participants face complex problems of gathering and interpreting information. Adherence to <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> and wages may explain part of the macroeconomic puzzle of price and wage stickiness and the sensitivity of real variables to nominal disturbances. ...|$|R

50|$|Other {{unintended}} consequences of an FTT could include {{a reduction in}} professional market participants such as market makers who stand ready {{to buy or sell}} at <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices.</b> This could impact the orderly and efficient operation of markets, including the price discovery process.

25|$|Ethanol is {{produced}} {{both as a}} petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene and, via biological processes, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Which process is more economical depends on <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> of petroleum and grain feed stocks.

50|$|Adding oil {{recovery}} methods {{adds to the}} cost of oil —in the case of CO2 typically between 0.5-8.0 US$ per tonne of CO2. The increased extraction of oil on the other hand, is an economic benefit with the revenue depending on <b>prevailing</b> oil <b>prices.</b> Onshore EOR has paid in the range of a net 10-16 US$ per tonne of CO2 injected for oil prices of 15-20 US$/barrel. <b>Prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> depend on many factors but can determine the economic suitability of any procedure, with more procedures and more expensive procedures being economically viable at higher prices. Example: With oil prices at around 90 US$/barrel, the economic benefit is about 70 US$ per tonne CO2. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that 20 billion tons of captured CO2 could produce 67 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil.|$|R

Although Sherman's army had left no work stock, Major Coker had cotton seed and seed corn, which he planted {{with the use of}} an old mule and a pair of oxen borrowed from an uncle. He planted 60 acre of cotton and 40 acre of corn, which yielded 25 bales of cotton and 300 bushels of corn. At the <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices,</b> 25 bales of cotton brought $1,700, a small fortune in that time.|$|R

5000|$|For example, assume an {{industry}} {{with a certain}} capacity that produces a certain commodity. Given this capacity, the supply offered by the industry {{will depend on the}} <b>prevailing</b> <b>price.</b> The corresponding supply schedule gives short-run supply. The demand depends on the market price. The price in the market declines if supply exceeds demand, and it increases, if supply is less than demand. The price mechanism leads to market clearing in the short run.|$|E
5000|$|In {{economic}}s, {{an excess}} supply or economic surplus {{is a situation}} in which the quantity of a good or service supplied is more than the quantity demanded, and the price is above the equilibrium level determined by supply and demand. That is, the quantity of the product that producers wish to sell exceeds the quantity that potential buyers are willing to buy at the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price.</b> It is the opposite of an economic shortage (excess demand).|$|E
40|$|Empirical studies provide {{compelling}} evidence that economic agents do not adopt the complete range of energy-efficient {{technologies that are}} cost-effective under <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> and market conditions.

This paper recasts the controversy from the perspective of economic theory and finds that market failures related to asymmetric information, bounded rationality, and transaction costs are major contributors to the so-called "efficiency gap.

50|$|The above factors {{contributed to}} a {{speculative}} boom throughout the Territory, but particularly in Madison County, Alabama, where the prices increased from around $2 per acre in 1817 to $7.40 per acre by 1818, with reports of much higher prices ($78 per acre in one case) in certain locales. Cotton at this time cost around $0.15 per pound to produce, and when combined with <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> at $0.30 per pound, implied annual profits of around $120 per acre. Such profits would justify even the highest per acre prices reported around Huntsville.|$|R
50|$|On October 28, 1864, Stephen G. Burbridge, the {{military}} commander of Kentucky, issued a proclamation {{that was designed}} to get Kentuckians to sell their surplus hogs to the Union government at lower than <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices.</b> Interstate hog shipments were prohibited, permits were required for farmers to drive hogs to market, and other regulations were enforced. The scheme cost Kentucky farmers an estimated $300,000. President Abraham Lincoln ordered the program halted after one month, because it was widely reviled in a state that was at best a hesitant ally of the Union.|$|R
5000|$|Technical analysts view {{increasing}} {{open interest}} {{as an indication}} that new money is flowing into the marketplace. From this assumption, one could conclude that the present trend will continue. Analogously, declining open interest implies {{that the market is}} liquidating, and suggests that the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price</b> trend is coming to an end.

50|$|The {{overall system}} {{involves}} two state variables: price and capacity. Using the temporary equilibrium method, {{it can be}} reduced to a system involving only state variable. This is possible because each short-run equilibrium price will be a function of the prevailing capacity, and the change of capacity will be determined by the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price.</b> Hence the change of capacity will be determined by the prevailing capacity. The method works if the price adjusts fast and capacity adjustment is comparatively slow. The mathematical background is provided by the Moving equilibrium theorem.|$|E
50|$|A {{firm with}} market power {{has the ability}} to {{individually}} affect either the total quantity or the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price</b> in the market. Price makers face a downward-sloping demand curve, such that price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded. The decrease in supply {{as a result of the}} exercise of market power creates an economic deadweight loss which is often viewed as socially undesirable. As a result, many countries have anti-trust or other legislation intended to limit the ability of firms to accrue market power. Such legislation often regulates mergers and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel divestiture.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{contrast}} {{the proposition that}} markets reveal independently existing preferences with the alternative possibility that they may help to shape them. Using demand-revealing experimental market institutions, we separate the shaping effects of price cues {{from the effects of}} market discipline. We find that individual valuations and <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> are systematically affected by both exogenous manipulations of price expectations and endogenous but divergent price feedback. These effects persist to varying degrees, in spite of further market experience. In some circumstances, market experience may actually consolidate them. We discuss possible explanations for these effects of uninformative price cues on revealed preferences...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} price discrimination and collusion in spatial markets. The problem is analyzed {{in the context}} of a repeated duopoly game. I conclude that the <b>prevailing</b> <b>pricing</b> systems depend on the structural elements of the market. Delivered pricing systems emerge in equilibrium in highly monopolistic and highly competitive industries, while FOB is used in intermediate market structures. The fact driving this result is that delivered pricing policies allow spatial price discrimination that facilitates collusion, but at the same time they have a very competitive feature: they are the only pricing rules that could be sustained in a very competitive market structure. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1848 news that gold had been {{discovered}} in California {{made its way to}} the Willamette Valley and an exodus of fortune-seekers from Oregon ensued. Whitcomb decided that a surer path to fortune lay with the manufacture and supply of lumber to the boomtowns of Northern California, however, and he built a schooner, the Milwaukie, and bought a brig, the Forest, to carry lumber and other goods to markets in California. Whitcomb's mill turned out 6,000 board feet of rough 3-inch planks every day in two 12-hour shifts — material which brought $300 per thousand board feet in San Francisco, triple the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price</b> in Oregon.|$|E
50|$|In a {{competitive}} equilibrium, supply equals demand. Property P1 is satisfied, {{because at the}} equilibrium price the amount supplied {{is equal to the}} amount demanded. Property P2 is also satisfied. Demand is chosen to maximize utility given the market price: no one on the demand side has any incentive to demand more or less at the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price.</b> Likewise supply is determined by firms maximizing their profits at the market price: no firm will want to supply any more or less at the equilibrium price. Hence, agents on neither the demand side nor the supply side will have any incentive to alter their actions.|$|E
5000|$|In common use, {{the term}} [...] "shortage" [...] may {{refer to a}} {{situation}} where most people are {{unable to find a}} desired good at an affordable price, especially where supply problems have increased the price.

Although fertilizer is, on average, profitable in our sample, on roughly one-third of the plots degraded soils limit the marginal productivity of fertilizer such that it becomes unprofitable at <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices.</b> Moreover, because poorer farmers most commonly cultivate soils deficient in SOM, fertilizer interventions might be less pro-poor than is widely assumed and may instead reinforce ex ante income inequality.
