5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics is not necessary. Education {{is an important}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> treatment plan, and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, {{it is important to}} correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.|$|E

5|$|Some species, {{including}} frigatebirds, gulls, and skuas, {{engage in}} kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism {{is thought to}} be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%. Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.|$|E
5|$|The two {{companies}} attempted {{to reach a}} new agreement for ten months before it fell through in January 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to finance their films {{on their own and}} collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the distribution fee. More importantly, as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles (2004) and Cars (2006). Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.|$|E

5|$|York is the {{traditional}} county town of Yorkshire, and therefore did not form <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> of its three historic ridings, or divisions. Its Mayor has had the status of Lord Mayor since 1370. York is an ancient borough, and was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 to form a municipal borough. It gained {{the status of a}} county borough in 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888, and existed so until 1974, when, under the Local Government Act 1972, it became a non-metropolitan district in the county of North Yorkshire, whilst retaining its Lord Mayor, its Sheriff and Aldermen.|$|E
5|$|As US31 curves {{around to}} the {{northeast}} and east in Charlevoix County, it follows {{a section of the}} Lake Michigan shoreline that is not considered to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> bay. The highway continues through Northern Michigan agricultural areas to the southeast of Charlevoix. Once it enters the city, the trunkline intersects the northern end of M-66 and follows a series of city streets to a drawbridge over the channel that connects Lake Charlevoix to Lake Michigan. South of the structure it is Bridge Street, and north of the bridge it is Michigan Avenue. The highway turns eastward to exit town on Petoskey Avenue and follow the Lake Michigan shoreline. Near the community of Bay Shore, US31 crosses into Emmet County. The trunkline continues past the Bay Harbor development on Charlevoix Avenue into the city of Petoskey.|$|E
5|$|Kim Deal's {{band the}} Breeders {{released}} Last Splash in August 1993; {{the album was}} very successful, and its release was followed by much touring. The Breeders then took an extended break from activity. One reason was that Deal's sister Kelley, who {{was also in the}} group, was arrested on drug charges in November 1994. Member Josephine Wiggs likewise took time away from the band, although Wiggs and Deal have different memories of the circumstances surrounding this. Wiggs recalls offering to be involved if Deal's next album {{was going to be a}} Breeders record, but having the impression that Deal wanted to do a solo release; Deal remembers Wiggs declining to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> immediate Breeders' recording, but offering to be on the one after that.|$|E

5|$|Singaporeans are {{encouraged}} to display the national flag outside their homes during National Day celebrations, and residents' committees, particularly those of public housing estates, often arrange co-ordinated displays. However, some Singaporeans decline to do so as they associate it with the People's Action Party, the ruling party in Parliament, rather than with the nation. During the period beginning 1 July and ending on 30 September of each year, any person may, {{without the need for}} the approval of the Minister under paragraph (4), incorporate the Flag or an image thereof as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> costume or attire except that he shall do so in a manner that does not give rise to any disrespect to the Flag.|$|E
5|$|Until 2004, {{the flag}} was used {{exclusively}} on or {{in front of}} buildings owned by the government, ministries, statutory boards and educational institutions on a year-round basis.

During the National Day celebrations period (1 July – 30 September), rules governing the flying of the national flag outside buildings are relaxed. The flag may be displayed on any vehicle (other than a hearse), vessel or aircraft, and may be incorporated as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> costume or attire, so long as this is done in a respectful manner.|$|E
5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. Some argue that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert had become so well known {{that he was an}} issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> negotiated solution, and the presence of Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Wallace {{published}} the book Island Life as {{a sequel to}} The Geographical Distribution of Animals. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently {{been part of a}} continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like Madagascar) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased glaciation, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages. Island Life was considered a very important work {{at the time of its}} publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In {{geological}} terms at 7million {{years old}} Lord Howe Island is relatively young {{and was never}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> continent, its flora and fauna colonising the island from across the sea, carried by wind, water or birds, possibly assisted at a geological time when other islands were exposed, enabling island hopping. Nevertheless, it is far enough away and has had sufficient time to evolve endemic species. The high degree of endemism is emphasised {{by the presence of}} five endemic genera: Negria, Lordhowea, Howea, Lepidorrhachis, and Hedyscepe. Island plants {{are similar to those of}} Norfolk Island, the two islands sharing some endemic species, for example, the critically endangered species of creeping vine Calystegia affinis. The combined flora of these two islands is more closely related to that of New Zealand and New Caledonia than to that of Australia. There is also a small but clear link with the plants of Vanuatu. The closest mainland affinities are with the vegetation of subtropical southeastern Queensland. A link with Gondwanaland is indicated by the presence of endemic species like the wedding lily (Dietes robinsoniana) whose only living relatives occur in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2017, the White Sox traded Clippard to the Houston Astros in {{exchange}} for a player to be named later or cash considerations. Clippard broke the news himself by changing his biographical information on Twitter and Instagram. With the Astros to finish 2017, Clippard made 16 more appearances out of the bullpen, having a 0-2 record and a 6.43 ERA. Overall in 2017, combined with all three teams he had played for, Clippard's total stats came to 67 appearances out of the bullpen, a 2-8 record, and a 4.77 ERA. The Astros finished the 2017 season with a 101-61 record, clinching the AL West. Clippard, however, was not <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> postseason action, although he was still on the Astros 40-man roster at the time. The Astros won their first World Series in franchise history as they bested the Los Angeles Dodgers in 7 games of the 2017 World Series. Clippard would still win his first career World Series championship after 11 seasons of service in the Majors.|$|E
