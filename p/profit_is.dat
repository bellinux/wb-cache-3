5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E
5|$|Gambling {{and related}} paraphernalia, broadly defined by ABC to include claw and crane machines, casino-themed video games, {{football}} pools, and door prizes, irrespective of whether any <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> {{being made by}} the business, are prohibited at licensed establishments. The only exceptions are for those bars licensed {{by the state to}} sell lottery tickets or have off-track betting on horse racing. Charity bingo games or raffles are also allowed. Card games, darts, billiards and other games are permitted as long as no money is exchanged, and no prizes are given.|$|E
5|$|Of the film's net profit, {{estimated}} to amount to $30–40million (£20–25million) from the cinema release alone, roughly 20% will be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who receive their bonuses {{before the other}} stakeholders. The remaining <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> to be split equally between the producers and the equity investors. The UK Film Council invested £1million of public funds from the United Kingdom lottery into the film. In March 2011 Variety estimated that the return could be between fifteen and twenty times that. The Council's merger into the British Film Institute means that the profits are {{to be returned to}} that body.|$|E

25|$|Advocates {{of unions}} {{claim that the}} higher wages that unions demand can be paid for through company profits. However, as Milton Friedman pointed out, <b>profits</b> <b>are</b> only very rarely high enough. 80% of {{national}} income is wages, and only about 6% <b>is</b> <b>profits</b> after tax, providing very little room for higher wages, even if <b>profits</b> could <b>be</b> totally used up. Moreover, <b>profits</b> <b>are</b> invested leading {{to an increase in}} capital: which raises the value of labor, increasing wages. If <b>profits</b> <b>were</b> totally removed, this source of wage increase would be removed.|$|R
5|$|Throughout their career, the Grateful Dead {{were known}} to {{tolerate}} taping of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, {{and the concept of}} taping shows appealed to the band's general community ethos. They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to be pressed and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between tapers. The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product. In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality. Other bands, including Pearl Jam, Phish and the Dave Matthews Band tolerate taping in a similar manner to the Dead, provided no <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> involved. Because of the questionable legality of bootlegs, fans have sometimes simply dubbed a bootleg onto tape and freely passed it onto others.|$|E
5|$|An early {{algorithmic}} use of pseudoforests {{involves the}} network simplex algorithm and {{its application to}} generalized flow problems modeling the conversion between commodities of different types. In these problems, one is given as input a flow network in which the vertices model each commodity and the edges model allowable conversions between one commodity and another. Each edge is marked with a capacity (how much of a commodity can be converted per unit time), a flow multiplier (the conversion rate between commodities), and a cost (how much loss or, if negative, <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> incurred per unit of conversion). The task is {{to determine how much}} of each commodity to convert via each edge of the flow network, in order to minimize cost or maximize profit, while obeying the capacity constraints and not allowing commodities of any type to accumulate unused. This type of problem can be formulated as a linear program, and solved using the simplex algorithm. The intermediate solutions arising from this algorithm, as well as the eventual optimal solution, have a special structure: each edge in the input network is either unused or used to its full capacity, except for a subset of the edges, forming a spanning pseudoforest of the input network, for which the flow amounts may lie between zero and the full capacity. In this application, unicyclic graphs are also sometimes called augmented trees and maximal pseudoforests are also sometimes called augmented forests.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. also {{imposes a}} branch profits tax on foreign {{corporations}} with a U.S. branch, {{to mimic the}} dividend withholding tax which would be payable if the business was conducted in a U.S. subsidiary corporation and <b>profits</b> <b>were</b> remitted to the foreign parent as dividends.

25|$|Short period. Industrial {{capacity}} {{is taken as}} given. The level of output, the level of employment, the inputs of raw materials, and prices fluctuate to equate marginal cost and marginal revenue, where profits are maximized.

25|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the risk of}} default, the product is marked to market {{on a daily basis}} where the difference between the initial agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is reevaluated daily. This is sometimes known as the variation margin, where the Futures Exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into that of the other party, ensuring the correct loss or <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> reflected daily.|$|E
25|$|Pyramid schemes—also {{referred}} to as franchise fraud or chain referral schemes—are marketing and investment frauds in which an individual is offered a distributorship or franchise to market a particular product. The real <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> earned, not by {{the sale of the}} product, but by the sale of new distributorships. Emphasis on selling franchises rather than the product eventually leads to a point where the supply of potential investors is exhausted and the pyramid collapses.|$|E

25|$|Even Michael Steinhardt, {{who made}} his fortune trading in time horizons ranging from 30 minutes to 30 days, claimed to take a {{long-term}} perspective on his investment decisions. From an economic perspective, many professional money managers and financial advisors shy away from day trading, arguing that the reward simply does not justify the risk. Attempting to make a <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> the reason investors invest, and buy low and sell high is the general goal of most investors (although short-selling and arbitrage take a different approach, {{the success or failure}} of these strategies still depends on timing).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} econometric work, Measuring the Wealth of Nations, {{was published}} by Anwar Shaikh and Ertuğrul Ahmet Tonak in 1994. This work sought to reaggregate the components of official gross output measures rigorously, to approximate Marxian categories, using some new techniques, including input-output measures of direct and indirect labor, and capacity utilization adjustments. Shaikh and Tonak argued that the falling rate of <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> not a short-term trend of the business cycle, but a long-term historical trend. According to their calculations, the Marxian rate of profit on production capital fell {{throughout most of the}} long boom of 1947–1973, despite an enormous expansion of the volume (mass) of profit.|$|E
25|$|Usually by {{a system}} of prices. But prices depend on profit rate. In the Heckscher–Ohlin model, the rate of <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> {{determined}} according to how abundant capital is. If capital is scarce, it has {{a high rate of}} profit. If it is abundant, the profit rate is low. Here is a logical circle. Before the profit rate is determined, the amount of capital is not measured. This logical difficulty was the subject of academic controversy many years ago—sometimes called the Cambridge Capital Controversies. The conclusion of the controversies was that the concept of homogeneous capital was untenable. Heckscher–Ohlin theorists ignore all these stories without providing any explanation how capital is measured theoretically.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{an obvious}} riposte {{is that we}} can {{aggregate}} capital simply by using the first set of prices and ignoring the second, as with many inflation corrections. This does not work, however, because the variation of the rate of <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> theorized as happening at a specific point in time in purely mathematical terms rather than as part of an historical process. The point is that if neoclassical conceptions do not work at a specific time (statics), they cannot handle the more complicated issues of dynamics. This critique of the neoclassical conception is more of a matter of pointing out its major technical flaws in the theory than of presenting an alternative.|$|E
25|$|Membership {{is crucial}} to co-operatives and more than 8 million people are members of co-operatives in the UK which use 'The Co-operative Brand'. Members of co-operatives get to be democratically {{involved}} in {{the running of the}} society, often with votes on key business decisions and for the election of board members. It is also common for members to be provided with a share of the society's annual profits which is proportional to {{the amount of money that}} an individual has spent with the society over the year. This share of the <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> commonly referred to as co-op's dividend. The size of the dividend varies depending on the financial performance of the group.|$|E

Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that the salty spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel {{up and down in the}} wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes go in and out of the brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the leather valve.
