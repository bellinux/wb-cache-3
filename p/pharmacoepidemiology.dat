50|$|The International Society for <b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> (ISPE) was {{launched}} officially by Stanley A. Edlavitch, David E. Lilienfeld, and Hugh A. Tilson in 1989 during the Fifth International Conference on <b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> (ICPE) in Minneapolis. (The initial conference, in 1985, was the International Conference on Linked Databases.) ISPE {{is the only}} international acting society dealing with the topics of <b>pharmacoepidemiology</b> {{in the context of}} pharmacovigilance or drug safety; the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) addresses outcomes research epidemiology. The society has organized yearly conferences since its foundation. The society's office is located in Bethesda, Maryland, and its executive director is Mark Epstein. A number of the major figures in drug safety and pharmacovigilance have served as its Presidents, and its Officers and Trustees have been drawn from the leadership of the <b>pharmacoepidemiology</b> community. Members of the Society come from 53 nations and mostly come from academia, pharmaceutical industry, Contract Research Organizations and governmental institutions (e.g., U.S. Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, EMEA, BfArM, Robert Koch Institute (RKI)) acting als drug regulators. The official journal of the society is <b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> and Drug Safety which is indexed in MEDLINE and the regularly edited newsletter Scribe is available on the above-mentioned website of ISPE. (The original Society newsletter was the <b>PharmacoEpidemiology</b> Newsletter (PEN), created by Stanley A. Edlavitch (edited by Edlavitch and David E. Lilienfeld) in 1985. In 1992, the Society returned the PEN to Edlavitch.) The current president of the society is John D. Seeger, from the Division of <b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> and Pharmacoeconomics at Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital Boston, MA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> is {{the study}} of the effects of drugs in large numbers of people.|$|E
5000|$|To {{accomplish}} this study, <b>pharmacoepidemiology</b> borrows from both pharmacology and epidemiology. Thus, <b>pharmacoepidemiology</b> is the bridge between both pharmacology and epidemiology. Pharmacology {{is the study}} of the effect of drugs and clinical pharmacology {{is the study of}} effect of drugs on clinical humans. Part of the task of clinical pharmacology is to provide a risk benefit assessment by effects of drugs in patients: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> is {{the study}} of the uses and effects of drugs in well defined populations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> {{benefits}} from the methodology developed in general epidemiology and may further develop them for applications of methodology unique to needs of <b>pharmacoepidemiology.</b> There are also some areas that are altogether unique to <b>pharmacoepidemiology,</b> e.g., pharmacovigilance. Pharmacovigilance {{is a type of}} continual monitoring of unwanted effects and other safety-related aspects of drugs that are already placed in current growing integrating markets. In practice, pharmacovigilance refers almost exclusively to spontaneous reporting systems which allow health care professionals and others to report adverse drug reactions to the central agency. The central agency combines reports from many sources to produce a more informative profile for drug products than could be done based on reports from fewer health care professionals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> is {{the study}} of the {{incidence}} of adverse drug reactions in patient populations using drug agents.|$|E
5000|$|Ethnopharmacy {{shares a}} common terrain with medical {{anthropology}} and anthropology of pharmaceuticals. Ethnopharmacology also relates to <b>pharmacoepidemiology,</b> {{the study of}} how drugs are used by and affect large numbers of people.|$|E
50|$|The Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes and Policy {{offers two}} online degrees. The {{certificate}} of <b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> taught {{in coordination with}} the UIC School of Public Health, and the Master's Degree in Comparative Effectiveness Research.|$|E
5000|$|Systems {{pharmacology}} can {{be applied}} to drug safety studies as a complement to <b>pharmacoepidemiology.</b> The EU-ADR project for detection of adverse drug reactions (ADR) [...] has successfully incorporated systems pharmacology into their signal substantiation pipeline.|$|E
50|$|Other {{parameters}} {{relating to}} drug use may benefit epidemiological methodology. <b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> then can also {{be defined as the}} transparent application of epidemiological methods through pharmacological treatment of conditions to better understand the conditions to be treated.|$|E

50|$|The ISPE is {{directed}} by a structured Board of Trustees, ensuring that each of its various constituencies has some voice within the organization. The major areas within which <b>pharmacoepidemiology</b> is practiced (industry, government, academia) provides the framework for the three forums within which ISPE members may raise items for discussion by the ISPE Board.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve this}} expertise, {{clinical}} pharmaceutical scientists typically pursue education after their professional pharmacy degrees (in the United States, a PharmD is generally a prerequisite). This can involve a 2-3 year postdoctoral fellowship or pursuing graduate degrees (e.g. MS, PhD). Postdoctoral programs tend to emphasize a specific area of pharmaceutical science for the scientist to specialize in, such as <b>pharmacoepidemiology</b> or pharmacogenetics.|$|E

5000|$|Inman {{contributed to}} an {{initiative}} on risk management and communication by Wolfson College, Oxford in 1984. At this symposium he outlined the problems of communicating risk perception, and demonstrated the huge differences in the views of medical staff of risk within their own fields. He illustrated the comparative annual risk of doing something (smoking) or being somebody (a president of the United States, or a matador). By contrast, he cited examples of drug withdrawals after a single drug-related death of one in two million. In 1984 he {{was appointed to the}} first Chair in <b>Pharmacoepidemiology</b> in the United Kingdom, at the University of Southampton. Inman held strong views about the complete separation of safety monitoring between government and industry, and felt that medical evaluation should be separate from the national licensing authority. He was warned that his clashes with authority would prevent him receiving a knighthood. Lord Butterfield described Inman as [...] "well known world-wide for his foresight and his persistence, which has resulted in his bringing the clinical skills of close observation and detective-like following up of clues to the problems of drug development". Michael O'Donnell [...] wrote, after reading Inman's autobiography, Feeling Better Doctor?: [...] "I suspect you will agree that the author has earned the accolade of one of those beastly people who are always bringing up awkward subjects and making respectable people feel uncomfortable." [...] To the end Inman expressed disappointment that no system, such as a database of pregnant women's drug histories, had been put in place to prevent another thalidomide tragedy.|$|E
