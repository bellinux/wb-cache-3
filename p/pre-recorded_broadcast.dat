500|$|The {{performance}} of the Finnish entry, [...] "Marry Me", caused controversy in certain more socially conservative countries broadcasting the contest. The act featured the female singer Krista Siegfrids {{and one of her}} female backing singers kissing each other at the end, widely labelled in media as Eurovision's first [...] "lesbian kiss". Siegfrids stated to the media that the act was done to encourage Finland to legalise same sex marriage. It was reported that Turkish and Greek media reacted negatively to Siegfrids' act. According to Gay Star News, the Turkish Eurovision broadcaster TRT, who had earlier withdrawn from competing in the contest for 2013, initially indicated that they would still broadcast the contest, but made a late decision not to do so. A number of media reports directly linked this decision to the kiss in the Finnish performance, although TRT stated the reason was low viewing figures for the contest. In China, it was completely removed from the <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>broadcast</b> due to the branch of television censorship in Mainland China.|$|E
