5|$|While {{waiting to}} be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> he {{composed}} a poem entitled The Lonely Isle, which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.|$|E
5|$|As a {{hurricane}} approaches Quahog, Rhode Island, the Griffin family prepares for its arrival. In his own attempt to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> Brian decides to use magic mushrooms, to the curiosity of Stewie. As the mushrooms start {{to take effect}} on Brian, he begins having hallucinations and eventually cuts his own ear off. Stewie tries to help Brian by staying by his side {{and taking care of}} him, but Brian continues to perceive himself in an ugly world where he is continually attacked by various monsters resembling the Griffins and Quagmire. Brian eventually snaps out of the hallucination after Stewie helps him downstairs to drink some water.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Reed (Dominic Keating) and Ensign Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery) {{play chess}} {{while serving as}} hosts to non-corporeal aliens. Returning from an away mission on the planet below, Commander Tucker (Connor Trinneer) and Ensign Sato (Linda Park) soon exhibit {{symptoms}} of a strange disease. Upon examination by Doctor Phlox (John Billingsley), it {{is found to be}} a highly contagious silicon-based virus, and Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) explains that Commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) and Phlox are seeking a cure. To <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> while isolated in Decontamination, the two try to learn more about each other.|$|E

5|$|Trautmann {{joined the}} Luftwaffe as a radio {{operator}} in 1941. During training, he showed little aptitude for radio work, {{and transferred to}} Spandau to become a Fallschirmjäger (paratrooper). He served first in Occupied Poland, though being stationed far behind the front line resulted in boredom for his regiment, which resorted to sports and practical jokes to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> One such practical joke involving a car backfired on Trautmann, resulting in a staff sergeant burning his arms. Trautmann was court-martialled, and received a three-month prison sentence. At {{the start of his}} confinement, Trautmann came down with acute appendicitis, and spent the remainder of his sentence in a military hospital.|$|E
5|$|When {{the ship}} became trapped in pack ice his duties {{expanded}} to constructing makeshift housing, and, once {{it became clear}} that the ship was doomed, to altering the sledges for the journey over the ice to open water. He built the quarters where the crew took their meals (nicknamed The Ritz) and cubicles where the men could sleep. These were all christened as well; McNish shared The Sailors' Rest with Alfred Cheetham, the Third Officer. Assisted by the crew, he constructed kennels for the dogs on the upper deck. Once Endurance became trapped, and the crew were spending the days on the ice, McNish erected goalposts and football became a daily fixture for the men. To <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in the evening, McNish joined Frank Wild, Tom Crean, James McIlroy, Worsley and Shackleton playing poker in the wardroom.|$|E
5|$|Wodehouse's {{family and}} friends had not had any news of his {{location}} {{after the fall of}} France, but an article from an Associated Press reporter who had visited Tost in December 1940 led to pressure on the German authorities to release the novelist. This included a petition from influential people in the US; Senator W.Warren Barbour presented it to the German ambassador. Although his captors refused to release him, Wodehouse was provided with a typewriter and, to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> he wrote Money in the Bank. Throughout his time in Tost, he sent postcards to his US literary agent asking for $5 to be sent to various people in Canada, mentioning his name. These were the families of Canadian prisoners of war, and the news from Wodehouse was the first indication that their sons were alive and well. Wodehouse risked severe punishment for the communication, but managed to evade the German censor.|$|E

5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E
25|$|In the 1957 {{film version}} of Twelve Angry Men {{there is a small}} scene were two jurors are playing the game in order to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later {{the most}} popular way to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> was stoolball, a {{particularly}} rough version of rugby, where there were two stools {{at either end of}} the prisoners' courtyard and goals were scored by touching the opponent's stool with the ball. This game served as an outlet for pent-up aggression, and also provided noise to cover the sounds of tunnel-digging.|$|E

25|$|As a {{teenager}} in Sandy Hook, Whitley and his friends would <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> drinking bootleg bourbon and racing their cars down mountain roads at dangerous speeds. Whitley was once in a car whose driver attempted to round a curve at 120mph. The car wrecked, killing his friend and almost breaking Whitley's neck. In another incident, he drove his car off a 120-foot cliff into a frozen river, escaping with only a broken collar bone.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to enlist}} {{due to his}} paralyzed leg and with World War I looming, Weston volunteered with the YMCA, serving as a {{hospitality}} liaison with the British Army in Baghdad in the Ottoman Empire. He encouraged soldiers to draw and paint to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and organized Baghdad Art Club in 1917 {{as a means of}} exhibiting and promoting their art. Because of this work, he was appointed Official Painter for the British Army in 1918.|$|E
25|$|Passengers would <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{by reading}} by candlelight or playing cards and games such as Nine Men's Morris. Meals on board were cooked by the firebox, {{which was an}} iron tray with sand in it on which a fire was built. This was risky because it was kept in the waist of the ship. Passengers made their own meals from rations that were issued daily and food was cooked for a group at a time.|$|E

25|$|Catholic and Aglipayan Filipinos pay {{respects to}} the {{ancestors}} on All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. People gather in graveyards to clean and decorate the family grave as early as All Hallow's Eve, then offer the dead prayers, candles, flowers and sometimes food. More often than not, mourners keep vigil overnight at graves, eating and making merry to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and keep the dead company. A popular children's pastime during such vigils is to gather candle wax from melted candles to either play with or sell to candlemakers.|$|E
25|$|Leisure {{facilities}} were provided {{for all three}} classes to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing {{to inform the public}} which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.|$|E

25|$|His later films fared less successfully, {{although}} Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, {{in which}} he played the White Rabbit, enjoyed moderate success in the UK. After performing in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and with offers of work greatly reduced and much of his salary from Hello, Dolly! lost, reportedly due to underhanded investments by his agent, Crawford faced {{a brief period of}} unemployment, {{in which he}} helped his wife stuff cushions (for their upholstery business) and took a job as an office clerk in an electric company to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> between. During this difficult time, his marriage fell apart and divorce followed in 1975.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to the United States and moved to Monterey, California near Fort Ord, the successor to Gigling Reservation, which he helped found and build in 1941 and 1942. Louer had an open door policy to anyone who wanted to drop by at 3:00 on any afternoon to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and say hello. Lauer died of cancer on 13 October 1966, at the Fort Ord Army Hospital. He was inurned at the Golden Gate National Cemetery near San Francisco on 15 October 1966. He requested that he be buried in a plain pine box, like any other soldier, which was honored. On 16 February 1974, his wife of 48 years was buried beside him.|$|E
25|$|Butcher {{was born}} in Independence, Missouri, in 1971. He is the {{youngest}} of three children, having two older sisters. While he was sick with strep throat as a child, Butcher's sisters introduced him to The Lord of the Rings and The Han Solo Adventures novels to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> thus beginning his fascination with fantasy and science fiction. As a teenager, he completed his first novel {{and set out to}} become a writer. After many unsuccessful attempts to enter the traditional fantasy genre (he cites J. R. R. Tolkien, Lloyd Alexander, and C. S. Lewis, among others, as major influences), he wrote the first book in The Dresden Files—about a professional wizard, named Harry Dresden, in modern-day Chicago—as an exercise for a writing course in 1996 at the age of 25.|$|E
