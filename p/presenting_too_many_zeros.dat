Zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models have been proposed for the situations where the data generating process results into <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>zeros.</b> In this paper, we propose a zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) regression model to model domestic violence data with <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>zeros.</b> Es-timation of the model parameters using the method of maximum likelihood is provided. A score test is presented to test whether the number of zeros is too large for the generalized Poisson model to adequately fit the domestic violence data...|$|R

Such inflexibility might have been the source of <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>zero</b> steps taken by the simplex method in solving real-world linear programming problems, which are usually highly degenerate. To dodge this difficulty, we first generalize the basis to allow the deficient case, characterized as one that has columns fewer than rows of the coefficient matrix. Variations of the primal and dual simplex procedures are then made, and used to form a two-phase method based on such a basis, the number of whose columns varies dynamically in the solution process. Generally speaking, the more degenerate a problem to be handled is, the fewer columns the basis will have; so, this renders the possibility of efficiently solving highly degenerate problems. We also provide a valuable insight into the distinctive and favorable behavior of the proposed method by reporting our computational experiments...|$|R
