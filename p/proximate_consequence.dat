Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} genes as-sociated with hybrid sterility and other hybrid dys-functions, but {{the consequences of}} introgressions of these ‘‘speciation genes’ ’ are often poorly understood. Previously, we identified a panel of genes that are underexpressed in sterile male hybrids of Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana relative to pure species. Here, we build on this reverse-genetics approach {{to demonstrate that the}} underexpression of at least five of these genes in hybrids is associated with hybrid sterility and that these five genes are coordinately regulated. We map one upstream regulator of these genes to a region previously shown to harbor one or more factors causing hybrid sterility. Finally, we show that the genes underexpressed in hybrids are often highly conserved, as might be predicted for downstream targets of the genetic changes that cause hybrid sterility. This approach integrates forward genetics with reverse genetics to show a <b>proximate</b> <b>consequence</b> of the introgression of particular hybrid sterility-conferring regions between species: underex-pression of genes necessary for normal spermato-genesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] controversies currently dominate the fields of arthropod metabolic rate, gas exchange and water balance, including {{the extent to which}} modulation of gas exchange reduces water loss, the origins of discontinuous gas exchange, the relationship between metabolic rate and life-history strategies, and the causes of Palaeozoic gigantism. In all of these areas, repeated calls have been made for the investigation of groups that might most inform the debates, especially of taxa in key phylogenetic positions. Here we respond to this call by investigating metabolic rate, respiratory water loss and critical oxygen partial pressure (Pc) in the onychophoran Peripatopsis capensis, a member of a group basal to the arthropods, and by synthesizing the available data on the Onychophora. The rate of carbon dioxide release (V̇ CO 2) at 20 °C in P. capensis is 0. 043 ml CO 2 h - 1, in keeping with other onychophoran species; suggesting that low metabolic rates in some arthropod groups are derived. Continuous gas exchange suggests that more complex gas exchange patterns are also derived. Total water loss in P. capensis is 57 mg H 2 O h- 1 at 20 °C, similar to modern estimates for another onychophoran species. High relative respiratory water loss rates (∼ 34 %; estimated using a regression technique) suggest that the basal condition in arthropods may be a high respiratory water loss rate. Relatively high Pc values (5 - 10 % O 2) suggest that substantial safety margins in insects are also a derived condition. Curling behaviour in P. capensis appears to be a strategy to lower energetic costs when resting, and the concomitant depression of water loss is a <b>proximate</b> <b>consequence</b> of this behaviour.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the actual impact of so-called social networks (or social utilities) on lives of modern high school students. The subject matter of this work is basically concerned with the usage of these internet social networks and the <b>proximate</b> <b>consequences</b> of it within teenagers? everyday (?real?) lives. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to describe how and to what extend being a registered user and active member of these internet social utilities may interact with self-perception {{and the perception of}} others, as well as how much it may affect personal and social status of each individual. As a main research method, the authoress has used questioning methods and qualitative analysis of gathered data in line with the grounded theory as expressed, for example, by Strauss and Corbin (1999). The outcome of this research work shows inconsistence of the role of internet social networks as a means of communication, as well as the significance of its impact on modern teenagers? lives and the way of their thinking...|$|R
40|$|Lizard life-history {{characteristics}} {{vary widely}} among species and populations. Most authors seek adaptive or phylogenetic explanations for life-history patterns, {{which are usually}} presumed to reflect genetic differences. However, lizard life histories are often phenotypically plastic, varying in response to temperature, food availability, and other environmental factors. Despite the importance of temperature to lizard ecology and physiology, its effects on life histories have received relatively little attention. We present a theoretical model predicting the <b>proximate</b> <b>consequences</b> of the thermal environment for lizard life histories. Temperature, by affecting activity times, can cause variation in annual survival rate and fecundity, leading to a negative correlation between survival rate and fecundity among populations in different thermal environments. Thus, physiological and evolutionary models predict the same qualitative pattern of life-history variation in lizards. We tested our model with published life-history data from field studies of the lizard Sceloporus undulatus, using climate and geographical data to reconstruct estimated annual activity seasons. Among populations, annual activity times were negatively correlated with annual survival rate and positively correlated with fecundity. Proximate effects of temperature may confound comparative analyses of lizard life-history variation and {{should be included in}} future evolutionary models...|$|R
500|$|William S. Andrews of Syracuse was a 69-year-old judge, {{noted for}} his scholarship, {{who had been}} on the Court of Appeals since 1917. The son of Charles Andrews, a former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, William Andrews is best remembered today because he wrote an opinion in Palsgraf. In that dissent, he was joined by Judges Frederick E. Crane and John F. O'Brien. Andrews began with a brief recitation of facts: that a {{railroad}} employee had negligently dislodged the package, the contents of which the trainman was unaware, and the subsequent explosion broke the scale and injured the plaintiff, [...] "an intending passenger". Andrews noted the fundamental difference among the judges concerning the law of negligence: whether there must be a duty to the plaintiff, the breach of which injured her, and whether, when there is an act that is a threat to the safety of others, the doer of it should be [...] "liable for all its <b>proximate</b> <b>consequences,</b> even where they result in injury to one who would generally be thought to be outside the radius of danger". Andrews believed that if there was a negligent act, the proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff, that should establish liability.|$|R
40|$|Rates of {{childhood}} obesity have increased three-fold {{in the last}} 20 years, and experts estimate that well over half of adolescents with a Body Mass Index {{at or above the}} 95 th percentile become obese adults. These trends are even more pronounced in ethnic minority and lower income populations that are disproportionately impacted by obesity and its complications. It would be appropriate, then, to focus obesity interventions on Hispanic children. Television viewing, especially, has been shown to contribute to obesity by increasing caloric intake and decreasing physical activity. Parent involvement {{has proven to be a}} critical component in changing children’s health behaviors. In order to explore parents’ motivations for limiting their children’s television viewing, I qualitatively analyzed data from twenty-five interviews with Houston area Head Start parents. Using Grounded Theory, four main categories of concern emerged from the audio-recorded conversations: developmentally inappropriate content, the influence of television, poor health behaviors/outcomes, and general disapproval with television. Developmentally inappropriate content was the most frequently mentioned category with 119 mentions. This included violence, the most common sub-theme. In all, parents were more concerned with television content that produced <b>proximate</b> <b>consequences</b> such as modeling violent behavior or inappropriate language. Content that encouraged behaviors that led to obesity or other delayed consequences were of less concern to the parents. This suggests that future interventions aimed at encouraging Hispanic parents to reduce their children’s television viewing should draw motivation from parents’ concerns about developmentally inappropriate content, rather than focusing on deleterious health outcomes such as obesity. ...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{influences}} the activity seasons, reproductive phenology, survival rates, and {{growth rates of}} lizards. We present a model of lizard growth that predicts phenotypic patterns of age and size at reproductive maturity in different thermal environments (i. e. different activity seasons). The model predicts a threshold in length of activity season: above this threshold (long season), lizards can mature one year earlier, but at a smaller size, compared to populations with activity seasons below the threshold. This environmentally imposed pattern reflects the <b>proximate</b> <b>consequences</b> of temperature together with simple rules {{about the timing of}} maturation. A key prediction of the model is that age and size at maturity can vary non-linearly with thelength of the activity season, and with the timing and duration of egg laying and hatching. We tested these predictions with published data from field studies of the phrynosomatid lizard 2 ̆ 7 Sceloporus undulatus, 2 ̆ 7 which is geographically widespread and occupies a range of thermal environments. We estimated activity seasons for each population by modeling the links between climates, microclimates and lizard body temperatures using heat-transfer principles. Female age at maturity showed the predicted threshold in length of activity season, whereas female size at maturity did not show the predicted threshold, but instead was negatively correlated with length of activity season. Two prairie populations were exceptions to this pattern: females matured in one year despite their short activity seasons, and consequently matured at an unusually small size. Prairie populations may have evolved differences in growth response and reproductive timing. The thermal environment appears to be an important correlate of life history variation among populations of 2 ̆ 7 Sceloporus undulatus. 2 ̆...|$|R

The answers to these questions should contribute to explaining how transnational regulatory power is allocated through contract and how it is exercised along the chain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The age {{at which}} a female reaches sexual {{maturity}} is critical in determining her future reproductive health and success. Thus, a worldwide decline in menarcheal age (timing of first menstrual period) may have serious long-term consequences. Early menarcheal timing (first menstrual period before age 12) can {{have a negative effect}} on fecundity, as well as the quality and quantity of offspring, and may consequently influence population growth or decline. In this paper, we apply an evolutionary framework to modern human health, and assess both <b>proximate</b> and ultimate <b>consequences</b> of declining menarcheal age. Examination of human reproductive health within an evolutionary framework is innovative and essential, because it illuminates the ultimate consequences of a declining age of menarche and facilitates new ways of thinking about the long-term and intergenerational transmission of health and disease; thus, an evolutionary framework lends itself to innovative public health and policy programs. In this paper, we examine whether or not early menarche is an alternative reproductive tactic that modern human females employ in response to a stressful environment, and whether or not early menarche is ultimately beneficial...|$|R
40|$|Egg {{quality is}} a {{phenotype}} of, and can profoundly influence fitness in, {{both mother and}} offspring. However, the physiological mechanisms that underlie this maternal effect are poorly understood. Carotenoids are hypothesized to enhance antioxidant activity and immune function, and {{are responsible for the}} pigmentation of egg yolk. The <b>proximate</b> basis and <b>consequences</b> of this maternal investment, however, have not previously been studied in wild birds. In this supplemental feeding study of lesser black-backed gulls, Larus fuscus, carotenoid-fed females are shown to have increased integument pigmentation, higher plasma concentrations of carotenoids and antioxidant activity, and lower plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins (Igs) in comparison with controls. In turn, carotenoid-fed females produced eggs containing high carotenoid but low Ig concentrations (i. e. passive immunity), whereas control females produced eggs containing low carotenoid but high Ig concentrations. Within-clutch patterns of these resources varied over the laying sequence in a similar manner in both carotenoid-fed and control nests. Our results suggest that carotenoids could be one resource responsible for egg quality maternal effects in birds. We discuss the possible implications of carotenoid-mediated effects on phenotype for fitness in mothers and their offspring...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>proximate</b> causes and <b>consequences</b> of {{breeding}} dispersal and divorce in a Mediterranean blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus population. We attempt {{to evaluate the}} primacy of mate and territory quality in the decision making of birds. In females, the fidelity to their old territories was dependent on how {{they did in the}} previous year. We found differences in hatching success and fledging success between females that dispersed and those that did not. In particular, dispersal distance was negatively correlated with hatching success in the preceding breeding season. Dispersed females experienced a gain in terms of hatching success and increased productivity in comparison with those that retained their former mate. Both females and males improved the quality of their breeding site after dispersal. We also found evidence that divorce is adaptive for at least one pair member because adult females (but not juveniles) enhanced their breeding performance after the breakup. Such improvement was also observed when restricting the analyses to only those individuals that did not change territory, suggesting that these benefits not only accrue through the acquisition of better territories but advantages derived from pairing with a higher rank male (mate effects per se) could also be important. Our results suggest that 1) both dispersal and divorce can be regarded as adaptive decisions, 2) females play an active role in pair-bond maintenance, and 3) the intense competition for good nesting sites drives the observed high divorce rate (63 %) reinforcing the view that breakups could be a side effect derived from the female’s attempt to improve their breeding place.

40|$|Life-history theory {{predicts that}} {{individuals}} {{need to adjust}} their behaviour to specific environmental conditions in order to maximise their fitness. Thus, {{to understand how the}} environment affects demography and population dynamics, it is crucial to study the behavioural responses of individuals to different aspects of the environment as well as the consequences of these responses for reproduction and survival. Two aspects of the environment affect animals across all life-history stages. First, the availability of food resources determines the amount of energy available for different life-history functions. If resources are limited during the breeding season, parents need to decide how to allocate limited energy among reproduction and self-maintenance. As a result, individuals may adjust breeding site selection, range use, home-range size, or parental effort to the availability of food. Second, predators influence population dynamics and the spatial distribution of animals directly by lethal predation and indirectly by eliciting anti-predator behaviours. In this thesis, I used the little owl (Athene noctua) as a study system to investigate three issues faced by adult animals: the allocation of energy between reproduction and self-maintenance {{as a function of the}} habitat conditions (Chapters 1 - 3), the decision between philopatry and breeding dispersal (Chapter 4), and the behavioural response to predation risk (Chapter 5). Using very high frequency (VHF) radio-telemetry, I tracked individuals throughout the year, allowing me to calculate season-specific home-range sizes and survival rates with a high temporal resolution. A nestling food supplementation experiment enabled me to investigate parental responses to the nutritional state of the nestlings and to evaluate food limitation of reproduction in habitats of different quality. In Chapter 1, I showed that, irrespective of the parental home-range size, clutch size was positively correlated with the proportion of food-rich habitat close to the nest, suggesting that the distance between high quality food resources and suitable nest sites plays an important role for the productivity of little owls. Paternal home-range size was positively correlated with the survival of the father and the nestlings. In homogenous landscapes, parents seem to expand their home-range to include additional food-rich habitat, thereby gaining a net benefit in terms of reproductive success and parental survival. In Chapter 2, I showed that nestlings in poor habitats only received two thirds of the biomass delivered to nests in high-quality habitats, resulting in lower survival of nestlings in poor habitats. Food supplementation increased the survival of adult males and females, not only during the breeding season but also during the following periods of the year, suggesting that little owl parents are limited by the availability of food resources (Chapter 3). Thus, the first three chapters of this thesis provide insights into the mechanisms regulating the trade-off between current reproduction and self-maintenance under varying habitat conditions. I conclude from the results that habitats of low quality affect individual life histories and local demographic rates both in the short term (reduced current reproductive output), and in the long term (reduced survival prospects and future reproductive success of adults). In Chapter 4, I investigated the patterns, <b>proximate</b> causes and <b>consequences</b> of breeding dispersal. Little owls showed an overall dispersal rate of 20...|$|R
