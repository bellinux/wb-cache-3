5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} rigid lattice, it can {{be contaminated}} by very few types of impurities, such as boron and nitrogen. Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (lattice defects), green (radiation exposure), purple, <b>pink,</b> <b>orange</b> or red. Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion (ability to disperse light of different colors).|$|E

25|$|On the Blacksburg campus, the {{majority}} of the buildings incorporate Hokie Stone as a building material. Hokie Stone is a medley of different-colored limestone, often including dolomite. Each block of Hokie Stone is some combination of gray, brown, black, <b>pink,</b> <b>orange,</b> and maroon. The limestone is mined from various quarries in Southwestern Virginia, Tennessee, and Alabama, one of which has been operated by the university since the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The finest ruby is {{described}} as being a vivid medium-dark toned red. Secondary hues add an additional complication. <b>Pink,</b> <b>orange,</b> and purple are the normal secondary hues in ruby. Of the three, purple is preferred because it reinforces the red, making it appear richer. Purple also occupies {{a position on the}} color wheel halfway between red and blue. When a purplish-red ruby is set in yellow, the yellow neutralizes its complement blue, leaving the stone appearing to be pure red in the setting.|$|E
25|$|A truly red bearded iris, like a truly blue rose, {{remains an}} unattained goal despite {{frequent}} hybridizing and selection. There are species and selections, most notably {{based on the}} beardless rhizomatous Copper iris (I. fulva), which have a relatively pure red color. However, getting this color into a modern bearded iris breed has proven very difficult, and thus, {{the vast majority of}} irises are in the purple and blue range of the color spectrum, with yellow, <b>pink,</b> <b>orange</b> and white breeds also available.|$|E

25|$|Since {{becoming}} the San Antonio Spurs in 1973, the team colors have been black, silver and white. The distinctive logo {{of the word}} Spurs in Eurostile font, with the stylized spur substituting for the letter U, {{has been a part}} of the team's identity since their move to San Antonio. The logo incorporated 'Fiesta colors' of <b>pink,</b> <b>orange</b> and teal, used from 1989 to 2002 (though the uniforms remained the same), and alignment from straight to arched beginning with the 2002–03 NBA season.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} known that oxygen is {{solidified}} into a state called the β-phase at room temperature by applying pressure, and with further increasing pressure, the β-phase undergoes phase transitions to the δ-phase at 9 GPa and the ε-phase at 10 GPa; and, due {{to the increase in}} molecular interactions, the color of the β-phase changes to <b>pink,</b> <b>orange,</b> then red (the stable octaoxygen phase), and the red color further darkens to black with increasing pressure. It was found that a metallic ζ-phase appears at 96 GPa when ε-phase oxygen is further compressed.|$|E
25|$|Biofluorescence is the {{absorption}} of electromagnetic wavelengths from the visible light spectrum by fluorescent proteins in a living organism, and the reemission of that light at a lower energy level. This causes the light that is re-emitted {{to be a different}} color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an electron, raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescent light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, <b>pink,</b> <b>orange,</b> red, green, or purple. Biofluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.|$|E

25|$|On January 30, 2007, Apple {{announced}} {{the addition of}} four new colors to the iPod Shuffle line - <b>pink,</b> <b>orange,</b> green, and blue, {{in addition to the}} original silver color. The orange color was a first for the iPod franchise. They also now came with new redesigned headphones that were not included with the original silver model. The box was also changed to have gray text instead of the lime-green text. On September 5, 2007, Apple introduced four new colors, including a Product Red version. The new colors were turquoise, lavender, mint green, and Product Red, with the previous colors discontinued. On February 19, 2008, Apple introduced a 2GB version of the iPod Shuffle, retailing for US$69 and available in all the same colours as the 1GB model. At the Apple Let's Rock Event on September 9, 2008, Apple once again released four new colors for the iPod Shuffle: blue, green, pink, and red, replacing the colors that were released in September 2007. The new blue, green and pink variants of the iPod Shuffle reverted to shades that were similar to the colors that were released in January 2007. In June 2009, Avon offered a gold iPod Shuffle (second generation) for $29 when purchased in conjunction with two ANEW skin care products.|$|E
500|$|Like all penguin species, emperor {{penguins}} have streamlined {{bodies to}} minimize drag while swimming, and wings {{that are more}} like stiff, flat flippers. The tongue is equipped with rear-facing barbs to prevent prey from escaping when caught. Males and females are similar in size and colouration. The adult has deep black dorsal feathers, covering the head, chin, throat, back, dorsal part of the flippers, and tail. The black plumage is sharply delineated from the light-coloured plumage elsewhere. The underparts of the wings and belly are white, becoming pale yellow in the upper breast, while the ear patches are bright yellow. The upper mandible of the [...] long bill is black, and the lower mandible can be <b>pink,</b> <b>orange</b> or lilac. In juveniles, the auricular patches, chin and throat are white, while its bill is black. Emperor penguin chicks are typically covered with silver-grey down and have black heads and white masks. A chick with all-white plumage was found in 2001, but was {{not considered to be}} an albino as it did not have pink eyes. Chicks weigh around [...] after hatching, and fledge when they reach about 50% of adult weight.|$|E
500|$|Grevillea juniperina has a {{spreading}} or erect habit (growth form) and {{it grows}} to between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) in height. The branchlets are thick and sturdy. The prickly leaves are generally stiff, and are [...] long and [...] wide. They are crowded along the stems. Flowering occurs throughout the year, peaking between mid winter and early summer, though varies {{between the different}} subspecies. Subspecies allojohnsonii flowers from September to February, subspecies trinervis flowers from August to December, and subspecies juniperina, amphitricha, sulphurea, villosa and fortis flower in August and September. The spider-flower arrangement of the inflorescence has several individual flowers emerging from a central rounded flower head—reminiscent of the legs of a spider. The flowers are red, <b>pink,</b> <b>orange,</b> yellow or greenish, and are mostly terminal—arising {{on the ends of}} stems—though they occasionally arise from axillary buds. They are [...] long. The perianth is finely furred on the outside, while the pistil is smooth; it is [...] long. Flowering is followed by the development of seed pods, each capsule is [...] long, and releases one or two seeds when ripe. The narrow oval seed is [...] and [...] wide, with a swelling at the apex and a short wing. Both surfaces are covered with tiny hairs.|$|E

500|$|Nitrogen {{is by far}} {{the most}} common {{impurity}} found in gem diamonds and is responsible for the yellow and brown color in diamonds. Boron is responsible for the blue color. Color in diamond has two additional sources: irradiation (usually by alpha particles), that causes the color in green diamonds, and plastic deformation of the diamond crystal lattice. Plastic deformation is the cause of color in some brown and perhaps pink and red diamonds. In order of increasing rarity, yellow diamond is followed by brown, colorless, then by blue, green, black, <b>pink,</b> <b>orange,</b> purple, and red. [...] "Black", or Carbonado, diamonds are not truly black, but rather contain numerous dark inclusions that give the gems their dark appearance. Colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration, while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless. Most diamond impurities replace a carbon atom in the crystal lattice, known as a carbon flaw. The most common impurity, nitrogen, causes a slight to intense yellow coloration depending upon the type and concentration of nitrogen present. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) classifies low saturation yellow and brown diamonds as diamonds in the normal color range, and applies a grading scale from [...] "D" [...] (colorless) to [...] "Z" [...] (light yellow). Diamonds of a different color, such as blue, are called fancy colored diamonds and fall under a different grading scale.|$|E
2500|$|Still Life with French Novels and a Rose is a {{painting}} {{with a number}} of novels with bindings of contrasting colors: green against pink and red. The books are meant to represent seven Parisian novels Van Gogh owned, that Van Gogh described as [...] "a great source of light", regardless of the somber literature they contain. [...] The dashes of lemon, <b>pink,</b> <b>orange</b> and green seem to bring life to the books, like the blossoming flower that also adds a feeling that the paintings is made for a woman. [...] In 1888 Van Gogh gave this painting and another to his sister, Wil for her birthday. [...] The other painting was made in Arles and is titled Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book (F393).|$|E
