50|$|Formerly, two {{subspecies}} of the <b>Plains</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> {{were widely}} recognized, but most authorities have since dropped subspecies recognition. The first, T. r. radix, was {{commonly referred to}} as the eastern <b>Plains</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> while T. r. haydeni (Kennicott 1860) was considered the western subspecies. However, the distinction between the two is weak, partly {{based on the number of}} scales and partly on slight coloration differences, with T. r. haydeni said to have cleaner markings and more ventral and neck scales. As the two subspecies share the same habitat in many regions of the United States, further complicated by their strikingly similar appearance, many now do not recognize the two subspecies.|$|E
50|$|The {{great plains toad}} feeds a {{range of}} insects such as lepidopterans, dipterans, hymenopterans, coleopterans, ants, and termites.

The rainbow trout in Piscasaw Creek are stocked {{each year by}} the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the McHenry County Conservation District. Brown trout populations are most likely natural, since no stocking efforts were made. Both species are known to breed successfully, though the overwhelming populations of various chub and sucker often deter most fisherman from consistently fishing it. In total, 46 species of fish have been documented in Piscasaw Creek. Aside from fish, 17 species of mussel have been collected from the creek.

2500|$|San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> forage {{extensively}} in aquatic habitats. Adult snakes feed primarily on California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii), which are federally listed as threatened.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of naphthalene, sulfur, and a commercial {{combination of these}} chemicals as a repellent against the <b>plains</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis radix) was investigated. Behavioral tests were conducted using 96 recently captured snakes to determine whether significant avoidance results from {{the presence of these}} chemicals. Field tests were performed at 24 locations in the snakes 2 ̆ 7 home range and in unfamiliar habitats. In both home ranges and unfamiliar habitats application of potential repellents did not result in significant avoidance behavior. The snakes may be able to sense these volatile chemicals, but the stimuli were unable to alter their behavior. Based on this study, tendency to seek cover, refuge, familiar habitat, or to investigate unfamiliar areas was stronger than deterrence of the chemicals. Because the substances tested did not elicit avoidance behavior in the <b>plains</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> usage of these repellents should be discouraged. Habitat modification for snake management is discussed {{as an alternative to the}} application of chemical repellents...|$|E

Ruthven (p. 80), however, believed that radix very probably would be found in western Indiana, a supposition since substantiated by Schmidt and Necker (1935 : 72), who report the species from the dune region of Lake and Porter counties...|$|E
40|$|A four-year-old, captive-bred, female <b>Plains</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis radix) was {{presented}} with a large midbody distension (5 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm) in the second third of the body length (total body length 123 cm).

Aspiration of 8 ml of acellular straw coloured fluid negative for presence of bacteria, fungi or parasites, reduced the swelling {{to a third of}} its original size. Surgical exploration revealed a pathologically changed central part of the liver with multiple different sized cysts. Histopathologically the diagnosis was defined as biliary cystadenoma. As the liver had a physiological appearance cranial and caudal to the central area, a partial hepatectomy was performed. The snake recovered well and started to feed spontaneously two days after surgery. During the check up two, four and seven months after hepatectomy, the snake was active and in a good condition. Hypoproteinaemia and altered activity of lactate dehydrogenase were present two months after surgery, azurophilia and hyperuricaemia were present in the blood sampled four months after hepatectomy.

40|$|Introduction: The {{distribution}} and {{natural history of}} amphibians and reptiles have been little studied in the northern states of the great plains. Relative to other vertebrate groups, the herpetofauna of grasslands is depauperate particularly at higher latitudes where temperature becomes a limiting factor to poikilotherms. Nevertheless, certain species of amphibians and reptiles are common in specific habitats and thus form a conspicuous component of the prairie fauna. The purposes {{of the present study}} were to document the distributions of herpetiles in a specified region of western Nebraska and to describe general aspects of their natural history. We hope such information will stimulate additiona work as well as provide a baseline reference for future studies on the herpetofauna of the northern great plains. Previous work on herpetiles in western Nebraska are either in need of updating (e. g. Hudson, 1942) or are anecdotal or not comprehensive (Heyl and Smith, 1957; Gehlbach and Collette, 1959; Iverson, 1975; Lynch, 1978). Summary: The herpetofauna of the seven county study area in western Nebraska may be characterized in general by a preponderance of organisms exhibiting both wide geographical and wide ecological distributions and tolerances. Species exhibiting little microhabitat specificity and which are found widely throughout the region include the tiger salamander, spadefoot toad, rocky mountain toad, striped chorus frog, lesser earless lizard, fence lizard, racerunner, common racer, bullsnake, red-sided garter snake, <b>plains</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> snapping turtle and painted turtle. Those ecologically restricted species that enter the area include the plains leopard frog, common water snake, black-headed snake, yellow mud turtle, Blanding 2 ̆ 7 s turtle, and spiny soft-shelled turtle...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [58]- 61) Sexual dimorphism in body, {{head and}} tail dimensions is wide spread in snakes. Sex differences in behavior {{appear to be}} less common but occur in some species. However, information on sexual dimorphism is often limited to adults and information on neonates is frequently lacking. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) characterize patterns of sexual dimorphism in neonate and adult Plains garter snakes (Thamnophis radix), 2) test for sex differences in behavior and 3) document corticosterone levels in wild-caught and captive snakes and test for possible effects of corticosterone on behavior. Sexual dimorphism in body size was absent in neonates (71 offspring in six families) whereas adult females were larger than males (64 wild-caught adults). Sexual dimorphism in head dimensions was present in neonates but not in adults. Tail length dimorphism was male-biased in both neonates and adults. Significant sex effects on growth in body size and head dimensions were absent in snakes reared to 11 months (51 snakes in five families) but present for growth in tail length. Plains garter snakes typically flee when threatened but will sometimes strike defensively. In the closely related Butler's garter snake (T. butleri), the likelihood of striking is greater in males than females. In this study, sex differences in behavior were lacking among neonates (64 snakes in six families) and adults (24 wild-caught snakes). However, there was a significant age-by-sex interaction among snakes reared to 11 months of age (19 snakes in two families), with strike frequency of males increasing considerably. Effects of corticosterone on behavior are well documented in species that maintain territories or compete for mates. For non-territorial species, like the <b>Plains</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> corticosterone may have different behavioral effects. Snakes were given corticosterone implants to raise hormone levels and measures of activity were scored before and after implantation. Unfortunately, corticosterone implants were ineffective and behavioral scores were uncorrelated with corticosterone levels. Corticosterone levels were much higher in wild-caught snakes than in neonates and in wild-caught females than in males, perhaps due to stress associated with capture. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
