5|$|HIT may be {{suspected}} if {{blood tests}} show a falling <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> in someone receiving heparin, {{even if the}} heparin has already been discontinued. Professional guidelines recommend that people receiving heparin have a complete blood count (which includes a <b>platelet</b> <b>count)</b> {{on a regular basis}} while receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> in {{the blood}} falls below the normal range, a {{condition}} called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E
5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation generally resolves {{when the}} underlying causes are treated, but supportive measures are often required. For instance, if the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> drops significantly and there is resultant bleeding, platelets may be administered.|$|E
30|$|Daily <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> {{were done}} with an {{automated}} haematology analyser (Sysmex XE- 500, Denmark). Thrombocytopenic patients with bleeding had <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> analysed twice a day. <b>Platelet</b> <b>counts</b> of less than 10  ×  109 per litre were manually counted.|$|R
40|$|<b>Platelet</b> <b>counts</b> were {{obtained}} in 675 patients with different hematological {{and other medical}} disorders. An indirect venous blood dry slide method which gave a normal range of 200 to 400 × 103 per cu mm was used. <b>Platelet</b> <b>counts</b> varied considerably in disease: In 20 patients, exclusive of myeloproliferative disorders, <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> in excess of 1, 000 × 103 per cu mm were observed; in 20 patients, exclusive of leukemia and megaloblastic anemia, <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> were below 100 × 103 per cu mm.

30|$|P-PRP and L-PRP {{preparations}} were independently prepared {{from the}} 11 donors by three well-trained operators. <b>Platelet</b> <b>counts</b> were first determined using the AHA and aliquots of the PRP preparations were measured using the SPM. <b>Platelet</b> <b>counts</b> were calculated {{with the appropriate}} formulas and were compared with the measured <b>platelet</b> <b>counts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low <b>platelet</b> <b>count),</b> due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation, another {{complication of}} rhabdomyolysis {{and other forms}} of critical illness, may be suspected on the basis of unexpected bleeding or abnormalities in hematological tests, such as a decreasing <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> or prolongation of the prothrombin time.

40|$|Background: Platelets play a {{critical}} role in liver injury and regeneration. Thrombocytopenia is associated with increase postoperative complications after partial hepatectomy, but it is unknown whether <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> may also predict outcome after transplantation, a procedure often performed in thrombocytopenic patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> are indicators of short- and long-term outcomes after liver transplantation. Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2011, 257 consecutive liver transplantation recipients from our prospective database were analyzed. Pre- and daily postoperative <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> were recorded until postoperative day (POD) 7. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to assess whether low peri-operative <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> are risk factor of postoperative complications, graft and patient survivals. Results: The median pre-transplantation <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> was 88 (IQR: 58 - 127) x 10 (9) /L. The lowest <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> occurred at POD 3 with a median of 56 (IQR: 41 - 86) x 10 (9) /L. Patients with low <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> at POD 5 had higher rates of severe complications (grade IIIb-IV) (39 % vs. 29 %, OR, 1. 09 (1. 1 - 3. 3), p< 0. 02) and of 90 -day mortality (16 % vs. 8 %, OR, 2. 25 (1. 0 - 5. 0), p= 0. 05). On multivariate analysis, POD 5 <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> < 60 x 10 (9) /L were identified as an independent risk factor of grade IIIb-IV complications (OR, 1. 96 (1 - 3. 5), p= 0. 01)), graft survival (HR, 2. 0 (1. 1 - 3. 6), p= 0. 03)) and patient survival (HR, 2. 2 (1. 1 - 4. 6), p= 0. 03)). The graft and patient survival predictive value of <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> was lost in patients who survived 90 days. Conclusion: After liver transplantation, <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> < 60 x 10 (9) /L at postoperative day 5 (the 60 - 5 criterion) are an independent factor associated with severe complications, and early graft and patient survivals. These findings may help to develop protective strategies or specific interventions in high-risk patients...|$|R
5|$|The {{treatment}} of HIT requires stopping heparin treatment, and both protection from thrombosis and choice of an agent {{that will not}} reduce the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> any further. Several alternatives are available for this purpose and mainly used are danaparoid, fondaparinux, argatroban and bivalirudin.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{should not}} be given to people with heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} until <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> has improved or normalised.

5|$|The IgG {{antibodies}} form {{a complex}} with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. The {{tail of the}} antibody then binds to the FcγIIa receptor, a protein {{on the surface of}} the platelet. This results in platelet activation and the formation of platelet microparticles, which initiate the formation of blood clots; the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> falls as a result, leading to thrombocytopenia.|$|E
40|$|AIM/BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that healthy subjects of African ancestry have lower total white cell counts, neutrophil <b>counts</b> and <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> than Caucasian subjects and that, at least among Caucasians, women have higher neutrophil and <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> than men. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} confirm and quantify the ethnic differences, confirm the sex difference in Caucasians and determine whether there was a similar sex difference in non-Caucasians. A secondary aim was to establish reference ranges for white cell and <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> for the different ethnic and sex groups. METHODS: The study population comprised 417 healthy volunteers (201 women and 216 men), of whom 200 were Caucasian, 102 were Afrocaribbean and 115 were African. Full blood counts, including a differential white cell count, were measured using a H. 2 automated differential counter. White cell and <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> were compared between the three different ethnic groups and between men and women. Reference ranges were determined for each ethnic and sex group. RESULTS: Africans and Afrocaribbeans had lower total white cell, neutrophil and <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> than Caucasians and counts were lower in Africans than in Afrocaribbeans. Women had higher neutrophil and <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> than men in all ethnic groups.

40|$|Objectives: Thrombocytopenia is {{commonly}} observed in critically ill patients. This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} variation in <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> and the risk factors associated with thrombocytopenia and mortality in pediatric intensive care patients. In addition, prognostic value of <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> for outcome in pediatric intensive care unit was studied. Study Design: Prospective, observational cohort analysis. Setting: 8 - bedded pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital. Patients: All consecutively admitted patients (n= 138) staying in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for at least 48 h over a 7 months period were studied. Measurements and Main Results: Thrombocytopenia was defined as <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> &# 60; 150. 0 /nL. Median 1 st day Pediatric Risk of Mortality Score (PRISM) was 5 (range 0 - 30) and median ICU stay was 4 days (range 2 - 98 days). Twenty five percent patients {{had at least one}} episode of thrombocytopenia during the stay. Twenty percent of these patients had thrombocytopenia on admission and rest (80 &#x 0025;) developed it during the PICU stay. Seventy one percent (19) of the patients developed thrombocytopenia by fourth day of admission. Patients with PICU acquired thrombocytopenia had statistically significant lower baseline, nadir and 4 th day <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> and a significantly higher drop in <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> (56 &#x 0025; vs. 6 &#x 0025; P &# 60; 0. 001) as compared to non thrombocytopenic patients. PRISM score, long PICU stay, sepsis, coagulopathy, and creatinine levels were significantly associated with occurrence of thrombocytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia had higher probability of bleeding (34 &#x 0025; vs. 15 &#x 0025;, P = 0. 01). Higher <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> on admission were associated with significantly reduced risk of thrombocytopenia (P = 0. 00) Baseline, nadir and day- 4 <b>platelet</b> <b>counts,</b> presence of thrombocytopenia on admission, sepsis, coagulopathy and a higher mean PRISM score on univariate analysis were significantly associated with mortality. Leucopenia or leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy were found to significantly affect outcome. Drop in <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> was found to have slightly higher discriminative value for mortality prediction than PRISM on the ROC curve. The survivors had higher <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> throughout the PICU stay and after an initial fall in <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> in the PICU showed a significantly higher rise in the <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> in the following days than the non-survivors. Conclusions: Thrombocytopenia is common in PICU. Patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation or with circulatory shock, coagulopathy, sepsis and with more severe disease have higher risk of developing thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenic patients have a higher risk of bleeding. Drop in platelet counts&# 62; 27 &#x 0025; and thrombocytopenia were independently related to mortality. Serial measurements of <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> are better predictors of pediatric intensive care outcome than one-time values. Any drop in <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> even without thrombocytopenia needs an urgent and extensive evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> and the mean platelet volume in patients who received isotretinoin for the treatment of acne vulgaris.

5|$|Treatment was {{initially}} limited to aspirin and warfarin, but the 1990s saw {{the introduction of}} a number of agents that could provide anticoagulation without a risk of recurrent HIT. Older terminology distinguishes between two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: type 1 (mild, non-immune mediated and self-limiting fall in <b>platelet</b> <b>count)</b> and type 2, the form described above.

It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the platelet parameters in women with IDA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six women of mean age 37 +/- 13 (16 - 70) years with IDA were enrolled this study. The relationship between serum iron parameters (such as iron, iron-binding capacity, iron saturation and ferritin) and platelet parameters (such as <b>platelet</b> <b>counts,</b> <b>platelet</b> crit, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width) were evaluated by using Pearson correlation and stepwise logistic regression tests. RESULTS: Thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia were noted in 24 (27. 9 %) and two (2. 3 %) patients, respectively. <b>Platelet</b> <b>counts</b> were increased when serum iron, iron saturation, ferritin and mean platelet volume were decreased in this study. There was a linear relationship between <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> and <b>platelet</b> crit (p 0. 05).
