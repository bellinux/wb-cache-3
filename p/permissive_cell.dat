TIM-1 binds to Ebola virus glycoproteins (GP) and mediates Ebola virus cellular entry by increasing Ebola virus infectivity in poorly <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Moreover, reducing expression of endogenous TIM-1 in highly <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> lines decreased Ebola virus infectivity. Furthermore, TIM-1 IgV domain specific antibody ARD5 inhibited Ebola virus infectivity, indicating that TIM-1 was critical for Ebola virus entry. Also, TIM-1 expression on human mucosal epithelial cells from the trachea, cornea and conjunctiva demonstrated the correlation of TIM-1 expression feature and viral entry routes.|$|E

40|$|The AIDS {{pandemic}} continues. Little {{is understood}} about how HIV gains access to <b>permissive</b> <b>cells</b> across mucosal surfaces, yet such knowledge {{is crucial to}} the development of successful topical anti-HIV- 1 agents and mucosal vaccines. HIV- 1 rapidly internalizes and integrates into the mucosal keratinocyte genome, and integrated copies of HIV- 1 persist upon cell passage. The virus does not appear to replicate, and the infection may become latent. Interactions between HIV- 1 and oral keratinocytes have been modeled in the context of key environmental factors, including putative copathogens and saliva. In keratinocytes, HIV- 1 internalizes within minutes; in saliva, an infectious fraction escapes inactivation and is harbored and transferable to <b>permissive</b> target <b>cells</b> for up to 48 hours. When incubated with the common oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, CCR 5 − oral keratinocytes signal through protease-activated receptors and Toll-like receptors to induce expression of CCR 5, which increases selective uptake of infectious R 5 -tropic HIV- 1 into oral keratinocytes and transfer to <b>permissive</b> <b>cells.</b> Hence, oral keratinocytes—like squamous keratinocytes of other tissues—may be targets for low-level HIV- 1 internalization and subsequent dissemination by transfer to <b>permissive</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

40|$|Permissiveness {{for human}} {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) infection {{is dependent on}} the state of cellular differentiation and has been linked to repression of the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). We have used conditionally <b>permissive</b> <b>cells</b> to analyze differential regulation of the MIEP and possible mechanisms involved in latency. Our data suggest that histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in repression of the MIEP in non-permissive cells as inhibition of HDACs induces viral permissiveness and increases MIEP activity. Non-permissive cells contain the class I HDAC, HDAC 3; super-expression of HDAC 3 in normally <b>permissive</b> <b>cells</b> reduces infection and MIEP activity. We further show that the MIEP associates with acetylated histones in <b>permissive</b> <b>cells,</b> and that in peripheral blood monocytes the MIEP associates with heterochromatin protein  1 (HP 1), a chromosomal protein implicated in gene silencing. As monocytes are believed to be a site of viral latency in HCMV carriers and reactivated virus is only observed upon differentiation into macrophages, we propose that chromatin remodeling of the MIEP following cellular differentiation could potentially play a role in reactivation of latent HCMV...|$|R

Recently, however, it has become apparent that there are considerable differences in the efficiencies of transduction of different cell types by AAVs. Here, we analyzed the efficiencies of transduction and the transport mechanisms of AAV type 2 (AAV- 2) in different cell types, emphasizing endothelial cells. Expression analyses in both cultured cells and the rabbit carotid artery assay showed a remarkably low level of endothelial cell transduction {{in comparison to the}} highly <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> types. The study of the endosomal pathways of AAV- 2 with fluorescently labeled virus showed clear targeting of the Golgi area in <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> lines, but this phenomenon was absent in the endothelial cell line EAhy- 926. On the other hand, the response to the block of endosomal acidification by bafilomycin A 1 also showed differences among the <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> types. We also analyzed the effect of proteasome inhibitors on endothelial cells, but their impact on the primary cells and in vivo was not significant. On the contrary, analysis of the expression pattern of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), the primary receptors of AAV- 2, revealed massive deposits of HSPG in the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. The matrix-associated receptors may therefore compete for virus binding and reduce transduction in endothelial cells. Accordingly, in endothelial cells detached from their matrix, AAV- 2 transduction was significantly increased. Altogether, these results point to a more complex cell-type-specific mode of transduction of AAV- 2 than previously appreciated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mutant HIV (HIV-Env-Tr 712) {{lacking the}} cytoplasmic {{tail of the}} viral {{glycoprotein}} (Env-CT) exhibits a cell-type specific replication phenotype such that replicative spread occurs in some T-cell lines (referred to as <b>permissive</b> <b>cells)</b> but fails {{to do so in}} most T-cell lines or in PBMCs (referred to as non-permissive cells). We aim to gain insight on the underlying requirement for the Env-CT for viral spread in non-permissive cells. Results We established that in comparison to HIV-Wt, both cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission of mutant HIV-Env-Tr 712 from non-permissive cells were severely impaired under naturally low infection conditions. This requirement for Env-CT could be largely overcome by using saturating amounts of virus for infection. We further observed that in <b>permissive</b> <b>cells,</b> which supported both routes of mutant virus transmission, viral gene expression levels, Gag processing and particle release were inherently higher than in non-permissive cells, a factor which may be significantly contributing to their permissivity phenotype. Additionally, and correlating with viral transfer efficiencies in these cell types, HIV-Gag accumulation at the virological synapse (VS) was reduced to background levels {{in the absence of the}} Env-CT in conjugates of non-permissive cells but not in <b>permissive</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusions During natural infection conditions, the HIV-Env-CT is critically required for viral transmission in cultures of non-permissive cells by both cell-free and cell-to-cell routes and is instrumental for Gag accumulation to the VS. The requirement of the Env-CT for these related processes is abrogated in <b>permissive</b> <b>cells,</b> which exhibit higher HIV gene expression levels. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{vif gene}} of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) encodes a basic Mr 23, 000 protein that is necessary for production of infectious virions by nonpermissive cells (human lymphocytes and macrophages) but not by <b>permissive</b> <b>cells</b> such as HeLa-CD 4. It had been proposed that <b>permissive</b> <b>cells</b> may contain an unidentified factor that functions like the viral Vif protein. To test this hypothesis, we produced pseudotyped wild-type and vif-deleted HIV gpt virions (which contain the HIV- 1 genome with the bacterial mycophenolic acid resistance gene gpt {{in place of the}} viral env gene) in <b>permissive</b> <b>cells,</b> and we used them to generate nonper-missive H 9 leukemic T cells that express these proviruses. We then fused these H 9 <b>cells</b> with <b>permissive</b> HeLa <b>cells</b> that express the HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein gp 120 -gp 41, and we asked whether the heterokaryons would release infectious HIV gpt virions. The results clearly showed that the vif-deleted virions released by the heterokaryons were noninfectious whereas the wild-type virions were highly infectious. This strongly suggests that nonpermissive cells, the natural targets of HIV- 1, contain a potent endogenous inhibitor of HIV- 1 replication that is overcome by Vif.

In this study, the binding characteristics of AAV- 2 to human cells were examined in two different assays. In a liquid-phase assay, in which binding of biotinylated virus to cells in suspension was measured, AAV- 2 showed specific binding to four different <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> lines: HeLa S 3, 293, D 6, and KB cells. In contrast, AAV- 2 binding to erythrocytes or to the nonpermissive cell line UT- 7 /Epo was negligible. AAV- 2 binding showed saturation kinetics. Both binding and infectivity of AAV- 2 were abolished by trypsin treatment of cells, with significant recovery of bindings after 8 hr of culture, suggesting that virus attachment occurs through a protein that can be regenerated on the cell surface. In a second, virus overlay assay, we assessed binding of [35 S]methionine-labeled AAV- 2 to membrane proteins that had been transferred to nitrocellulose after electrophoretic separation. In this assay, virus attachment was shown to a 150 -kDa protein. This protein was present in membranes from the AAV- 2 <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> lines but not detected in membranes from erythrocytes or UT- 7 /Epo cells.

However, the identity of the <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> types and the required steps of conversion of vitamin A to biologically active ATRA bringing about retinoic acid receptor-regulated signaling remains elusive. Here we present that only a subset of murine and human DCs express the necessary enzymes, including RDH 10, RALDH 2, and transporter cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) 2, to produce ATRA and efficient signaling. These <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> types include CD 103 + DCs, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin- 4 -treated bone marrow-derived murine DCs and human monocyte-derived DCs (mo-DCs).

In our model of human mo-DCs, all three proteins (RDH 10, RALDH 2, and CRABP 2) appeared to be required for ATRA production induced by activation of PPARγ and therefore form a linear pathway. This now functionally validated PPARγ-regulated ATRA producing and signaling axis equips the cells with the capacity to convert precursors to active retinoids in response to receptor-activating fatty acids and is potentially amenable to intervention in diseases involving or affecting mucosal immunity...|$|E

In contrast, murine norovirus (MNV) offers a tractable system for the study of noroviruses with the recent discovery of permissive cells and a mouse model. The lack of a reverse genetic system for MNV has been a significant block to understanding the biology of noroviruses. We report recovery of infectious MNV after baculovirus delivery of viral cDNA to human hepatoma cells under the control of an inducible DNA polymerase (pol) II promoter. Recovered virus replicated in murine macrophage (RAW 264. 7) cells, and the recovery of MNV from DNA was confirmed through recovery of virus containing a marker mutation. This pol II promoter driven expression of viral cDNA also generated infectious virus after transfection of HEK 293 T cells, thus providing both transduction and transfection systems for norovirus reverse genetics. We used norovirus reverse genetics to demonstrate by mutagenesis of the protease-polymerase (pro-pol) cleavage site that processing of pro-pol is essential for the recovery of infectious MNV.

N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) oligomer-specific lectins bound to PRRSV and blocked virus attachment, resulting in reduced viral infection.

Removal or alteration of envelope protein-linked N-glycans {{also did not}} affect virus infection, indicating that PRRSV N-glycans are not required for virus infection. These findings show that steric hindrance of glycans on the PRRSV envelope by lectins or, presumably, other space-filling molecules, may interfere nonspecifically with infection by blocking protein interactions with cell surface receptors.

To analyze the limited permissiveness of our Huh 7 cells, 70 clones were obtained after single-cell cloning of parental Huh 7 cells. The cloned Huh 7 cells exhibited various levels of HCV pseudoparticles and JFH- 1 virus infection efficiency, and some clones were not permissive. A subgenomic replicon was then transfected into the cloned Huh 7 cells. While the replication efficiencies differed among the cloned Huh 7 cells, these efficiencies did not correlate with infectious permissibility. Flow cytometry showed that CD 81, scavenger receptor class B type I, and low-density-lipoprotein receptor expression on the cell surfaces of the Huh 7 clones differed among the clones. Interestingly, we found that all of the <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> clones expressed CD 81 while the nonpermissive cell clones did not. To confirm the importance of CD 81 expression for HCV permissiveness, CD 81 was then transiently and stably expressed on a nonpermissive Huh 7 cell clone, which was consequently restored to HCV infection permissiveness. Furthermore, permissiveness was down-regulated upon transfection of CD 81 silencing RNA into a CD 81 -positive cell clone.

To eliminate adenovirus protein effects, plasmids expressing GFP for fluorescent selection of only transfected cells and wild-type IE 86 protein or a mutant IE 86 protein were tested in <b>permissive</b> and nonpermissive <b>cells.</b> HCMV infection induced the entry of U 373 cells into the S phase.

(1996) and our laboratory indicated that it is an unusual insect virus with strict tissue tropism and the ability to establish persistent infections in vivo. ^ After acquiring purified virus from infected adult insects, two <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> culture systems, TN- 368 and Ld 652 Y were established for GSV replication in vitro. The cell culture-derived virus was confirmed to have the same morphology, biological activity and genetic identity as that of GSV recovered from insects. Using a cell culture system, several genetically pure GSV cloned isolates were acquired by plaque purification. The replication cycle of the virus including ultrastructural studies, viral DNA replication and virus specific protein synthesis were investigated in these two cell lines and interestingly, {{it was found that the}} exact same virus isolate had a different biology in the different <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Difference in the molecular biology of virus replication in these two cell lines was also observed. This suggests that host factors play an important role in determining the different host-viral interaction of the virus. In addition, biochemical properties of the GSV genome were investigated. The genome size was estimated using pulse-field gel electrophoresis to be 215 - 235 kb. CsCl-EtBr density gradient centrifugation indicated that GSV has a supercoiled, circular genome. Purified viral structural proteins, envelope proteins and glycoproteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and a total 16 of viral structural proteins were identified, three of them are glycosylated and five of these proteins are likely to be virus envelope or matrix components. ^ Studies of GSV specific protein synthesis, DNA replication and transcription in the presence of specific inhibitors suggests that as with other most baculoviruses, GSV gene expression is temporally regulated and can be separated into early and late phases based on viral DNA replication and differential responses to the cellular RNA polymerase inhibitor, alpha-amanitin. That is, early gene expression is likely mediated by cellular RNA polymerase whereas a viral encoded or viral-modified host RNA polymerase likely mediates late viral gene expression. ^ GSV persistent infection in vitro has been investigated using a persistently infected cell line, GSVP.

Among the cell lines that we examined, Hep 3 B cells stably expressing miR 122 (Hep 3 B/miR 122) exhibited a significant enhancement of HCVcc propagation. Surprisingly, the levels of production of infectious particles in Hep 3 B/miR 122 cells upon infection with HCVcc were comparable to those in Huh 7 cells. Furthermore, a line of “cured ” cells, established by elimination of HCV RNA from the Hep 3 B/miR 122 replicon cells, exhibited an enhanced expression of miR 122 and a continuous increase of infectious ti-ters of HCVcc in every passage. The establishment of the new <b>permissive</b> <b>cell</b> line for HCVcc will have significant implications not only for basic HCV research but also for the development of new therapeutics. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects over 170 million people world-wide and frequently leads to persistent infection, which in turn can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellula...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} enhancer for the m+ {{variant of}} echovirus 6 was isolated from uninfected, <b>permissive</b> host <b>cells.</b> The enhancer transferred the susceptibility to virus infection from <b>permissive</b> <b>cells</b> to less susceptible cells. Enhancer activity in cultured, human cells (WISH) {{was released by}} these cells into extracellular fluids at a linear rate. Maximal enhancer activity was recovered from cell monolayers that were extracted with buffered salt solutions (pH 6. 6) for 5 h at 37 C. Crude enhancer preparations contained substances that reduced virus titers in <b>permissive</b> host <b>cells</b> and suppressed some of the enhancer activity. Viral inhibitory activity was removed from cellular extracts by either differential centrifugation or ion exchange chromatography. The enhancer, in contrast to inhibitory substances, remained in supernatant fractions after centrifugation at 110, 000 × g for 4 h and adsorbed to diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex columns. Enhancer preparations that were devoid of inhibitory activity increased the virus titers in less susceptible simian cell cultures (approximately 100 -fold) to the titers attained by fully <b>permissive</b> human <b>cell</b> cultures. A direct relationship between protein concentration and enhancer activity in cellular extracts was demonstrated. Partial purification of the enhancer by differential centrifugation and ammonium sulfate precipitation increased the specific activity of enhancer (units/mg of protein) by 13 -fold...|$|R
40|$|Mononuclear cells {{which were}} {{isolated}} from rheumatoid synovial effusions and cultured without prior separation failed {{to support the}} growth of herpes simplex virus (HSV). However, subpopulations of T lymphocytes separated {{on the basis of}} cell size or receptors for sheep red cells were, in isolation, permissive for this virus. Virus growth in these <b>permissive</b> <b>cells</b> was blocked by cocultivation with the remaining mononuclear cell populations...|$|R

Transformed (HKBK) cell produced BK virus T antigen and induced tumors in hamsters that developed antibodies to BK virus T antigen. BK virus was rescued from HKBK cells by Sendai virus-assisted fusion with <b>permissive</b> <b>cells.</b> One {{out of six}} cell lines derived from HKBK cell-induced tumors showed the same characteristics as HKBK cells...|$|R
