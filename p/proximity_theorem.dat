30|$|First {{we discuss}} the concept of best proximity. Let T:A → B be a map where A and B are two nonempty subsets of a metric space (X, d) and let A and B are {{disjoint}} subsets of a metric space then the equation Tx=x might have no solution. Therefore in case of nonself-maps we {{are not sure about}} the existence of fixed point. In such a case we try to minimize the distance d(x, Tx) and a point x for which d(x, Tx) is minimum is called a best proximity point. In the recent years there have been many interesting best proximity point theorems are proved, for example, see De la Sen et al. (2013), Eldred and Veeramani (2006), Prolla (1983), Reich (1978), and Sankar Raj (2011), Sehgal and Singh (1988).

30|$|The Banach {{contraction}} {{principle is}} one of the most well-known and useful tools in analysis. This principle has been generalized by many authors in many different ways (see [1 – 6]). Recently, Samet et al. [7] introduced the notion of α-ψ-contractive type mappings and proved some fixed point theorems for such mappings within the framework of complete metric spaces. Karapınar and Samet [8] generalized α-ψ-contractive type mappings and obtained some fixed point theorems for generalized α-ψ-contractive type mappings. Some interesting multivalued generalizations of α-ψ-contractive type mappings are available in [9 – 18]. More recently, Jleli and Samet [19] introduced the notion of α-ψ-proximal contractive type mappings and proved certain best proximity point theorems. Many authors have obtained best proximity point theorems and have done so in a variety of settings; see, for example, [19 – 41]. Abkar and Gbeleh [22] and Al-Thagafi and Shahzad [24, 26] investigated best proximity points for multivalued mappings. Recently Ali et al. extended the results of Jleli and Samet [19] for nonself multivalued mappings. The concept of coupled best proximity point theorem was introduced by Sintunavarat and Kumam [36], and they proved the coupled best <b>proximity</b> <b>theorem</b> for cyclic contractions.|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} Lifshitz formula for the Casimir force between {{parallel}} plates we calculate {{the difference between}} the forces at two different settings, one in which the temperature is $T_ 1 = 350 $ K, the other when $T_ 2 = 300 $ K. As material we choose gold, and make use of the Drude dispersion relation. Our results, which are shown graphically, should be directly comparable to experiment. As an analogous calculation based upon the plasma dispersion relation leads to a different theoretical force difference, an experiment of this kind would be a decisive test. We also present an analogous calculation for the case when the two plates are replaced with a sphere-plate system, still with gold as material in both bodies.

We establish basic properties for optimization: a local-to-global optimality criterion, the steepest descend algorithm by successive k-submodular function minimizations, the persistency property, and the <b>proximity</b> <b>theorem.</b> Our theory is motivated by minimum cost free multiflow problem. To this problem, Goldberg and Karzanov gave two combinatorial weakly polynomial time algorithms based on capacity and cost scalings, without explicit running time. As an application of our theory, we present a new simple polynomial proximity scaling algorithm to solve minimum cost free multiflow problem in O(n (n AC) MF(kn, km)) time, where n {{is the number of}} nodes, m is the number of edges, k is the number of terminals, A is the maximum of edge-costs, C is the total sum of edge-capacities, and MF(n',m') denotes the time complexity to find a maximum flow in a network of n' nodes and m' edges. Our algorithm is designed to solve, in the same time complexity, a more general class of multiflow problems, minimum cost node-demand multiflow problem, and is the first combinatorial polynomial time algorithm to this class of problems. We also give an application to network design problem. Comment: 39 pages; Discrete Optimization, to appea...|$|E
40|$|For a {{function}} defined on a convex {{set in a}} Euclidean space, midpoint convexity is the property requiring {{that the value of}} the function at the midpoint of any line segment is not greater than the average of its values at the endpoints of the line segment. Midpoint convexity is a well-known characterization of ordinary convexity under very mild assumptions. For {{a function}} defined on the integer lattice, we consider the analogous notion of discrete midpoint convexity, a discrete version of midpoint convexity where the value of the function at the (possibly noninteger) midpoint is replaced by the average of the function values at the integer round-up and round-down of the midpoint. It is known that discrete midpoint convexity on all line segments with integer endpoints characterizes L^-convexity, and that it characterizes submodularity if we restrict the endpoints of the line segments to be at ℓ_∞-distance one. By considering discrete midpoint convexity for all pairs at ℓ_∞-distance equal to two or not smaller than two, we identify new classes of discrete convex functions, called local and global discrete midpoint convex functions, which are strictly between the classes of L^-convex and integrally convex functions, and are shown to be stable under scaling and addition. Furthermore, a <b>proximity</b> <b>theorem,</b> with the same small proximity bound as that for L^-convex functions, is established for discrete midpoint convex functions. Relevant examples of classes of local and global discrete midpoint convex functions are provided. Comment: Appendix B is adde...|$|E

Our results do not agree with previous predictions like the <b>Proximity</b> <b>theorem</b> approach. The technical and experimental advances associated to the investigation of micro and nano devices has boosted the research on forces acting at such scale, like Casimir and van der Waals (vW) dispersive forces. The origin of dispersive forces between atoms and macroscopic bodies may be attributed to electromagnetic interactions between their charge distributions induced by quantum vacuum fluctuations, even when they are electrically neutral. In a first approximation the charge distribution of neutral particles may be represented by electric dipoles. This dipole approximation was employed by London to calculate the non-retarded van der Waals interaction potential VvW(z) between two identical polarizable molecules by using perturbation theory in quantum mechanics [1]. He found that VvW(z) ∼ −α 2 /z 6, where α is the polarizability of the particles and z is the magnitude of the distance between them. In 1948, Casimir and Polder [2] found a correction to the London-vW force by considering the influence of retardation, where at large distances the potential varies like 1 /z 7, instead of 1 /z 6. Furthermore, they found that the vW interaction could be attributed to the change of the zero-point energy [3], VvW(z) = E(z) − E(z → ∞) =...|$|E
