40|$|Many {{species of}} migratory birds migrate {{in a series}} of solitary nocturnal flights. Between flights, they stop to rest and refuel for the next segment of their journey. The {{mechanism}} controlling this behaviour has long remained elusive. Here, we show that wild-caught migratory redstarts (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) are consistent in their flight scheduling. An advanced videographic system enabled us to determine the precise timing of flight activity in redstarts caught at a northern European stopover site during their return trip from Africa. Birds were held captive for three days in the absence of photoperiodic cues (constant dim light) and under <b>permanent</b> food <b>availability.</b> Despite the absence of external temporal cues, birds showed clear bimodal activity patterns: intense nocturnal activity alternating with diurnal foraging and resting periods. The onset of their migratory activity coincided with the time of local sunset and was individually consistent on consecutive nights. The data demonstrate that night-migrating birds are driven by autonomous circadian clocks entrained by sunset cues. This timekeeping system is probably the key factor in the overall control of nocturnal songbird migration...|$|R

The results show that the tree species (Cupressus sp., Olea europaea; Quercus sp. and Platanus hyspanica) react differently to situations of water stress and changeable temperatures than herbaceous species (Urticaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae species and Artemisia sp.).

Daily satellite products (L 3 JRC) of burned areas from the SPOT Vegetation sensor at a moderate spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km between 2000 and 2007 were analyzed over the West African savannah in this paper. Results from seasonal analysis revealed a large increase in burned areas from November to February, with consistent peaks in December at the regional scale. In addition, about 30 % of the pixels are burned {{at least four times}} within the 7 -year period. Positive correlations were found between burned areas and rainfall values obtained from the TRMM satellite over savannahs located above 8 ¬∞ N, meaning that a wet rainfall season over these regions was favorable to biomass availability in the next dry season and therefore may induce an increase in burned areas in this region. Moreover, our results showed a nonlinear relationship between the large-scale climatic indexes SOI, MEI, NAO and SSTG and burned-area anomalies. Positive (negative) correlations between burned areas and SOI (MEI) were consistent over the Sahel and Sudano-Sahelian areas. Negative correlations with Atlantic SSTG were significant over the Guinea subregion. Correlations between burned areas over Sudano-Guinean subregion and all the large-scale indexes were weak and may be {{explained by the fact that}} this subregion had a mean rainfall greater than 800 mm yr ‚àí 1 with <b>permanent</b> biomass <b>availability</b> and an optimal amount of soil moisture favorable to fire practice irrespective of the climate conditions.

Bats predominantly utilised water sources, rock outcrops, dune/swale areas near woodland, dry creek lines and coolibah woodland habitats. However, they rarely used open habitats (open plain and dune/swale), acacia scrub and gidgee woodland. The bats foraged most often over water and on calmer nights, when insects were more active. Although highly active over water in some areas, bats may survive in the Simpson Desert without access to <b>permanent</b> water. Food <b>availability</b> in terms of flying insect abundance and biomass did not appear to significantly determine the use of different habitats.

40|$|M. Sc. Boreholes in the Kruger National Park (KNP) was {{at first}} {{developed}} {{to increase the number}} of animals that were at low densities because of poaching, diseases, fencing and low <b>permanent</b> water <b>availability.</b> This development of artificial waterholes without managerial measures or knowledge of possible consequence led to negative impacts on the environment. These included that the higher concentration of herbivores around artificial waterholes led to a change in vegetation; secondary vegetation growth did not support the feeding habits of water dependent species; the infiltration rate of water in the soil surrounding waterholes changed and animal distribution patterns also changed, in turn changing the predatory base. Due to the above the KNP developed a new water policy. The policy states that all artificial waterholes that are open should be part of natural ecosystem principles. This led to the closure of many artificial waterholes that did not conform to the requirements of the new water policy. This study aimed to determine the ecological implications of artificial waterholes and whether tourism will be affected by the closure of these artificial waterholes. The following two hypothesis were thus tested in this project: i) Artificial waterholes have ecological implications on the environment. ii) The closure of artificial waterholes will have a negative response from tourists and thus affect tourism to the KNP. The results from this project indicated that both these hypothesises can be accepted as the available literature clearly showed that artificial waterholes do have a negative impact on the environment and that the majority of the tourist questioned asked for the waterholes to be opened again. The latter reaction was mainly due to the tourist‚Äüs concern that the animals will suffer and die without water. Furthermore the visitors are concerned they won‚Äüt see animals anymore. This result can partly be due to the low awareness of the visitors on the subject. No effort was made to communicate these decisions, and the reasons it‚Äüs based on, to the public. Although a certain number of artificial waterholes were closed according to the new KNP policy, it is still important to keep a number open due to fact that KNP is not a natural system. It is suggested however that the closure of the artificial waterholes take place differently, following a principle of rotational opening and closing of patches of waterholes to allow recovery of vegetation and facilitate migration between waterholes...|$|R

The market climate may already be too hostile to support this industry‚Äôs desire for a renewal of consumers‚Äô acceptance of the physical product, here the Blu-ray disc, and to create new market opportunities in the struggle against the industry‚Äôs potential obsolescence (Harrigan et al. 1983). Despite strong efforts of promotion and powerful market approaches, the Blu-ray disc could not find inroads to markets yet making this format sustainably successful. Evidence is that after a short period of time, Blu-ray discs‚Äô available manufacturing capacities outperform consumers‚Äô demand by > 30...|$|R

Microorganisms have also been found {{in some of the}} most extreme environments. They have been found to exist in ice, boiling water, acid, salt crystals, toxic waste and even in the water cores of nuclear reactors (Rothschild and Mancinelli, 2001). Antarctic subglacial lake ecosystems have the potential to be one of the most extreme environments on Earth, with combined stresses of high pressure, low temperature, <b>permanent</b> darkness, low-nutrient <b>availability</b> and oxygen concentrations derived from the ice that provided the original meltwater (Siegert et al., 2003), where the predominant mode of nutrition is likely to be chemoautotrophic. Yet, to date, the identification of significant subglacial bacterial activity in the Arctic, beneath glaciers (Skidmore et al., 2000, 2005) and in subglacial lakes (Gaidos et al., 2004), as well as extensive work on permafrost communities and work in the deep sea, suggests that life can survive and potentially thrive in these types of environment. Microbial {{life has been}} shown to function at gigapascal pressures (Sharma et al., 2002) and bacteria recovered from the deep ocean at around 4000 [*]m have been shown to retain both structural integrity and metabolic activity. They have shown activity in the Antarctic at ‚àí 17 [*]¬∞C (Carpenter et al., 2000) and to exist in the pore spaces between ice crystals (Thomas and Dieckmann, 2002) ...|$|R
