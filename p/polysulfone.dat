25|$|One {{approach}} by C. van den Berg et al. {{focuses on the}} use of impregnated particles for in situ recovery of phenol from Pseudomonas putida fermentations using ionic liquids. Further development led to the use of high capacity <b>polysulfone</b> capsules. These capsules are basically hollow particles surrounded by a membrane. The interior is completely filled with extractant and thus increases the impregnation capacity as compared to classical SIRs.|$|E
25|$|Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), {{some other}} plastic {{materials}} {{may be used}} as the dielectric in film capacitors. Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Siloxane, <b>Polysulfone</b> (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.|$|E

50|$|<b>Polysulfones</b> are {{a family}} of {{thermoplastic}} polymers. These polymers {{are known for their}} toughness and stability at high temperatures. They contain the subunit aryl-SO2-aryl, the defining feature of which is the sulfone group. <b>Polysulfones</b> were introduced in 1965 by Union Carbide. Due to the high cost of raw materials and processing, <b>polysulfones</b> are used in specialty applications and often are a superior replacement for polycarbonates.|$|R
50|$|The <b>polysulfones</b> can be {{prepared}} by reacting olefins, notably alpha-olefins, with sulfur dioxide. The polyamines can {{be prepared}} by reacting epichlorohydrin with aliphatic monoamines.|$|R
2500|$|Capacitors {{made with}} {{any type of}} {{dielectric}} material show some level of [...] "dielectric absorption" [...] or [...] "soakage". On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it, after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric. This effect is objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits. The level of absorption depends on many factors, from design considerations to charging time, since the absorption is a time-dependent process. However, the primary factor {{is the type of}} dielectric material. Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or <b>polysulfone</b> film exhibit relatively high absorption, while polystyrene or Teflon allow very small levels of absorption. In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist, such as in flashtubes, television sets, and defibrillators, the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged. Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous, while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal. A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20% of its original charge {{over a period of several}} minutes, allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous.|$|E

These polymers are also used in the automotive and electronic industries. Filter cartridges made from <b>polysulfone</b> membranes offer extremely high flow rates at very low differential pressures when compared with nylon or polypropylene media. Additionally, filter cartridges made from <b>polysulfone</b> can be sterilized with in-line steam or in the autoclave without loss of integrity up to 50 times.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAs {{a part of}} {{research}} work to elaborate polymeric materials for metal corrosion protection, we have developed a new family of phosphonic acid-containing polymers. The synthesis and the characterization of <b>polysulfones</b> bearing alkyl phosphonate ester side groups are first described. These polymers are synthesized by direct polycondensation of a phosphonate ester-containing bisphenol by aromatic nucleophilic substitution. The physicochemical properties of the resulting polymers are described. Acidic hydrolysis of phosphonate esters results {{in the formation of}} phosphonic acid groups. A series of phosphonic acid-containing <b>polysulfones</b> is therefore obtained and characterized. A preliminary evaluation of the anticorrosive properties of these polymers is described. In 0. 25 M Na 2 SO 4 solution, the corrosion rate of a polymer-coated mild steel sample is much lower than of the free metal substrate. These results suggest that phosphonic acid-containing <b>polysulfones</b> might be interesting as anticorrosive coatings...|$|R
40|$|Aromatic <b>polysulfones</b> {{containing}} functional {{groups were}} prepared by two synthetic approaches: by copolymerization of a carboxyl containing bisphenol monomer, or by chemical modification of <b>polysulfones.</b> A bisphenol 50 with a pendant fluorene ring was prepared by acid catalyzed phenol condensation of 9 -fluorenone- 4 -carboxylic acid 53. Ionomeric polymers 56 and 57 {{were obtained by}} copolymerization of the alkali metal salts of bisphenol 50 and 0 - 50 % of Bisphenol-A with a 4 - 4 '-dihalodiphenylsulfone. The polymers are hydrophilic and have high thermal stabilities and glass transition temperatures. Polymers containing a diversity of functional groups were obtained by direct metalation of Udel 1 or Radel 2 <b>polysulfones.</b> Using organo-lithium metalating agents, the site of lithiation (Figure 6) was exclusively ortho- to the directing sulfone group. A maximum of three lithium atoms per repeat unit could {{be placed on the}} polymer chain without degredation. The reaction of electrophiles with the reactive metalated polymer intermediates led to polymers with alkyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, silyl, halogen and other functional groups. Halogenated polymers 86, 89, and 90 were also prepared by halogenation of <b>polysulfones</b> without a catalyst. The site of halogenation was ortho- to the ether linkages in the bisphenol unit and this underwent metal-halogen exhange preferentially over the site of direct metalation.

40|$|Lithiation {{chemistry}} {{is an extremely}} effective method for modifying <b>polysulfones.</b> <b>Polysulfones</b> (PSf) are activated rapidly and quantitatively with a lithiating reagent. Lithiated intermediates are converted to {{a wide array of}} functional group types by addition of suitable electrophiles. The scope and versatility of this {{chemistry is}} outlined in this paper. Functional groups in <b>polysulfones</b> tailor membrane properties, while the inherent stability of the polymer backbone is retained. In ultrafiltration (UF), hydrophilic groups can enhance water flux, reduce pore size, and have the potential for decreased fouling. Similarly, hydrophilic groups enable chlorine resistant PSf to be used in nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO). Gas separation membranes are highly material dependent, and significant changes in solubility selectivity, fractional free volume, and chain rigidity are possible through appropriate choice and site of functional group. Reactive groups provide attachment sites and crosslinking capability to membranes. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
