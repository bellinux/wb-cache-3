5|$|In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the Institute of <b>Planetology</b> and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} CFBDSIR 2149-0403; an independently moving 4-7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the AB Doradus moving group, less than 100 light years from Earth.

500|$|On 22 August {{the draft}} {{proposal}} was rewritten with two changes {{from the previous}} draft. The first was a generalisation {{of the name of}} the new class of planets (previously the draft resolution had explicitly opted for the term 'pluton'), with a decision on the name to be used postponed. [...] Many geologists had been critical of the choice of name for Pluto-like planets, being concerned about the term pluton which has been used for years within the geological community to represent a form of magmatic intrusion; such formations are fairly common balls of rock. Confusion was thought undesirable due to the status of <b>planetology</b> as a field closely allied to geology. Further concerns surrounded use of the word pluton as in major languages such as French and Spanish, Pluto is itself called Pluton, potentially adding to confusion.|$|E
