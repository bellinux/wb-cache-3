40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} {{for the detection}} of clickbait posts in online social media (OSM). Clickbait posts are short catchy phrases that attract a user's attention to click to an article. The approach is based on a machine learning (ML) classifier capable of distinguishing between clickbait and legitimate posts published in OSM. The suggested classifier is based on a variety of features, including image related features, linguistic analysis, and methods for abuser detection. In order to evaluate our method, we used two datasets provided by Clickbait Challenge 2017. The best performance obtained by the ML classifier was an AUC of 0. 8, an accuracy of 0. 812, precision of 0. 819, and recall of 0. 966. In addition, as opposed to previous studies, we found that clickbait <b>post</b> <b>titles</b> are statistically significant shorter than legitimate <b>post</b> <b>titles.</b> Finally, we found that counting the number of formal English words in the given content is useful for clickbait detection...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation: A BIOGRAPHICAL INTERPRETATION OF WOMEN'S JOURNEYS THROUGH ATHLETIC LEADERSHIP: PRE AND <b>POST</b> <b>TITLE</b> IX LEGISLATION Marlene Louise Kelly, Doctor of Philosophy, 2004 Dissertation Directed by: Dr. Francine H. Hultgren Education Policy and Leadership This study {{explores the}} life {{experiences}} of four women athletic leaders, in four Decades (1960 s- 1990 s), as they traveled through careers in athletic leadership, pre and <b>post</b> <b>Title</b> IX passage, in 1972. The study covers {{the lives of}} these women from childhood to their adult years. Through the methodology of interpretive biography, the research investigates {{the lives of these}} four women coaches to bring to light the experiential and societal issues that have impacted their journeys. A narrative based on individual conversations with each participant and written reflections of the researcher provides insight into these women's coaching experiences. Denzin's methodology for in interpretive biography served as the framework for the study. The use of personal histories, as the basis for research in order to share and extend knowledge, is the keystone of this methodology. The major themes that come through in the life stories are centered around the support of family, the importance of role models, the impact of training, the ability to develop a personal philosophy of coaching, the importance of mentoring, and the coping skills that these women use to handle the stress. Although the journeys of these four women are varied, these characteristics were interwoven in each of their stories. Implications and recommendations for future women coaches entering the athletic leadership field center around the process of leadership development, rather than just the end result of being a coach. Women coaches need to be supported in their developmental years. Successful women coaches need {{to be a role model}} for novice coaches and mentor them through the life long journey. Extensive training and knowledge develops confidence in novice coaches and supports their goal to be successful. Although Title IX was the time anchor for this study, the last thirty years have not made the journey for women in athletics an easier course to travel. Obstacles remain the same, and challenges still require individual solutions. Additional studies on gender differences in coaching and coaching philosophy are recommended...|$|E

40|$|Categories and Subject Descriptors Web forums {{have become}} an {{important}} data resource for many web applications, but extracting structured data from unstructured web forum pages is still a challenging task due to both complex page layout designs and unrestricted user created posts. In this paper, we study the problem of structured data extraction from various web forum sites. Our target {{is to find a}} solution as general as possible to extract structured data, such as <b>post</b> <b>title,</b> post author, post time, and post content from any forum site. In contrast to most existing information extraction methods, which only leverage the knowledge inside an individual page, we incorporate both page-level and site-level knowledge and employ Markov logic networks (MLNs) to effectively integrate all useful evidence by learning their importance automatically. Site-level knowledge includes (1) the linkages among different object pages, such as list pages and post pages, and (2) the interrelationships of pages belonging to the same object. The experimental results on 20 forums show a very encouraging information extraction performance, and demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach on various forums. We also show that the performance is limited if only page-level knowledge is used, while when incorporating the site-level knowledge both precision and recall can be significantly improved...|$|E
40|$|Two {{thousand}} and twelve marked the fortieth anniversary of Title IX {{and the first}} Summer Olympic Games in which all attending nations sent female competitors. Too often, scholars of sport history conservatively frame the experiences of girls and women within a narrative of progress. College women 2 ̆ 7 s sport participation in particular is framed as a linear narrative beginning with the 2 ̆ 2 new woman 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 foray in college physical training, the non-competitive interwar coed, and the <b>post</b> <b>Title</b> IX female athlete. It is within this narrative that the college play day, a sport practice emerging in California and Washington in 1926 began to gain momentum as an additional form of extramural competition for college women. In this dissertation I interrogate which historical and societal forces contributed to the invention, diffusion, and evolution of the college play day. Though the play day is briefly included in descriptive narratives about women 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity and sport during the interwar era, deeper explorations are absent. This study aims to further elucidate the extent and variety of forms that the play day took. I aim to explore its general value within the college setting and its reception among women physical educators, colleagues, and play day participants. An additional research question I pose is what are the roles and contributions of certain individuals, alliances, and organizations involved in the invention, adoption, and evolutions of the college play day? Last, I question {{whether or not the}} play day is a site in which gender relations or other intersecting relations of power were reproduced, constructed, or transformed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} BlogBuster, a {{tool for}} extracting a corpus from the blogosphere. The topic of cleaning arbitrary web pages {{with the goal of}} extracting a corpus from web data, suitable for linguistic and language technology research and development, has attracted significant research interest recently. Several general purpose approaches for removing boilerplate have been presented in the literature; however the blogosphere poses additional requirements, such as a finer control over the extracted textual segments in order to accurately identify important elements, i. e. individual blog <b>posts,</b> <b>titles,</b> <b>posting</b> dates or comments. BlogBuster tries to provide such additional details along with boilerplate removal, following a rule-based approach. A small set of rules were manually constructed by observing a limited set of blogs from the Blogger and Wordpress hosting platforms. These rules operate on the DOM tree of an HTML page, as constructed by a popular browser, Mozilla Firefox. Evaluation results suggest that BlogBuster is very accurate when extracting corpora from blogs hosted in the Blogger and Wordpress, while exhibiting a reasonable precision when applied to blogs not hosted in these two popular blogging platforms...|$|R
