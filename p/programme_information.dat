25|$|Because the BBC {{had become}} both a {{monopoly}} and a non-commercial entity, it soon faced controversial competition from British subjects who were operating leased transmitters {{on the continent}} of Europe before World War II, to blast commercial radio programmes into the United Kingdom. John Reith who had been given powers to dictate the cultural output of the BBC retaliated by leading the opposition to these commercial stations. Controversy spilled over into the press when the British government attempted to censor the printing of their <b>programme</b> <b>information.</b> The pressure {{was created by the}} success of these stations. By 1938 it was reported that on Sundays 80% of the British audience was tuning into commercial radio, rather than the non-commercial BBC.|$|E
