50|$|It is a brood {{parasite}} to the green-winged pytilia. Male long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydahs</b> {{imitate the}} song of the male green-winged pytilia. The whydah chicks are larger and louder than the host chicks, so the foster parents will give them more attention than their own chicks.|$|R
5000|$|All are obligate brood parasites, {{which lay}} their eggs in the nests of estrildid finch species; most indigobirds use firefinches as hosts, whereas the <b>paradise</b> <b>whydahs</b> chose pytilias. Unlike the cuckoos and honeyguides, the indigobirds and whydahs do not destroy the host's eggs. Typically, they lay 2 - 4 eggs in with those already present. The eggs of both the host and the victim are white, {{although}} the indigobird's are slightly larger. Many of the indigo-plumaged species named [...] "indigobirds" [...] are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. The best guide is often the estrildid finch {{with which they are}} associating, since each indigobird parasitises a different host species. For example, the village indigobird is usually found with red-billed firefinches. Indigobirds and whydahs imitate their host's song, which the males learn in the nest. Although females do not sing, they also learn to recognise the song, and choose males with the same song, thus perpetuating the link between each species of indigobird and firefinch. The nestling indigobirds mimic the unique gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species.|$|R

50|$|Chapin {{described}} the broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> as Steganura aucupum obtusa from Luchenza in 1922. Previously, Vidua obtusa, V. interjecta, V. orientalis, V. paradisaea and V. togoensis {{were considered to}} be in the same species, and these five species are sometimes placed in the genus Steganura. The broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> is a monotypic species.|$|E
5000|$|The broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> is a brood parasite, {{its host}} being the orange-winged pytilia (Pytilia afra). The host species only weighs 14 - 15 g {{and is thus}} at a disadvantage. It mimics the host species's call. It feeds {{on the ground in}} small flocks, eating seeds. When the broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> is not breeding, it may mix with the long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah.</b> Breeding plumage has been {{observed}} from February to July in the southeastern Congo Basin. The eggs are white, weighing approximately 1.6 g. Newborn chicks have loose greyish down, very similar to chicks of the orange-winged pytilia. The incubation period and nestling period are unknown. Irruptions can occur; in 1994, an [...] "invasion" [...] of thousands of whydahs was reported in Kasane, Botswana.|$|E
50|$|Widespread {{throughout}} its large range, the long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
50|$|The long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> or eastern <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> (Vidua paradisaea) is a {{small brown}} sparrow-like bird of Eastern Africa, from eastern South Sudan to {{southern}} Angola. During the breeding season the male moults into breeding plumage that consists of a black head and back, rusty brown breast, bright yellow nape, and buffy white abdomen with broad, elongated black tail feathers up to 36 cm long (approximately three times the length of its body). Males and females are almost indistinguishable outside of the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|The Togo <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> (Vidua togoensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Viduidae.It is found in Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Togo.|$|E
50|$|The broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> (Vidua obtusa) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Viduidae. It is found {{woodland}} and acacia savanna habitat in Sub-Saharan Africa from Angola to Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique. A brood parasite, it has a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being of least concern.|$|E
50|$|Vidua orientalis {{has often}} been {{considered}} a subspecies of eastern <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah,</b> Vidua paradisea, since both birds parasitise the green-winged pytilia, Pytilia melba, a common species of estrildid finch. However, the finch has two subspecies, nominate melba and citerior, which are sometimes treated as separate species. The ranges of these two taxa correspond well to those of V.paradisea and V. orientalis.|$|E
50|$|This whydah {{is found}} in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with an {{estimated}} distribution size of 5060000 km2. Approximately half of the range overlaps with {{the range of the}} long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah.</b> The broad-tailed paradise whydah's habitat is woodlands, including miombo and Baikiaea plurijuga woodland, and also acacia savannas.|$|E

50|$|The Sahel <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> {{does not}} build its own nests, but parasitises the green-winged pytilia, Pytilia melba, a common species of estrildid finch. These birds do not destroy the host green-winged pytilia's eggs, but they deposit their own {{eggs in the}} nests of their hosts, adding them to those already present. As in other whydah species to attract hens the songs of the males mimic the song of their hosts. These birds are not monogamous pairs, in fact males breed with many females. In a {{breeding}} season females may lay about 22 eggs, that hatch after 12-13 days of incubation. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.|$|E
50|$|The orange-winged pytilia {{is found}} in small flocks, and can form larger, looser flocks {{when it is not}} breeding. It feeds on the ground, eating seeds and {{probably}} also insects. In the non-breeding season, it can move great distances to find food. Its call is seee, and its song is quickly repeated whistles. The orange-winged pytilia is parasitised by the broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah,</b> which mimics its call. The orange-winged pytilia's breeding season is April to May in the southeastern Congo Basin, January to May in Zambia and Zimbabwe, March to June in Malawi, and April to June in Tanzania. The eggs weigh approximately 1.42 g, and those of the brood parasite weigh about 15% more, at 1.64 g. The pytilia's incubation period is 12 to 13 days, and the nestling period is 21 days.|$|E
5000|$|There are [...] "69 {{species of}} mammal, 327 species of birds, 7 species of reptile, 493 {{species of plants}} and 92 species of fish". Planning for the {{conservation}} and management of wildlife in Gambela Park was focused on protecting three endangered species: the African elephant, Nile lechwe and shoebill stork. Among the mammal species reported to be living here are the Cape buffalo, Masai lion, leopard, Sudan cheetah, Nubian giraffe, roan antelope, tiang, Lelwel hartebeest, olive baboon, and guereza monkey, as well as hyena, buffalo, sable antelope, hippopotamus, Kafue lechwe, zebra, greater kudu, bushbuck, oribi, reedbuck and waterbuck. The peak of the annual antelope migration occurs from January to March. Several birds only found in this area include the long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> and the red-throated and green bee-eaters.|$|E
