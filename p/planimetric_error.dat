40|$|ABSTRACT: The main {{topics of}} this paper {{concerns}} two aspects of our participation at the CNES-ISPRS experiment on SPOT 5 -HRS-DSM extraction and validation. Our area of interest, the area of Liège located in eastern Belgium, is a moderate hilly zone characterized by a heterogeneous land-cover. We discuss firstly the {{each step of the}} DSM extraction procedure and then some particular results of its validation subdivided in two parts. The first validation approach concerns of the computed height and the second one is the structural quality assessment. The accuracy of the computed DSM is ~- 14 m and doesn’t show any spatial trend. When the slope is steeper than 25 °, a relationship between accuracy and aspect is put in evidence. This is probably due to the effect of the <b>planimetric</b> <b>error</b> on the height accuracy. The precision of the computed DSM varies between 9 and 12 m in function of land-cover characteristics. Surprisingly, it is higher for ground level points than for points corresponding to man-made objects. The principles and some preliminary results of the second validation approach are exposed but it is still in development. These results must than be handled with care. Nevertheless, the concept of structural validation of DSM’s is an important and promising aspect of DSM’s quality assessment. ...|$|E
40|$|Airborne laser {{altimetry}} {{has the potential}} to make frequent detailed observations that are important for many aspects of studying land surface processes. However, the uncertainties inherent in airborne {{laser altimetry}} data have rarely been well measured. Uncertainty is often specified as generally as 20 cm in elevation, and 40 cm planimetric. To better constrain these uncertainties, we present an analysis of several datasets acquired specifically to study the temporal consistency of laser altimetry data, and thus assess its operational value. The error budget has three main components, each with a time regime. For measurements acquired less than 50 ms apart, elevations have a local standard deviation in height of 3. 5 cm, enabling the local measurement of surface roughness of the order of 5 cm. Points acquired seconds apart acquire an additional random error due to Differential Geographic Positioning System (DGPS) fluctuation. Measurements made up to an hour apart show an elevation drift of 7 cm over a half hour. Over months, this drift gives rise to a random elevation offset between swathes, with an average of 6. 4 cm. The RMS <b>planimetric</b> <b>error</b> in point location was derived as 37. 4 cm. We conclude by considering the consequences of these uncertainties on the principle application of laser altimetry in the UK, intertidal zone monitoring...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of various mobile laser scanning systems was tested on an established urban test field. The test {{was connected to}} the European Spatial Data Research (EuroSDR) project “Mobile Mapping—Road Environment Mapping Using Mobile Laser Scanning”. Several commercial and research systems collected laser point cloud data on the same test field. The system comparisons focused on <b>planimetric</b> and elevation <b>errors</b> using a filtered digital elevation model, poles, and building corners as the reference objects. The results revealed the high quality of the point clouds generated by all of the tested systems under good GNSS conditions. With all professional systems properly calibrated, the elevation accuracy was better than 3. 5 cm up to a range of 35 m. The best system achieved a planimetric accuracy of 2. 5 cm over a range of 45 m. The <b>planimetric</b> <b>errors</b> increased as a function of range, but moderately so if the system was properly calibrated. The main focus on mobile laser scanning development in the near future should be on the improvement of the trajectory solution, especially under non-ideal conditions, using both improvements in hardware and software.

In the experiment, the true-ortho from the large-format aerial images with known exterior orientation were used to check the planimetric accuracy of LIDAR data in two proposed approaches. First analysis was carried out by comparison the position of the selected points identifiable on true-ortho from aerial images with corresponding points in the raster of reflection intensity reflection.

Specifically, with an RMS error of 0. 284 ft (8. 7 cm) in Northing, and 0. 255 ft (7. 8 cm) in Easting. The average over-all vertical (height) error is 0. 003 ft (0. 1 cm) with a 0. 108 ft (3. 3 cm) RMS error. Lidar recognizable control (2 m x 2 m chevrons) was spaced at approximately 200 m parallel to {{the direction of the}} axis of the project corridor, and at 60 m sideway intervals. The project corridor was about 6 km long. Least Squares Image matching software was developed. The internal accuracy proved to be 0. 027 ft (8 mm). The strip width was approximately 111 m and overlap between the Lidar strips changes from 55 to 90 m sideways. Each flight line was flown twice in opposite directions showing 55 % overlap in two strips and 75 % in other two. The overall conclusion about the usage of Lidar aerial surveys for corridor mapping projects is that this technique is an efficient, cost cutting alternative to classical terrestrial and aerial survey techniques. However, at this point of the research it is felt that that the design of the LiDAR control plays a critical role {{to the success of the}} deployment of aerial LiDAR surveys. Augmentation of ground-based LiDAR and classical surveys proves necessary because of shielding of the airborne laser signals (e. g. underpasses).

40|$|Structure-from-motion (SfM) {{algorithms}} greatly {{facilitate the}} production of detailed topographic models from photographs collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the survey quality achieved in published geomorphological studies is highly variable, and sufficient processing details are never provided to understand fully the causes of variability. To address this, we show how survey quality and consistency can be improved through a deeper consideration of the underlying photogrammetric methods. We demonstrate the sensitivity of digital elevation models (DEMs) to processing settings {{that have not been}} discussed in the geomorphological literature, yet are a critical part of survey georeferencing, and are responsible for balancing the contributions of tie and control points. We provide a Monte Carlo approach to enable geomorphologists to (1) carefully consider sources of survey error and hence increase the accuracy of SfM-based DEMs and (2) minimise the associated field effort by robust determination of suitable lower-density deployments of ground control. By identifying appropriate processing settings and highlighting photogrammetric issues such as over-parameterisation during camera self-calibration, processing artefacts are reduced and the spatial variability of error minimised. We demonstrate such DEM improvements with a commonly-used SfM-based software (PhotoScan), which we augment with semi-automated and automated identification of ground control points (GCPs) in images, and apply to two contrasting case studies – an erosion gully survey (Taroudant, Morocco) and an active landslide survey (Super-Sauze, France). In the gully survey, refined processing settings eliminated step-like artefacts of up to ~ 50 mm in amplitude, and overall DEM variability with GCP selection improved from 37 to 16 mm. In the much more challenging landslide case study, our processing halved <b>planimetric</b> <b>error</b> to ~ 0. 1 m, effectively doubling the frequency at which changes in landslide velocity could be detected. In both case studies, the Monte Carlo approach provided a robust demonstration that field effort could by substantially reduced by only deploying approximately half the number of GCPs, with minimal effect on the survey quality. To reduce processing artefacts and promote confidence in SfM-based geomorphological surveys, published results should include processing details which include the image residuals for both tie points and GCPs, and ensure that these are considered appropriately within the workflow...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the estimation of}} planimetric precision of laser scanning data. Due to the nearly random distribution of the points hit by the laser, {{it is difficult to}} use the very standard technique of measuring the same points with the instrument under investigation and with another one, whose performances are well known and better than those expected from the former. A new approach is necessary and ours is based on surfaces, rather than points; we measure flat and slope surfaces previously acquired with laser scanning, with very accurate ground surveying methods; we use their equations to validate the laser points inside. Flat surfaces are used for the altimetric error estimation, while slope ones are used for the estimation of the planimetric accuracy. Indeed when the terrain is not flat, it could be said that the <b>planimetric</b> <b>errors</b> affect altimetric precision of the points measured by the laser scanner; we will show exactly what this means; we will also show that this behaviour can be exploited to estimate planimetric precision, provided that the shape, position and attitude of some ramps is known.

40|$|The {{real time}} {{positioning}} techniques {{rely on the}} fact that errors in the reference station are, inits great majority, the same ones found in the rover station. However, while the distance between stations is increased, the errors which were analogous before become more and more uncorrelationed. Because of this process, there is a progressive degeneration in position fix. The main objective of this work is fundamented in studying the positioning accuracy for DGPS and RTK techniques. The main difference among these techniques refers to GPS observation. The DGPS technique applies the pseudoranges and in the RTK technique uses carrier phase for your solutions. Aiming to accomplish this objective ten test stations have been chosen, with baseline lengths varying from 0, 2 to 29 Km. It was not possible, using results obtained in this research, to determine the spatial correlation value for DGPS and RTK techniques. However, it has been found that for these baselines, DGPS made <b>planimetric</b> <b>errors</b> smaller than 2, 5 m possible, while errors using the RTK technique were smaller than 7 cm.

40|$|The {{employment}} of mass market receivers in a differential mode {{is not a}} standard procedure, especially into a network for NRTK positioning. This is because only few mass market receivers are able to yield raw data as output, almost no one accepts differential corrections, and for many applications is sufficient the WAAS augmentation. In actual fact, the improvements {{that can lead to}} the establishment of a network of CORSs (Continuous Operating Reference Stations) can be much higher with regard to these receivers, on condition that the raw data (code or carrier phase measurements) are used with special precautions. These receivers are very often used for the purpose of infomobility, but can also be used for precise farming. In this chapter, attention is focused on the quality control of GNSS positioning in real time. The goal is to show how networks using NRTK (Network Real Time Kinematic) positioning for different inter-station distances may also be useful in a real-time approach. The objective is to show how CORSs networks are useful for mass-market receivers, considering the accuracy required for the purposes described above. The accuracy of real-time positioning depends mainly on the type of receiver (whether it is single frequency or low-cost) and antenna (whether it is patch, mass-market or geodetic) used, as well as also the size of the network dimension (Dabove et al., 2011). Numerous experiments have been carried out on different types of networks and differential corrections, so we would like to show the results of such tests for the quality control of real-time positioning. Excellent results are also been obtained with regard to two mass-market receivers and two antennas settled on the roof of a vehicle. The purpose of these experiments was not to determine the direction of the vehicle, but to constrain the ‘network' and, simultaneously, to filter the outliers. Particular attention has been devoted to the increasing the quality of the positioning of a C/A-code receiver in real time, and to analyzing and investigating the innovative methods tested by the authors that involve the indicators provided by the rover itself, such as the signal to noise ratio (S/N) and the redundancy of the observations. The experiments were conducted by splitting a single frequency antenna (Garmin) to both the receiver uBlox 6 T and the geodetic receiver (Leica 1200), using the VRS correction and the differential correction of the Nearest station (about 20 km far away). With regard to the VRS correction, the correct fixing of the ambiguity phase is more than 60 % of the trajectory and there were no false fixes. In such cases, the maximum <b>planimetric</b> <b>error</b> is less than 5 cm. Considering the positioning obtained by using float ambiguity (about 40 %) the errors can be tightly controlled within the previously established parameters (S/N and HDOP). In this way, at least 50 % of the trajectory has a maximum error of less than 20 cm. Using the Nearest correction, we have obtained a smaller quantity of integer ambiguity fix and, in this case, it is therefore possible to control the quality of the positioning using the HDOP and S/N parameter...|$|E

Measurements with Toposys Falcon airborne laser scanner were arranged in May 2003 in Espoo, Southern Finland. A 5 km 2 test area, consisting of urban settlements and forests, {{were collected from}} the altitude of 400 m resulting in measurement density of about 10 points per square metre. One 4 km long and about 100 m wide strip was collected five times allowing {{the analysis of the}} repeatability of the laser scanning. One strip was used as a reference and inter-strip comparisons were made. Point wise comparison methods were also used to characterize the differences. Additionally, target models were compared against each other. Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS and also tachymeter measurements were used as ground reference. Extraction of building vectors from laser scanner data was performed using interactive methods implemented in the TerraScan software. The accuracy of the vectorization is also reported. Mean height errors for elevation points were – 2 to 1 cm and standard deviations were mainly ± 3 - 4 cm. In planimetry, mean errors of the centre points of the buildings were less than 30 cm for the first and also for the last pulse data when compared with the buildings on the map. The standard deviations varied between ± 11 - 28 cm (first pulse) and ± 14 - 18 cm (last pulse) for extracted buildings using repeated observations. Mean errors were between 3 - 8 cm and standard deviations ± 3 - 6 cm using last pulse data of repeated observations and extracted ridge information.

40|$|Further {{reproduction}} or electronic {{distribution is}} not permitted. <b>Planimetric</b> positional <b>error</b> limits {{the accuracy of}} landscape change measurements based on features interpreted from high spatial resolution imagery (1 m), and this limitation depends on {{the magnitude of the}} positional error, the spatial heterogeneity of landscapes, and the spatial extent of the change detection window (the change detection resolution). For this reason, accuracy assessments of change measurements from feature-based approaches require careful evaluation of the impacts of positional errors across land-scapes differing in spatial heterogeneity at different change detection resolutions. We quantified such impacts by computing the false changes produced by spatially shifting and comparing high-resolution ecological maps derived by feature interpretation and ground interpretation of 1 m resolution Ikonos imagery of rural China and 0. 3 m resolu-tion aerial photographs of suburban United States. Change detection error increased significantly as positional errors increased, as landscape heterogeneity increased, and as the change detection resolution became finer. Regression-derived relationships between change estimation error and positional error, change detection resolution, and landscape hetero-geneity allow calculation of the minimum change detection window size at which it is possible to obtain change meas-urements of a specified accuracy given any set of feature-based ecological maps and their positional error. Prediction of this “optimal change detection resolution ” is critical in producing reliable high-resolution change measurements from feature-based ecological maps...|$|R

The time delay between the reception of the direct and reflected signals gives access to the altitude of the re-ceiver over the reflecting surface. The field of view of the receiver is highly dependent on both the orbits of the GNSS satellites and the configuration of the study site geometries. A simulator has been developed to determine the location of the reflection points on the surface accurately by modeling the trajectories of GNSS electromagnetic waves that are re-flected by the surface of the Earth. Only the geometric prob-lem was considered using a specular reflection assumption. The orbit of the GNSS constellation satellites (mainly GPS, GLONASS and Galileo), and the position of a fixed receiver, are used as inputs. Four different simulation modes are pro-posed, depending on the choice of the Earth surface model (local plane, osculating sphere or ellipsoid) and the consider-ation of topography likely to cause masking effects. Angular refraction effects derived from adaptive mapping functions are also taken into account. This simulator was developed to determine where the GNSS-R receivers should be located to monitor a given study area efficiently. In this study, two test sites were considered: the first one {{at the top of the}} 65 m Cor-douan lighthouse in the Gironde estuary, France, and the sec-ond one on the shore of Lake Geneva (50 m above the reflect-ing surface), at the border between France and Switzerland. This site is hidden by mountains in the south (orthometric altitude up to 2000 m), and overlooking the lake in the north (orthometric altitude of 370 m). For this second test site con-figuration, reflections occur until 560 m from the receiver. The planimetric (arc length) differences (or altimetric differ-ence as WGS 84 ellipsoid height) between the positions of the specular reflection points obtained considering the Earth's surface as an osculating sphere or as an ellipsoid were found to be on average 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite el-evation angles greater than 10 •, and 13. 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles between 5 and 10 •. The altimetric and planimetric differences between the plane and sphere approximations are on average below 1. 4 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles greater than 10 • and below 6. 2 cm (or 2. 4 mm) for satellite elevation angles be-tween 5 and 10 •. These results are the means of the differ-ences obtained during a 24 h simulation with a complete GPS and GLONASS constellation, and thus depend on how the satellite elevation angle is sampled over the day of simula-tion. The simulations highlight the importance of the dig-ital elevation model (DEM) integration: average planimet-ric differences (or altimetric) with and without integrating the DEM (with respect to the ellipsoid approximation) were found to be about 6. 3 m (or 1. 74 m), with the minimum el-evation angle equal to 5 •. The correction of the angular re-fraction due to troposphere on the signal leads to planimet-ric (or altimetric) differences of an approximately 18 m (or 6 cm) maximum for a 50 m receiver height above the reflect-ing surface, whereas the maximum is 2. 9 m (or 7 mm) for a 5 m receiver height above the reflecting surface.

The correction of the angular refraction due to troposphere on the signal leads to planimetric (or altimetric) differences of an approximately 18 m (or 6 cm) maximum for a 50 m receiver height above the reflecting surface, whereas the maximum is 2. 9 m (or 7 mm) for a 5 m receiver height above the reflecting surface. These errors increase deeply with the receiver height above the reflecting surface. By setting it to 300 m, the <b>planimetric</b> <b>errors</b> reach 116 m, and the altimetric errors reach 32 cm for satellite elevation angles lower than 10 °. The tests performed with the simulator presented in this paper highlight the importance of the choice of the Earth's representation and also the non-negligible effect of angular refraction due to the troposphere on the specular reflection point positions. Various outputs (time-varying reflection point coordinates, satellite positions and ground paths, wave trajectories, first Fresnel zones, etc.) are provided either as text or KML files for visualization with Google Earth...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the works}} of civil engineering, and some others applications, need to be {{designed}} using a basic cartography with a suitable scale to the accuracy and extension of the plot. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Photogrammetry covers the gap between classical manned aerial photogrammetry and hand- made surveying techniques because it works in the close-range domain, combining aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry, but also introduces low-cost alternatives. The aim of this work is developing of an accurate and low-cost method to characterize landslides located on the size of a road. It was applied at the kilometric point 339 belonging to the A 92 dual carriageway, in the Abla municipal term, province of Almeria, Spain. A photogrammetric project was carried out from a set of images taken from an md 4 - 200 Microdrones with an on-board calibrated camera 12 Megapixels Pentax Optio A 40. The flight was previously planned to cover the whole extension of the embankment with three passes composed of 18 photos each one. All the images were taken with the vertical axe and it was registered 85 % and 60 % longitudinal and transversal overlaps respectively. The accuracy of the products, with <b>planimetric</b> and altimetric <b>errors</b> of 0. 049 and 0. 108 m repectively, lets to take measurements of the landslide and projecting preventive and palliative actuations...|$|R

The aim of this work is to compare {{the performance of a}} remote sensing technique using a digital camera mounted on an airborne platform, with 3 D photo-reconstruction, a method already validated for gully erosion assessment purposes (Castillo et al., 2012). A field survey was conducted in November 2012 in a 250 m-long gully located in field crops on a Vertisol in Cordoba (Spain). The airborne campaign was conducted with a 4000 x 3000 digital camera installed onboard an aircraft flying at 300 m above ground level to acquire 6 cm resolution imagery. A total of 990 images were acquired over the area ensuring a large overlap in the across- and along-track direction of the aircraft. An ortho-mosaic and the digital surface model (DSM) were obtained through automatic aerial triangulation and camera calibration methods. For the field-level photo-reconstruction technique, the gully was divided in several reaches to allow appropriate reconstruction (about 150 pictures taken per reach) and, finally, the resulting point clouds were merged into a unique mesh. A centimetric-accuracy GPS provided a benchmark dataset for gully perimeter and distinguishable reference points in order to allow the assessment of measurement errors of the airborne technique and the georeferenciation of the photo-reconstruction 3 D model. The uncertainty on the gully limits definition was explicitly addressed by comparison of several criteria obtained by 3 D models (slope and second derivative) with the outer perimeter obtained by the GPS operator identifying visually the change in slope {{at the top of the}} gully walls. In this study we discussed the magnitude of <b>planimetric</b> and altimetric <b>errors</b> and the differences observed between the estimates of the main dimensions of the gully (length, slope profile and total volume) for both methods. This analysis proved useful to define the field of application for each technique, considering their accuracy, cost and processing requirements. JRC. H. 4 -Monitoring Agricultural Resource...|$|R
