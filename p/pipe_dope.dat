5000|$|Various {{types of}} <b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> {{formulation}} exist, the appropriate type being {{determined by the}} application, e.g., pneumatic, hydraulic, caustic, etc., {{as well as the}} expected pressure. Improper selection of the type of <b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> may result in leakage despite best assembly practices.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>dope</b> is any thread lubricant, {{thread sealing}} compound, and {{anaerobic}} chemical sealants {{that are used}} to make a pipe thread joint leak proof and pressure tight. Although common pipe threads are tapered and therefore will achieve an interference fit during proper assembly, machining and finishing variances usually result in a fit that does not result in 100 percent contact between the mating components. The application of <b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> prior to assembly will fill the minute voids between the threads, thus making the joint pressure tight. <b>Pipe</b> <b>dope</b> also acts as a lubricant and helps prevent seizing of the mating parts, which can later cause difficulty during disassembly.|$|E
50|$|Threaded pipe joints {{are sealed}} with thread seal tape or <b>pipe</b> <b>dope.</b> Many {{plumbing}} fixtures are sealed to their mounting surfaces with plumber's putty.|$|E
40|$|Metal waste {{generated}} from domestic nuclear operations for defense and commercial applications {{has led to}} a growing stockpile of radioactively contaminated scrap metal, much of which is stainless steel. This steel contains large quantities of strategic elements such as nickel and chromium and constitutes a valuable domestic resource [1]. A significant fraction of this material cannot be efficiently surface decontaminated, and burial of this material would be wasteful and expensive, since long term monitoring would be necessary in order to minimize environmental risk. Melt decontamination of this material would maintain the chemical pedigree of the stainless steel, allowing its controlled reuse within the nuclear community. This research addresses the melt decontamination of radioactively contaminated stainless steel by electroslag remelting (ESR). ESR is industrially used for the production of specialty steels and superalloys to remove a variety of contaminates and to improve metal chemistry. Correctly applied, it could maintain the specified chemistry and mechanical properties of the original material while capturing the radioactive transuranic elements in a stable slag phase. The ESR process also produces a high quality metal ingot free of porosity that can be directly forged or rolled into final shapes. The goal of this project was to optimize a melt decontamination process through a basic understanding of the factors which govern the partitioning of various radionuclides between the metal, slag, and gas phases. Radionuclides which are captured by a slag phase may be stabilized by promoting the formation of synthetic minerals within a leach resistant matrix. This research program included three segments. At Boston University, Prof. Uday Pal and his group conducted research to develop a fundamental understanding of thermochemical and electrochemical behaviors of slag/metal/radionuclide surrogate systems. This work combined experimental characterization and thermochemical modeling of these high temperature systems. The second segment utilized Sandia expertise and ongoing work in fundamental separation science and liquid metal processing technology to investigate and optimize ESR decontamination using representative surrogate compounds to represent contaminate radionuclides. This work evaluated partitioning of the surrogates between the slag and metal ingot in ESR experiments. Furnace operating parameters were systematically varied to determine the optimum slag processing conditions. The third effort in Russia conducted ESR melting experiments using contaminated stainless steel <b>pipe</b> electrodes <b>doped</b> with plutonium. This work provided separation data for the radioactive compounds...|$|R
50|$|Petroleum-based <b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> is not {{intended}} for use on threaded PVC, CPVC or ABS pipe and fittings since it will deteriorate the plastic. Builders in the US are expected to use thread compounds that meet ASTM F2331 - Standard Test Method for Determining Chemical Compatibility of Thread Sealants with Thermoplastic Threaded Pipe and Fittings Materials or thread seal tape on PVC, CPVC and ABS threads.|$|E
50|$|Thread {{sealants}} such as {{joint compound}} (<b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> or thread seal tape such as PTFE tape) are unnecessary on compression fitting threads, {{as it is}} not the thread that seals the joint but rather the compression of the ferrule between the nut and pipe. However, a small amount of plumber's grease or light oil applied to the threads will provide lubrication to help ensure a smooth, consistent tightening of the compression nut.|$|E
50|$|Overuse or mis{{application}} {{of thread}} tape {{may be a}} hazard. Excess application of PTFE tape can prevent mating threads from fully engaging, reducing the shear point of the threads. Combining thread-seal tape with a <b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> compound can also overload threads. Also, internal overhangs of loose material may constrict a joint or slough off and form a foreign body that could jam a valve seat. Therefore, use of PTFE tape as a thread sealant is generally not considered appropriate in fluid power (hydraulic) systems.|$|E
50|$|Pulling {{the drill}} string out of or running the drill string {{into the hole}} is {{referred}} to as tripping. Drill pipe, HWDP and collars are typically racked back in stands in to the monkeyboard which is a component of the derrick {{if they are to be}} run back into the hole again after, say, changing the bit. The disconnect point ("break") is varied each subsequent round trip so that after three trips every connection has been broken apart and later made up again with fresh <b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> applied.|$|E
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of fluids under pressure have a threaded section that is slightly conical. Examples are the NPT and BSP series. The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint is created when a tapered externally threaded end is tightened into an end with internal threads. Normally a good seal requires {{the application of a}} separate sealant in the joint, such as thread seal tape, or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as <b>pipe</b> <b>dope,</b> however some threaded pipe joints do not require a separate sealant.|$|E
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of gases or liquids under pressure have a tapered thread that is slightly conical (in contrast to the parallel sided cylindrical section commonly found on bolts and leadscrews). The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint depends upon multiple factors: the labyrinth seal created by the threads; a positive seal between the threads created by thread deformation when they are tightened to the proper torque; and sometimes {{on the presence of}} a sealing coating, such as thread seal tape or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as <b>pipe</b> <b>dope.</b> Tapered thread joints typically do not include a gasket.|$|E
5000|$|Tripping pipe (or [...] "Making a round trip" [...] {{or simply}} [...] "Making a trip") is the {{physical}} act of pulling the drill string {{out of the}} wellbore and then running it back in. This is done by physically breaking out or disconnecting (when {{pulling out of the}} hole) every other 2 or 3 (in 1959 Superior Oil Co barge 11 pulled pipe in 4Neededjoint segments) joints of drill pipe at a time (called a stand) and racking them vertically in the derrick. When feasible the driller will start each successive trip on a different [...] "break" [...] so that after several trips fresh <b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> will have been applied (when running back in the hole) to every segment of the drill string.|$|E
5000|$|The taper on NPT threads {{allows them}} to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads {{compress}} against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight thread fittings or compression fittings in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide the seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without thread sealants, as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically thread seal tape or <b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> (sometimes plumber's putty). As the thread body is tapered (...) , a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or thread seal tape. The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.|$|E
40|$|Using {{greenhouse}} pot techniques, 32 {{drilling mud}} components were tested to see if, {{at a high}} rate of addition, they reduced plant growth. Green beans and sweet corn were the test plants. The excellent black, silt loam, slightly acidic, uncultivated Dagor soil (Cumulic Haploxeroll) was used for most tests. Rates used were considered to be abnormal level (high rate) and usual (low rate) amounts that might be added in commonly used drilling muds. Drilling mud components that caused no observable or statistically significant reductions of plant yield are the following: Super Visbestos, (Asbestos), asphalt, Ben-Ex (a vinyl acetate and maleic anhydride copolymer), bentonite, Cypan (sodium polyacrylate), DME (ethoxylated nonyl phenol), Super Lube Flow (gilsonite), paraformaldehyde, Separan-AP- 273 (Dow-made, Shell-supplied polymer), sodium acid pyrophosphate, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. Drilling mud components that barely caused a statistical significant (5 percent level) reduction in yield for only one of the two plant species when added to the soil only and, therefore, is of questionable hazard to plant growth are the following: Barite (BaSO 4), Desco (modified tannin), Drillaid 412 (a filming amine), Drillaid 405 (diesel oil replacement), Kelzan-XC (a xanthan gum), <b>Pipe</b> <b>dope,</b> Lingo (lignite), Soltex (sulfonated asphalt?), and Witconnate 1840 (sulfonated tall oil). Drilling mud components causing significant reduction in plant growth mostly at only the high addition rates to soil-mud mixtures are the following: Desco (modified tannin?), Dextrid (a non-fermenting starch), pregelatinized starch, Q-Broxin (an iron chromelignosulfonate), Gendril Thik (guar gum), and Kwik-Seal. The most severe reductions in plant growth were caused by the following materials: Sodium hydroxide at the high rate (which was used in the soil-mud mixture with calcium lignosulfonate and with lignite), diesel oil and potassium chloride at both rates. The latter salt completely inhibited plant germination. Probable causes for plant growth reductions, photographic and visual records, and a discussion of the results is presented in some detail...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, some of the {{platforms}} in the Gulf of Mexico have been damaged completely, such that conventional P&A operations may not be possible. In these cases, plugging fluid needs to be pumped through an intervention well and dropped several thousand feet in water to settle above a packer and seal the well. The current P&A material of choice is cement, but cement is miscible in water, which dilutes and contaminates the cement. Therefore, alternate plugging materials need {{to be used for}} these operations. This paper discusses the development of a cost-effective Epoxy P&A method and the challenges of using Epoxy. First, the impact of seawater, oil, and <b>pipe</b> <b>dope</b> on the curing process remains unknown. Secondly, the yield strength of Epoxy with and without the contaminating chemicals must be equal to or better than cement. Finally, previous tests have shown significant losses of Epoxy to the walls of the wellbore during the 7, 000 -ft drop. 2 High temperature curing and compression tests were performed on contaminated epoxy samples to determine the effectiveness of the epoxy plug. To reduce material losses, an improved method for introducing the epoxy into the target zone was developed. This method takes advantage of a narrow window in the cure process where the curing process can be suspended by quenching the partially cured liquid epoxy in water at room temperature, thereby changing the liquid epoxy into solid beads. The beads can then be pumped into the wellbore, where they liquefy at wellbore temperature, 200 ?F, then cure into a solid plug. Seawater was found to accelerate the cure time, while all contaminants tested reduced the fracture strength by more than 25 % compared to pure resin. The yield strengths of contaminant mixtures, however, remained relatively constant, with the greatest drop being only 11 %. The use of solid epoxy beads was found to have a compressive strength 50 % greater than Portland cements I&II. In addition, the application mentioned herein eliminates the need to prepare the plug material on site. These advantages greatly contribute to reducing the costs of an epoxy P&A operation, to potentially being USD 0. 7 million cheaper than a Portland cement operation...|$|E
