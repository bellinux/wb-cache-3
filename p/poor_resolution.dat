5|$|Within {{the family}} Cheirogaleidae, fork-marked lemurs {{are the most}} phylogenetically distinct, {{although}} their placement remained uncertain until recently. One uniting characteristic (synapomorphy) among all cheirogaleids, {{to the exclusion of}} other lemurs, is the branching of the carotid artery along with how it enters the skull—a trait which is shared by fork-marked lemurs. Analyses based on morphology, immunology, and repetitive DNA have given contradictory placements of Phaner, while studies in 2001 and 2008 either lacked data or yielded <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> of their placement.|$|E
5|$|Reconnaissance by Junkers Ju 86 {{aircraft}} {{had identified}} the airfields as fighter bases. The high altitude and <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> {{of the photographs}} meant the aircraft on the ground could not be identified properly and the Germans mistakenly believed them to be fighter fields. In fact, none of the airfields belonged to Fighter Command. Gosport housed a torpedo development unit, Thorney Island housed No. 59 Squadron RAF and No. 235 Squadron RAF with Bristol Blenheims assigned to RAF Coastal Command. Ford was a naval air station and housed No. 829 Squadron Fleet Air Arm which was working up with Fairey Albacore aircraft at the time. These targets were given to Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (StG 77 or Dive Bombing Wing 77). The Geschwader committed 109 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers to the raid. It was the largest concentration of Ju 87s to operate over Britain to date.|$|E

25|$|Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) is another signal processing solution that separates different signals that are statistically independent in time. It is primarily used to remove artifacts such as blinking, eye muscle movement, facial muscle artifacts, cardiac artifacts, etc. from MEG and EEG signals {{that may be}} contaminated with outside noise. However, ICA has <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> of highly correlated brain sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{emission}} lines seen on {{the spectrum}} of a Seyfert galaxy may come {{from the surface of}} the accretion disc itself, or may come from clouds of gas illuminated by the central engine in an ionization cone. The exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> of the galactic center. However, each part of the accretion disc has a different velocity relative to our line of sight, and the faster the gas is rotating around the black hole, the broader the emission line will be. Similarly, an illuminated disc wind also has a position-dependent velocity.|$|E
25|$|DNA barcoding is a taxonomic {{method that}} uses a short genetic marker in an organism's DNA to {{identify}} it as belonging to a particular species. It differs from molecular phylogeny in that the main {{goal is not to}} determine patterns of relationship but to identify an unknown sample in terms of a preexisting classification. Although barcodes are sometimes used in an effort to identify unknown species or assess whether species should be combined or separated, These provide <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> for land plants, and a call was made for regions to be assessed that could complement rbcL and matK.|$|E

One meta-analysis concluded that ATT {{in the management}} of patients with presumed ocular TB enabled remission in 84 % [30]. Another large analysis explored whether any factors were associated with a poorer outcome and found that prior immunosuppression and/or a high absolute QuantiFERON GOLD level were associated with <b>poorer</b> <b>resolution</b> of inflammation post-ATT or an ongoing need for systemic steroid [34].|$|R
25|$|Although QTL {{analysis}} has generated {{a vast amount}} of information on gene locations and the magnitude of effects on many traits, the identification of the genes involved has remained elusive. This is due to <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> of QTL analysis. The solution for this problem would be production of recombinant chromosome substitution line, or stepped aligned recombinant inbred lines. Here, backcrossing is carried out until a desired level of recombination has occurred and genetic markers are used to detect desired recombinant chromosome substitution lines in the target region, which can be fixed by doubled haploidy. In rice, molecular markers {{have been found to be}} linked with major genes and QTLs for resistance to rice blast, bacterial blight, and sheath blight in a map produced from DH population.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{homology}} model {{is dependent on the}} {{quality of the}} sequence alignment and template structure. The approach can be complicated by the presence of alignment gaps (commonly called indels) that indicate a structural region present in the target but not in the template, and by structure gaps in the template that arise from <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> in the experimental procedure (usually X-ray crystallography) used to solve the structure. Model quality declines with decreasing sequence identity; a typical model has ~1–2 Å root mean square deviation between the matched Cα atoms at 70% sequence identity but only 2–4 Å agreement at 25% sequence identity. However, the errors are significantly higher in the loop regions, where the amino acid sequences of the target and template proteins may be completely different.|$|E
25|$|Tissue {{preparation}} or fixation {{is essential}} for the preservation of cell morphology and tissue architecture. Inappropriate or prolonged fixation may significantly diminish the antibody binding capability. Many antigens can be successfully demonstrated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. However, some antigens will not survive even moderate amounts of aldehyde fixation. Under these conditions, tissues should be rapidly fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut with a cryostat. The disadvantages of frozen sections include poor morphology, <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> at higher magnifications, difficulty in cutting over paraffin sections, and the need for frozen storage. Alternatively, vibratome sections do not require the tissue to be processed through organic solvents or high heat, which can destroy the antigenicity, or disrupted by freeze thawing. The disadvantage of vibratome sections is that the sectioning process is slow and difficult with soft and poorly fixed tissues, and that chatter marks or vibratome lines are often apparent in the sections.|$|E
50|$|At {{the other}} extreme of dynamic range are the windows with the <b>poorest</b> <b>resolution</b> and sensitivity, which {{is the ability to}} reveal {{relatively}} weak sinusoids in the presence of additive random noise. That is because the noise produces a stronger response with high-dynamic-range windows than with high-resolution windows. Therefore, high-dynamic-range windows are most often justified in wideband applications, where the spectrum being analyzed is expected to contain many different components of various amplitudes.|$|R

50|$|The first {{integrated}} circuits had features of 200 micrometres which were printed using contact lithography. This technique was {{popular in the}} 1960s until it was substituted by proximity printing, where a gap is introduced between the photomask and the substrate. Proximity printing had <b>poorer</b> <b>resolution</b> than contact printing (due to the gap allowing more diffraction to occur) but generated far less defects. The resolution was sufficient for down to 2 micrometre production. In 1978, the step-and-repeat projection system appeared.|$|R
25|$|The facial pit {{actually}} visualizes {{thermal radiation}} {{using the same}} optical principles as a pinhole camera, wherein {{the location of a}} source of thermal radiation is determined by the location of the radiation on the membrane of the heat pit. However, studies that have visualized the thermal images seen by the facial pit using computer analysis have suggested that the resolution is actually extremely poor. The size of the opening of the pit results in <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> of small, warm objects, and coupled with the pit's small size and subsequent poor heat conduction, the image produced is of extremely low resolution and contrast. It is known that some focusing and sharpening of the image occurs in the lateral descending trigeminal tract, and {{it is possible that the}} visual and infrared integration that occurs in the tectum may also be used to help sharpen the image. In addition, snakes may deliberately choose ambush sites with low thermal background radiation (colder areas) to maximize the contrast of their warm prey in order to achieve such a high degree of accuracy from their thermal “vision”.|$|E

The graphics were viewed as dated on Windows, with IGN calling it [...] "choppy" [...] and pointing out the <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> upscaling. The Dreamcast port was essentially identical to the PlayStation version, with a graphical advantage of not suffering from the texture-distortion effect produced by the PlayStation. On the Dreamcast, , another Capcom survival horror game, was viewed as a superior experience.|$|E

Because the seismometers that recorded the Nazko swarm were more than [...] away from where the earthquakes took place, {{the locations of the}} hypocenters were measured with <b>poor</b> <b>resolution.</b> Following the earthquake, five seismometers were placed by the Geological Survey of Canada from September 2007 to June 2008 close to the hypocenter. Analysis of the data recorded by these seismometers indicates a much larger total number of earthquakes. For example, at least 597 earthquakes were recognized during a period of only six hours.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the pitfalls}} of the STFT {{is that it has}} a fixed resolution. The width of the {{windowing}} function relates to how the signal is represented—it determines whether there is good frequency resolution (frequency components close together can be separated) or good time resolution (the time at which frequencies change). A wide window gives better frequency <b>resolution</b> but <b>poor</b> time <b>resolution.</b> A narrower window gives good time <b>resolution</b> but <b>poor</b> frequency <b>resolution.</b> These are called narrowband and wideband transforms, respectively.|$|R

[...] The crystal is illuminated with a finely focused monochromatic beam of X-rays, producing a diffraction pattern of regularly spaced spots known as reflections. The two-dimensional images taken at different orientations are converted into a three-dimensional model of the density of electrons within the crystal using the mathematical method of Fourier transforms, combined with chemical data known for the sample. <b>Poor</b> <b>resolution</b> (fuzziness) or even errors may result if the crystals are too small, or not uniform enough in their internal makeup.|$|E

2500|$|Single-photon {{emission}} {{computed tomography}} (SPECT) {{is similar to}} PET and uses gamma ray-emitting radioisotopes and a gamma camera to record data that a computer uses to construct two- or three-dimensional images of active brain regions. SPECT relies on an injection of radioactive tracer, or [...] "SPECT agent," [...] which is rapidly {{taken up by the}} brain but does not redistribute. Uptake of SPECT agent is nearly 100% complete within 30 to 60 seconds, reflecting cerebral blood flow (CBF) at the time of injection. These properties of SPECT make it particularly well-suited for epilepsy imaging, which is usually made difficult by problems with patient movement and variable seizure types. SPECT provides a [...] "snapshot" [...] of cerebral blood flow since scans can be acquired after seizure termination (so long as the radioactive tracer was injected {{at the time of the}} seizure). A significant limitation of SPECT is its <b>poor</b> <b>resolution</b> (about 1cm) compared to that of MRI. Today, SPECT machines with Dual Detector Heads are commonly used, although Triple Detector Head machines are available in the marketplace. Tomographic reconstruction, (mainly used for functional [...] "snapshots" [...] of the brain) requires multiple projections from Detector Heads which rotate around the human skull, so some researchers have developed 6 and 11 Detector Head SPECT machines to cut imaging time and give higher resolution.|$|E
