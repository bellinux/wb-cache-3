A retail area sold D’Artagnan <b>prepared</b> <b>products</b> such as pâtés and terrines. William Grimes reviewed D’Artagnan the Rotisserie in The New York Times, and gave the restaurant two stars, saying: [...] "D’Artagnan has the real thing. In fact it has so much personality it can sell it by the pound. The food is authentic, robust, earthy and powerfully flavored." [...] The restaurant closed in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|D’Artagnan {{originally}} sold whole lobes of raw {{foie gras}} to the chefs of New York City. At {{the time the}} only foie gras available to restaurants was canned product imported from Europe. D’Artagnan’s product line quickly expanded to include game meats and heritage breed poultry, organic chicken, heritage turkey, grass-fed beef, humanely-raised veal and pork, pheasant, quail, squab and <b>prepared</b> <b>products</b> like pâté, dry-cured sausages, smoked duck breast and duck prosciutto. D’Artagnan was an early proponent of humanely raised, antibiotic and hormone-free organic meat. D’Artagnan sources from small farmers and creates cooperatives of farms where possible, to ensure that animals are raised in humane conditions. They procure meats from small family farms that are committed to humane, sustainable free-range, antibiotic and hormone free methods of animal husbandry. D’Artagnan contracts with 35 co-ops nationwide, representing about 1,500 farmers as of 2009. D’Artagnan’s line of products became more available to the consumer public when it began selling items to major grocery stores Balducci’s and the Food Emporium in 1996.

50|$|An {{unbalanced}} {{selection of}} food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products {{may lead to a}} lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins and a higher intake of sugars and saturated fats. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid / carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. These nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these <b>prepared</b> <b>products</b> and have higher biological and nutritional value. Advances towards higher nutrition-content gluten-free bakery products, improved for example in terms of fiber content and glycemic index, have been made by using not exclusively corn starch or other starches to substitute for flour. In this aim, for example the dietary fiber inulin (which acts as a prebiotic) or quinoa or amaranth wholemeal have been as substitute for part of the flour. Such substitution has been found to also yield improved crust and texture of bread. It is recommended that anyone embarking on a gluten-free diet check with a registered dietitian {{to make sure they are}} getting the required amount of key nutrients like iron, calcium, fiber, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and folate. Vitamins often contain gluten as a binding agent. Experts have advised that it is important to always read the content label of any product that is intended to be swallowed.|$|E

To {{prolong the}} {{shelf-life}} of chilled chicken {{and to reduce}} the drip loss in this meat and in <b>prepared</b> chicken <b>products</b> in refrigerated storage, a gelatin-based antimicrobial edible coating was developed that included nisin, EDTA and potassium sorbate. The chilled chicken breast and <b>prepared</b> chicken <b>products</b> were treated with the coating and were stored at 4 °C in tray-packaging. The results showed that after treatment with the coating that included the optimal concentrations of the additives, the shelf life of the chilled chicken meat and the <b>prepared</b> chicken <b>products</b> was significant prolonged, the amount of drip loss of was significantly reduced from 4. 88 ~ 5. 90 % to 0. 67 %~ 0. 82 %, and the color values were also improved during the early stage of the storage.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{prevalence}} of slotting fees in organic packaged and <b>prepared</b> <b>products,</b> and identifies {{the factors that influence}} the relative size of slotting fees. Based on a 2009 survey of U. S. food retailers, we find that 31 percent of surveyed retailers accept slotting fees for organic packaged and <b>prepared</b> <b>products.</b> Previous literature on slotting fees provides arguments for two rationales, one focused on the role slotting fees play in establishing an efficient allocation of shelf space for new products and the other focused on how slotting fees can be used strategically to price discriminate or otherwise increase rents to parties with more bargaining power. Using an ordered logit regression of the relative magnitude of slotting fees on retailer characteristics, we estimate coefficients that are mostly consistent with the economic efficiency rationale, with a few being consistent with the market power/strategic behavior rationale. More specifically, we find that the magnitude of slotting fees for organic products, relative to their non-organic counterparts, depends on a number of retailer characteristics, including the number of stores in the retailer’s chain, a retailer’s total sales, and the size of its organic marketing budget. Organic, slotting fees, food retailers, ordered logit, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E
