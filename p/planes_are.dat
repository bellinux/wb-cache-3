5|$|However, Project Stormfury had {{positive}} results as well. Knowledge gained during flights proved invaluable in debunking its hypotheses. Other science {{resulted in a}} greater understanding of tropical cyclones. In addition, the Lockheed P-3's were perfectly suitable for gathering data on tropical cyclones, allowing improved forecasting of these monstrous storms. Those <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> still used by the NOAA today.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{referred}} to Müsstler's agents as the Iron Guard, thereby naming them after the real Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist group {{that sought to}} oust King Carol II and forge a Romanian-German alliance. The Bordurian officers wore uniforms based on those of the German SS, while the Bordurian <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> German in design; in the original version Tintin escapes in a Heinkel He 112, while in the revised version this {{is replaced by a}} Messerschmitt Bf 109. Hergé adopted the basis of Borduria's false flag operation to take over Syldavia from the plans outlined in Curzio Malaparte's Tecnica del Colpo di Stato ("The Technique of a Coup d'Etat").|$|E
25|$|The {{frontal plane}} or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or {{posterior}} and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans a coronal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> vertical and a transverse <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> horizontal and a transverse <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> vertical. A longitudinal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> any <b>plane</b> {{perpendicular to the}} transverse plane. The coronal plane and the sagittal <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> examples of longitudinal planes.|$|R

5|$|Star Alliance's 27 member {{airlines}} {{operate a}} fleet of approximately 4,657 aircraft, serve more than 1,330 airports in 192 countries and carry 641.1million passengers per year on more than 18,500 daily departures. The alliance has a two-tier rewards program, Silver and Gold, with incentives including priority boarding and upgrades. Like other airline alliances, Star Alliance airlines share airport terminals (known as co-location) and many member <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> painted in the alliance's livery.|$|E
5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days {{relative to the}} background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The cover art was {{conceived}} by Weymouth and Frantz {{with the help}} of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his MIT Media Lab team. Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with TalkingHeads—but decided against it in the end.|$|E
50|$|A {{longitudinal}} <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> any <b>plane</b> {{perpendicular to}} the transverse plane. The coronal plane and the sagittal <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> examples of longitudinal planes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sagittal}} (also {{known as}} anteroposterior) <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> an Y-Z <b>plane,</b> {{perpendicular to the}} ground, which separates left from right. The midsagittal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> the specific sagittal <b>plane</b> that <b>is</b> exactly {{in the middle of}} the body.|$|R

5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E
25|$|Though most <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> pushed {{across a}} piece of wood, holding it with one or both hands, Japanese <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> pulled toward the body, not pushed away.|$|E
25|$|Because {{foliation}} <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> {{planes of}} weakness, these fabrics within the rocks strongly influence landslide and debris flow hazards. Where the foliation <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> dipping towards a free surface, failure {{is likely to}} occur along these planes.|$|E
5000|$|The four {{sentences}} in Torres Strait Creole carry a semantic difference difficult {{to show in}} the English translation. Plein i dhe go plai is the basic sentence — 'the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> flying away over there'.

25|$|Generally all <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> used to flatten, {{reduce the}} {{thickness}} of, and impart a smooth surface to a rough piece of lumber or timber. Planing {{is also used}} to produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually too large for shaping, where the integrity of the whole requires the same smooth surface. Special types of <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> designed to cut joints or decorative mouldings.|$|E
40|$|An oval script O {{sign of a}} {{projective}} <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> called two-transitive {{if there}} is a collineation group G fixing script O sign and acting 2 -transitively on its points.

25|$|Bench <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> {{characterized}} by the cutting iron bedded with the bevel facing down and attached to a chipbreaker. Most metal bench planes, and some larger wooden ones, are designed with a rear handle known as a tote. Block <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> {{characterized by}} the absence of a chipbreaker and the cutting iron bedded with the bevel up. The block plane is usually a smaller tool that can be held with one hand and is used for general purpose work such as taking down a knot in the wood, smoothing small pieces, chamfering edges, and making the end of a sawed board square and smooth.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> broadly {{categorized}} as either bench planes, block planes, or specialty planes. In modern-day carpentry, electrically powered hand planers (also called hand or handheld power planers or simply power planes) {{have joined the}} family.|$|E

50|$|In the {{analysis}} of this form of astigmatism, it is most common to consider rays from a given point on the object, which propagate in two special planes. The first <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> the tangential <b>plane.</b> This <b>is</b> the <b>plane</b> which includes both the object point under consideration and the axis of symmetry. Rays that propagate in this <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> called tangential rays. Planes that include the optical axis <b>are</b> meridional <b>planes.</b> It <b>is</b> common to simplify problems in radially-symmetric optical systems by choosing object points in the vertical ("y") plane only.
