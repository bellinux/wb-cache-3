40|$|In {{the last}} decade <b>Process</b> <b>Synthesis</b> has been an {{emerging}} active area of research. Since 1999 at COMPS, we have continuously applied this technique to many studies and recently have carefully started to consider the integration of this technique with others to simplify multilevel process design. In this regard {{the need for new}} tools that do not require very accurate data or experimental technique has become an imperative for the initial analysis of systems. This thesis presents some of these results. <b>Process</b> <b>synthesis</b> requires new rapid tools for the assessment and comparison of new technologies (possibilities) in the process development stage. This thesis examines and formulates <b>process</b> <b>synthesis</b> problems in the case of separation processes (separation with mixing, separation with reaction). Using simple generic vectorial tools, the thesis addresses the folowing issue: How the topology and mapping of the process vector field defines patterns that may be used for alternative <b>process</b> <b>synthesis</b> solution and design (structure selection,stability analysis or controllability etc [...] .). The tools presented are intended for preliminary process design and feasibility studies and will allow for simple comparisons of various options. The key principle used in the study is the exploitation of the generic vectorial representation of fundamental physical phenomena (separation, mixing, reaction) in the process models as used for <b>process</b> <b>synthesis</b> and analysis. The demonstrated power of this approach is that it allows one to exploit the formal mathematical similarities between the different processing modes. Extensive topological Reactive Column Profile has been generated and analysed, offering new insights for manipulation of process behaviour in <b>process</b> <b>synthesis</b> and design. The significance of the contribution of this research is in offering extended fundamental insigths in creating <b>process</b> <b>synthesis</b> options for reactive-separations systems, creating the essential structural basis for subsequent mathematical optimisation of the performanceof process designs...|$|E
40|$|The paper briefly {{describes}} {{the problem of}} <b>process</b> <b>synthesis</b> {{in the area of}} chemical engineering, and suggests its formulation as a Multi-Objective Programming problem. <b>Process</b> <b>synthesis</b> optimization is usually modeled as Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) or Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) with an economic objective function. We claim that incorporating more criteria (e. g., environmental criteria) in this kind of combinatorial optimization problem offers the decision makers the opportunity to refine their final decision by examining more than one solution (a set of efficient or Pareto optimal solutions instead of one optimal solution). For solving the multi-objective <b>process</b> <b>synthesis</b> problem, an improved version of the Multi-Criteria Branch and Bound (MCBB) algorithm, which has been developed by the same authors, is used.

40|$|Renewable {{resources}} pose special {{challenges to}} <b>process</b> <b>synthesis.</b> Due to decentral raw material generation, usually low transport densities and the perishable character of most renewable raw materi-als {{in combination with}} their time dependent availability, logistical questions as well as adaptation to regional agricultural structures are necessary. This calls for synthesis of structures not only of single processes but of the whole value chain attached to the utilisation of a certain resource. As most of the innovative technologies proposed to build on a renewable raw material base face stiff economic competition from fossil based processes, economic optimality of the value chain is crucial to their implementation. On top of this widening of the process definition for synthesis, many processes {{on the base of}} renewable resources apply technologies (like membrane separations, chromatographic purifi-cation steps, etc.) for which the heuristic knowledge is still slim. This reduces the choice of methods for <b>process</b> <b>synthesis,</b> mainly to methods based on combinatorial principles.
