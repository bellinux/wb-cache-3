A case-control (induced exposure) study design was implemented {{using data from the}} Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and the General Estimates System (GES). Using FARS data, vehicles with similar makes and models, but different model years, were analyzed. A 30. 5 % reduction in the odds of a single-vehicle crash was estimated for passenger cars equipped with ESC, and a 49. 5 % reduction was estimated for sport utility vehicles (SUVs). The estimated <b>percentage</b> <b>reductions</b> in the odds of rollover for passenger cars and SUVs equipped with ESC were 39. 7 % and 72. 9 %, respectively. No significant effects were found on roads that were not dry. Using the accident type variable in the GES database, cases were defined as vehicles in crashes that ran off the roadway, and controls were defined as vehicles involved in rear-end struck crashes. Overall, estimated <b>percentage</b> <b>reductions</b> for passenger cars and SUVs were 54. 5 % and 70. 3 %, respectively. Models that adjust for age and gender effects were fit. No significant differences due to ESC were found between males and females, but middle-aged drivers of passenger cars and older drivers of SUVs tended to benefit most from the presence of ESC.

40|$|Objective: This paper {{examines}} {{time series}} data on infant mortality from 21 countries to demonstrate an appropriate {{test of the}} hypothesis that <b>percentage</b> <b>reductions</b> in infant mortality are larger when infant mortality is lower. Prior research expounding this hypothesis has dubbed it "the Matthew effect". Method: Time series for infant mortality can be modeled as X t = m + q 1 X t- 1 +e t where e t is identically and independently distributed. If q 1 = 1 it is easily demonstrated that the time series has an asymptotic distribution with infinite variance. The correct test to apply in this situation is the Dickey-Fuller test which we use to test the statistical significance of q 1 in a regression analysis of Dlog IMR t = m + q 1 log IMR t- 1 +e t. Evidence that q 1 is significant and negative would support the claim {{that there is a}} Matthew Effect in infant mortality. This paper uses time series data on IMR from 21 nations for 1870 - 1988. Several additional lagged values of Dlog IMR were appended using an Akaike Indicator Criterion to select the preferred specification. Transformations of IMR other than simple logarithms were explored. Results: With the preferred specification, the Dickey-Fuller test rejected the presence of any Matthew Effect in all but three countries. The rejection of a Matthew Effect was robust to alternative specifications of the lag structure of IMR and to various transformations of IMR other than logarithmic. Conclusion: Based on 20 th century data there is scarce evidence that <b>percentage</b> <b>reductions</b> in infant mortality are generally smaller in higher mortality countries. Large <b>percentage</b> <b>reductions</b> in infant mortality are possible for countries at any stage in economic development and are likely to be reflective of durable advances in human knowledge, social institutions, and physical capital. ...|$|R
30|$|For an {{economic}} perspective, {{we turn to}} developments in two price economies (Madan and Schoutens (2016)) that evaluate the necessary costs of holding risk exposures. Basically, {{the cost of an}} exposure is the spread cost of entering and exiting the exposure when trading in both directions at adverse terms. The two price economy provides constructions of lower and upper conservative valuations at which positions may be offloaded or acquired. We take as {{an economic}} cost the spread between these upper and lower valuations. For the purpose of valuing predictions, one evaluates the economic cost of the prediction residual seen as a risk exposure. In evaluating different predictors, attention is focused on the <b>percentage</b> <b>reductions</b> in exposure costs delivered by various models. The <b>percentage</b> cost <b>reduction</b> is an easily interpretable performance metric.|$|R

50|$|Causes {{of infant}} {{mortality}} directly {{lead to the}} death. Environmental and social barriers prevent access to basic medical resources and thus contribute to an increasing infant mortality rate; 99% of infant deaths occur in developing countries, and 86% of these deaths are due to infections, premature births, complications during delivery, and perinatal asphyxia and birth injuries. Greatest <b>percentage</b> <b>reduction</b> of infant mortality occurs in countries that already have low rates of infant mortality.Common causes are preventable with low-cost measures. In the United States, a primary determinant of infant mortality risk is infant birth weight with lower birth weights increasing the risk of infant mortality.
