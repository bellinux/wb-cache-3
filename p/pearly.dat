5|$|The building's {{structural}} steel frame {{was also a}} first for the city. It was covered in grey limestone from Saint-Marc-des-Carrières and Queenston. Due to the rapid construction, Saint-Marc-des-Carrières was unable to supply enough stone {{to keep up with}} demand on the building site, resulting in the use of Queenston as an additional source. Saint-Marc-des-Carrières limestone is a <b>pearly</b> grey, and becomes a pale beige with age, while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from crinoid fossils and takes a chamois tint as it ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea onion}} Paranthus rapiformis lives on subtidal mud flats and burrows into the sediment, holding itself {{in place by}} {{expanding}} its basal disc to form an anchor. If it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents, it contracts into a <b>pearly</b> glistening ball which rolls about. Tube-dwelling anemones which live in parchment-like tubes, are in the anthozoan subclass Ceriantharia, and are only distantly related to sea anemones.|$|E

5|$|Norris Bradbury {{was born}} in Santa Barbara, California, on 30 May 1909, one of four {{children}} of Edwin <b>Pearly</b> and his wife Elvira née Clausen. One sister died as an infant, and the family adopted twins Bobby and Betty, both of whom served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. Bradbury was educated at Hollywood High School and Chaffey High School in Ontario, California, graduating {{at the age of}} 16. He then attended Pomona College in Claremont, California, from which he graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in chemistry in 1929. This earned him membership of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. At Pomona, he met Lois Platt, an English Literature major who was the sister of his college roommate. They were married in 1933, and had three sons, James, John, and David.|$|E
5|$|Some folk {{figures are}} based on semi or actual {{historical}} people whose story has been passed down centuries; Lady Godiva for instance {{was said to have}} ridden naked on horseback through Coventry, Hereward the Wake was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, Herne the Hunter is an equestrian ghost associated with Windsor Forest and Great Park and Mother Shipton is the archetypal witch. On 5 November people make bonfires, set off fireworks and eat toffee apples in commemoration of the foiling of the Gunpowder Plot centred on Guy Fawkes. The chivalrous bandit, such as Dick Turpin, is a recurring character, while Blackbeard is the archetypal pirate. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as Morris dancing, Maypole dancing, Rapper sword in the North East, Long Sword dance in Yorkshire, Mummers Plays, bottle-kicking in Leicestershire, and cheese-rolling at Cooper's Hill. There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the <b>Pearly</b> Kings and Queens associated with cockneys, the Royal Guard, the Morris costume and Beefeaters.|$|E

25|$|The great grey shrike, {{northern}} grey shrike, or northern shrike (Lanius excubitor) {{is a large}} songbird {{species in}} the shrike family (Laniidae). It forms a superspecies with its parapatric southern relatives, the southern grey shrike (L. meridionalis), the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) and the loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus). Within the great grey shrike species itself, there are two subspecies. Males and females are similar in plumage, <b>pearly</b> grey above with a black eye-mask and white underparts.|$|E

5000|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1908, Alfred has {{developed}} a drinking problem and is managing the pub poorly and getting behind on the family's rent due to spending the rent money on drink. Ellen and Fanny, now a schoolgirl, are embarrassed and put off by Alfred's drinking and slovenly appearance. Ellen carefully plans a genteel social evening when Jane Marryot and her son Edward, {{who is now in}} college at Oxford, pay a visit to the Bridges' flat. Ellen does not tell Alfred about the visit and lies to the Marryots that he can't attend due to a leg injury, but just as the Marryots are leaving, Alfred shows up drunk, acts rudely and destroys a doll that Jane had given Fanny, causing Fanny to run away into the street, where she distracts herself by dancing with some <b>Pearlies.</b> An angry Alfred chases Fanny, attacks the <b>Pearlies,</b> and then stumbles into the street where he is fatally run over by a horse-drawn fire engine.|$|R

25|$|Basal-cell {{skin cancer}} (BCC) usually {{presents}} as a raised, smooth, <b>pearly</b> bump on the sun-exposed {{skin of the}} head, neck or shoulders. Sometimes small blood vessels (called telangiectasia) can be seen within the tumor. Crusting and bleeding {{in the center of}} the tumor frequently develops. It is often mistaken for a sore that does not heal. This form of skin cancer is the least deadly and with proper treatment can be completely eliminated, often without scarring.|$|E
25|$|Adult red-crowned cranes {{are named}} for a patch of red bare skin on the crown, which becomes {{brighter}} during mating season. Overall, they are snow white in color with black on the wing secondaries, which can appear almost like a black tail when the birds are standing, but the real tail feathers are actually white. Males are black on the cheeks, throat, and neck, while females are <b>pearly</b> gray in these spots. The bill is olive green to greenish horn, the legs are slate to grayish black, and the iris is dark brown.|$|E
25|$|The shell {{has three}} layers. In the <b>pearly</b> mussels {{there is an}} inner {{iridescent}} layer of nacre (mother-of-pearl) composed of calcium carbonate, which is continuously secreted by the mantle; the prismatic layer, a middle layer of chalky white crystals of calcium carbonate in a protein matrix; and the periostracum, an outer pigmented layer resembling a skin. The periostracum is composed of a protein called conchin, and its function {{is to protect the}} prismatic layer from abrasion and dissolution by acids (especially important in freshwater forms where the decay of leaf materials produces acids).|$|E
50|$|In {{yet another}} escape from <b>Pearly's</b> men, both Peter Lake {{and the white}} horse crash into a mysterious, {{recurring}} cloud wall, disappearing in it for decades. When Peter Lake emerges, he no longer remembers {{who he is and}} is visibly no longer of this world, seeing and hearing things that nobody else can see or hear. One night, in a dream or a vision, he is carried on a tour of all the graves of the world, observing and remembering all the dead. In the apocalyptic chaos of burning New York, he acquires astonishing powers.|$|R

60|$|They {{took the}} path {{down by the}} bank of the Yukon. Home did not lie that way, but the elusive idea did. Mucluc Charley giggled over the idea that he could not catch for the edification of Leclaire. They came to where Siskiyou <b>Pearly’s</b> boat lay moored to the bank. The rope with which it was tied ran across the path to a pine stump. They tripped over it and went down, O’Brien underneath. A faint flash of {{consciousness}} lighted his brain. He felt the impact of bodies upon his and struck out madly for a moment with his fists. Then he went to sleep again. His gentle snore arose on the air, and Mucluc Charley began to giggle.|$|R
25|$|A picornavirus-like causes {{sacbrood}} disease. Affected larvae {{change from}} <b>pearly</b> white to gray and finally black. Death {{occurs when the}} larvae are upright, just before pupation. Consequently, affected larvae are usually found in capped cells. Head development of diseased larvae is typically retarded. The head region is usually darker {{than the rest of}} the body and may lean toward the center of the cell. When affected larvae are carefully removed from their cells, they appear to be a sac filled with water. Typically, the scales are brittle but easy to remove. Sacbrood-diseased larvae have no characteristic odor.|$|E
25|$|Lustre {{indicates}} how light reflects {{from the}} mineral's surface, {{with regards to}} its quality and intensity. There are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories. Metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are galena and pyrite. Non-metallic lustres include: adamantine, such as in diamond; vitreous, which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals; <b>pearly,</b> such as in talc and apophyllite, resinous, such {{as members of the}} garnet group, silky which common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform chrysotile.|$|E
25|$|The {{vocal folds}} are {{located within the}} larynx {{at the top of}} the trachea. They are {{attached}} posteriorly to the arytenoid cartilages, and anteriorly to the thyroid cartilage. They are part of the glottis which includes the rima glottidis. Their outer edges are attached to muscle in the larynx while their inner edges, or margins, are free forming the opening called the rima glottidis. They are constructed from epithelium, but they have a few muscle fibres in them, namely the vocalis muscle which tightens the front part of the ligament near to the thyroid cartilage. They are flat triangular bands and are <b>pearly</b> white in color. Above both sides of the glottis are the two vestibular folds or false vocal folds which have a small sac between them.|$|E

5000|$|Bren and Lucy {{are playing}} in the woods when Lucy finds the Golden Pine Cone, {{dangling}} from an alder branch. She and Bren walk home, but on their way, they meet a friendly, old, and hungry homeless man. They give him some thing to eat, and, {{as a reward for}} being so kind as to feed his hungry belly, he gives them his dog, Ooshka. That night, an evil giant named Nasookin comes, seeking the Golden Pine Cone, which is really an earring, belonging to Tekontha (Ooshka, who can talk, tells them this. They hide in the cow tunnel, as Nasookin cannot fit. The next day, Ooshka tells them to give the Golden Pine Cone to the Fish Hawk, who will fly it up to Tekontha's Valley, but he drops it into the Lake Snake's Mud Swamp, {{at the far end of}} the Big Lake. That night, the children go out to the Floating Island, which comes out of the water every full moon in the very middle of the lake. There lives the beautiful princess, Onamara. She tells them that she is Nasookin's wife, and that her Heart is at the bottom of the lake; the Pearl Folk live there. The children get sucked down in to the Wishing Pool on the Floating Island, which brings them to the Pearl Folk. The <b>Pearlies</b> tell them that the Lake Snake still has the pine cone, and, if they slay him, they will give them Onamara's Heart back. Bren and Lucy succeed, and come out of the Big Lake, landing by a slough, where they meet Head Goose. The next day, Head Goose and his friends find a net and use it to carry them and Ooshka to Tekontha'so Valley, but they crash and land in Nasookin's Valley, instead. Nasookin cares for them, and it is revealed he has a crush on Lucy (he nicknamed her [...] "Little Squirrel"), who thinks that he is not as bad as they had originally assumed. Months have now passed, and the forest is now blanketed with snow. Ooshka tells Bren and Lucy about the Cabin where they should run away to. When they get there, they meet the owner, Old Buffer. He cares for them, and gets the Squareheads to give them a ride to Tekontha's Valley, but the sleighs crash at the Ice Witch's castle. They kill her with an axe, and rivive a mammoth that was frozen by the Ice Witch. As a reward for saving him, the Mammoth then takes them the rest of the way to Tekontha's Valley, where they return the Golden Pine Cone, and free Ooshka and Nasookin of their crimes. Nasookin takes Bren and Lucy to Onamara, his wife, and they give her her Heart. Bren and Lucy are then safely returned to their parents.|$|R
25|$|Vermeer's {{mother-in-law}} Maria Thins owned Dirck van Baburen's 1622 oil-on-canvas The Procuress (or {{a copy of}} it), {{which appears}} {{in the background of}} two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a <b>pearly</b> light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, Dresden, Gemäldegalerie). Vermeer's two townscapes have also been attributed to this period: View of Delft (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and A street in Delft (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).|$|E
25|$|Fox species {{differ in}} fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from <b>pearly</b> white to {{black and white}} to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted {{to life in the}} desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool. Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick, {{insulating}} fur, which aid in keeping the body warm. Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with white marking. A fox's coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months. To get rid of the dense winter coat, foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins from the feet, up the legs, and then along the back. Coat color may also change as the individual ages.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the shell varies between 50mm and 165mm, its {{diameter}} between 100mm and 120mm. The large, ponderous, shell has a conical shape, appearing subperforate. It is covered by a corneous striate, brown or yellowish cuticle usually lost on the upper whorls. Its color beneath the cuticle is white, longitudinally striped with crimson, violet or reddish brown. The base of the shell is maculate or radiately strigate with a lighter shade of the same. The spire is strictly conical. The apex is acute, usually eroded. The shell contains 8-10 whorls. The upper ones are tuberculate at the sutures, and spirally beaded, the following flat on their outer surfaces, smooth, separated by linear suture. The body whorl is expanded, dilated and compressed at the obtuse periphery, more or less convex below, indented at the axis. The umbilical tract is covered by a spiral <b>pearly</b> deeply entering callus. The aperture is transverse and very oblique. The columella is oblique, terminating in a denticle below, and with a strong spiral fold above, deeply inserted into the axis. The operculum is circular, thin, corneous, orange-brown, and composed of about 10 whorls.|$|E
25|$|The Mafia boss Uncle Enzo {{begins to}} take a {{paternal}} interest in Y.T. Impressed by her attitude and initiative, he arranges to meet her and offers her freelance jobs. Hiro's investigations and Y.T.'s intelligence gathering begin to coincide, with links between the neuro-linguistic viruses, a religious organization known as Reverend Wayne's <b>Pearly</b> Gates and a media magnate named L. Bob Rife beginning to emerge. Juanita's research showed that the ancient Sumerian ur-language allowed brain function to be 'programmed' using audio stimuli {{in conjunction with a}} DNA altering virus. Sumerian culture was organized around these programs (known as me) which were administered by priests to the populace. Enki, a figure of legend, developed a counter-virus (known as the nam-shub of Enki) which when delivered stopped the Sumerian language from being processed by the brain and {{led to the development of}} other, less literal languages, giving birth to the Babel myth. L. Bob Rife had been collecting Sumerian artifacts and developed the drug Snow Crash in order to make the public vulnerable to new forms of me which he would control. The physical form of the virus is distributed in the form of an addictive drug and within Reverend Wayne's church via infected blood. There is also a digital version to which hackers are especially vulnerable as they are accustomed to processing information in binary form.|$|E
