25|$|Filene's philanthropy, {{combined}} with the <b>practical</b> <b>implementation</b> efforts of his associate Roy Bergengren were critical {{to the emergence of}} credit unions across the United States. Unlike the credit unions of Germany or Quebec, most credit unions in the US emerged from an employer-based bond of association. In addition to the traditional information and enforcement advantages resulting from the fact that members shared the same workplace, the employer-based bond permitted credit unions to use future paychecks as collateral.|$|E

The main findings supported the conclusion that there were no physical nor technological obstacles to the <b>practical</b> <b>implementation</b> of MSRs. A reduction in activity occurred after 1986 due to the Chernobyl accident, along with a general stagnation of nuclear power and the nuclear industry.|$|E

25|$|The {{generation}} of standard SSB modulation results in large envelope overshoots {{well above the}} average envelope level for a sinusoidal tone (even when the audio signal is peak-limited). The standard SSB envelope peaks are due to truncation of the spectrum and nonlinear phase distortion from the approximation errors of the <b>practical</b> <b>implementation</b> of the required Hilbert transform. It was recently shown that suitable overshoot compensation (so-called controlled-envelope single-sideband modulation or CESSB) achieves about 3.8dB of peak reduction for speech transmission. This results in an effective average power increase of about 140%.|$|E
25|$|The Djinn was {{developed}} {{to function as a}} <b>practical</b> <b>implementation</b> of the earlier experimental Sud-Ouest Ariel rotorcraft. Atypically, the rotors were driven by compressed-air jets {{at the end of each}} blade, which had the benefit of eliminating the need for an anti-torque tail rotor. On 2 January 1953, the proof-of-concept S.O.1220 performed its maiden flight; it was followed by the first of the S.O.1221 Djinn prototypes on 16 December 1953. During the subsequence test program, one of the prototypes was recorded as having achieved a world altitude record.|$|E

25|$|During the Age of Enlightenment and in {{the early}} nineteenth century, England was the place where {{vegetarian}} ideas were more welcome than anywhere else in Europe, and the English vegetarians were particularly enthusiastic about the <b>practical</b> <b>implementation</b> of their principles. In England, vegetarianism was strongest in the northern and middle regions, specifically urbanized areas. As vegetarianism spread across the country, more working-class people began to identify as vegetarians, though still a small number in comparison to the number of meat eaters in the country. Though there were established groups all across England, the movement failed to gain popular support and was drowned out by other, more exciting, struggles of the late-nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish-speaking {{areas in}} Finnish Mainland {{do not have}} fixed {{territorial}} protection, unlike the languages of several national minorities in Central Europe such as German in Belgium and North Italy. This has caused heated debate among Swedish-speaking Finns. The current language act of Finland has been criticized as inadequate instrument to protect the linguistic rights of Swedish-speaking Finns in practice. The criticism was partly legitimized by the report (2008) conducted by Finnish government which showed severe problems in the <b>practical</b> <b>implementation</b> of the language act. The recent administrative reforms in Finland have caused harsh criticism in the Swedish-speaking media and created fear over the survival of Swedish as an administrative language in Finland. A special status in the form partial self-determination and fixed protection for Swedish language in Swedish-speaking municipalities have been proposed in Finland's Swedish-speaking media.|$|E

500|$|Thirty years later, {{this work}} inspired, independently, two {{research}} groups {{to adopt the}} H-phosphonate chemistry to the solid-phase synthesis using nucleoside H-phosphonate monoesters 7 as building blocks and pivaloyl chloride, 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (TPS-Cl), and other compounds as activators. [...] The <b>practical</b> <b>implementation</b> of H-phosphonate method resulted {{in a very short}} and simple synthetic cycle consisting of only two steps, detritylation and coupling (Scheme 2). Oxidation of internucleosidic H-phosphonate diester linkages in 8 to phosphodiester linkages in 9 with a solution of iodine in aqueous pyridine is carried {{out at the end of}} the chain assembly rather than as a step in the synthetic cycle. If desired, the oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions. Alternatively, 8 can be converted to phosphorothioate 10 or phosphoroselenoate 11 (X = Se), or oxidized by CCl4 in the presence of primary or secondary amines to phosphoramidate analogs 12. The method is very convenient in that various types of phosphate modifications (phosphate/phosphorothioate/phosphoramidate) may be introduced to the same oligonucleotide for modulation of its properties.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} and DVD set titled , author Laurence Rees {{indicates}} that although Gröning had requested to leave Auschwitz after he witnessed the killing, his objection was only {{on the basis of}} its <b>practical</b> <b>implementation,</b> and not on the general militaristic principle of the mass extermination of enemies. Gröning said that he thought at the time that it was justified due to all the Nazi propaganda he had been subjected to, in that Germany's enemies were being destroyed, which to him made the tools of their destruction (such as gas chambers) of no particular significance. Because of this, he says his feelings about seeing people and knowing that they had hours to live before being gassed were [...] "very ambiguous". He explains that children were murdered because, while the children themselves were not the enemy, the danger was the blood within them, in that they could grow up to become dangerous Jews. Rees points to Gröning's ultra-nationalist upbringing as indication of how he was able to justify the extermination of helpless children. Gröning says that the horrors in the gas chambers did eventually dawn on him when he heard the screams.|$|E
