Experimental results are evaluated in three conditions. First, a fixed pressure value is set and flow value is varied as step. Second, a fixed flow value is set while varying pressure value. Final, both <b>pressure</b> and <b>flow</b> value is simultaneously varied. All results show good control performance by which both <b>pressure</b> and <b>flow</b> rate can reach to set point in all condition.

However, other parameters are also important as well, such as power, <b>pressure,</b> <b>flow</b> rate, frequency, electrode gap and reactor configuration. Low flow rates usually only depend {{on the amount of}} reactive species present for polymerization, whereas high flow rates depend on {{the amount of time that}} is spent in the reactor. Therefore, the maximum rate of polymerization is somewhere in the middle.|$|E

50|$|An {{objection}} {{leveled against}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>flow</b> mechanism {{is that it}} does not explain the phenomenon of bidirectional movement i.e. movement of different substances in opponent directions at the same time. The phenomenon of bidirectional movement can be demonstrated by applying two different substances at the same time to the phloem of a stem at two different points, and following their longitudinal movement along the stem. If the mechanism of translocation operates according to <b>pressure</b> <b>flow</b> hypothesis, bidirectional movement in a single sieve tube is not possible. Experiments to demonstrate bidirectional movement in a single sieve tube are technically very difficult to perform. Some experiments indicate that bidirectional movement may occur in a single sieve tube, whereas others do not.|$|E
