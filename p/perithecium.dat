50|$|The {{oogonium}} and antheridium, {{which are}} formed where two neighboring hyphae approach, each contain a single nucleus. The cell wall between these organs is dissolved {{at the time}} of fertilization and the male and female nuclei unite, and a fresh wall is laid down between the two organs.Now the wall of the future <b>perithecium</b> beings to form by the development of a number of upright hyphal branches around the oogonium, forming a pseudo-parenchymatous tissue, while the other branches later absorbed grow into the interior of the developing <b>perithecium,</b> while the outer cell walls become flattened and darker in color. Like other species in Sphaerotheca, S. castagnei contains only a single ascus. The cell in which the egg nucleus develops and is fertilized (the carpogonium) elongates, divides and a curved row of 5 or 6 cells is formed. The penultimate cell of this row contains two large nuclei; while the other cells of the row have one nucleus each. The young ascus develops from this penultimate cell in which the two nuclei fuse following a rapid increase {{in the size of the}} ascus; which presses against the inner wall cells of the <b>perithecium</b> and absorbs them. The nucleus of the ascus finally divides three times, producing the nuclei of the eight ascospores; which subsequently are formed by free cell formation. From the half-grown <b>perithecium</b> there arise hyphae which grow out as the appendages. These appendages serve to attach the perithecia to plants.|$|E
5000|$|The disease cycle for Septoria {{cannabis}} {{is identical}} to that of Septoria tritici [...] or Septoria of tomato except {{for the production of}} a <b>perithecium</b> instead of a pseudothecium. Being that it is a polycyclic disease, it can asexually produce conidia in a pycnidium which continually inoculates new hosts throughout the growing season, as well as sexually produce ascospores in a <b>perithecium</b> which acts as an overwintering structure. The disease survives on plant debris from the previous growing season as ascospores in a <b>perithecium,</b> as well as mycelium on the epidermal tissue layers of leaves. The thick cell wall of the ascospores provides protection and allows for the disease to remain in the infected growing area until favorable conditions return. When the conditions are favorable (summer-fall) the spores are released and carried by wind or raindrops to a nearby host. Once infected the disease quickly spreads via the production of conidia in the secondary cycle which is accompanied by the sexual production of ascospores. Pycnidium are formed on the leaf lesions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cell wall}} of C. cupreum is largely {{composed}} of chitin and glucan, which {{is reflected in}} the large number of acquired genes encoding class V chitin synthase and glucan synthase found in the C. cupreum cDNA. The vegetative mycelium is profusely branched, septate and multicellular; the mycelial cells are multinucleate. The species is distinguished from other Chaetomium species by a high frequency of boat-shaped ascospores and copper coloured terminal hairs. The fruiting bodies occur {{on the surface of the}} substratum and are attached by undifferentiated rhizoids. The perithecia of C. cupreum are ovate in shape and copper colored with dimensions of 110-120 x 120-130 μm. The presence of long, thin hairs on the outer surface of the <b>perithecium</b> is a characteristic feature of Chaetomium (Gr. χαίτη = long hair). In C. cupreum, these hairs are numerous, thin, septate lateral hairs with a base 3.0-3.5 μm in diameter. Hairs at the apex of the <b>perithecium</b> are rigid, septate, 4.5-6.0 μm in diameter with 1-2 spirals. The apical hairs are covered with small copper coloured granules whose pigment is soluble in alcohol, ether, cellosolve, xylol but insoluble in water. Club-shaped asci measuring 38 × 13 μm develop in clusters n the interior, basal part of the <b>perithecium.</b> Each ascus contains 8 reddish ascospores that are boat shaped with dimensions of 10.0 × 5.5μm. The walls of the asci are mucilaginous and disintegrate, causing the ascospores to remain inside the <b>perithecium</b> at maturity, embedded in mucilaginous jelly. The ascospores and the mucilaginous matrix form a paste that is extruded through the apical opening in the the <b>perithecium</b> producing [...] "cirrhi" [...] resembling toothpaste squeezed out from a toothpaste tube. Chaetomium cupreum is intermediate between the species: C. trilaterale Chivers and C. aureum Chivers. C. aureum and C. cupreum both produce conspicuous cirrhi while C. trilaterale does not. The ascospores of C. cupreum are similar shape but larger than C. aureum. The pigment produced by C. trilaterale in agar cultures is water soluble while the granules produced on C. cupreum are insoluble.|$|E
50|$|Lichens {{reproduce}} {{by means}} of spores or vegetatively. This characteristic is also seen in free-living fungi and many other plants. There are three common spore-bearing structures found in lichens: the apothecium, the <b>perithecium</b> and the pycnidium. The apothecium is described as being either sessile or immersed. The thallus is known as sessile if it sits atop the surface of its growth medium. If the apothecium is level with or sits below the surface it is known as immersed. The second form of spore-bearing structure is a <b>perithecium</b> which refers to the complete immersion in the substratum of rock or bark. Finally, the pycnidium, commonly seen {{on the surface of}} foliose lichen and crustose lichen, are absent in fruticose lichens.|$|E
50|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, Bipolaris maydis {{also has}} a sexual stage with ascospores, but this has only been observed in laboratory culture. Its ascospores (within asci) {{are found in the}} ascocarp Cochiobolus, a type of <b>perithecium</b> rare in nature. Thus, the main route of SCLB infection is asexual via conidial infection.|$|E
50|$|The {{three most}} common spore body types are raised discs called apothecia (singular: apothecium), bottle-like cups {{with a small}} hole at the top called perithecia (singular: <b>perithecium),</b> and pycnidia (singular: pycnidium), shaped like perithecia but without asci (an ascus is the {{structure}} that contains and releases the sexual spores in fungi of the Ascomycota).|$|E
50|$|This {{is similar}} to a <b>perithecium,</b> but the asci are not {{regularly}} organised into a hymenium and they are bitunicate, having a double wall that expands when it takes up water and shoots the enclosed spores out suddenly to disperse them. Example species are Apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) and the horse chestnut disease Guignardia aesculi.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the above}} {{features}} N. crassa {{was found to be}} very useful for the study of genetic events occurring in individual meioses. Mature asci from a <b>perithecium</b> can be separated on a microscope slide and the spores experimentally manipulated. These studies usually involved the separate culture of individual ascospores resulting from a single meiotic event and determining the genotype of each spore. Studies of this type, carried out in several different laboratories, established the phenomenon of “gene conversion” (e.g. see references).|$|E
50|$|All {{species in}} the genus Petriella have a Graphium state, {{characterized}} by dark synnemata and round, single-celled spores in the mucus. Dimorphic pore openings produce condia to form mucoid balls at the synnemata apex, which is similarly found in Lectographium lundbergii. The spores are sexual, non-motile condiophores. The <b>perithecium</b> in which the sexual spores are borne is pale to dark brown colour, 75-125μm in diameter with scattered hairs along the neck. It is thought that expression of the slime-spored Graphium may be induced by certain environmental conditions.|$|E
50|$|Perithecium: These are flask shaped {{structures}} opening by a pore or ostiole (short papilla opening by {{a circular}} pore) {{through which the}} ascospores escape. The ostiolar canal may be lined by hair-like structures called periphyses. The unitunicate asci are usually cylindrical in shape, borne on a stipe (stalk), released from a pore, developed from the inner wall of the <b>perithecium</b> and arise from a basal plectenchyma-centrum. Examples are members of Sphaeriales and Hypocreales. Perithecia are also found in Xylaria (Dead Man’s Fingers, Candle Snuff) and Nectria.|$|E
5000|$|Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae (sexual) and Phomopsis sojae (asexual) overwinter as mycelia in {{infected}} {{seeds and}} plant debris. This {{serves as the}} primary inoculum. [...] In the spring, pycnidium are produced on plant debris and the petioles of abscise leaves. In the early summer perithecia develop on decaying stem tissue. The <b>perithecium</b> contain asci while the pycnidium releases conidia. Spores will germinate and penetrate through primarily immature or wounded tissue. Spores need at least 24 hours of free moisture to cause infection. The spores can then spread into mycelium and form perithecia and pycnidia.|$|E
50|$|Most lichen fungi {{belong to}} Ascomycetes (ascolichens). Among the ascolichens, spores are {{produced}} in spore-producing structures called ascomata. The most common types of ascomata are the apothecium (plural: apothecia) and <b>perithecium</b> (plural: perithecia). Apothecia are usually cups or plate-like discs {{located on the}} top surface of the lichen thallus. When apothecia are shaped like squiggly line segments instead of like discs, they are called lirellae. Perithecia are shaped like flasks that are immersed in the lichen thallus tissue, which has a small hole for the spores to escape the flask, and appear like black dots on the lichen surface.|$|E
50|$|Ceratomyces is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Ceratomycetaceae. There are {{approximately}} 20 identified species for this genus, with most species occurring on Tropisternus (Hydrophilidae, Coleoptera) from America. According to Tavares and Shen et al. The genus {{is characterized by a}} receptacle of usually 3-4 cells, outer wall cells ﬂattened in alternate vertical rows, other 2 rows with subequal or conspicuously longer and narrower cells, rows usually appearing 3 across, wall cell tiers usually 20 or more (rarely as few as 13), and a <b>perithecium</b> with a slender subterminal or terminal horn (usually multicellular) on only one side.|$|E
5000|$|Members of the Loramycetaceae family lack stromata, {{the compact}} mass of {{mycelium}} (with or without host tissue) that supports fruit bodies or in which fruiting bodies are produced. The ascomata, which are formed within a gelatinous matrix, are deeply cup-shaped, {{almost like a}} <b>perithecium.</b> The outer tissue layer of the ascomata is thin-walled and transclucent. The ascospores are 2-septate, transclucent, and have a long basal cellular appendage with a gelatinous sheath. This sheath is thought {{to play the role}} of a [...] "flotation mechanism", and ultimately give the ascospores a greater chance to become attached to the upper part of the host plant.|$|E
50|$|As an ascomycete, Ceratocystis coerulescens {{produces}} ascospores encased as {{groups of}} eight in asci. The asci {{are protected by}} a <b>perithecium,</b> a flask-shaped ascocarp, in which the pathogen overwinters. Ascospores are the sexual spores and are far less common than the asexual spores known as conidia. The conidia form on conidiophores without a sporocarp. C. coerulescens has two mating types referred to as Mat-1 and Mat-2, {{but it is not}} a strictly heterothalic species. The Mat-1 type is self-sterile and must cross with Mat-2 to produce perithecia. However, the Mat-2 type is self-fertile and half of the progeny from a Mat-2 selfing are Mat-1.|$|E
50|$|A mature <b>perithecium</b> {{may contain}} {{as many as}} 300 asci, each derived from {{identical}} fusion diploid nuclei. Ordinarily, in nature, when the perithecia mature the ascospores are ejected rather violently into the air. These ascospores are heat resistant and, in the lab, require heating at 60 °C for 30 minutes to induce germination. For normal strains, the entire sexual cycle takes 10 to 15 days. In a mature ascus containing eight ascospores, pairs of adjacent spores are identical in genetic constitution, since the last division is mitotic, and since the ascospores are contained in the ascus sac that holds them in a definite order determined by the direction of nuclear segregations during meiosis. Since the four primary products are also arranged in sequence, a first division segregation pattern of genetic markers can be distinguished from a second division segregation pattern.|$|E
50|$|The Pyricularia genus {{includes}} {{species that}} are pathogenic {{on a wide range}} of monocot plants. For example, Pyricularia oryzae (sexual morph Magnaporthe oryzae), the causal agent of the rice blast disease, is one of the most widely distributed diseases of rice, and is highly destructive leading to up to 30% yield loss worldwide. Pyricularia oryzae isolates from rice are mostly host-specific and infect only few host plants beside rice (barley and Lolium). Pyricularia oryzae isolates from other host plants such as Eleusine, Setaria and Triticum are also host-specific, and unable to infect rice. The closely related species P. oryzae and Pyricularia grisea are indistinguishable in morphology of conidium, <b>perithecium</b> and ascopore. Pyricularia grisea isolates from Digitaria were shown to form a distinct clade by phylogenetic analysis and infect crabgrass (Digitaria), but not other hosts. However, some P. oryzae isolates from rice and other grasses and some P. grisea isolates from crabgrass were described to show cross-infectivity on crabgrass and rice, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Eutypella parasitica is {{characterized}} as an ascomycete fungus that produces fruiting bodies called perithecia. When conditions are favorable (moderate temperature and high humidity), the <b>perithecium</b> will produce sexual spores called ascospores which are dispersed {{primarily by the}} wind. If they land on the susceptible host they may enter through a wound and establish themselves in the xylem tissue of the host. Each year, the fungus kills the callus material formed by the tree and invades more cambium during the growing season. During the summer months, the fungus is also able to produce asexual spores called conidia that are dispersed by the wind {{to be used as}} secondary inoculum to infect other maple trees in the area. Upon dispersal, they potentially land on a susceptible host which induces the spore to germinate and produce mycelia. At the end of the season, the fungus produces perithecia. Then, the fungus can overwinter as perithecia or as mycelia in the host. Due to the slow development of the disease, these fruiting bodies are not produced until 5-8 years after initial infection. Once they are produced they can be visible with very close observation {{in the center of the}} canker, which can give it a speckled, gritty appearance.|$|E
50|$|Hypoxylon canker {{of shade}} trees has three primary species, {{through which the}} {{pathogen}} can infect a variety of hardwood shade trees. Hypoxylon atropunctatum is most commonly found on oak, Hypoxylon mammatum is a significant pathogen on aspen trees, and Hypoxylon tinctor infects sycamore trees (2,3,16). In order to tell if the pathogen is affecting the tree, the bark must be closely examined, but the symptoms are distinct. Early stages of the disease show a light brown and tan color that looks dry and dusty. Later on, as the pathogen goes through the sexual stage, the bark will turn to a dark grey color. The bark becomes brittle and flakes off (2) and black and grey cankers will appear (3). Because these changes are indications of a disease, these are symptoms. They demonstrate that the pathogen is present and infecting or has already infested the host. Hypoxylon also produces characteristic signs, which are either going to be direct products of the pathogen or {{the appearance of the}} pathogen itself. The signs we can see from Hypoxylon are conidia and ascospores. Conidia are produced during the asexual stage, while ascospores are produced during the sexual stage (4,7). You can sometimes see the conidia with the naked eye if they are structuralized, but {{it is much easier to}} see them under a dissecting microscope. When looking underneath a compound microscope, you will be able to see the ascospores. They will be located on perithecia. The microscopic signs of the <b>perithecium</b> are the flask-shaped sexual fruiting body that contains ascospores. Lastly, the pathogen is going to be found primarily just beneath the bark of the trees, located throughout the tree and if the pathogen spreads. The pathogen can also spread to the bark of surrounding trees (3). If you start to see symptoms on the main trunk, the tree is likely too diseased to save, since the trunk is the spot where the nutrients and water are transported. Once Hypoxylon is active on the main trunk, there is no other way for the water and nutrients to get to the rest of the tree and thus it dies. Fortunately, if Hypoxylon is found on the branches or limbs there is a good chance the tree will live if the fungus does not spread. Pruning out the limbs and branches that look like they have the disease on it or are dying will solve the problem (2).|$|E
40|$|The {{homothallic}} ascomycete fungus Gibberella zeae is a {{plant pathogen}} that is found worldwide, causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) in cereal crops and ear rot of maize. Ascospores formed in fruiting bodies (i. e., perithecia) are hypothesized {{to be the}} primary inocula for FHB disease. <b>Perithecium</b> development is a complex cellular differentiation process controlled by many developmentally regulated genes. In this study, we selected a previously reported putative transcription factor containing the Myb DNA-binding domain MYT 2 for an in-depth study on sexual development. The deletion of MYT 2 resulted in a larger <b>perithecium,</b> while its overexpression resulted in a smaller <b>perithecium</b> when compared to the wild-type strain. These data suggest that MYT 2 regulates <b>perithecium</b> size differentiation. MYT 2 overexpression affected pleiotropic phenotypes including vegetative growth, conidia production, virulence, and mycotoxin production. Nuclear localization of the MYT 2 protein supports its role as a transcriptional regulator. Transcriptional analyses of trichothecene synthetic genes suggest that MYT 2 additionally functions as a suppressor for trichothecene production. This is the first study characterizing a transcription factor required for <b>perithecium</b> size differentiation in G. zeae, and it provides a novel angle for understandin...|$|E
40|$|As Gibberella zeae infects during crop flowering, {{knowledge}} of the timing of formation of perithecia {{in the field is}} important in designing novel control methods. To evaluate the timing of <b>perithecium</b> formation, we collected wheat and corn stubble from commercial fields yearround from 1997 to 2000. We analyzed the timing of <b>perithecium</b> formation relative to local temperature and rainfall...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium graminearum, {{a devastating}} {{pathogen}} of small grains, overwinters on crop residues and produces ephemeral perithecia. Accumulation of lipids in overwintering hyphae would provide reserves for overwinter survival and <b>perithecium</b> development. Fatty acid composition of cultures during <b>perithecium</b> development indicated {{a drop in}} neutral lipid levels during development but little change in fatty acid composition across stages. Microscopic examination of cultures early in sexual development revealed hyphal cells engorged with lipid bodies. In comparison, vegetative hyphae contained few lipid bodies. Microarray analysis was performed on wheat stems at stages of colonization through <b>perithecium</b> development. Gene expression analysis during stages of <b>perithecium</b> development both in planta and in vitro (previously published) supports the view that lipid biosynthesis occurs during early stages of wheat colonization leading to sexual development and that lipid oxidation occurs as perithecia are developing. Analysis of gene expression during the stages of wheat stem colonization also revealed sets of genes unique to these stages. These results {{support the view that}} lipids accumulate in hyphae colonizing wheat stalks and are subsequently used in <b>perithecium</b> formation on stalk tissue. These results indicate that extensive colonization of plant tissue prior to harvest is essential for subsequent sporulation on crop residues and, thus, has important implications for inoculum reduction...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium graminearum is the {{predominant}} {{component of the}} Fusarium head blight complex of wheat. F. graminearum ascospores, which initiate head infection, mature in perithecia on crop residues and become airborne. The effects of temperature (T) and moisture on <b>perithecium</b> production and maturation and on ascospore production on maize stalk residues were determined. In the laboratory, perithecia were produced at temperatures between 5 and 30 °C (the optimum was 21. 7 °C), but matured only at 20 and 25 °C. Perithecia were produced when relative humidity (RH) was ≥ 75 % but matured only when RH was ≥ 85 %; <b>perithecium</b> production and maturation increased with RH. Equations were developed describing <b>perithecium</b> production and maturation over time {{as a function of}} T and RH (R 2 > 0. 96). Maize stalks were also placed outdoors on three substrates: a grass lawn exposed to rain; a constantly wet, sponge-like foam exposed to rain; and a grass lawn protected from rain. No perithecia were produced on stalks protected from rain. Perithecia production and maturation were significantly higher on the constantly wet foam than on the intermittently wet lawn (both exposed to rain). Ascospore numbers but not their dispersal patterns were also affected by the substrate...|$|E

40|$|The a mating-type {{region of}} Neurospora crassa {{controls}} several major events {{in both the}} sexual and asexual phases of the fungal life cycle. This 3235 -base-pair DNA segment is not homologous to the comparable genetic region of the A mating type. The unique a and A regions are bordered by nearly identical DNA sequences.
