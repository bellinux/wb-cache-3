Thus, {{capital accounts}} serve to reconcile the entitlements and obligations of the partners upon liquidation. For example, if all partnership assets were sold for a fair market value and all liabilities were paid, the remaining cash, if any, would be equal to the partner's equity in the <b>partnership</b> at <b>fair</b> market value. Tax capital accounts are partners' [...] "Outside Basis" [...] (however, unlike outside basis, the partnership's recourse and nonrecourse liabilities {{are not included in}} partners' tax-basis capital accounts) and under Section 722 are initially determined by reference to the partner's contributed cash amount and the adjusted basis of the contributed property. Thereafter, other allocations that either increase or decrease a partner's basis will be reflected in the account. A partner's 'outside basis' is separate and distinct from the partnership's 'inside basis'. Under Section 723, a partnership's 'inside basis' is the adjusted basis of the contributed property or the value of the contributed cash.

The merits and drawbacks of oil palm as a smallholder crop are then analysed, based on household socio-economic surveys conducted in 2007 – 2010. The main causes of conflicts between oil palm companies and communities are unclear land tenure, and a recurrent lack of leadership in smallholders’ cooperatives.

40|$|Involvement in {{collaborative}} {{partnerships in}} natural resource management {{has become a}} popular method for natural resource management agencies to collect public input, cope with conflicts, and develop ecosystem management plans. This thesis evaluates various collaborative processes, emphasizing multiple-owner partnerships. Qualitative interviews of 46 landowners in Utah were conducted to reveal concerns and suggestions regarding multiple-owner landscape-level collaborative partnerships. Landowners were concerned about private property rights infringement and losing control of their private land. Landowners were primarily concerned about the fairness and effectiveness of any partnership {{in which they were}} involved. However, they were willing to consider participating if certain procedural and group composition elements were met: realistic goals; compromise or consensus-based decision-making; time efficiency; participant commitment, especially by public land management officials; more weight given to local concerns than non-local concerns; participant knowledge of local ecosystems; and respect among participants. A follow-up study with participants of eight collaborative partnerships in four western states examined the importance of the procedural and group composition elements identified from the landowner interviews, plus one from a literature review, i. e., that participants feel that they have some control and/or a voice in the process. Analysis revealed that all but one of these elements - more weight given to local concerns - were associated with participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions that their <b>partnership</b> was <b>fair</b> and effective. These elements can be used as guidelines for emerging collaborative partnerships. Participants were overwhelmingly positive in their evaluations of their partnerships, suggesting that there are real benefits of using collaborative processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 15 years, {{the trend of}} NGOs working in {{cooperation}} with business has developed considerably. The global community – including leaders of international governmental institutions and of the non-profit sector {{as well as some}} business leaders – has recognized the importance of including business in the process of international development. NGOs, on the other hand, have become instrumental in development work internationally, but they generally do not have the means and resources to carry out their projects efficiently in a sustainable manner. This is why engaging business with the public and non-profit sectors to find common solutions to problems has been an increasing trend globally. The first section of this paper analyzes the general trend of increasing interaction between the public and the private sector. It outlines some of the benefits of partnerships to both corporations and NGOs, the practical difficulties they present, and the elements necessary to establishing a healthy collaboration between both actors.

The Sustainable Palm Oil Production (SPOP) project, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR), was aimed at consolidating and deepening the scientific basis of these schemes. - SPOP field work undertaken in Indonesia and Cameroon highlighted the large variability in practices and impacts of oil palm systems. Our main results related to the uncovering of the multiplicity of growers and their trajectories, and identifying room for improvement and the need for recommendations adapted to the various grower contexts and strategies. - The SPOP project made it explicit that visions of sustainability and global challenges vary greatly among growers and other stakeholders involved in the palm oil sector. These diverging conceptions are most likely to induce bottlenecks in the definition and implementation of good practices and should be accounted for in the refinement of sustainability criteria. - Within the SPOP project, we investigated possible futures for oil palm using participatory prospective analyses and multi-agent-based modeling work. Our research work showed that capacity development and the organizational capacity of smallholders, <b>fair</b> <b>partnerships</b> and combined forms of governance are key drivers in ensuring the uptake of good practices and sustainable development at the landscape scale.

40|$|This report {{reflects}} on a collaborative advocacy research project I undertook in <b>partnership</b> with the <b>Fair</b> Fare Coalition (FFC), a transit activist and advocacy organization in Toronto. The {{project is a}} community-based research project on transit affordability involving the participation of low-income Torontonians throughout the city. The purpose was to bring together voices that are usually excluded from official city planning discourses and decision-making processes to highlight some of the frequently unaccounted for "costs" of increasing transit fares in Toronto – for example, on individual and community health and well-being. Through this, the Fair Fare Coalition hoped to build capacity and mobilize knowledge towards advocating for policy measures to increase transit affordability in Toronto. The participatory project's goals and outcomes are twofold. One goal is for the participatory process to culminate in a project deliverable {{that could be used}} for advocacy purposes in support of the Fair Fare Coalition's advocacy goals. The second goal is increasing community knowledge-building and mobilization, including ongoing political and advocacy actions. This is to highlight the fact that both the process and outcome are valuable and important. For the purposes of this report, I will contextualize and situate the significance of the FFC project in Toronto, providing background, exploring relevant literature, and explaining the importance of the research methodology. I will then share brief findings from the research, and provide analysis of both the outcomes and process of the research project...|$|R

He endeavours to get over my objections to accepting his liberality (supposing me to entertain them) by assuring me his conduct is founded on a sage selfishness. This is diverting enough. I suppose the Commissioners of, Police will next send me a letter of condolence, begging my acceptance of a broom, a shovel, and a scavenger's greatcoat, and assuring me that they had appointed me to all the emoluments of a well-frequented crossing.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Public Health and awarded by Brunel University. There {{has been an increase}} in empirical evidence indicating an association between governance and health systems, suggesting that better governed countries tend to have healthier populations with better performing health systems. This is an important finding, as it could point to structural public health interventions having a greater impact on health systems performance than individually targeted interventions. This doctoral thesis in public health (DrPH) from Brunel University is a compilation of three independent research projects undertaken under different settings, converging in the examination of the relationship between governance and health systems. The first project was a study conducted in the African region of the World Health Organization with the aim of understanding how and to what extent measures of governance are statistically correlated with performance of health systems as measured by a key health outcome: the under-five child mortality. The second project was a case study from a high income country in Europe during the period in which it went through an economic meltdown, the focus being a qualitative analysis {{of the extent to which}} the response to economic crisis influenced public health policy making and short term performance of the health system. The third project was a policy analysis carried out in an upper middle income country in Asia and the focus was to examine how the long history of health financing reform has influenced the performance of the health system. All research projects indicate an association between governance and health systems and the case studies provide empirical evidence of how health systems are affected by governance quality. The African study shows a statistically positive relationship between governance indicators and health outcomes, suggesting better governed countries to have lower child mortality. The European and the Asian cases suggest accountability, responsiveness, transparency and <b>fair</b> <b>partnership</b> to be important governance qualities for successful policy making and reforms. This evidence could be of use to current and future policy makers and others with the authority to configure and implement new public health policies. It indicates the importance of comprehensive analytical work prior to policy making with easy access to documents and fair participation with all stakeholders to increase the probability of reaching consensus oriented policy proposals followed by successful implementations. The main contribution of this thesis is to provide evidence through robust statistical/ qualitative analysis around the association between governance and health systems in countries at all income levels. The originality is located in the breadth (three different settings) as well as depth (three distinct, robust methods) of this kind of research. The congruence of findings regardless of study locations, the outcome measures used or types of methods applied have added to the growing evidence that there is a strong correlation between governance and health systems performance. This increased knowledge provides policy makers with additional evidence which can be applied to develop and improve governance with the aim of allocating public resources more efficiently and equitably. However, further research is required on governance and its link to health systems, inter alia how health equity is affected by selective partnership in the decision making processes and how political ideologies influence governance practices...|$|R
