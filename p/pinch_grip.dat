40|$|AbstractSince {{a robotic}} hand {{equipped}} with three-axis tactile sensors can detect not only grasped force caused by pinching motion but also slippage generated by sliding fingers, {{it can be}} applied to various tasks such as cap twisting, exploring object shape and detecting hardness. Although thin sheet handling {{is considered one of the}} more difficult tasks in robotics because of object flexibility and thinness, the versatility of the hand seems to accomplish this task. In this paper, we evaluate the sensing ability of this sheet thickness to obtain basic data for handling and turning thin flexible sheets. In this experiment, we used 1, 000 -yen bills as specimens because they have precise and stable size and mechanical properties. Experimental results showed that the robotic hand could not distinguish sheet numbers through a <b>pinching</b> <b>grip</b> causing normal force but could distinguish them through sliding fingers causing tangential force...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although {{researchers}} have studied various parameters that affect grip force, few studies investigate {{the effects of}} tactile sensation on pinch force. This study aims to determine the influences of tactile sensation on pinch force with a special emphasis on screw knobs under loaded and unloaded conditions. The participants included 32 manual workers who were required to pinch and turn the knobs to generate pinch force under reduced and increased sensations simulated using cotton and nitrile gloves. The data were analysed using the analysis of variance via Minitab 16. Results show that the pinch force exerted for reduced sensations is {{higher than that of}} increased sensations because the reduced friction increased skin-object slippages, which caused participants to spontaneously increase their force to prevent slippages. This study serves as a guideline to potentially improve the design of objects operated with <b>pinch</b> <b>grips</b> to be safe and suitable for manual, sedentary or general tasks...|$|R

40|$|TRIZ, a Russian {{abbreviation}} {{known as}} the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, refers to a methodology for problem-solving rooted in logic and data rather than intuition. It promotes the ability to solve problems creatively. Using TRIZ tools for problem-solving such as the cause-effect-chain analysis and engineering contradiction, a new ergonomic milling machine control knob was developed for improved musculoskeletal comfort. The major improvisations from the original milling machine knob included its spherical shape design, the indentations to accommodate a lateral pinch {{and the addition of}} a rubbery material for increased sensation. In the validation test, it was found that this new and improved ergonomic milling machine control knob was able {{to reduce the amount of}} pinch force by about 72 % for males and 55 % for females compared to the original knob, hence potentially eliminating risks of overexertion in <b>pinch</b> <b>grips.</b> This solution potentially reduces occupational injuries and cumulative trauma disorders. An implicit benefit is that the quality of machined parts using the milling machine can be potentially enhanced due to better control of the machine knobs that could eventually lead to the reduction of rejects and reworks, which also translates to improved productivity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDespite the {{paramount}} {{function of the}} thumb in daily life, thumb biomechanical models have been little developed and studied. Moreover, only two studies provided quantitative anthropometric data of tendon moment arms. To investigate thumb tendon tensions, biomechanicians and clinicians {{have to know the}} performances and the limits of these two data sets. The aim of this study was thus to compare the results of these two models and evaluate their performances in regard to prior electromyographic measurements (EMG). Thumb posture was recorded during the classical key pinch and pulp <b>pinch</b> <b>grips.</b> Various fingertip forces applied at the distal segment were simulated in a range including extension, adduction, flexion, abduction. input data of thumb postures and fingertip forces were used to compute tendon tensions with both models. Tendon tensions obtained using these two models were then compared and correlated to EMG measurements provided in the literature. The results showed that both models predicted relevant muscle coordination for five of the nine muscles modelled. Opponent and abductor longus muscle coordinations were badly estimated by both models. Each model was sensible to kinematic errors but not in the same proportion. This study pointed out the advantages/limits of the two models to use them more appropriately for clinical and/or research purposes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the application of ergonomic principles to the standard tasks performed by the workers at Company XYZ. Goals were developed in order to achieve the {{purpose of this}} study. Conduct quantitative assessments on the tasks to determine the extent of the problem. Conduct qualitative perception surveys to determine the extent of the problem. Analyze the workstations where the tasks were performed. Finally, a cost justification was created for any improvements. The evaluation consisted of using several ergonomic assessments, surveys, and a workstation design analysis to identify any risks associated with the tasks at Company XYZ. A cost justification followed to justify the reasoning for investing in changes so that Company XYZ is able to determine whether they will receive a return on their investment. The types of ergonomic risk factors which were found in the masking and demasking processes were repetitive wrist movements, <b>pinch</b> <b>grips,</b> and awkward postures. The researcher identified a number of possible controls and procedural changes to improve the 3 current masking and demasking process to reduce or eliminate the risk of ergonomic injuries. The recommendations were justified and concluded that Company XYZ would receive a payback period of a year and eight months by implementing the changes. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} whether {{patients with the}} clinical phenotype of multifocal motor neuropathy but without the electrophysiological criteria for conduction block would respond to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).  METHODS—Ten patients were selected with a slowly progressive, asymmetric, lower motor neuron disorder, and were treated prospectively with IVIg at a dose of 2 g/kg over 5 days. All subjects had neurophysiological testing to look for evidence of conduction block before treatment. Muscle strength was assessed by MRC grades and hand held myometry, measuring <b>pinch</b> and <b>grip</b> strength. A 20 % increase in both <b>pinch</b> and <b>grip</b> myometry was considered a positive response.  RESULTS—In no patient was conduction block detected. Four of the 10 patients showed a positive response to IVIg, with the best response occurring in two patients who presented with weakness but without severe muscle wasting. Three of the four responders have continued to receive IVIg for a mean period of 17 months (range 15 - 24 months), with continued effect. The response to IVIg {{was not related to}} the presence of anti-GM 1 antiganglioside antibodies, but responders had a selective pattern of muscle weakness and normal (> 90 % predicted) vital capacity.  CONCLUSION—The findings suggest that a course of IVIg should be considered in patients with the clinical phenotype of multifocal motor neuropathy but without neurophysiological evidence of conduction block. ...|$|R
50|$|One {{focus of}} {{ergonomic}} principles is maintaining neutral postures, which are postures in which muscles {{are at their}} normal length and able to generate the most force, while reducing stress and possible injury to muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones- therefore, in the workplace or in everyday life, it is ideal for muscles and joints to maintain neutral positions. Additionally, to prevent hand, wrist, and finger injuries, understanding when to use <b>pinch</b> <b>grips</b> (best for fine motor control and precise movements with low force) and power grips (best for high-force movements done repeatedly) is important for employees and general tasks outside the workplace. The choice of tools should match that of the proper grip and be conducive to neutral postures, which is important for employers to consider when purchasing equipment. In order to reduce injuries to the low back and spine, it is recommended to reduce weight and frequency of lifting cycles as well as decreasing {{the distance between the}} body and the load to reduce the torque force on the back for workers and individuals doing repeated lifting to avoid fatigue failure of the spine. The shape of objects being lifted should also be considered, especially by employers, because objects which are easier to grip, lift, and access present less stress on the spine and back muscles than objects which are awkwardly shaped and difficult to access.|$|R

Hand function assessment included <b>pinch</b> and <b>grip</b> strength measurement, finger {{range of motion}} (ROM) assessment, Hand Mobility in Scleroderma (HAMIS) test and Hand Functional Index (HFI). Hand disability was assessed by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Scleroderma HAQ Visual Analogue Scale (SHAQ VAS) and Cochin scale. US hand examination included measuring hand skin thickness, screening of the finger flexor and extensor tendons, measuring cartilage thickness of the 2 nd MCP joint, anteroposterior thickness of the flexor retinaculum, and surface area of the median nerve. ResultsNine patients had healed digital ulcers while only one patient had active ulcers. Seven patients had arthralgia in the hand joints. The patients had {{a significant decrease in}} grip strength and finger ROM. By US, patients showed significant increase in hand skin thickness and flexor retinaculum thickness and a significant decrease in median nerve surface area.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Elevated {{carpal tunnel}} {{pressure}} (CTP) {{has been associated}} with carpal tunnel syndrome. This study systematically evaluated the effect of wrist motion resistance and grip type on CTP during wrist motion typical of occupational tasks. CTP during four wrist motion patterns, with and without resistance, and with and without gripping, was measured in vivo in 14 healthy individuals. CTP measured during compound motions fell between that measured in the cardinal planes of wrist flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation. Generally, with no active gripping there was little pressure change due to wrist angular displacement or resistance level. However, concurrent active <b>pinch</b> or power <b>grip</b> increased CTP particularly in motions including extension. CTP typically did not increase during wrist flexion, and in fact often decreased. Extension motions against resistance when employing a <b>pinch</b> or power <b>grip</b> increase CTP more than motions with flexion.

40|$|Background Hospitalised and {{community}} dwelling older people (aged 65 years and over) have difficulties opening certain {{food and beverage}} items (e. g. cheese portions and tetra packs) served in public hospitals. Previously, the role of hand strength on successful pack opening has been explored in a seated position. However, because many people in hospital eat in bed, the present laboratory study examined the differences between participants opening a selection of products {{in a hospital bed}} and a chair. Methods The present study used a qualitative method (satisfaction) and quantitative methods (<b>grip</b> and <b>pinch</b> strength, dexterity, time and attempts) in two conditions (bed; chair) in a sample of well older community dwelling adults (n = 34). Packs tested included foil sealed thickened pudding, foil sealed thickened water, tetra pack, dessert, custard, jam, cereal, honey sachet and cheese portions. Results Honey sachets, cheese portions, foil sealed thickened pudding and tetra packs were the most difficult packs to open, with 15 % of cheese portions unable to be opened in either the bed or chair posture. Although grip strength was consistent for each posture, <b>pinch</b> <b>grips</b> and dexterity were adversely affected by the bed posture. Lying in a hospital bed required greater pinch strength and dexterity to open packs. Conclusions Eating in a seated position when in hospital has been shown to improve intake. The present study demonstrates that eating in a seated posture is also advantageous for opening the food and beverage packs used in the NSW hospital food service and supports the notion that patients should sit to eat in hospital...|$|R

Design A single-group longitudinal study. Setting Self-help organizations. Participants A convenience sample of 16 community residents (N= 16) with chronic unilateral stroke and mild to moderate upper-extremity impairment stratified by the severity of their paretic arm function, measured by using the Functional Test for the Hemiplegic Upper Extremity (FTHUE). Interventions Participants engaged in repetitive upper-extremity task practice for 2 weeks while wearing an ambulatory sensory cueing device on their affected hand for 3 hours a day. Main Outcome Measures Evaluations were conducted on the 3 occasions of pretest (1 day before training), posttest (immediately after training), and follow-up test (2 weeks after training) by using the following behavioral measures of paretic upper-extremity performance: the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), the Box and Block Test, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the FTHUE, power and <b>pinch</b> <b>grips,</b> the Motor Activity Log assessment of arm use, and kinematic data obtained from the device. Results Significant differences were found in ARAT and FMA scores among the pretest, posttest, and follow-up evaluations.
