500|$|Tidal heating occurs {{through the}} tidal {{friction}} processes: orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as {{heat in the}} crust of an object. In addition, {{to the extent that}} tides produce heat along fractures, libration may affect the magnitude and distribution of such tidal shear heating. Tidal dissipation of Enceladus's ice crust is significant because Enceladus has a subsurface ocean. A computer simulation that used data from Cassini was published in November 2017, and it indicates that friction heat from the sliding rock fragments within the permeable and fragmented core of Enceladus could keep its underground ocean warm for up to billions of years. It is thought that if Enceladus had a more eccentric orbit in the past, the enhanced tidal forces could be sufficient to maintain a subsurface ocean, such that a periodic enhancement in eccentricity could maintain a subsurface ocean that periodically changes in size. A more recent analysis claimed that [...] "a model of the tiger stripes as tidally flexed slots that puncture the ice shell can simultaneously explain the persistence of the eruptions through the tidal cycle, the <b>phase</b> <b>lag,</b> and the total power output of the tiger stripe terrain, while suggesting that eruptions are maintained over geological timescales." [...] Previous models suggest that resonant perturbations of Dione could provide the necessary periodic eccentricity changes to maintain the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, if the ocean contains a substantial amount of ammonia. The surface of Enceladus indicates that the entire moon has experienced periods of enhanced heat flux in the past.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{evolution}} of the <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> associated with the type-C QPO in GX 339 - 4 during the rising phase of the 2006 / 2007 outburst. We find that the <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> at the QPO frequency are always positive (hard) and show very different behavior between QPOs with frequencies below and above ˜ 1. 7 Hz: when the QPO frequency is below ˜ 1. 7 Hz, the <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> increase both with QPO frequency and energy, while when the QPO frequency is above ˜ 1. 7 Hz, the <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> remain more or less constant. When the QPO frequency is higher than ˜ 1. 7 Hz, a broad feature is always present in the lag-energy spectra at around 6. 5 keV, suggesting that the reflection component may have a significant contribution to the <b>phase</b> <b>lags.</b> Below ˜ 1. 7 Hz, the QPO rms first decreases with energy and then turns to almost flat, while above ˜ 1. 7 Hz, the QPO rms increases with energy. During the transition from the low-hard state to the hard-intermediate state, the second harmonic and subharmonic of this QPO appear in the power density spectra. The second-harmonic and subharmonic <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> show very similar evolutions for their centroid frequencies. However, the energy dependence of the second-harmonic and subharmonic <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> are quite different.

It is shown that both <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> and gain change almost linearly with the temporal frequency of the stimulus. This implies that the <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> correspond to a frequency-independent time delay and that, if the system is linear, the impulse response should take a symmetrical (sin x/x) 2 form, with a corresponding standard form of step response. Comparison of this derived step response with the quasi-exponential results found experimentally underlines the limitations of attempting to generalise dynamic accommodation performance from responses obtained with predictable sinusoidally-changing stimuli {{and the application of}} a linear model. Consideration of the frequency response which would lead to an exponential step response supports the argument that, although the gain results obtained with sinusoidal stimuli are reasonably representative of those applying with other forms of stimulus, the predictable nature of sinusoidally-changing stimuli makes the derived <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> inapplicable to non-predictable step or other stimuli.

ERG responses to stimuli, temporally modulated at 30 Hz, were recorded. The stimuli were generated on a computer controlled colour monitor. Thirty-two different combinations of L- and M-cone excitation strength, expressed as cone contrasts, were presented. The short-wavelength-sensitive (S-) cones were not stimulated (S-cone contrast= 0 %). The response phase of the fundamental stimulus component was obtained from Fourier analysis.

40|$|Observations of {{quasi-periodic}} oscillations (QPOs) in X-ray binaries hold a key {{to understanding}} many aspects of these enigmatic systems. Complex appearance of the Fourier <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> related to QPOs {{is one of the}} most puzzling observational effects in accreting black holes. In this Letter we show that QPO properties, including <b>phase</b> <b>lags,</b> can be explained in a framework of a simple scenario, where the oscillating media provides a feedback on the emerging spectrum. We demonstrate that the QPO waveform is presented by the product of a perturbation and a time delayed response factors, where the response is energy dependent. The essential property of this effect is its non-linear and multiplicative nature. Our multiplicative reverberation model successfully describes the QPO components in energy dependent power spectra as well as the appearance of the <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> between signal in different energy bands. We apply our model to QPOs observed by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in BH candidate XTE J 1550 - 564.

Significant {{deviations}} from the average pulse profile can appear, in particular close to the cyclotron line energies. These deviations {{can be described as}} energy-dependent <b>phase</b> <b>lags,</b> that is, as energy-dependent shifts of main features in the pulse profile. Aims. Using a numerical study we explore the effect of cyclotron resonant scattering on observable, energy-resolved pulse profiles. Methods. We generated the observable emission as a function of spin phase, using Monte Carlo simulations for cyclotron resonant scattering and a numerical ray-tracing routine accounting for general relativistic light-bending effects on the intrinsic emission from the accretion columns. Results. We find strong changes in the pulse profile coincident with the cyclotron line energies. Features in the pulse profile vary strongly with respect to the average pulse profile with the observing geometry and shift and smear out in energy additionally when assuming a non-static plasma. Conclusions. We demonstrate how <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> at the cyclotron energies arise {{as a consequence of the}} effects of angular redistribution of X-rays by cyclotron resonance scattering in a strong magnetic field combined with relativistic effects. We also show that <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> are strongly dependent on the accretion geometry. These intrinsic effects will in principle allow us to constrain a system’s accretion geometry...|$|R
