40|$|This study {{seeks to}} provide more insight into the Septuagint of Isaiah (LXX Isaiah) by {{analysing}} all the cases of <b>pluses</b> and minuses in that translation. In this way it sets out to contribute to and to complement the discussion of <b>pluses</b> and minuses in LXX Isaiah which was presented by Joseph Ziegler in his work Untersuchungen zur Septuaginta des Buches Isaias (1934). All LXX Isaiahâs <b>pluses</b> and minuses have been collected and classified in this study, and then analysed to understand the motivation for them. Do they betray certain translation tendencies of the translator, or do they indicate that the Greek translator had a Vorlage {{in front of him}} which differed from the Masoretic text? One of the conclusions is that many <b>pluses</b> and minuses in the translation seem to be connected with certain literary, stylistic preferences of the translator. Hardly any previous investigations have been made into this stylistic or rhetorical aspect of the Greek translation of Isaiah. Promotor: A. van der KooijWith summary in DutchNW...|$|R
