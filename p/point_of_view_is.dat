5|$|The Swahili Utendi wa Tambuka, an epic poem {{composed}} in 1728 at Pate Island (off {{the shore of}} present-day Kenya) and depicting the wars between the Muslims and Byzantines from the former's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> <b>is</b> also known as Kyuo kya Hereḳali ("The book of Heraclius"). In that work, Heraclius is portrayed as declining the Prophet's command to renounce his belief in Christianity; he is therefore defeated by the Muslim forces.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, a wave of Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} (in the appearance of Balkenkreuz sprites on the map) will cross the English Channel and proceed to bomb various cities, air bases and radar installations. In response, RAF squadrons are automatically scrambled and will await orders to either engage invading Luftwaffe fighters or to defend key cities from bombers. When a RAF squadron has successfully engaged a Luftwaffe unit on the map, the game will shift to a first-person shooter perspective, in which the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> portrayed from a cockpit of either a Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, depending on the side chosen. During the dogfight sequence, the number of Luftwaffe casualties will depend on how many aircraft the player was able to shoot down.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{the fact that the}} Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that {{it is virtually impossible to}} pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E

25|$|Inconsistency, vagueness, {{and a lack}} of {{specifics}} in both English language translations {{and modern}} English language interpretations of Leibniz's writings render a clear exposition difficult. As with Leibniz's calculus ratiocinator two different schools of philosophical thought have come to emphasise two different aspects that can be found in Leibniz's writing. The first point of view emphasizes logic and language, and is associated with analytic philosophy and rationalism. The second <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> more in tune with Couturat's views as expressed above, which emphasize science and engineering. This <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> associated with synthetic philosophy and empiricism. Either or both of these aspects Leibniz hoped would guide human reasoning like Ariadne's thread and thereby suggest solutions to many of humanity's urgent problems.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and fundamental doctrines of Jainism is Anēkāntavāda. It refers to the principles of pluralism and multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> the complete truth.|$|E
25|$|The other <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> geometrical. One can {{explicitly}} {{construct the}} spinors, and then examine how they behave under {{the action of}} the relevant Lie groups. This latter approach has the advantage of providing a concrete and elementary description of what a spinor is. However, such a description becomes unwieldy when complicated properties of spinors, such as Fierz identities, are needed.|$|E

25|$|The {{patchwork}} construction {{does not}} use any embedding, but simply views the manifold as a topological space by itself. This abstract <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> called the intrinsic view. It can {{make it harder to}} imagine what a tangent vector might be, and there is no intrinsic notion of a normal bundle, but instead there is an intrinsic stable normal bundle.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} interpretations for this disparity: either the {{universe}} began with a small preference for matter (total baryonic number of the universe different from zero), or the universe was originally perfectly symmetric, but somehow a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favour of matter over time. The second <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> preferred, {{although there is no}} clear experimental evidence indicating either of them to be the correct one.|$|E
25|$|The Mists of Avalon, a {{retelling of}} the King Arthur myth from a feminist <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> <b>is</b> Marion Zimmer Bradley's most famous single novel. Over the years, and through {{collaboration}} with her sister-in-law, Diana L. Paxson, {{it has grown}} into a series of books: The Mists of Avalon (1982), The Forest House (1994), Lady of Avalon (1997), Priestess of Avalon (2000), Ancestors of Avalon (2004), Ravens of Avalon (2007), and Sword of Avalon (2009).|$|E

25|$|It is {{sometimes}} argued that Molotov continued the talks with Britain and France {{to stimulate the}} Germans into making an offer of a non-aggression treaty and that the triple alliance failed because of the Soviet determination to conclude a pact with Germany. Another <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that the Soviet's pursuit of a triple alliance was sincere and that the Soviet government turned to Germany only when an alliance with the Western powers proved impossible.|$|E
25|$|Most Faroese Islanders {{consider}} the hunt {{an important part}} of their culture and history. Animal rights groups, such as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, criticize it as being cruel and unnecessary, since it in their <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> no longer necessary as a food source for the Faroese people, while the hunters claim in return that most journalists do not exhibit sufficient knowledge of the catch methods or its economic significance.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} {{examines the}} reliability of Wikipedia, and the dichotomy between the contributions of experts and amateur editors. The documentary includes commentary from Wikipedia co-founders Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, The Cult of the Amateur author Andrew Keen, O'Reilly Media chief executive officer Tim O'Reilly, and former editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica Robert McHenry. Keen says that experts should serve as guardians of information during the Web 2.0 phenomenon; this <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> supported by analysis from Sanger.|$|E

25|$|An {{opposing}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> held by Kiyohiko Satō, {{who says}} that only the battalion commanders were asked whether they agreed to the plan, and {{that the rest of}} the soldiers were not given a choice. According to Satō, the witnesses mentioned by Hata and Takahashi denied being interviewed on the subject at all. Furthermore, from freshly conducted interviews and from the sergeant major's notes, Satō infers that only the officers and warrant officers were involved in the decision to surrender, and that the other soldiers only received an order.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that it {{was only}} after the end of Japanese rule with World War II that Korea saw true, {{democratic}} rise in public education as evidenced by the rise of adult literacy rate from 22 percent in 1945 to 87.6 percent by 1970 and 93% by the late 1980s. Though free public education was made available for elementary schools during Japanese rule, Korea as a country did not experience secondary-school enrollment rates comparable to those of Japan prior to the end of World War II.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} see a {{divergence between}} {{the language of}} Galicia-Volhynia and the language of Novgorod-Suzdal by the 12th century, assuming that before the 12th century, the two languages were practically indistinguishable. This <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is,</b> however, at variance with some historical data. In fact, several East Slavic tribes, such as Polans, Drevlyans, Severians, Dulebes (that later likely became Volhynians and Buzhans), White Croats, Tiverians and Ulichs lived on the territory of today's Ukraine long before the 12th century. Notably, some Ukrainian features were recognizable in the southern dialects of Old East Slavic {{as far back as}} the language can be documented.|$|E

25|$|Clayton and Bell {{excelled in}} their use of colour. The {{designing}} of a stained glass window that “works” from a visual <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> a more complex matter than simply drawing up a cartoon and painting the colours in. What works on paper does not necessarily work when it has the added element of light streaming through it. Some colours are notoriously difficult. Blue glass, frequently used for backgrounds, can create a halo effect that dominates the window. Red and blue together can create a jumping discordant pattern that is quite nasty to look at. Faces can bleach out completely. Green can simply turn black.|$|E
25|$|Introducing {{the term}} 'low entropy' for {{valuable}} natural resources, and the term 'high entropy' for valueless waste and pollution, Georgescu explains {{that all the}} economic process does from a physical <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> to irreversibly transform low entropy into high entropy, thereby providing a flow of natural resources for people to live on. The irreversibility of this economic process {{is the reason why}} natural resources are scarce: Recycling of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources plus an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as waste heat (according to the entropy law).|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the notion}} of Satya, or Truth, {{is central to the}} Gandhian {{conception}} of nonviolence. Gandhi saw Truth as something that is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the Truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater Truth. This led him to believe in the inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, the willingness to listen to another's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.|$|E
