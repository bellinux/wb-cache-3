50|$|Typically, {{this process}} uses a low {{viscosity}} (100 to 1000 cP) <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> resin along with fiberglass fibers {{to create a}} composite. Normally the process is capable of producing composites with a fiber volume fraction between 40-50%. The resin to fiber ratio is important for determining the overall strength and performance of the final part, with mechanical strength being most influenced {{by the type of}} fiber reinforcement. The type of resin used will primarily determine the corrosion resistance, heat distortion temperature, and surface finish. Resins used in this process must have low viscosities due to the limited pressure differential provided by the vacuum pump. High performance fibers, such as carbon fiber, can also be used. However, their usage is less common and is mainly for the fabrication of high end parts.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} fiber diameter, trigger {{geometry}} and section geometry on the crush response of pultruded glass {{fiber reinforced plastic}} tubes, made with either <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> resin, was determined at crush rates from 2. 1 x 10 - 4 m/s to &mdash; 15 m/s. The rate dependence of the specific energy for the polyester resin tubes was positive, whereas that for the vinyl resin tubes could be either positive or negative, depending upon the par-ticular tube geometry. Increases in the specific energy absorption, previously observed in quasi-static loading, caused by changes in the crush trigger geometry, were found also for dynamic loading. Reductions in the fiber diameter by one half (nominal), for the same glass content, decreased the specific energy by up to &sim; 20 %. Differences in the resin affect the quasi-static crush resistance, the vinyl ester resin tubes having a significantly higher specific energy {{than that of the}} polyester resin tubes. These differences tend to diminish for dynamic crush. Fiber delamination occurs more profusely under dynamic loading con-ditions, and it is suggested that a crush mode change occurs on passing from quasi-static to dynamic loading. A tendency to crush in an unstable manner was found for some square sections under dynamic loading, possibly due to the accumulation of crush debris in the tube interior...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} presented into the explosive blast response of fibre-reinforced polymer laminates used in naval ship structures. Blast tests using plastic explosive charges were performed in air on square target plates made of carbon-polyester, glass-polyester, carbon-vinyl ester or glass-vinyl ester laminates, which are composite {{materials used in}} naval ships. The laminates were dynamically loaded by shock waves of increasing pressure and impulse, and the deformation, damage and residual mechanical properties were determined. The amount of blast-induced damage and the post-blast mechanical properties depend on both the fibre reinforcement and polymer matrix. E-glass laminates have higher resistance to blast-induced delamination cracking and tow rupture than carbon fibre composites. Furthermore, glass or carbon fibre laminates with a <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> matrix have superior blast damage resistance compared to composites with a polyester matrix. The higher damage resistance is attributed to the higher flexural strain energy capacity and interlaminar fracture toughness properties of laminates containing glass fibres <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> matrix...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy release}} rate for {{propagation}} of a debond {{in either a}} single-fiber pull-out test or a microbond test was derived analytically. The key finding was that an accurate analysis can be derived by a global energy analysis that includes effects of residual stresses and interfacial friction but {{does not need to}} include the details of the stress state at the interfacial crack tip. The analytical results were verified by comparison to finite element analyses. The energy release rate expressions were used to determine interfacial fracture toughness from singlefiber pull-out tests or microbond tests. The experiments included both macrosized model microbond specimens (steel wire/epoxy) and micro-sized pull-out and microbond specimens (glass fiber/epoxy <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester).</b> In all experiments, it was critical to correctly account for the true level of residual stresses in the specimen; it some experiments, the inclusion of friction was also critical.

40|$|Organometallic-Mediated Radical Polymerization (OMRP) is an {{emerging}} class of controlled radical polymerization {{based on the}} reversible deactivation of the growing radical chains by a metal complex. OMRP based on Co(acac) 2 (CMRP) is very efficient for non-conjugated and reactive monomers such as <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> amides. Kinetics and theoretical investigations revealed the preponderance of an intramolecular cobalt chelation in the CMRP mechanism. The latter reinforces the cobalt-polymer bond at the polymer chain-end. The effects of the carbonyl donor power {{in the formation of}} the chalated structure, of the ring strain for the cyclic amides (lactams) and of hydrogen bonding for secondary vs. tertiary amides have been rationalized with help of DFT calculations. Such represents a unique opportunity to imporve the control of the polymerizations, especially for the synthesis of well-derined poly(N-vinhyl amide) s which sustain numerous applications. Because poly(N-) vinylcaprolactam) s (PNVCL) represent an important class of biocompatible and thermoresponsive material, a series of NVCL-based copolymers was synthezized via CMRP. Lower critical solution temperature (LCST) were tuned up and down by introduction of vinylacetamides <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters</b> comonomers. CMRP also allowed the syntbhesis of new diblock copolymers having double thermoresponsive poroperties whereas the corresponding NVCL-based triblock copolymers were obtained by the cobalt-mediated raidical coupling (CMRC) method developed in our research center. The thermo-responsive properties and self-assembly behavior of these new di-and tri-block copolymers were studied by turbidimetry analysis and dynamic light scattering (DLS) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{short-term}} evaluation of some commercially available FRP tendon-anchor systems for application in prestressed concrete structures. Ten FRP tendon-anchor systems were stressed and subjected to sustained load for a period of three days to determine ease of installation, mechanical performance and anchor seating losses. The FRP tendons used aramid, carbon, and glass fibres embedded in epoxy <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> resin (except for one case). Anchors were of the wedge (or spike) and potted type. A minimum of two tests were conducted for each system at a load level equal to 65 % of the manufacturer's specified ultimate tendon strength. Collected data included load, strain, and displacement readings during both initial stressing and three-day sustained load. In most cases, anchorage devices permitted the stressing of the FRP tendons at the desired load level. Among wedge-type anchors, plastic and aluminium wedges had questionable performance, whereas steel wedges (in direct contact with the tendon or using a metal sleeve between tendon and wedge) showed good performance. Regardless of wedge material (plastic, aluminium, or steel), grit application to the wedge internal surface was highly beneficial. The spike anchor presented some installation difficulties. Resin potted anchors worked well and were easy to install. For the one case considered (wedge anchor), it was determined that retensioning produces early failure and anchor-zone temperatures between - 40 degrees C and + 60 degrees C have no effect on system performance. Anchor seating losses during short-term use are in general small and could become insignificant depending on the length of the tendon. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|External bonding of {{composite}} strips to {{the components}} of concrete construction is an effective technique in rehabilitation and upgrading of concrete construction. This thesis reports a study regarding the effects of adhesive properties on mechanical and structural performance of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) strips. The concrete beam was subjected to four point bending test to {{examine the effect of}} adhesive properties. It is found that the rubber modifier increased the maximum bending force, the corresponding displacement and flexural ductility, compared with those bonded with a neat epoxy resin, for all concrete beams tested with different number of FRP layers. There was a transition of major failure mechanism from 'delamination of CFRP strip' along the CFRP-concrete interface with relatively clean fracture surface to 'peel-off of concrete' with cracks propagating irregularly through the inside of concrete, when the number of CRRP strips was increased from two to four layers. The interlaminar fracture toughness of FRP strips-concrete interfaces was measured using the asymmetric double cantilever beam specimens. The mixed-mode interlaminar fracture toughness increased with the rubber content for both the epoxy <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> resin, the improvement being as large as about 13 % with 20 % rubber content. Apart from the higher interlaminar fracture toughness, the rubber modifier gave rise to higher stability during delamination, suggesting a beneficial effect of mitigation catastrophic failure in practical applications. A series of micro-hardness test on polished cross-sections of adhesive-concrete interface indicates that the rubber promoted the penetration of adhesive into the concrete, which may further improved strengthening of concrete beams using FRP strips. The finite element analysis method was carried out to study the stress profiles along the interface between CFRP strip and concrete. The numerical study indicates that both the shear and normal stress concentrations within about 15 mm from the strip ends were reduced with increasing the rubber modifier content, while the stress profiles remain much the same for the rest of interface. Also, the thicker the CFRP strip used, the higher the stress concentrations...|$|R

The work in this project is to investigate the effect of adding nanoclays on these properties of <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester.</b> Commercial <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters</b> usually contain styrene, which serves both as a diluent and a crosslinking agent.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} long-chain fatty esters of corn starch (starch laurate and starch stearate) with a broad range In degree of substitution (DS = 0. 24 - 2. 96). The fatty esters were prepared by reacting the starch with <b>vinyl</b> laurate <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> stearate In the presence of basic catalysts (Na 2 HPO 4, K 2 CO 3, and Na acetate) In DMSO at 110 °C. The yellowish products were characterized by 1 H-, 13 C-NMR and FT-IR. The DS of the products {{is a function of}} the carbon number of the fatty acid chain, <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> to starch ratio and the type of catalyst. When performing the reactions using Na 2 HPO 4 as the catalyst, the DS for the starch laurate compounds Is higher than for the corresponding starch stearates. For low <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> to starch ratios, an increase in the <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> concentration leads to higher product DS values. At higher ratios, the DS decreases, presumably due to a reduction of the polarity of the reaction medium. K 2 CO 3 and Na acetate are superior catalysts with respect to activity compared to Na 2 HPO 4 and products with DS values close to 3 were obtained. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. ...|$|R

40|$|Development of epoxy <b>or</b> epoxy-based <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> {{composites}} {{with improved}} mechanical and electromagnetic properties, filled with carbon-based nanomaterials, is of crucial interest {{for use in}} aerospace applications as radar absorbing materials at radio frequency. Numerous studies have highlighted {{the fact that the}} effective functional properties of this class of polymer composites are strongly dependent on the production process, which affects the dispersion of the nanofiller in the polymer matrix and the formation of micro-sized aggregations, degrading the final properties of the composite. The assessment of the presence of nanofiller aggregation in a composite through microscopy investigations is quite inefficient in the case of large scale applications, and in general provides local information about the aggregation state of the nanofiller rather than an effective representation of the degradation of the functional properties of the composite due to the presence of the aggregates. In this paper, we investigate the mechanical, electrical, and electromagnetic properties of thermosetting polymer composites filled with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). Moreover, we propose a novel approach based on measurements of the dielectric permittivity of the composite in the 8 – 12 GHz range in order to assess the presence of nanofiller aggregates and to estimate their average size and dimensions.

Linear viscoelastic models are generally composed {{of one or}} more elements such as dashpots and springs that represent the viscous and elastic properties. Stress relaxation data from DMA was used to obtain the elastic parameters based on model constitutive equations. The Standard Linear Solid (SLS) model, which is a physical model, was used for predicting the creep deformation behavior of the <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> nanocomposites over a wide temperature range. This model was chosen because it can describe the stress relaxation and creep behavior of polymers and can also explain the two main deformations of plastics [1]; with the spring representing deformations due to bending and stretching of intermolecular bonds and dashpot represents deformation due to the viscous effect. Some correlations have been made with the mechanical model, such as the effect of temperature on the deformation behavior which is well explained in the dashpot mechanism. At lower temperatures, higher creep compliance was observed for <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> as compared to nanocomposites, while at temperatures near the Tg of <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester,</b> creep compliance in nanocomposites becomes closer in magnitude to that for <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester.</b> Creep response of pure <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> appears to be modeled reasonably well at temperatures lower than it’s Tg (66 C). Comparison between the predictions and experimental data from creep tests demonstrate that this model can represent the long term deformation behavior of these nano reinforced materials reasonably well...|$|R
