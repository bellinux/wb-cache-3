Apart from these, Sabah also {{features}} a number of snacks like amplang, cincin, lidah, roti kahwin, UFOs pinjaram and Sandakan tart and dessert like lamban, punjung and Tuaran coconut pudding. Every ethnic group has its own cuisine with different styles of preparing, cooking, {{and the way they}} serving and eating the food. Example of Sabah-based companies promoting dairy product and state drinks are like the Desa Cattle, Tenom coffee and Sabah Tea. The indigenous people features a number of alcoholic drinks such as bahar, kinomol, lihing, montoku, sagantang, sikat and tuak; with the state itself becoming the third highest in alcohol consumption in the country after Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak.

5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his <b>presence</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, the {{officers}} {{know they are}} here only on a temporary basis, further enforced {{by the fact that}} they are disallowed from integrating too much with local society. Due to their chief purpose as a neutral <b>presence</b> <b>here,</b> they are not allowed to marry Singaporean women, hence the allowance to bring their wives and children from Nepal to the camp. At the end of their contract, they are expected to return to their villages and back to a rural life dependent on agriculture.

25|$|The {{production}} of dry red wines {{has been steadily}} increasing since the late 20th century spurred on, in part, by {{the creation of the}} Anjou-Villages AOC in 1987 for premium red wine production. Made predominantly from Cabernet Franc, some of the most ideally situated vineyards located south of Angers in the Coteaux de l'Aunbance AOC was given their own distinct sub-appellation in 1998 known as the Anjou-Villages Brissac AOC. The Gamay grape of Beaujolais still has a <b>presence</b> <b>here</b> and its own appellation of Anjou Gamay AOC.

Previously the commercial activities of Kuala Lumpur were run {{to a large extent}} by Chinese businessmen such as Loke Yew who was then the richest and most influential Chinese of Kuala Lumpur.

500|$|An analogy has {{frequently}} been drawn between the European Crusades of the Middle Ages {{and the modern}} day Zionist movement. This view, which has been espoused by Arab media and political leaders, has also been discussed in Israeli academia. Prawer was often asked to comment on this analogy, and claimed that a major difference was that the Jews settled the land and worked it, whereas the Crusaders lorded over a conquered land worked by the natives. [...] Ronnie Ellenblum, a lecturer at Hebrew University, identifies a subliminal objective in Prawer's work to draw {{a distinction between the}} two: [...] "He's always writing about the Crusaders' manpower shortage and about their not settling the land...He claims that their <b>presence</b> <b>here</b> was principally urban, consisting of nobility and merchants. This is why they lost in the end. The implications are obvious: If we bring enough immigrants, and if we settle the land, we are bound to succeed." [...] (Ellenblum himself has shown that Crusader settlement in the Holy Land was much more widespread than previously thought and has found evidence of hundreds of Crusader farms.) But he also notes that [...] "if Joshua Prawer were alive today he would no doubt deny any linkage between his Zionist political beliefs and the model of segregation that he developed." ...|$|E

[...] Kerri Mason of Billboard praised the album for not relying heavily on production and Auto-Tune, calling Lovato [...] "a natural talent who could really take flight after outgrowing Disney". Mason wrote that the album includes [...] "quiet surprises" [...] and potential hits, particularly praising the title track and [...] "Catch Me". Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News rated Here We Go Again {{two and a half}} stars out of four, writing: [...] "Unlike so many of her Disney-fied peers, Lovato can really sing, and part of what makes her sophomore effort appealing is the lack of in-studio vocal manipulation." [...] Miers wrote that it is [...] "refreshing" [...] that Lovato does not need Auto-Tune [...] "to mask any lack of natural ability". He concluded by calling the album [...] "safe and pretty predictable, but also incredibly catchy".|$|E
