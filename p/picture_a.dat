5|$|Debuting {{first in}} a {{work-in-progress}} version at the 1991 New York Film Festival before its November 1991 wide release, Beauty and the Beast, directed by Kirk Wise & Gary Trousdale, was an unprecedented critical and commercial success, and would later be seen {{as one of the}} studio's best films. The film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for Best <b>Picture,</b> <b>a</b> first for an animated work, winning for Best Song and Best Original Score. Its $145 million box office gross set new records and merchandising for the film– including toys, cross-promotions, and soundtrack sales– was also lucrative.|$|E

The film was originally known under the title Locked and Loaded, although this later became Get Rich or Die Tryin. Get Rich or Die Tryin was released to cinemas in 2005, and received generally mixed reviews from contemporary film critics.|$|E

5|$|Early {{work was}} {{promising}} {{and by the}} fall of 1976 the project was building momentum. Fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the White House with 400,000 letters, influencing President Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise. Bryant and Scott's proposal became the first accepted by the studio in October; Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and producers were swamped with grateful fan mail. By the start of 1977 the project's official title was changed to Star Trek—The Motion <b>Picture</b> (<b>a</b> title reapplied to the eventually released 1979 film). The elation was short-lived; the first draft of the completed script was not finished until March 1, 1977, and pressure was mounting for Paramount to either begin production or cut its losses and cancel the project. Producer Jerry Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators to complement the script.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} scenario and {{concept of}} Final Fantasy Type-0, originally a mobile title named Final Fantasy Agito XIII, was conceived by Hajime Tabata. He wished for a group-driven story {{as he felt}} that a single playable character {{would not be able}} to properly convey the scope and themes of the story. Because Tabata wanted to show a history of survival told from the point of view of young people caught in a war, it was decided to set the story during a war between four nations. Much of the original story, which mainly revolved about defying the gods, was drawn from popular anime and manga and did not survive. After the platform change to PlayStation Portable, Tabata adopted a story-telling style similar to a documentary film: a direct inspiration for this was Centuries of <b>Picture,</b> <b>a</b> documentary series broadcast on NHK. Alongside that, multiple war films were used as inspiration. Type-0s script was written by Hiroki Chiba and Sarah Okabe. During the rough draft stage, elements such as extra plot points involving Khalia Chival, a boss fight with Arecia, and a main plot thread involving Joker and Tiz were planned. Most of these elements were cut from the final product, meaning elements such as Joker and Tiz's role needed to be included in written texts found in-game so they were not left hanging. The deaths of Class Zero were planned from an early stage, and to emphasize the state of the world, a large number of the supporting cast were killed off near the end. Tabata wanted to create a story depicting different fates for Type-0s characters, and this decision was supported by both staff members and fans of the original. He also implemented the ability for players to decide the course of the story, which was to have been included in the Type-0 when it was still known as Agito XIII. Final Fantasy Agito was given a more upbeat atmosphere when compared to Type-0, although dark and more dramatic moments were still present. The story grew out of what Tabata originally envisioned for Type-0.|$|E

25|$|For example, if {{the given}} {{manifold}} is a -sphere, then one can picture the tangent space {{at a point}} as the plane that touches the sphere at that point and is perpendicular to the sphere’s radius through the point. More generally, if a given manifold is thought of as an embedded submanifold of Euclidean space, then one can <b>picture</b> <b>a</b> tangent space in this literal fashion. This was the traditional approach toward defining parallel transport and was used by Dirac. More strictly, this defines an affine tangent space, which is distinct from the space of tangent vectors described by modern terminology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Picture</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} water pipes, fitting into a network. Each pipe is {{of a certain}} diameter, so it can only {{maintain}} a flow of {{a certain amount of}} water. Anywhere that pipes meet, the total amount of water coming into that junction must be equal to the amount going out, otherwise we would quickly run out of water, or we would have a buildup of water. We have a water inlet, which is the source, and an outlet, the sink. A flow would then be one possible way for water to get from source to sink so that the total amount of water coming out of the outlet is consistent. Intuitively, the total flow of a network is the rate at which water comes out of the outlet.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{engagement}} Graham commissioned William Hogarth to paint as a conversation <b>picture</b> <b>a</b> cabin portrait {{to celebrate his}} victory, probably using the cabin of the Nottingham as a setting. Hogarth painted Graham smoking his pipe in his cabin before dinner, while listening to pipe and tabor music played by his black servant, while his chaplain and clerk sing. Two dogs are visible, one is Graham's own, which joins in the singing. The other is Trump, Hogarth's dog, which is shown wearing Graham's wig, holding a scroll, and reading from a sheet of music propped against a wine glass. A steward, holding a plate of fowl, looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, and drops gravy {{down the back of}} the chaplain's neck. The painting has several political and social allusions in Hogarth's satirical style. Cabin scenes in oil are rare, and Hogarth's is considered by the current owner, the National Maritime Museum, to be the most famous in British art.|$|E

Varietys A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance [...] "absolutely magnificent". According to The New Yorkers Pauline Kael, it was [...] "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made... more zest than an early Woody Allen <b>picture,</b> <b>a</b> lot more electricity, [...] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way". For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen.... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark." [...] Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as [...] "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" [...] and complimented its acting and [...] "extraordinary technical achievements". Rex Reed praised the [...] "nerve-frying" [...] action scenes and concluded that [...] "for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".|$|E
