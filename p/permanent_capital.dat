5|$|The Northwest Territories {{government}} {{moved to}} Battleford in 1877 {{on the order}} of the Lieutenant Governor. Battleford {{was supposed to be the}} <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> of the Territories. The town was chosen because it was expected to be linked with the Canadian Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|Robert Morris, a {{representative}} from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital {{for a period of}} 10 years. In a final attempt to convince Congress to keep the capital in Philadelphia, the city began construction on a new Presidential palace and an expansion to Congress Hall. Their efforts failed, and the federal government relocated from Philadelphia for the final time on May 14, 1800.|$|E
5|$|Article One, Section Eight, of the United States Constitution granted Congress the {{authority}} to create a federal district {{to serve as the}} national capital. Following the ratification of the Constitution, the Congress, while meeting in New York, passed the Residence Act on July 9, 1790. The Act established the District of Columbia {{on the banks of the}} Potomac River between the states of Maryland and Virginia to serve as the new federal capital. However, Robert Morris, a Senator from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of ten years.|$|E

5|$|In 1818, Jennings began {{promoting}} a large-scale plan for internal {{improvements in the}} state. Most of the projects were directed toward construction of roads, canals, and other projects to enhance the commercial appeal and economic viability of the state. During Jennings's second term the state government continued to support public improvements, with new road construction and expanded settlement into central Indiana. After Indianapolis became {{the site for the}} state's <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> in 1821 and new settlers arrived in the area, the Indiana General Assembly appropriated $100,000 for new road construction and improvements to some of the more important routes, but it was considerably short of the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues facing the newly elected government was {{the decision of the}} province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed Edmonton as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of Calgary. Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign, but selecting a <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> was {{high on the list of}} the new legislature's orders of business. Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross. Banff and Red Deer were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders. In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members—including Rutherford—to eight.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Buddhism during {{the sixth century}} was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese Tang and Sui Dynasties led to {{the foundation of the}} first <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The {{introduction of}} the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy.|$|E

25|$|During {{the colonial}} period of North Carolina, the state capital was New Bern. For several years {{during and after the}} Revolutionary War there was no capital, and the General Assembly met in various locations. Fayetteville was the state capital from 1789 to 1793, when Raleigh became the <b>permanent</b> state <b>capital.</b> In 1792, a {{commission}} was appointed to select a site to build a <b>permanent</b> state <b>capital.</b> The commission members favored land owned by Colonel John Hinton across the Neuse River, but the night before the final vote the committee adjourned to the home of Joel Lane for an evening of food and spirits. The next day, the vote went in Lane's favor.|$|R
5|$|A {{few days}} after the ultimatum, both Lithuania and Poland named their ambassadors. Kazys Škirpa was sent to Warsaw, and Franciszek Charwat was sent to Kaunas before March 31, the {{deadline}} indicated in the ultimatum. Negotiations over practical matters began on March 25, in Augustów, and by June three agreements covering rail transit, mail service, and river navigation had been concluded. The railroad, torn apart for several kilometers at the border, was repaired. A customs post was established in Vievis, and consulates were opened in Klaipėda and Vilnius. Lithuania closed the League for the Liberation of Vilnius and the Vilnius Foundation; the latter organization had given financial support to Lithuanian activities in the Vilnius Region. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim Vilnius as its de jure capital. In May 1938 a new constitution was adopted, which echoed the previous constitution's statement that Vilnius was the <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> of Lithuania and that Kaunas was merely a temporary capital. Poland continued to suppress Lithuanian organizations in Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{convince}} Congress to keep the capital in Philadelphia, the city began construction on a massive new Presidential palace on 9th Street {{as well as an}} expansion to the County Courthouse into what would become Congress Hall. Upon the return of Congress to Philadelphia on December 6, 1790, the first level of Congress Hall had been transformed into the chamber for the House of Representatives and the second floor had been converted into a chamber for the United States Senate. Despite their efforts to construct new buildings for use by the federal government, the city's residents failed to convince Congress to modify the Residence Act and make Philadelphia the <b>permanent</b> <b>capital.</b> Congress Hall served as the capitol building until May 14, 1800, when the offices of the national government moved to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{had voted}} {{to move the}} seat of {{government}} permanently to Quebec City. Macdonald had opposed that, and used his power to force the Assembly to reconsider in 1857. Macdonald proposed that Queen Victoria decide which city should be Canada's capital. Opponents, especially from Canada East, argued that the Queen would not make the decision in isolation; she would be bound to receive informal advice from her Canadian ministers. Nevertheless, Macdonald's scheme was adopted, with Canada East support assured by allowing Quebec City to serve a three-year term as the seat of government before the Assembly moved to the <b>permanent</b> <b>capital.</b> Macdonald privately asked the Colonial Office {{to ensure that the}} Queen would not respond for at least 10 months, or until after the general election. In February 1858, the Queen's choice was announced, much to the dismay of many legislators from both parts of the province: the isolated Canada West town of Ottawa.|$|E
50|$|From November 26, 1783 to August 13, 1784, Annapolis was {{the capital}} of the United States. The Congress of the Confederation met in the Maryland State House. Subsequently, Annapolis was a {{candidate}} to become the new <b>permanent</b> national <b>capital</b> before Washington, D.C. was built.|$|R
50|$|There was no <b>permanent</b> state <b>capital,</b> as {{the royal}} {{residence}} varied from one ruler to another; five cities in total reportedly obtained {{the title of}} a royal seat: Nin (Krešimir IV), Biograd (Stephen Držislav, Krešimir IV), Knin (Zvonimir, Petar Svačić), Šibenik (Krešimir IV), and Solin (Krešimir II).|$|R
5000|$|Cahaba, also spelled Cahawba, was {{the first}} <b>permanent</b> state <b>capital</b> of Alabama from 1820 to 1825, and county seat of Dallas County, Alabama until 1866. It {{suffered}} a major flood in 1865 and the state legislature moved the county seat to Selma, which was better situated.|$|R
5|$|The {{subject of}} a <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> for the United States was {{discussed}} numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another site on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{presided over}} the {{establishment}} of the new federal governmentappointing all of the high-ranking officials in the executive and judicial branches, shaping numerous political practices, and establishing the site of the <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> of the United States. He supported Alexander Hamilton's economic policies whereby the federal government assumed the debts of the state governments and established the First Bank of the United States, the United States Mint, and the United States Customs Service. Congress passed the Tariff of 1789, the Tariff of 1790, and an excise tax on whiskey to fund the government and, {{in the case of the}} tariffs, address the trade imbalance with Britain. Washington personally led federal soldiers in suppressing the Whiskey Rebellion, which arose in opposition to the administration's taxation policies. He directed the Northwest Indian War, which saw the United States establish control over Native American tribes in the Northwest Territory. In foreign affairs, he assured domestic tranquility and maintained peace with the European powers despite the raging French Revolutionary Wars by issuing the 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality. He also secured two important bilateral treaties, the 1794 Jay Treaty with Great Britain and the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo with Spain, both of which fostered trade and helped secure control of the American frontier. To protect American shipping from Barbary pirates and other threats, he re-established the United States Navy with the Naval Act of 1794.|$|E
25|$|Gondar {{as a third}} <b>permanent</b> <b>capital</b> (after Aksum and Lalibela) of the Christian Kingdom {{was founded}} by Fasiladas in 1636. It was the most {{important}} center of commerce for the Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|Sparta nearly {{became the}} capital of the state of Tennessee, as, early in the history of Tennessee, the state {{legislature}} voted to choose a location for the <b>permanent</b> state <b>capital.</b> The final vote resulted in a near tie between Sparta and Nashville. Sparta lost to Nashville by one vote.|$|R
25|$|Before the Taihō Code was established, {{the capital}} was customarily moved {{after the death}} of an emperor because of the ancient belief that a place of death was polluted.

The main fortress, Silsilat, included a walled garden and a guard house. It became the residence of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, his wives, family, prominent Somali military leaders, and also hosted several Turkish, Yemeni and German dignitaries, architects, masons and arms manufacturers. Several dozen other fortresses were built in Illig, Eyl, Shimbiris {{and other parts of}} the Horn of Africa.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} the ongoing violent agitations and {{political}} gridlock, some politicians have suggested to include Nalgonda district in to Seemandhra instead of Kurnool district.

Many Telangana leaders have opposed this plan.|$|R
