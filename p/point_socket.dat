5000|$|Due to the {{twisting}} or cam {{action of the}} socket on a bolt or nut head, {{nearly all of the}} torque is applied at or near the corners of the nut or bolt. Whether one uses either a twelve or six <b>point</b> <b>socket</b> the same stresses are applied in the same locations. Under load, nearly all of the flats of the nut are not touching the socket at all, it is only a small amount of the surfaces near the fastener corners which bears the torque loads. In nearly all applications over-stressing a bolt or nut will result in stripping the bolt or nut threads or breaking the bolt long before the socket will break. Tougher, thicker impact sockets are made for impact gun use. Occasionally when the corners of a bolt head or nut begin to become worn or damaged, the material the nut is made from can eventually smear or tear under load and create a situation where the corners are effectively [...] "rounded off". Some socket users believe that six point sockets are less likely to damage a fastener head, but tool evaluations and lab tests document that there is no difference in performance. A distorted or corroded fastener head may not fit a six-point socket but a twelve-point socket can be made to fit. When a fastener head is [...] "rounded off" [...] the nut or bolt can often no longer be turned without special repair or extraction tools. These rounded-off heads can incur substantial penalties, both direct and indirect. Deteriorated fasteners often inhibit the routine assembly and disassembly of the host components that rely on them, which can in turn deter users from performing normal maintenance procedures. Addressing the problem may require cost and effort, and potentially sidelining valuable equipment until the component's damaged fasteners have been replaced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{microcontroller}} (or MCU) is a computer-on-a-chip used {{to control}} electronic devices. It {{is a type of}} microprocessor emphasizing self-sufficiency and cost-effectiveness, in contrast to a general-purpose microprocessor (the kind used in a PC).

5000|$|When {{working with}} common 6-point {{hexagonal}} fasteners, the 12-point shaped socket offers {{double the amount}} of starting points or possible positions by which to put the socket on the nut. This is of large importance on a box wrench which is typically adjustable in 15 or 30 degree increments. This versatility of fitting position is normally of small importance on a socket wrench which can be easily rotated in small increments regardless of socket type. Since loading contact points between the nut and socket are at the corner points (not the flats), twelve <b>point</b> <b>sockets</b> have more than adequate strength for most applications where nut and socket are in good condition. If the nut or socket is rounded by wear, using a [...] "double" [...] shaped socket {{is more likely to}} results in slippage or further rounding off and possible stripping of either the bolt head, nut or socket. This versatility is the main purpose of the 12-point shape found in common sockets, but is essential when working with 12-point bolt and nut heads. Socket strength is mainly a function of the alloys and heat treatments used to make the socket along with wall thickness of the socket wrench as measured at the corner points (thinnest section).|$|R

40|$|The new {{millennium}} with rapid advancement {{of information and}} communications technology globally {{and the appearance of}} the post millennial net generation library users have created a demanding and competitive environment for academic libraries. On one hand, libraries are competing with virtual google-driven information arena while trying hard to attract users to physically visit the library. Academic libraries are moving towards electronic collection to match the needs of the Net generation. Activities, facilities, and services offered are also revamped as significant library measures to remain relevant. One of the interesting observation of the young library users are their multitasking abilities and their need for a more relaxed atmosphere in contrary to the serious, scholarly milieu of academic libraries in the past. This paper summarizes the open comments on space by library users while answering the User Satisfaction Survey at the University of Malaya, Malaysia. From the open comments, the users’ perspectives of library space can be categorized into five areas; library as a place via extended opening hours, {{increase in the number of}} plug <b>points</b> and <b>sockets,</b> high speed wireless and internet services, the need for food and café for relaxation, and aesthetic value and comfort while in the library. Although the University of Malaya library had been taking actions within financial constraints and policy restrictions, to meet the users’ needs, the comments and suggestions over the years nonetheless continue to be along the same lines of the categories mentioned. It can be concluded that the users’ perspectives of the academic library is moving away from the scholarly view to that of library as a third place perhaps due to the availability of electronic books, journals, databases, and resources online...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor drawing {{electrical}} wiring diagram of buildings, mostly two dimensional CAD programs are used. Drawing is done starting from the source (utility pole) to main power panel and then it is distributed towards to subpanels. Then, end <b>points</b> such as <b>sockets,</b> lighting armature, etc are defined. In this study several algorithms are developed in order to evaluate different part of drawing project. Tree structure of drawing is analyzed and all materials to be used are decided based on an algorithm. Apart from these, some of the supplies {{to be used in}} project but not shown in the drawings are also be chosen with certain criteria. These decision systems will result in efficiency of overall cost of the project. In wire drawing {{one of the most important}} point is the line drawing with reference to an object. Apart from light outlet all wires are referenced to walls. Furthermore, all supplies shown in drawings are allocated with reference to walls and with an angle to walls. In wiring diagram drawings, standard CAD programs have no ability for wire drawing with reference to walls. Besides that, suggestion and selection of the most appropriate supplies is not possible. These increase drawing time and result in very high cost calculation errors. These algorithms provide fast and correct implementation. By analyzing drawings in a tree structure on which users have minimal impact, and with automatic selection of supplies all type of calculation mistakes are minimized...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in prosthetic socket design have created {{renewed interest in}} monitoring the stress distribution at the socket-residual limb interface. Although a few devices for measuring pressure {{can be found in}} the literature, none are capable of measuring reliably in areas of high curvature, such as the important area at the patellar tendon bar. Furthermore, few devices can record shear stress, thought to be critical in causing tissue damage. In order to address these issues two new transducers have been designed and evaluated. One design allows the simultaneous recording of the normal and shear stresses at various <b>points</b> of the <b>socket</b> walls, while the other is capable of measuring the three components of the force applied on the patellar tendon. The latter design incorporates a feature that permits displacement of the patellar tendon bar, in order to study the effect of various amounts of indentation of the tendon on the stress distribution around the residual limb. Both transducers were calibrated using dead weights and special jigs to ensure accurate loading conditions. Under laboratory bench conditions the normal-shear force transducer showed: 2. 03 per cent full scale output (FSO) hysteresis error for shear stress direction, 1. 65 per cent FSO for normal direction; 99. 56 per cent FSO overall accuracy for shear direction, and within 99. 64 per cent FSO for normal direction; and for the patellar tendon transducer 1. 53 per cent FSO hysteresis error for shear direction, 1. 85 per cent FSO for shear stress direction; 99. 65 per cent FSO overall accuracy for shear direction, and 99. 58 per cent FSO for normal direction. During an amputee walking trial the transducers showed 92 per cent to 97 per cent repeatability. The two new transducers were used in conjunction with two other types of transducers, previously designed at the University of Strathclyde, in a series of tests on ten trans-tibial amputees. Sample results for walking activities and a summary of maximum stresses recorded are presented...|$|R
40|$|Further {{knowledge}} about the healing process of the alveolar ridge after tooth extraction is necessary to enhance functional and esthetic requirements in implant therapy. In cases of severe atrophy of the alveolar bone augmentation prodcedures with autogenous bone is still gold standard. The advantages of autogenous grafts are their osteogenic, osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. However, the augmentation of the alveolar ridge {{by the use of}} these grafts has been shown to result in a partial resorption of the graft. Therefore different methods reducing the tendency of resorption are discussed in the literature. Our study demonstrated that after iliac bone grafting, sufficient revascularization of the corticocancellous bone grafts were seen after a 3 -months time period. The additional use of resorbable collagen membranes did not show particular advantages compared with solely periosteal coverage of the grafts regarding the revascularization of the graft and new bone formation rate. The biology of the healing of the extraction socket was investigated in the following studies. It is known that tissue alterations following the removal of a tooth occur as bone loss in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Two studies evaluated histomorphometrically the rate of new bone formation in the extraction socket after different time points within the first 3 months as well as the possible influence of augmentation prodcedures with xenogenic bone. Both studies revealed great interindividual variations in the amount of bone formation within the extraction sockets. Furthermore the bone formation rate in apical region of the socket was significantly higher within the first weeks than in the coronal region. The rate of new bone formation in ungrafted sockets is higher than in sockets augmented with bovine bone, but the overall amount of hard tissue (new bone and bovine bone) is similar. The amount of bone formation found in grafted and ungrafted sockets after 6 weeks is comparable to that found after 12 weeks, suggesting an initial boost of bone formation within the first 6 weeks followed by a maturation of the bone. Furthermore, the studies demonstrated that other than new bone formation, the histological biopsies also showed regenerating fibrous tissue to a varying amount. This regenerating tissue is characterized through mesenchymal cells (MC) embedded in a fibrous matrix, called provisional matrix. In further studies the osteogenic and endothelial potential of the mesenchymal cells embedded in this provisional matrix, in the ungrafted and grafted sockets, was evaluated after 4, 6 and 12 weeks healing time. Immunohistochemical analyses with specific monoclonal antibodies revealed a high osteogenic potential of the cells. The osteoblastic activity was highest after 4 weeks of healing period. The active zone of bone formation is found in the apical region of the extraction socket during the early healing phase, shifting to the coronal region after 12 weeks. The density of the vessels is concurrent to the maturation of osteoblasts. The augmentation material did not influence the osteogenic or endothelial potential of the mesenchymal cells of the provisional matrix. It can be concluded that after an initial boost of bone formation within the first six weeks after tooth extraction follows the maturation of bone. At every investigated time <b>point</b> of <b>socket</b> healing interindividual variations in bone formation and amounts of provisional matrix were found. Bio-Oss Collagen as augmentation material did not have an influence the osteogenic and endothelial potential. These studies indicate that implants can be safely inserted after four to six weeks after tooth extraction...|$|R
