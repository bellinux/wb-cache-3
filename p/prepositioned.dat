In {{this research}} the writer analyze the simple <b>preposition</b> di, pada, ke, and dari and their equivalent in English version. <b>Preposition</b> {{is an interesting}} problem to analyze, {{because there are many}} mistakes when the students translate it into English as target language. Moreover there are many <b>prepositions</b> which can be chosen as the equivalent of one <b>preposition</b> in Indonesia. In this novel contained fifteen short stories, but the researcher only analyzing four short stories deeper. During the research, the researcher used qualitative descriptive method. Based on the findings, there are 45 sentences that containe <b>preposition</b> di, 9 sentences with the <b>preposition</b> pada, 30 sentences with the <b>preposition</b> ke, 20 sentences with the <b>preposition</b> dari. Therefore the number of <b>preposition</b> di, pada, ke, and dari found was 109 sentences. After analyzing the data in fact, a <b>preposition</b> in source language can be translated into many <b>prepositions</b> in target language. The <b>preposition</b> di is translated into many <b>prepositions</b> in the target language such as: under, on, across, near, in at, into, to, behind, by, with, from, inside, and between. The second is translation pada translated into with, at, to, on, and towards. The third is <b>preposition</b> ke translated into many <b>preposition</b> in English such as: into, to, towards, in, and forward. The last one ispreposition dari translated into three <b>prepositions</b> in target language such as: from, off, and within.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{impairment}} of <b>prepositions,</b> a somewhat neglected topic in aphasia research. It {{is the first to}} investigate the availability of all types of <b>prepositions</b> (i. e., spatial, temporal, other meaningful, subcategorized, syntactic <b>prepositions,</b> and particles) in a variety of comprehension and production tasks in one anomic aphasic and four Broca’s aphasic patients and healthy speakers. While the availability of spatial, temporal, or subcategorized <b>prepositions</b> has been investigated, other <b>preposition</b> types have never been studied before. The data revealed that <b>prepositions</b> were impaired in the patients, and that the degree of impairment differed for different types of <b>prepositions.</b> Three of the main findings are: first, meaningless <b>prepositions</b> were not the most vulnerable subcategory of <b>prepositions</b> in the patients. In fact, four of the five aphasic patients performed best on (meaningless) syntactic <b>prepositions.</b> Second, patients made few omissions and many substitution errors which were mostly within-category (a <b>preposition</b> was substituted by another <b>preposition).</b> Third, {{there was no difference in}} the performance of Broca’s and anomic aphasic patients. These results differ from those of previous studies (e. g., Bennis et al., 1983; Friederici, 1982). They found that (i) meaningful <b>prepositions</b> remained relatively well preserved in Broca’s aphasia, while meaningless subcategorized and/or syntactic <b>prepositions</b> were very impaired, (ii) that Broca’s aphasic patients tended to omit rather than substitute <b>prepositions,</b> and (iii) that patients of contrasting clinical profiles performed differently. The preservation of syntactic <b>prepositions</b> together with the large number of within-category substitutions (which indicate sensitivity to the grammatical class of <b>prepositions)</b> were interpreted to suggest that the <b>preposition</b> deficit of the patients is not due to syntactic impairments. Rather, a post syntactic deficit in selection of the correct <b>preposition</b> at spell-out – a construct in modern linguistic theory that links syntax with phonology – is put forward. ...|$|R

As the JMA upgraded Gorio to Tropical Storm Rumbia, Signal #2 were now put up over Region V and VIII, whilst Signal #1 were put up over southern Luzon, Visayas and northern Mindanao. PAGASA also upgraded Rumbia to a tropical storm. In Manila, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority's(MMDA) Monsoon Task Force deployed 200personnel to 11station in the local metropolitan area to monitor flooding and traffic conditions, as well as assist in potential rescue situations. The authority also requested the dismantling of all outdoor advertisements and billboards. Army rescue trucks were also on standby in Guadalupe, Makati. The Philippine government allocated ₱6.9million in relief funds {{to deal with the}} effects of Rumbia. The Department of Social Welfare and Development in Eastern Visayas activated rapid response teams and prepared 1,040family food packs for potential delivery in disaster areas. The department also readied ₱263,920 in standby food funds and ₱1.7million in food items, as well as ₱270,350 in standby non-food funds. The civil defense office in the province also called for the preemptive evacuation of citizens in potentially affected areas.

With the base plate positioned between the Australians and the US 1st Brigade's headquarters there was initial confusion over the source of the rounds, and both Gloztbach and Preece accused the other of firing on their positions. However, after US aircraft arrived overhead to illuminate the battlefield the Australians were able to join the fighting, and they began firing at masses of Viet Cong who had become disorientated and were milling around on the battlefield. Earlier, a number of Australian ambushes had intercepted Viet Cong pathfinder groups and this had largely prevented the communists from conducting a final reconnaissance of their objectives. Unaware of the newly strengthened defences, they had assaulted into the combined firepower of two American field artillery batteries firing over open sights, as well as tanks supported by infantry.
