40|$|Abstract—A {{wide-band}} {{slot antenna}} element is proposed as a building block for designing single- or multi-element wide-band or dual-band slot antennas. It is {{shown that a}} properly designed, offcentered, microstrip-fed, moderately wide slot antenna shows dual resonant behavior with similar radiation characteristics at both resonant frequencies and therefore {{can be used as}} a wide-band or dual-band element. This element shows bandwidth values up to 37 %, if used in the wide-band mode. When used in the dual-band mode, frequency ratios up to 1. 6 with bandwidths larger than 10 % at both frequency bands can be achieved without putting any constraints on the impedance matching, cross polarization levels, or radiation patterns of the antenna. The proposed wide-band slot element can also be incorporated in a multi-element antenna topology resulting in a very wide-band antenna with a minimum number of elements. It is also shown that, by using only two of these elements in a <b>parallel</b> <b>feed</b> topology, an antenna with good radiation parameters over a 2. 5 : 1 bandwidth ratio can be obtained.

40|$|This book {{presents}} a detailed and systematic analytical treatment of scattering by an arbitrary dipole array configuration with unequal-length dipoles, different inter-element spacing and load impedance. It provides a physical {{interpretation of the}} scattering phenomena within the phased array system. The antenna radar cross section (RCS) depends on the field scattered by the antenna towards the receiver. It has two components, viz. structural RCS and antenna mode RCS. The latter component dominates the former, especially if the antenna is mounted on a low observable platform. The reduction in the scattering due {{to the presence of}} antennas on the surface is one of the concerns towards stealth technology. In order to achieve this objective, a detailed and accurate analysis of antenna mode scattering is required. In practical phased array, one cannot ignore the finite dimensions of antenna elements, coupling effect and the role of feed network while estimating the antenna RCS. This book presents the RCS estimation of an array with unequal-length dipoles. The signal reflections within the antenna system and the mutual coupling effect are considered to arrive at the total RCS for series and <b>parallel</b> <b>feed.</b> The computations are valid for any arbitrary array configurations, including side-by-side arrangement, parallel-in-echelon, etc...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It is {{demonstrated}} that the bandwidth of circular polarization (CP) can be significantly increased when one more parasitic loop is added inside the original loop. A single-loop antenna has only one minimum axial ratio (AR) point while the two-loop antenna can create two minimum AR points. An appropriate {{combination of the two}} minimum AR points results in a significant enhancement for the CP bandwidth. A comprehensive study of the new type of broad-band circularly polarized antennas is presented. Several loop configurations, including a circular loop, a rhombic loop, and a dual rhombic loop with a series feed and a <b>parallel</b> <b>feed,</b> are investigated. The AR (2 dB) bandwidth of the circular-loop antenna with a parasitic circular loop is found to be 20 %, {{more than three times the}} AR bandwidth of a single loop. For the rhombic-loop antenna with a parasitic rhombic loop, an AR bandwidth @e ‚ 2 dBAof more than 40 % can be achieved by changing the rhombus vertex angle. The AR (2 dB) bandwidths of the series-fed and parallel-fed dual rhombic-loop antennas with a parasitic element are 30 % and 50 %, respectively.

40|$|Increasing {{global demand}} for fresh water is driving {{research}} and development of advanced desalination technologies. As a result, a detailed model of multiple effect distillation (MED) is developed that is flexible, simple to implement, and suitable for use in optimization of water and power cogeneration systems. The MED system is modeled in a modular method in which each of the subcomponents is modeled individually and then instantiated as necessary in order to piece together the complete plant model. Modular development allows for studying various MED configurations (such as forward feed, <b>parallel</b> <b>feed,</b> etc.) with minimal code duplication. Use of equation-oriented solvers, such as Engineering Equation Solver and JACOBIAN, rather than sequential solvers, simplifies the coding complexity dramatically and also reduces the number of required approximations and assumptions. The developed model is compared with four prominent forward feed MED models from literature. Through parametric analysis, it is found that the present model compares very well with the simple model provided by El-Sayed and Silver while providing substantially more detail in regard to the various temperature profiles within the MED system. Further, the model is easier to implement than the detailed El-Dessouky model while relying on fewer assumptions. The increased detail of the model allows for proper sensitivities to key variables related to input, operating, and design conditions necessary for use in a cogeneration or hybrid system optimization process.

40|$|This book {{focuses on}} {{determination}} of scattering of parallel-fed planar dipole arrays {{in terms of}} reflection and transmission coefficients {{at different levels of}} the array system. In aerospace vehicles, the phased arrays are often in planar configuration. The radar cross section (RCS) of the vehicle is mainly due to its structure and the antennas mounted over it. There can be situation when the signatures due to antennas dominate over the structural RCS of the platform. This necessitates the study towards the reduction and control of antenna/ array RCS. The planar dipole array is considered as a stacked linear dipole array. A systematic, step-by-step approach is used to determine the RCS pattern including the finite dimensions of dipole antenna elements. The mutual impedance between the dipole elements for planar configuration is determined. The scattering till second-level of couplers in <b>parallel</b> <b>feed</b> network is taken into account.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Many {{countries}} worldwide experience {{water shortages}} {{on a daily}} basis and this water crisis is expected to increase even more in the near future due to limited fresh water resources. Alternative sources of fresh water such as desalinated seawater are becoming an attractive option for many developing countries. Although various desalination technologies exist today, interest in multi-effect distillation (MED) is growing rapidly worldwide. Today various energy power sources are utilized in MED plants, but the use of nuclear power as a clean and effective heat source for the MED process seems to be gaining interest. Implementation of HTGR technology, such as the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor being developed in South Africa is ideal for MED desalination purposes. In these types of reactors high temperature water is available as waste heat as opposed to high temperature steam from conventional steam power plants. Currently conventional MED plants utilize steam as the process heat source, to drive the MED process. In this study a system simulation model was developed in the computer language C++. It evaluates different MED process flow configurations in order to identify an optimum MED plant configuration for both water and steam as process heat source. Simulation results indicate that a steam-heat-source (SHS) MED plant produces approximately 25 - 30 % more product water than a water-heat-source (WHS) MED plant while utilizing less plant stages. Plant layout and economics are impacted by the available process heat source. Results also indicate that a <b>parallel</b> <b>feed</b> configuration (PFC), which incorporates preheating of feed water, seems to be the optimum process flow configuration type for both the SHS and WHS type plants. Product water costs for optimized SHS and WHS MED plants were also compared.

Preheating of feed water increases production levels up to 30 %.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{increasing}} demands of advance wireless communications and radar systems, several novel types of bandpass filters and bandstop filters have been developed in this thesis. A new type of varactor-tuned dual-mode bandpass filters have been presented to achieve a nearly constant absolute bandwidth over a wide tuning range by using a single DC bias circuit. Since the two operating modes (i. e., the odd and even modes) in a dualmode microstrip open-loop resonator do not couple to each other, tuning the passband frequency is accomplished by merely changing the two modal frequencies proportionally. Design equations and procedures are derived, and two two-pole tunable bandpass filters and a four-pole tunable bandpass filter of this type are demonstrated experimentally. Miniature microstrip doublet dual-mode filters that exhibit quasi-elliptic function response without using any cross coupling have been developed. It shows that a single two-pole filter or the doublet can produce two transmission zeros resulting from a double behaviour of the dual-mode resonator of this type. Electromagnetic (EM) simulation and experiment results of the proposed filters are described. <b>Parallel</b> <b>feed</b> configuration of a microstrip quasi-elliptic function bandpass filter has been built with a pair of open-loop dual-mode resonators. By employing this new coupling scheme, a novel filter topology with three-pole quasi-elliptic function frequency response can be obtained, leading to good passband performance, such as low insertion loss and good matching at the mid-band of passband. A designed three-pole bandpass filter of this type is demonstrated experimentally. A new class of dual-band filters based on non-degenerate dual-mode microstrip slow-wave open-loop resonators, which support two non-degenerate modes that do not couple, have been introduced. Different feed schemes that affect the filtering characteristics are investigated. Examples of dual-band filters of this type are described with simulation and experiment results. iii In order to achieve a wide spurious-free upper passband, a novel design of bandstop filter with cancellation of first spurious mode by using coupled three-section step impedance resonators (SIRs) has been developed. This cancellation occurs when two transmission poles coincide with the first spurious mode (transmission zero) by properly choosing the step impedance ratio and the gap between the SIR and the main transmission line. A stripline bandstop filter and a microstrip bandstop filter of this type are designed, fabricated and tested. As a preliminary investigation, the microstrip filter is tuned electronically using ferroelectric thin film varactors...|$|E
40|$|Water {{scarcity}} {{and energy}} supply are currently {{two of the}} major problems faced by the global society. The growth of the world’s population along {{with the rise of}} industrial activities, especially in developing countries, is leading to a rapid increase of the energy consumption and the construction of new power plants. Most of these plants are based on fossil fuels, which emit harmful greenhouse gases (mainly CO 2) and contribute to global warming on Earth. Power production technologies which use renewable energies (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.) as energy source represent clean and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional methods, particularly Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants, which have been proved as a reliable system for power generation. On the other hand, although more than 70 % of the Earth’s surface is water, fresh water represents only 2. 5 % of the total volume in the hydrosphere, approximately, being the rest saline water. Furthermore, of that fresh water percentage, a 69 % is contained in form of glaciers and ice sheets, from which its extraction does not result neither economically nor environmentally viable. Therefore, the fresh water production by means of seawater desalination can help to solve water supply problems in arid areas of the world, as it has been proved in Middle East countries since the middle of the twentieth century. In addition, regions of the world suffering from water stress habitually have high levels of solar irradiation and access to the sea, which suggest the use of solar energy to produce fresh water by seawater desalination in those regions. Also, the power and water supply issues are linked, because power generation, either by conventional or renewable technologies, need great amounts of water (particularly for the cooling requirements of the power cycle), and fresh water production by seawater desalination require high amounts of energy. Therefore, the combined generation of power and fresh water by integrating desalination processes and concentrating solar power plants, concept known as CSP+D, may help to solve the issues emerged regarding the power and water supply in such regions of the world. The specific objectives and goals set out in the present research work are to develop a partial-load model for the Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) seawater desalination process with Thermal Vapour Compression (TVC) (variable nozzle thermocompressors) integrated in a CSP plant (similar to Andasol I plant) as a tool to simulate the plant performance regarding both, electricity and water production, and to analyse high efficient MED processes and their integration within parabolic trough concentrating solar power plants. To that end, firstly a literature review on CSP+D has been performed to present the state-of-the-art of this technology and different approaches to this concept. Then, a preliminary thermo-economic study has been carried out for a particular case of the combination of a parabolic trough CSP plant with direct steam generation and two different desalination technologies, Reverse Osmosis (RO) and multi-effect distillation. Results obtained show that the bet coupling option, which produce the lower levelised cost of water, is the RO process. Also, it is recommended its indirect integration with the CSP plant, connected directly to the local grid. It is concluded that, in view of the lack of agreement among scientific community about the most suitable technology for integrating with a CSP plant and due to the potential of the combined freshwater and power production with MED and CSP, further investigation with higher efficient MED plants is needed. In this regard, two methods to improve the efficiency of MED processes have been investigated: the increase of the number of effects, which leads to an increase in the Top Brine Temperature (TBT), and its coupling with thermocompressors. The first case has been assessed by using seawater pretreatments that permit to elevate the temperature of the MED process without scale formation, like the nanofiltration membranes. For this purpose, a detailed mathematical model has been developed for a MED plant with forward-feed configuration and the model was implemented within Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software environment. Such feed arrangement has been selected in order to minimize the scale risk on the tubes of the heat exchangers. Results show that the Gain Output Ratio (GOR) is greatly improved (up to a 70 %), while the specific heat transfer area and specific energy consumption are significantly reduced (11 and 45 %, respectively). Despite of the great potential of this improvement to the MED process, the analysis of its integration into a CSP plant has been not pursued because there are not commercial MED plants using the forward feed scheme. Moreover, the increase of auxiliary consumption attributable to nanofiltration pretreatment may be not suitable for solar applications. Most commercial MED plants are based on the <b>parallel</b> <b>feed</b> MED-TVC process, which presents several advantages for its coupling with power plants. Therefore, this technology has been selected for the analysis of its coupling with CSP plants. A preliminary evaluation has been performed for a particular case study, simulating the power and water productions of a parabolic trough CSP plant of 50 MWe, with features similar to commercial Andasol-I CSP plant, and a MED-TVC unit of 10, 000 m 3 /d, based on commercial Trapani plant (Italy), during three representative days in winter and summer periods. Two different steam extractions have been considered to feed the MED-TVC unit, one from the high pressure turbine, and other from the low pressure turbine. The CSP model has been taken from the literature and implemented in MATLAB software environment, and the power block model, implemented in EES, has been developed to simulate part load conditions. From this assessment it is concluded that different integration schemes are needed to accomplish for the different profile demands of power and water during the year, in order to promote the power generation or the water production. Later, a parametric study of the integration of a parallel/cross MED-TVC, based on Trapani commercial plant, with a Rankine cycle power block similar to that one of Andasol-I, has been carried out in order to identify the best coupling arrangement, in terms of efficiency and minimum specific heat transfer area. To that end, a detailed design mathematical model of the MED-TVC unit has been developed and validated against actual data. It is found that the maximum GOR and minimum specific area are reached for a particular thermocompressor location, depending on the motive steam pressure fed into the thermocompressor. Also, an operation MED-TVC model has been developed, based on the design model, and used to determine the operational limits of the integration with a Rankine cycle power block that allowed the MED unit to work in nominal conditions (which has been possible by considering variable nozzle thermocompressors), for four different steam extractions of the turbines. For this purpose, the power block has been simulated at different loads, and a control algorithm has been also introduced {{in order to maintain the}} maximum brine salinity under 70, 000 ppm and the end condenser temperature around 37 °C. Finally, annual simulations of the coupling between a parallel/cross MED-TVC unit and a parabolic trough CSP have been performed, considering Almería (Spain) as the geographical location of the cogeneration plant. The models previously presented for the solar field, power block and desalination unit (off-design models) have been used. As a particular case study, the daily, monthly and yearly power and water productions have been estimated, using two different steam extractions, equal to those ones identified in the previous analyses: one from the high pressure turbine, at 45. 4 bar, and other from the low pressure turbine, at 3. 63 bar, which have been used alternatively to feed the MED-TVC unit depending on the monthly power demand for that location. La escasez de agua y el abastecimiento energético son actualmente dos de los mayores retos a los que se enfrenta la sociedad global. El crecimiento de la población mundial junto con el aumento de las actividades industriales, especialmente en los países en vía de desarrollo, está provocando un rápido incremento del consumo energético y, en consecuencia, de la construcción de nuevas plantas de producción de potencia. La mayoría de dichas plantas están basadas en la utilización de combustibles fósiles, los cuales emiten en su combustión gases de efecto invernadero (principalmente CO 2), contribuyendo al calentamiento global del planeta. Las tecnologías de producción de potencia que emplean energías renovables (solar, eólica, geotérmica, etc.) como fuente energética representan una alternativa limpia y respetuosa con el medio ambiente, en particular las plantas solares de concentración, las cuales han demostrado ser un sistema fiable para la generación de energía eléctrica. Por el contrario, aunque más del 70 % de la superficie terrestre es agua, el agua dulce representa aproximadamente el 2. 5 % del volumen total de la hidrosfera, siendo el resto agua salada. Además, de dicho porcentaje de agua dulce, alrededor del 69 % está incluida en glaciares y nieves permanentes, siendo su extracción poco viable, tanto desde un punto de vista económico como medioambiental. Por lo tanto, la producción de agua dulce mediante la desalación de agua de mar puede ayudar a resolver los problemas de abastecimiento de agua en las zonas áridas del planeta, como ha sido probado en los países de Oriente Medio desde la segunda mitad del siglo XX. Asimismo, aquellas regiones del mundo que sufren problemas de estrés hídrico presentan habitualmente altos niveles de irradiación solar, lo que sugiere la utilización de la energía solar para producir agua dulce mediante la desalación de agua de mar en dichas zonas con acceso directo a la costa. Existe también una conexión entre los problemas asociados al abastecimiento de agua y energía, debido a que la generación de electricidad, ya sea por medios convencionales o tecnologías renovables, requiere grandes cantidades de agua (en particular para la refrigeración del ciclo de potencia), y a su vez, la producción de agua mediante desalación de agua de mar precisa de un alto consumo energético. De los anteriores razonamientos puede concluirse que la cogeneración de agua y electricidad mediante la integración de procesos de desalación de agua de mar y plantas termosolares de concentración, podría ayudar a resolver, al menos parcialmente, los problemas de suministro energético y de agua dulce en dichas zonas del planeta. Los principales objetivos de este trabajo de investigación son el desarrollo de un modelo a carga parcial para procesos de destilación multiefecto (Multi-Effect Distillation, MED) con compresión térmica de vapor (Thermal Vapor Compression, TVC), integrados en una planta termosolar de concentración (Concentrating Solar Power, CSP) con tecnología de captadores cilindroparabólicos (Parabolic Trough, PT) de similares características a la planta CSP comercial Andasol-I, como una herramienta que permita simular la eficiencia de la producción conjunta de agua y electricidad, y el análisis de procesos MED de alta eficiencia integrados en plantas PT-CSP. A este fin, primero se ha llevado a cabo una revisión bibliográfica sobre dicho tema para presentar el estado actual de la tecnología propuesta y los diferentes acercamientos a este concepto. Posteriormente, se ha realizado un estudio termoeconómico preliminar para un caso particular de la integración de una planta de termosolar de captadores cilindroparabólicos con generación directa de vapor y dos tecnologías de desalación: ósmosis inversa y destilación multiefecto. Los resultados han revelado que la ósmosis inversa es la mejor opción de integración ya que genera los menores costes anualizados de producción de agua. Además, se recomienda la integración indirecta con la planta termosolar, conectándose directamente a la red eléctrica local. De dichos análisis se ha concluido que no existe acuerdo entre la comunidad científica en cuanto a la tecnología de desalación más adecuada para su combinación o acoplamiento con una planta termosolar de concentración. Además, debido al potencial mostrado por la destilación multiefecto para su integración con plantas CSP, se requiere una investigación más profunda sobre las posibilidades de aumento de eficiencia de esta tecnología. En esta línea, han sido evaluados dos métodos para aumentar la eficiencia del proceso de destilación multiefecto: el aumento del número de efectos, que conduce a un incremento de la temperatura máxima de salmuera, y la introducción de la compresión térmica de vapor. En el primer caso, el aumento de la temperatura máxima de salmuera sin aparición de incrustaciones salinas en los tubos de los intercambiadores de calor (scaling) precisa la utilización de un pretratamiento del agua de mar tal como la nanofiltración, la cual elimina los iones bivalentes causantes de dicho efecto. Para este propósito se ha desarrollado un modelo matemático detallado del proceso de destilación multiefecto con alimentación frontal (o hacia delante), el cual ha sido implementado en el entorno Engineering Equation Solver (EES). Dicha configuración ha sido elegida para minimizar los riesgos de aparición incrustaciones en los tubos de los intercambiadores de calor. Los resultados han mostrado que la eficiencia térmica del proceso, medida mediante el Gain Output Ratio (GOR), se incrementa considerablemente (hasta en un 70 %), mientras que el área específica de transferencia y consumo energético específico se reducen significativamente (en un 11 y 45 %, respectivamente). A pesar del gran potencial mostrado por esta mejora del proceso MED, no se ha analizado su integración en plantas CSP debido a que no existen unidades MED comerciales utilizando dicha configuración, y además el aumento del consumo auxiliar causado por el pretratamiento de nanofiltración podría no ser adecuado para aplicaciones solares. La mayoría de plantas comerciales tienen configuración de flujo paralelo/cruzado con compresión térmica de vapor, la cual presenta ventajas para su acoplamiento con plantas CSP. Una primera evaluación de esta integración ha sido realizada para un caso particular de estudio, simulando la producción conjunta de agua y electricidad en una planta PT-CSP de 50 MWe, con características similares a la planta comercial Andasol-I en Granada (España), y una unidad MED-TVC de 10, 000 m 3 /d, basada en la planta comercial de Trapani (Italia), durante tres días representativos de invierno y tres días de verano. Se han considerado dos extracciones diferentes de turbina para alimentar la planta desalinizadora, una del cuerpo de turbina de alta presión y otra del cuerpo de turbina de baja presión. El modelo del campo solar de la planta CSP se ha tomado de la literatura científica y ha sido implementado en el entorno MATLAB, mientras que el bloque de potencia, implementado en EES, se ha desarrollado para simular condiciones de operación a carga parcial. De este estudio se ha concluido que se requieren diferentes esquemas de integración para cumplir con los diferentes perfiles de demanda de agua y electricidad durante el año, de manera que se otorgue mayor prioridad a la producción de agua o la generación de energía eléctrica. Más tarde se ha realizado un estudio paramétrico de la integración de una planta desalinizadora MED-TVC, basada en la configuración de la planta comercial de Trapani, con un ciclo de potencia Rankine similar al de la planta CSP Andasol-I, con objeto de identificar el mejor acoplamiento, desde el punto de vista de eficiencia y área de intercambio de calor mínima. A este fin, se ha desarrollado un modelo matemático detallado del proceso MED-TVC con alimentación en paralelo/cruzado y se ha validado con datos de una planta real. Se ha encontrado que el máximo GOR y la mínima área específica se obtienen para una posición particular del termocompresor, dependiendo de la presión del vapor motriz que alimenta al termocompresor. Además, se ha desarrollado un modelo de operación del proceso MED-TVC, basado en el modelo de diseño, y se ha utilizado para determinar los límites de operación de la integración con ciclos de potencia Rankine tales que permitían trabajar a la unidad MED en condiciones nominales (lo cual fue posible considerando termocompresores de área variable), para cuatro extracciones de vapor diferentes. Para este propósito, se ha simulado la operación del bloque de potencia a diferentes cargas y se ha introducido un algoritmo de control para mantener la salinidad máxima de la salmuera en valores por debajo de 70, 000 ppm y la temperatura del condensador final alrededor de su valor de diseño, 37 °C. Para finalizar, se han efectuado simulaciones anuales de la integración de una unidad de destilación multiefecto con compresión térmica de vapor (en flujo paralelo/cruzado) y una planta termosolar de captadores cilindroparabólicos, considerando Almería (España) como la localización geográfica de la hipotética planta de cogeneración. Los modelos presentados previamente del campo solar, bloque de potencia y unidad de desalación (modelos para la operación a caga parcial) han sido utilizados en las simulaciones. Como un caso particular de estudio, se ha estimado la producción diaria, mensual y anual de electricidad y agua considerando dos extracciones de vapor de diferentes presiones, iguales a las identificadas en el estudio anterior: una perteneciente a la turbina de alta presión, a 45. 4 bar, y otra de la turbina de baja presión, a 3. 63 bar, las cuales se han utilizado alternativamente para alimentar la unidad MED-TVC dependiendo de la demanda mensual de electricidad y agua en dicha localización...|$|E

For this purpose we present voltage control procedures and criteria and model high speed line and train using PSCAD/EMTDC to compare power losses in various feeding condition. Power losses of the simulation result in power control before and after in single point feeding system was reduced maximum 0. 37 MW(23. 8 %) and average 0. 23 MW(20. 5 %) when one vehicle load operates maximum load condition. When three vehicles operate maximum load condition in one feeder section, power losses after voltage control was reduced 1. 03 MW(49. 5 %) compared to before voltage control. And, power loss of <b>parallel</b> <b>feeding</b> system is reduced the average 0. 08 MW(7. 2 %) compared to the single feeding system.

40|$|Abstract. •The {{study of}} {{ecological}} convergence, {{the evolution of}} similar traits on multiple occasions in response to similar conditions, is a powerful method for developing and testing adaptive hypotheses. However, despite the great attention paid to geographic variation and the foraging ecology of birds, surprisingly few cases of convergent or <b>parallel</b> <b>feeding</b> adaptations have been adequately documented. In this study, we document a biogeographic pattern of parallel bill morphology across 10 sparrow taxa endemic to tidal marshes. All North American tidal marsh sparrows display parallel differentiation from close relatives in other habitats, suggesting that selection on bill morphology is strong. Relative to their body mass, tidal marsh sparrows have longer, thinner bills than their non-tidal marsh coun-terparts, which is likely an adaptation for consuming more invertebrates and fewer seeds, {{as well as for}} probing in sediment crevices to capture prey. Published data on tidal marsh food resources and diet of the relevant taxa support this hypothesis. This morphological differentiation is most pronounced between sister taxa with the greatest estimated divergence times, but is found even in taxa that show little or no structure in molecular genetic markers. We, therefore, speculate that tidal marsh ecosystems are likely settings for ecological speciation.

40|$|Abstract—Design and {{fabrication}} {{aspects of}} an affordable planar beam steerable antenna array {{with a simple}} architecture are considered in this paper. Grouping {{the elements of a}} phased array into a number of partially overlapped subarrays and using a single phase shifter for each subarray, generally results in a considerable reduction in array size and manufacturing costs. However, overlapped subarrays require complicated corporate feed networks and array architectures that cannot be easily implemented using planar technologies. In this paper a novel feed network and array architecture for implementing a planar phased array of microstrip antennas is presented that enables the fabrication of low-sidelobe, compact, beam-steerable millimeter-wave arrays and facilitates integration of the RF front-end electronics with the antenna structure. This design uses a combination of series and <b>parallel</b> <b>feeding</b> schemes to achieve the desired array coefficients. The proposed approach is used to design a three-state switched-beam phased array with a scanning width of 10. This phased array which is composed of 80 microstrip elements, achieves a gain of 20 dB, a sidelobe level of 19 dB and a 10 -dB bandwidth of 6. 3 % for all states of the beam. The antenna efficiency is measured at 33 – 36 % in band. It is shown that the proposed feeding scheme is insensitive to the mutual coupling among the elements.

40|$|Effect of nut {{consumption}} on {{oxidative stress}} and the endothelial function in metabolic syndromeBACKGROUND & AIMS: Oxidative stress has {{a key role}} in atherosclerosis, cancer and other chronic diseases. Some bioactive compounds in nuts have been implicated in antioxidant activities. OBJECTIVE: We assessed how nut consumption affected several markers of oxidation and endothelial function (EF) in metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, controlled, <b>parallel</b> <b>feeding</b> trial was conducted on 50 MetS adults who were recommended a healthy diet supplemented or not with 30 g of mixed nuts (Nut and Control groups, respectively) every day for 12 weeks. The plasma antioxidant capacity (AC), oxidized LDL (oxLDL), conjugated diene (CD) formation, urine 8 -isoprostanes, DNA damage assessed by yield of urine 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxo-dG), and EF assessed by peripheral artery tonometry (PAT) and biochemical markers, were measured at baseline {{and the end of the}} intervention. RESULTS: No significant differences in changes between groups were observed in AC, oxLDL, CD, 8 -isoprostanes or EF during the intervention, whereas the reduction in DNA damage was significant in the Nut group compared to Control group (P &lt; 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Nut consumption has no deleterious effect on lipid oxidation. The decrease in DNA damage observed in this study could contribute to explain the beneficial effects of regular nut consumption on some MetS features and several chronic diseases...|$|R

A randomized, double-blind, 28 day <b>parallel</b> <b>feeding</b> trial compared gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance and hydration in healthy term newborn infants fed either a commercialized soy formula (with history of safe use) containing sucrose as 20 % of total carbohydrate, no supplemental short-chain FOS (scFOS) and no mixed carotenoids (lutein, lycopene, beta-carotene) as a control (CF, n = 62 infants) or one of two experimental soy-based formulas, EF 1 (n = 64) and EF 2 (n = 62) containing scFOS (2. 5 g/L) and mixed carotenoids. EF 1 differed from EF 2 by containing sucrose. Results indicated no significant study group differences (p > 0. 05) in study completion rates (CF = 81, EF 1 = 86, & EF 2 = 87 %), growth, mean rank stool consistency, stool frequency, formula intake, spit-up/vomit, and safety measures (urine specific gravity, USG; hydration status and adverse events). Mean USGs for study groups were normal ( CF group in percent yellow stools (p < 0. 01 at age 14 days).

However, traditional microcode (used since the 1950s) also inherently shares many of the same properties; the new method differs mainly in that the translation to micro-operations now occurs asynchronously.

This use of the seismometers (which they may be both horizontal or, one is vertical) is called "two seismometers seismograph" or simply " 2 S-S". 2 S-seismograph performs new capabilities: 1. -it cause to a higher gain {{which is based on}} directly ground motion energy from the two orthogonal components of signals, 2. -it has a much smoother response curve than that of the single use of seismometer, 3. -because of this smoothing, we are able to apply a higher level of static magnification which cause to widening the response at its both ends, therefore, 2 S-System enable to work with a larger dynamic range frequency, 4. - it has a directional and motional filtering property which may be used in some cases advantageously, The contribution of " 1 ", " 2 ", " 3 " and " 4 " correspond to unique instrumental improvements for which seismography are ever needed.
