40|$|Resumé Problems {{associated}} with awarding of public procurement by sector <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> The topic of this Dissertation is presentation of certain problems {{associated with}} awarding of public procurement by sector <b>contracting</b> <b>entities.</b> To begin with, basic issues of tenders and public procurement procedures are presented in a legal framework, referring {{not only to the}} Laws of the Czech Republic but also to the Laws of the European Union. This part includes definitions of basic terms, especially the public procurement concept and principles of applicable legislation. A short historical context concerning development of the legal norm after 1989 is provided. In the actual text, appropriate attention is paid to differentiation of <b>public</b> <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> with an emphasis on the content and development of the term "sector contracting entity". The definition of sector <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> is a key term of this Dissertation. The process of awarding of public procurement by a sector <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> is subject to numerous legal exemptions, as well as some specific law regulations. These exemptions and law regulations are described and thoroughly analysed in the Dissertation. In relevant cases, a comparison between the existing laws and legislation amendments enacted as of April 1, 2012 is made, completed [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} typical {{decisions}} made by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> which restrict the competition among economic operators. The thesis analyses the typical mistakes which are made by the <b>contract</b> <b>entities</b> in awarding procedures. The causes of mistakes being made by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> can be summarized into three groups. Into the first group belong conscious mistakes. For these mistakes shall be contracting entities` agents held responsible. Into the second group belong mistakes in planning. Mistakes from the third group are made {{as a consequence of}} lack of professional skills. None of these mistakes can be prevented just by an amendment to the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts.</b> Any proposal of an amendment solving the lack of professional skills shall consider also all connected negative effects; mainly additional time demands, financial costs and the risk of underfinanced praxis turning into formalism. Professionally skilled agents are usually more careful when they apply the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> because they are aware of legal risks. Considering current limited budget resources it should be decided whether to put stress on cooperation with internal or external experts. The author recommends internal experts because external experts do not do their best if they are aware of the fact being not controlled effectively by internal experts. However the current Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> is not perfect, the duties laid by it are enforced successfully. Considering a new amendment also the legal theory shall be taken into account. The author presumes similarity of preventing of breaches against the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> and of preventing of crimes. The most important factor preventing from criminality is to be aware that the punishment is inescapable, not its rates. The author points out also the opinion of the general theory of law according to which a new act is to be passed only if there is an objective necessary need. It should not to be passed by a fortuity or because of subjective views. There should be also a time space between the amendments. There was an amendment to Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> approved in 2010 and European Union currently prepares amending of awarding directives. The author therefore prefers improving the praxis of awarding in the Czech Republic by granting additional human resources to the Office for the Protection of Competition to passing of another amendment to the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts.</b> The scope of the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> is also not convenient for amending a list of contract clauses which are not allowed to be concluded by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities.</b> There are two reasons. <b>Contracting</b> <b>entities</b> are constituted by various groups of subjects and contracts selling their property are outside the scope of the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts.</b> <b>Contracting</b> <b>entities</b> should use standard awarding procedure to promote competition among economic operators. They should concentrate on exactness of tender conditions. A good prevention to mistakes in awarding procedure is also good planning and skilled human recourses of <b>contracting</b> <b>entities...</b>|$|R
40|$|RESUMÉ CONTRACTING <b>ENTITY</b> OF <b>PUBLIC</b> <b>CONTRACT</b> The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} and represent the current legal regulation of <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> of <b>public</b> <b>contract,</b> {{as well as to}} highlight some of the key judgments of the ECJ and decisions and opinions of the Office for the Protection of Competition in relation to the <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> of <b>public</b> <b>contract.</b> In this thesis, I have tried to focus on the general definition of a <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> of <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> and the descriptions of different types of <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> of <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> - a contracting authority, a subsidized <b>contracting</b> <b>entity,</b> as well as a sector entity. Undoubtedly an interesting area, which is also the subject of this thesis, is the centralized procurement. Regarding the fact that this institution is not very widespread in the Czech Republic, I have joined the description of a central public procurement in selected European countries to this chapter. The conclusion of this thesis is devoted to a brief outline of the current amendment to Act No. 137 / 2006 Coll., on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts,</b> as amended, which is currently {{at the beginning of the}} legislative process. In this final chapter, I have also joined some of my thoughts to the legal aspects in relation to the <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> of <b>public</b> <b>contract.</b> Personally, I believe that the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{institute}} of public procurement a considerable volume of financial resources is allocated. It is therefore {{in the interest of}} <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> to seek ways of how to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. Some public contract-awarding entities, along with some public-administration authorities in the Czech Republic, believe that the use of a single evaluation criterion (the lowest bid price) results in a more efficient tender for a <b>public</b> <b>contract.</b> It was found that <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> in the Czech Republic strongly prefer to use the lowest bid price criterion. Within the examined sample, 86. 5 % of public procurements were evaluated this way. The analysis of the examined sample of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> proved that the choice of an evaluation criterion, even the preference of the lowest bid price criterion, does not have any obvious impact on the final cost of a <b>public</b> <b>contract.</b> The study concludes that it is inappropriate to prefer the criterion of the lowest bid price within the evaluation of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> that are characterised by their complexity (including <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> for construction works and <b>public</b> service <b>contracts).</b> The findings of the Supreme Audit Office related to the inspection of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> indicate that when using the lowest bid price as an evaluation criterion, a <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> may indeed be tendered with the lowest bid price, but not necessarily the best offer in terms of supplied quality. It is therefore not appropriate to use the lowest bid price evaluation criterion to such an extent for the purpose of evaluating work and services. Any improvement to this situation requires a corresponding amendment to the Law on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> and mainly a radical change in the attitude of the Office for the Protection of Competition towards proposed changes, as indicated within the conclusions and recommendations proposed by this study...|$|R

Own empirical research comprises two parts. The first part of research is based on data about <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> from the Czech Republic between 2011 and 2013 announced via the Information System on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts.</b> The data allow investigating criteria and their weights used by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> in relationship to characteristics of the public contracts; especially the subject-matter {{and the value of}} the contract. The second part of the research is based on sample data file of contract announcements for contracts evaluated according to the economic advantageousness of the tender. The data allow investigating methods of multi-criteria decision making and approaches to qualitative criteria. Findings from the theory and the conducted research were source for a normative model for selection of criteria and methods of multi-criteria decision-making. The goal of the model is to enhance the quality of decision-making in the field of <b>public</b> <b>contracts.</b> The most important contribution of the model is the connection of the three key parts of multi-criteria decision-making; criteria, its weights and methods of multi-criteria decision-making...|$|R

The law of government contracts, in international and municipal law, seeks to balance the stability of contractual relations between the parties and the mutability of the contract which flows from {{a recognition of the}} primacy of the public interest. The precise balance struck varies from one legal system to another. Part One of the work looks, firstly, at the recognition, immunities and capacity of public entities in international commercial transactions. Secondly, it treats the conflict of laws rules applicable before national and arbitral jurisdictions. Thirdly, it explores the various possibilities of applicable law, namely the law of the contracting State, the lex mercatoria and public international law. Part Two examines, from a comparative perspective, the notions of "public body", "public contract" and "contrat administratif" in Ameircan, English and French law.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of transparency and openness to competition in public procurement in the Czech Republic. The problems of the Czech procurement market have been demonstrated on the analysis of a sample of contracts awarded by local government entities. From among a set of factors influencing the efficiency of public procurement, we closely analyse transparency, resilience against corruption, openness, effective administrative award procedure, and formulation of appropriate evaluation criteria for selecting the most suitable bid. Some assumptions were confirmed, including a positive effect of open procedures {{on the level of}} competition on the supply side as well as the dominant use of price criteria only. The latter case is probably often caused by low skills of workers at the <b>contracting</b> <b>entities,</b> as well as the lack of resources in public budgets. However, we have to reject the persistent legend of “undershooting” tender prices and subsequently increasing the final prices of <b>public</b> <b>contracts.</b> Increases of final prices are very limited. Based on the results of the analyses presented, we argue that the main problem of the Czech public procurement market lies in a rather low competence of administrators who are not able to use non-price criteria more often...|$|R
