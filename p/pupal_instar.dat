50|$|Two peaks {{occur in}} the number of larvae present in the colony. The first peak occurs in early June, coming right after the peak egg count. The second, highest peak of the larval {{population}} happens in July at exactly {{the same time as the}} highest peak in the egg count. This is probably so closely matching because eggs hatch into larvae very quickly in July, when the temperature is high. The median count of larvae decreases slightly in August and then rapidly decreases to nothing (zero) in September. The speedy fall in larval population happens because larvae pupate, and late in the season there is increased parasitism of larvae and brood destruction wrought by the adult wasps. In early June, the first pupae appear. Compared to eggs and larvae, the pupal population seems to only have one maximum.

The studies were developed in the experimental farm of the State University of Mato Grosso do Sul, in Aquidauana, from March 2011 to April 2012. In a forest fragment of the cerrado, when encountering fallen tree trunks, they were cut into small pieces for extraction and acquisition of immature and adult Melolonthidae. Larvae were taken to the laboratory where they were reared until emergence of adults, obtaining biological and biometric data. A total of 145 larvae and 11 adults were collected. Third instar larvae of Strategus surinamensis Burmeister, 1847, collected in this phase lasted 230 days and 31. 3 days in the <b>pupal</b> stage.

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of Sericostoma personatum (Spence) was studied at 6 °C, 10 °C and 14 °C and at each {{temperature}} at 8 and 14 hrs daylength. Embryogenesis was not temperature dependent in the 12 °- 18 °C range. Only 7 of 38 (app. 18 %) had a direct development, the rest remained in diapause with partly developed larvae. Hatching success of single egg masses was over 95 %. At 6 °C at both LDs, about 452 days are required for larval development. At 10 °C 370 days (LD 8 / 16), or 320 days (LD 14 / 10) and at 14 °C 319 days (LD 8 / 16) and 295 days (LD 14 / 10) were required. Duration of instars III and IV was longer at 6 °C (both LDs), compared with all other groups. Vth instar larvae of the 14 °C (LD 14 / 10) group grew fastest. Instar VI larvae of the 10 °C short day group developed faster than all others. Instar VII larvae of both 14 °C groups and of the 10 °C long day group develop faster than the rest. Duration of <b>pupal</b> <b>instar</b> is only temperature dependent, regardless of light regime. The field {{life cycle of}} S. personatum may require 2 - 5 years. Larvae are night active. They feed on Coarse Particular Organic Material (CPOM) on the sediment surface at night. They release faeces (Fine Particular Organic Material, FPOM) into the sediment where they rest by day at a few cm depth. Their burrowing behavior thus contributes to the retention of FPOM in the stream channel. Daily food consumption at constant 10 °C is significantly dependent on night length (r² = 0. 979, p < 0. 05). Two factors thus may limit food consumption: in winter, low temperatures, and in summer short nights. The species thus avoids competition by day-active shredders and predation by day-active predators. (DBO...|$|E

In C.albiceps, the length of larvae stage (first larval to <b>Pupal</b> <b>instar)</b> in 25 °C and 30 °C were 6 and 4 days, respectively. Different researchers determined different values for the length of this stage: Velez and Wolff (Velez & Wolff, 2008) (8 – 10 days at 25 °C); Grassberger (Grassberger et al., 2003) (8 – 10 days); Al-Shareef and Al-Qurashi (Al-Shareef & Al-Qurashi, 2016) (6 days); Queiroz (Queiroz, 1996) (5 days at 27 °C); Augul and Jassim (Augul, 2009) (3 days at 30 °C); AL-Shareef and Al-Qurashi(Al-Shareef & Al-Qurashi, 2016) (5 days); Richard et al. (Richards et al., 2008) (5. 5 days); Shiravi et al.(Shiravi et al., 2011) (2 – 3 days at 28 °C). In our research, the length of the pupal period for C.albiceps at 25 °C and 30 °C were determined as 5 and 3. 5 days, respectively. Again, other researchers determined different numbers: Grassberger (Grassberger et al., 2003). 1 and 5. 9 days at 25 °C and 30 °C, respectively; Al-Shareef and Al-Qurashi, (Al-Shareef & Al-Qurashi, 2016) 5. 5 and 4 days at 25 °C and 30 °C, respectively; Queiroz, (Queiroz, 1996) 4. 7 and 3 days at 27 °C and 32 °C respectively and Shiravi (Shiravi et al., 2011) (4 – 6 days at 28 °C). In addition, in our study, the length of egg to adult eclosion, at 25 °C and 30 °C were determined as 12 and 8 – 8. 5 days, respectively. Other researchers got the followings: Grassberger (Grassberger et al., 2003) 13 and 9. 9 days at 25 °C and 30 °C; Velez and Wolff (Augul, 2009) (14 days at 25 °C); Al-Shareef and Al-Qurashi, (Al-Shareef & Al-Qurashi, 2016) 11. 5 and 9 days at 25 °C and 30 °C respectively; Shiravi et al. (Shiravi et al., 2011) (8 – 12 days at 28 °C); and Queiroz(Queiroz, 1996) (7 days at 32 °C). The figures calculated for the life cycle of the speceis C.albiceps were more similar to the ones obtained in Al-shareef (Al-Shareef & Al-Qurashi, 2016) and Shiravi (Shiravi et al., 2011) studies and were different from others. The reason seems to be natural. As noted in various studies, inherent biogeographically variation between population (Marchenko, 1989; Donovan et al., 2006; Szpilla, 2010 a; Greenberg & Kunich, 2002) food substrate (Greenberg & Kunich, 2002; Kounouz & Kamel, 2017) humidity, population density and other intrinsic factors are considered as the reason of such differences (Faria & Godoy, 2001; Rosa et al., 2006). It seems that histolysis and histogenesis of the adult organs in immature stage were the reason of the highest thermal requirement of ADD in both 25 °C and 30 °C, during the pupal period, and the length of this development stage has been mentioned in most researches (Al-Shareef & Al-Qurashi, 2016; Queiroz, 1996; Bharti, 2009; Defilippo et al., 2013; Donovan et al., 2006; Richards et al., 2008; Augul, 2009; Velez & Wolff, 2008). Our findings about the life cycle of C.vicina showed that this species will also have shorter life cycle as the temperature increases such a way that at 15 °C, its life cycle, from the egg stage to adult, it took 32 days while at 20 °C, it took 21 days. For this species, other researchers obtained similar results: Reibe et al. (Reibe et al., 2009) at 13 °C and 20 °C, 45 and 23 days, respectively; Defilippo et al. (Defilippo et al., 2013) at 15 °C and 20 °C, 30. 5 and 20 days, respectively; Bharti (Bharti, 2009) at 20 °C and 25 °C, 19 and 15. 29 days. The results obtained from our study were more near to the ones obtained from the study done by Defilippo et al. (Defilippo et al., 2013). In terms of rate of development in C.vicina and C.albiceps, {{the results of this study}} were compatible with the finding of the studies of Greenberg,(Greenberg, 1991) (Lowne 1890), Defillipo et al (Defilippo et al., 2013) Such a way that the length of post-feeding and pupal periods were determined one third and half the total immature development stage, respectively. The amount of ADD was calculated for C.albiceps at 25 °C and 30 °C respectively, as 179 and 159 which correspond to the results obtained from the study done by Shiravi et al. (Shiravi et al., 2011) the amount of ADD, at 28 °C, was calculated between 130 and 195 DD. Moreover, the amount of ADD for the first larvae instar to adult of this species at 25 °C and 30 °C was calculated as 96 °C and 110 °C respectively. In the study done by AL-Shareef, (Al-Shareef & Al-Qurashi, 2016) the length of this period, at the same temperature, has been determined as 110 and 129. The life cycle of these species depends on some other factors, such as the geographic differences of population and genetics. Actually, the rate of development in necrophagous insects is the response of organisms to their thermal environment. Determining the rate of development of forensically important insects such as C.albiceps and C.vicina can give us valuable information concerning the circumstance of the death including the postmortem interval.|$|E

40|$|The braconid wasps {{represent}} one of {{the greatest}} family of the superfamily Ichneumonoidea inside Hymenoptera, to which we range Ichneumonidae and 8 small families, furthermore. The last catalogue of Braconidae enumerated 3731 species (Szépligeti, 1904). At present the number of the known species comprises all in all 13000. A new catalogue is published by Shenefelt since 1969. The plurality of the new braconid species are waited to discover outside Europe and North America on one hand and on the other the supposed number of the species living on the Earth is estimated about 30000. The modern classification distinguishes 20 subfamilies of Braconidae. The subfamilies mostly represent both taxonomical units and evolutionary trends (Tobias 1967, Papp 1974). The braconids arc primary parasites, neither secondary nor tertier braconid prasites are not known except Syntretus Först. There is not at all non-parasites braconid. They are parasitic exclusively during their Iarval stage, mostly in the larva of their hosts. True egg-parasites not among them. In their host-spectrum the caterpillars are predominate, the species of Opiinae-Alysiinae-Dacnbsinae are parasitic in different flies (Diptera), relatively small is the number of the braconid parasites of beetles and bugs. During their, parasitic life the braconids contribute a very important role in the terrestrial coenosae. In Szélenyi 2 ̆ 7,s (1955) biocoenological concept the braconids appear as two, structural elements (coetus) during a year incorporated in very much food-chain. In their instar stage as -obstant elements consuming animals (first of all caterpillars i. e. corrumpent elements), and in their imaginal stage as sustinent elements promoting the pollination of plants. The last role is much less significant than that of their obstancy. Highly important is their parasitic life in connection with that phenomenon of the coenosae which is named recently as biological circulation. Namely they take a high part in the checking of the prolification of their hosts over the quantity necessary. The plurality of the corrumpent elements posses a more or less series of entomophagous insects parasitizing them in their different developmental stege (i. e. from oval to imaginal stages). This phenomenon is disclosed as parasite-chain theory. In the, light of this theory it is necessary to study not only egg-parasites (relatively the most useful entomophagous insects) but <b>instar,</b> <b>pupal,</b> and imaginal parasites too.

40|$|In a field {{population}} of Bupalus piniarius in the Netherlands, Klomp (1958 a, 1966) found a negative correlation of population density with growth and adult fecundity. The experimental {{analysis of this}} relationship in B. piniarius is reported in this paper. Part I describes growth of isolated larvae, {{under the influence of}} abiotic factors. The experiments were performed at the former Institute for Biological Field Research (now amalgamated into the Research Institute for Nature Management) at Arnhem, in an outdoor insectary, the laboratory, and a greenhouse. The number of larval instars varied from four to eight, according to environmental conditions and sex. Warm conditions and long photoperiods tended {{to increase the number of}} instars. Females tended to moult one time more than males. Under given environmental conditions, the variation in number of instars was rarely more than one. In the field, growth proceeds through five or six, and, exceptionally through four, instars. Rate of growth was positively correlated with temperature, especially during the earlier larval stages, and negatively with photoperiod, particularly during the older larval stages. Warmth (e. g., 25 ° C) and long photoperiods (e. g., 17 hr) became detrimental towards the end of the larval stage. It is concluded that temperature and photoperiod influence the number of instars in Bupalus directly, rather than indirectly via the rate of growth. The period during which external factors determined the ultimate number of larval instars began in the embryonic stage and ended about the middle of the larval stage. The possible endocrine mechanism determining the number of instars is briefly discussed. Average pupal weight was positively correlated with number of larval instars. For a given number of larval <b>instars,</b> <b>pupal</b> weight was: 1) positively correlated with average temperature during the larval period, within the range of temperatures that permit normal development; 2) reduced by rearing in constant darkness. Slight differences in daylength during the larval stage were not reflected in pupal size. Morphologically normal pupae were formed after development through four, five, six, and seven larval instars. Moths of four, five, and six-instar larvae were capable of normal reproductive behaviour; seven-instar larvae were not tested in this respect. Sixinstar females produced more ripe eggs than five-instar females. The number of eggs laid did not differ significantly between the two groups, owing to a greater retention of eggs in the former group. No differences in viability of eggs and newly hatched larvae were found between these two categories. Part II of the present paper reports an experimental analysis of the negative correlation of population density with growth and fecundity in Bupalus piniarius, and an attempt to evaluate its function. The majority of the experiments, like those of Part I were performed at the former Institute for Biological Field Research. Some were conducted in the field. Both laboratory and field experiments confirmed the causality of the negative correlation between larval density and growth. In both laboratory and field, the maximum effect was attained at quite low densities, and when food was abundant. Aggregation under experimental conditions, if not excessively high, did not affect either mortality of larvae and pupae or longevity of the adults. In the first larval instar (L 1), aggregation did not influence growth. In all other stages except the last, it retarded and reduced growth, and reduced the efficiency of conversion of food absorbed through the intestine. In the last larval stage, the rate of growth and efficiency of food conversion were about the same in aggregated and in isolated larvae, but weight of the former remained lower because aggregation reduced the duration of this stage. In some identical experiments, the average reduction in pupal weight due to crowding varied from 12 to 24 % in females and from 9 to 17 % in males. The females showed significant individual differences in the effect of aggregation on growth, probably reflecting genetic differences in susceptibility to the density effect. Aggregated larvae tended to develop through one fewer instar than isolated specimens. This is probably an indirect effect of retarded development caused by crowding. The behaviour of the larvae is described in some detail. They rested for by far the greater part of the day. Activity was restricted mainly to the night, especially during twilight, except in L 1, when there was considerable diurnal activity. Crowded L 1 larvae seemed somewhat more mobile than isolated specimens, but behavioural differences between the two categories could not be detected in the other larval stages. A preliminary analysis of the chemical composition of pupae showed no obvious differences between density categories in content of dry matter, carbohydrates, fat, and nitrogen. Moth eclosion was slightly retarded after larval crowding. In the adults, all the linear dimensions considered (including wing loading) were reduced by about the same degree by larval crowding. Fecundity of females was reduced by larval crowding, as expected from its positive correlation with pupal weight. Females from aggregated cultures laid somewhat smaller eggs, and produced more eggs per unit body weight, than those reared in isolation. Egg retention was reduced by grouping of the larvae. On average, however, fewer eggs were actually laid by females from aggregated cultures. Tests of offspring viability relative to density conditions in the parental generation yielded contradictory results. All the evidence presently available disproves an earlier conclusion (Klomp & Gruys, 1965) about reduced viability as a result of aggregation. An analysis of field data showed that larval density had a much greater influence on growth than did temperature and daylength, whose effect in the field proved to be insignificant. (Chapter 2) The stimulus that the larvae exert upon each other did not consist of contamination of the food nor did it involve olfactory or visual perception. Only when the larvae had direct bodily contacts with each other during the night was growth reduced. Growth was not reduced if such contacts were restricted to the daytime. Regurgitated fluid gut contents, transferred between one another during contacts, were an essential component in the growth-reducing stimulus. Mere mechanical disturbance (to which the larvae showed the same behavioural reactions as to disturbance by other larvae) had no effect on growth. It is concluded that the essential stimulus induces a physiological change which reduces the rates of feeding and of growth; direct interference with feeding, as a result of mutual disturbance, is not the primary cause of growth reduction. Even when grouping was restricted to a relatively short period (i. e. one of the larval stages, or five days out of a total larval life of 100 days) there was a lasting reduction in size except when aggregation was restricted to L 1. The number of encounters required for growth reduction is rather low, and the area of pine foliage visited by half-grown larvae is sufficient to permit the occurrence of effective mutual interference at the intermediate and high densities found in the field. The induction of the density effect is not completely specific. Of four species of pine- inhabiting larvae examined, one geometrid reduced growth as effectively as Bupalus itself. (Chapter 3) The expression and the underlying mechanism of the density effect in Bupalus are compared with similar phenomena in other insect species, and its function is discussed. High larval density may increase the tendency of female moths to disperse. Density-induced reduction of weight would at least contribute to the realization of this tendency and may even be one of the causes of the increased tendency to disperse. Dispersal from highly populated areas, with a fair chance of reaching areas of low population density, presumably enhances the chance of survival of the offspring. Reduction in fecundity owing to high density seems a small price to pay for more effective reproduction. Some points relevant to this hypothesis are discussed (adult dispersal in relation to larval population density; local variations in population density; survival in relation to population density). It is tentatively concluded that, rather than being a mechanism for self-regulation of population density, the density effect is an adaptation that avoids mortality due to density-related processes by exploiting the heterogeneity of density occurring over extensive areas.
