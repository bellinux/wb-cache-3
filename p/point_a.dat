The Buccaneers {{answered}} {{that with a}} drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown reception by Isaac Hagins. This score, with 5:08 left in the game, put the Buccaneers ahead of the Bears and left them as the only remaining undefeated team in the league. It was the third consecutive loss for the Bears. Jerry Eckwood also contributed a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest running play in Buccaneers history to that <b>point.</b> <b>A</b> broken wrist suffered in this game would contribute to Eckwood's diminished performance later in the season.|$|E
5|$|A further {{source of}} {{difference}} between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the Anglican communion at her English coronation.

5|$|Another tragedy {{occurred}} {{on the morning of}} 16 May 1968 when Ronan <b>Point,</b> <b>a</b> 23-storey tower block in Newham, suffered a structural collapse due to a natural gas explosion. Four people were killed in the disaster and seventeen were injured, as an entire corner of the building slid away. The collapse caused major changes in UK building regulations and led to the decline of further building of high rise council flats that had characterised 1960s public architecture.|$|E
5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the <b>point,</b> <b>a</b> dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E
5|$|As Danielle tracked westward {{into the}} open Atlantic early on August14, the storm {{encountered}} warmer water southwest of Cape Verde and began to gradually intensify, becoming a moderate tropical storm with 50mph (85km/h) winds that morning. At that <b>point,</b> <b>a</b> bout of rapid intensification began to take place, and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Danielle that evening as an eye began to form. Over a 24‑hour period ending {{in the morning of}} August15, the pressure fell from 1004 to 978mbar and the winds increased to 90mph (145km/h), making it a high-end Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E

5|$|At one <b>point</b> <b>a</b> {{proposal}} {{was on the}} table to protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E
5|$|At this <b>point,</b> <b>a</b> Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E

She {{used the money}} {{to apply to the}} Iowa Writers Workshop and, after being accepted, to move from New York to Iowa City in 1967. There Godwin met her teacher and future mentor Kurt Vonnegut. At Iowa, Godwin worked as an instructor while earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from the same university in 1968 and 1971 respectively. She began teaching Greek Drama, before earning a position teaching literature. By age 30, Godwin had written three novels, but was unable to get any of them published.|$|E
