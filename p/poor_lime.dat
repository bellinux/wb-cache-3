40|$|An {{interesting}} and highly structured medieval complex, Dobrun has been attracting attention of scholars {{for a long}} time. Unlike the ruins of medieval fortifications, the remains of wall-painting in the former monastery church received most of the attention. A series of problems have, however remained open. Some of them have escaped observation, and there are hypotheses {{that ought to be}} reassessed. The Dobrun complex {{is not a matter of}} local or regional significance. It is a surviving testimony to the events and processes that marked the century preceding the final Ottoman occupation of Serbia and Bosnia. After outlining the research work done to date and analyzing the original historical documents and physical remains, this paper brings the author's views of the issue and some reflections aimed at suggesting directions of further research. The Dobrun complex is situated on the fringe of a hospitable landscape in the lower Rzav valley, not far from Višegrad. It is a region of present-day Republika Srpska on the border with Serbia. The medieval fortifications high up on cliffs above either side of the river controlled the entrance to the gorge, a natural border between western Serbia and Podrinje (the Drina river basin). About a kilometer downstream, on a plot of flat land above the right riverbank, surrounded by rocky hillsides and opening onto a gully cut by a mountain stream, sits the monastic complex of Dobrun with the Church of the Annunciation. The discussion of the structural remains of the complex (Fig. 2) proceed from the multipart whole, which consists of fortifications on the rocks above either bank of the Rzav, built in such a way as to take full advantage of the terrain for defence purposes. The steep slopes and inaccessible rocks complete with walls and towers form a fortress considered at the time of building to be virtually unassailable. Fortification elements were laid out on the western edge of the gorge, which was and still is an important communication route leading from the west towards the interior of Serbia – the illustrious "Bosnian route". Blocking the entrance to the gorge, the Dobrun fortifications were of strategic importance for the defense of the eastern territories against attack from the west. The central and undoubtedly the oldest part of the fortified complex are the remains on the cliffs overlooking the right bank of the Rzav – a castle of an elongated plan closely following the natural features of the terrain (Fig. 3). With most of the walls built on the cliffs somewhat easier access was only possible from the southwest. The interior of the castle was divided into three independently defendable wards. In the absence of archaeological investigation, only chance finds are available. The only surviving remains of its intramural structures are those of a sunken stone-built room left of the gate, presumably a cistern. The walls were built of rough-hewn stone bound with relatively <b>poor</b> <b>lime</b> mortar (Figs 4 and 5). Laid down on the very rock, they show a varying thickness of 1. 10 to almost 2 meters. Also fortified, the zone on the eastern slope below the castle was for the most part defended by steep slopes. Apparently of a somewhat later date its walls were built more solidly than the castle (Figs 6 and 7). There are traces of a path, with occasional rock-cut steps, climbing from the gate to the castle. In this ward, functioning primarily as the front line of defense of the castle, traces of houses are observable. The eastern part of the fortification above the left riverbank consisted of protruding towers on the summit of a rocky hill surrounded on three sides by the bending river (Fig 8). Surviving are the ruins of two towers and traces of a third. They stood in alignment and, not being interlinked by a rampart, were conceived as free-standing structures. Between Towers 2 and 3 passed the old road leading from the Rzav bridge towards the east. The outlying settlement grew by the river below the castle. Its central part seems to have occupied a piece of flat land at the hill foot on the right bank, where in the mid-nineteenth century streets and traces of houses were still discernible. According to research by Đ. Mazalić, part of the settlement was on the left bank as well in the area known as Podrogovi and stretching from the former mosque towards the Budimlija creek. Unlike the walls and towers of Dobrun, occasionally quite well preserved, of the nearby monastic complex only the vestiges of the church narthex have survived till this day. The church kept its original appearance until the end of the nineteenth century, when it was thoroughly altered. Eventually, its main part was blown up by German mines in early 1945 (Fig. 9). From earlier documentation and the surviving physical remains it is obvious that the building of the monastery church at Dobrun went through several phases (Fig. 10). The original church, erected in 1343 as an endowment of župan Pribil, as inferable from the now gone ktetor's inscription, was a one-nave edifice with a semicircular apse. It was barrel-vaulted and had no dome, while its walls were of limestone blocks Besides the foundations, considerable and well-preserved areas of the original floor have survived. In the middle of the central bay the ambo rosette still stands (Fig. 11). Especially interesting are the stone slabs next to the south church wall. The one in the west bay apparently covers the ktetor's grave. Two similar slabs in the central bay may also be interpreted as grave markers. In a later phase, presumably not long after the building of Pribil's endowment, the church received a narthex. A peculiarity of its architecture is a shallow arched porch on the west front, an unusual element in Serbian medieval architecture. Subsequently added to the narthex, an open exonarthex was torn down during the late-nineteenth-century rebuilding. A northern annexe, divided into two smaller rooms and connected with the apse by a door, may also be considered an addition. The purpose of the two rooms the position of which corresponds to that of the prothesis, is not clear. Of the wall-paintings only those in the narthex have partially survived (Figs 12 – 14). Despite damage, especially that inflicted in 1945, from the surviving fragments, old photographs and descriptions the original arrangement of scenes can be largely reconstructed, as well as the features of this, as it seems, valuable work of Serbian painting from the first half of the fourteenth century. Especially important is the ktetor's composition discussed on several occasions, showing župan Pribil with his sons Petar and Stefan, and protovestiar Stan. The impressive traces of dormitory cells and other buildings, indicative of a larger monastic community, are observable around the church. The churchyard included a cemetery with numerous gravestones, especially of the stećak type (Fig. 15), of which almost none have survived. Depictions in relief or carved on the rock some hundred meters to the northeast of the church are a curious discovery (Figs 16 – 17). In their immediate vicinity are vestiges of ascetic cave cells, registered also in the wider surroundings of Dobrun Castle. Approaches to the Dobrun complex have mostly been partial, their focus, understandably enough, being on the church with its remains of wall-paintings. Any solution to a series of problems that arise here would, by contrast, require an integrated approach to the complex given that it constituted a whole, initially at least. Regrettably, the research results achieved so far cannot lead to final conclusions, but rather to working hypotheses expected to inspire further research. Of particular significance as the starting-point for such exploration is Dobrun Castle – the walled core of the later fortress with the outlying settlement. In a region that was the westernmost zone of the state of the Nemanjić, župan Pribil with his sons seems to have controlled the lower Rzav valley, his hereditary domain. If that was the case, the castle on a rocky hill at the exit from the gorge that was an east-bound route may be regarded as Pribil s fortified residence. The same function must have been fulfilled by the frontier castle of Višegrad, the remains of which are still awaiting researchers. The role of Stan – titled a protovestiar in the Dobrun portrait – as its possible owner is yet to be examined. Responsibilities of the holder of this title, high-ranking at the court of Stefan Dušan, included that of customs supervisor. Officials holding this title had been known in the Serbian administration even before that date. It is perhaps with this duty that Stan's presence on the western state border, in an area crossed by an important trade route, may be related. It would help clarify his relationship with Pribil, a local hereditary lord, who seems to have been his son-in-law. If we accept that Dobrun Castle was the fortified residence of a provincial lord, it remains to examine the circumstances leading to the building of Pribil's endowment, i. e. to the foundation of the monastery. The interrelationship in the Serbian lands of the castles of local lords and the churches they founded is one of the issues that are yet to be studied. This practice, traced back to the fourteenth century, is characteristic of the period preceding the Ottoman conquest. Yet another interesting phenomenon is involved here – the development of anchoretic monasticism at the side of fortified sites, whether fortresses or castles of sovereigns and lords. Some well-known examples occur in the territory of Bulgaria, while in our parts the phenomenon is evidenced by a cave laura below the walls of the Fortress of Ras, the Monastery of the Archangel Michael, as well as by some other sites that are yet to be explored. The function of ascetic cells clinging to fortresses and castles, like that of warrior-saints portrayed on the walls of the Morava churches, was spiritual militancy and they were considered as part of the general system of defence from the enemy of a different faith. The case of Dobrun raises a query that is yet to be resolved – whether the hermitages surrounding the castle preceded the building of the monastery or developed according to the brotherhood's needs. The distribution of these hermitages as well as the traditional pattern of evolution of anchoretic monasticism from lauras to cenobitic communities tends to favor the first explanation, but it is quite certain that they were in use even later. What can be deduced from the frescoes at Dobrun indicates that the central role in the entire process of building Pribil's endowment was played by a respected and learned monk, undoubtedly the subsequent hegumen Jefrosin. Whether he lived his ascetic life in one of the nearby cells and thus won great respect remains open to conjecture. What seems incontestable is his influence of a spiritual guide on the župan's family. It does not seem erroneous to presume that he was the architect of Pribil's undertaking. Obviously, the relatively modest monastery church, also intended as the ktetor's sepulchral church, was built first. A cenobitic community was probably soon founded next to it, with Jerfrosin as its head, the first hegumen. Pribil's endeavor was continued by his younger son Petar, undoubtedly during his father's lifetime. The church does not seem to have received its wall-paintings before the addition of the narthex, as evidenced by the scene on the narthex wall that shows Pribil holding the model of the original church. The fresco programme was apparently devised by Jefrosin, who is likely to have passed away before the works were completed. The place of his posthumous portrait (Fig. 13), next to his patron saint, was even more distinguished than the ktetor's. We are inclined to believe that it also marks his grave. At any rate, Jefrosin was paid especial respect. With the painters still at work, Petar, the ktetor of the narthex became a monk, as shown by the now destroyed inscription above the portal. Jefrosin's personality, ideas and messages are clearly reflected in the surviving wall-paintings. On the one hand, prominence is given to ascetics, to the most consistent followers of earliest Christian anchoretic practice. Among them, and that is remarkably important, is figured for the first time in our wall-painting a Serbian protagonist of this orientation – St Peter of Koriša. On the other hand, the ecumenical councils are also given a prominent place and, enclosed in medallions next to them, as many as seven bishops that took part in them, as well as the established advocates of the true faith: Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem, an adversary of Monothelitism, and Peter, bishop of Damascus, a fighter against Manichean heresy. Someone in the milieu of Dobrun, on the delicate western frontier with Bosnian heretics – the learned hegumen in our opinion – obviously found such a painted programme important for the defence of Orthodoxy. The means of conveying the message was well-known – an emphasis on unswerving faith and ascetic deeds. This goal, firmly rooted in earlier periods, was certainly accomplished at Dobrun. There are no reliable data about the destiny of Dobrun in the second half of the fourteenth century. Along with the surrounding areas it belonged to Nikola Altomanović for a while. After this noble s fall in the autumn of 1373 and the unfortunate partitioning of Serbian lands, the consequences of which can still be felt, Dobrun s position is unclear. Together with Polimlje (the Lim Valley), it might have passed into the hands of the Bosnian ban. To judge by its geo-strategic position, however, it would be reasonable to assume that the Serbian sovereign kept it. This falls among the issues that require separate discussion. Of relevance to our subject is a usually neglected piece of information from the Pomenik (Memorial Book) of Kruševo that despot Stefan with his mother was the ktetor of the monastery. This contemporary information would lead to the conclusion that the early fifteenth century still saw the monastery within the Serbian state borders Whether it remained so till the end of despot Stefan s rule is yet to be established. In 1433 Dobrun already was the domain of vojvoda Radoslav Pavlović. Perhaps it was briefly held by despot Đurađ, contemporaneously with nearby Višegrad (1448), but at the time of the Ottoman conquest it was a fortress on the lands of the Pavlović. Leaving aside the as yet undecided issue of borders, we should touch upon the subsequent structural development of Dobrun. To begin with, there is the query about what despot Stefan's contribution to the growth of the monastic complex was. The Serbian sovereign must have made donations to the monastery, but for the time being only guesswork is possible as to whether he had any structures built. The open exonarthex, which earlier researchers dated by the surviving fragments of wall-paintings in the porch to the end of the sixteenth century, should not be ruled out in this regard. Renovations of and donations to the monastery would have been consistent with despot Stefan's efforts to bolster up Orthodoxy in the border zone of his state. It was under his rule that in the regions bordering on heretical Bosnia, where an increasing influence of the Roman Church had support of its Catholic rulers, the old Serbian dioceses were restored and some new established, especially important being the Metropolitan of Srebrenica. The growth of Dobrun from a castle into a fortress may have taken place in the turbulent last decades of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. Considerably enlarged by the addition of ramparts the defended zone could now accommodate a much larger garrison. The same period saw the growth, under protection of the fortress, of a commercial urban settlement, an important station on the road connecting Bosnia and Serbia. The fortress of Dobrun reached the peak of its prosperity in the fifteenth century. As one of the main strongholds in the domain of the Pavlović, the fortress received further additions. From that period, in our opinion, date the defences above the left bank of the Rzav, i. e. the protruding circular towers similar to developments in military architecture in the Kingdom of Bosnia. Dobrun retained its importance under Turkish rule as a checkpoint on the so-called "Bosnian road". The question as to how long a Turkish garrison stood guard over the walls of Dobrun cannot be reliably answered; perhaps until the momentous events in the last decade of the seventeenth century, when the settlement by the Rzav and the nearby monastery had to be abandoned...|$|E

We agree with MESSIKOMMER (1929) in doubting whether these two taxa indeed represent one species.

In the Netherlands and adjacent parts of Germany (Westfalen) B. erectus appears to be a neophytic species. On the one hand, it requires a somewhat open type of habitat; on the other hand, it tends to spread in grassland neglected by agriculture. The grassland at the locality can be considered neglected and also to some extent ‘open’, because of the steepness of the dike slope. In addition, some remarks are made on the flora along the Almelo-Nordhorn canal, which resembles that of the Fluviatile district to some extent The greater part of this flora the canal has in common with the small river Dinkel which crosses the canal, but some of the plants in question are unknown along the Dinkel. Probably their occurrence on the border of the Almelo-Nordhorn canal is related to that in Westfalen; this applies at least for B. erectus and Euphorbia cyparissias, which have been spreading in Westfalen for more than a century...|$|R

In 1974 both were refound, however. Formerly, V. praecox occurred on arable land in the Yssel valley in the surroundings of Deventer and at some localities south of Maastricht. The latter connect with localities in Belgium; the former constitute a kind of ‘outpost area’ northwest of the border of the species’ serried area. Possibly V. praecox, together with a few other species, can be looked upon as a ‘xerothermic relic’ there. Its habitat on the only recent locality near Gorssel (south of Deventer), where in the vicinity of V. praecox amongst others Vicia lathyroides, Saxifraga tridactylites and Holosteum umbellatum occur, is in accordance with that in Central Europe. V. verna, one of the scarce irano-turanic elements in the West and Central European flora and very rare in most of western Europe, was recorded from some scattered outposts in the Dutch coastal area; recently it is only known from Aerdenhout near Haarlem.

40|$|At {{the moment}} the {{occurrence}} of Juncus mutabilis and J. capitatus is mainly determined by activities of man (excavations) and by extreme fluctuations in climatic factors (the occurrence of very low water levels in summer). In the summer of 1972 and 1973 the water levels {{on the island of}} Terschelling were very low. As a consequence some small dune lakes were left dry and J. mutabilis was growing abundantly in two of them, where previously it was absent or of sporadic occurrence. In 1972 and 1973 J. mutabilis was also recorded from two other places, where it occurs in small numbers each year. In the nature reserve Koegelwieck on Terschelling excavation, followed by a lowering of the water level, the land remaining dry, resulted in a new ephemeral habitat of Juncus mutabilis and J. capitatus. In the Netherlands this is the last known locality of J. capitatus; in the former century this species was growing in two other dune slacks on Terschelling. In the dune area on the mainland near Schoorl, province of North-Holland (dunes <b>poor</b> in <b>lime,</b> as is the case at Terschelling), J. mutabilis was growing in a recent excavation. The species has only been found during years in which extremely low water levels occurred. In years with a normal or high water level not a single plant was growing there...|$|R
40|$|Hypericum canadense L. is an amphi-atlantic species, {{known in}} Europe from two localities only: Lough Mask in Ireland and northeastern Twente in the Netherlands. The habitat {{of the species}} on the western shore of Lough Mask is {{described}} {{with the help of}} four sample plots, and this site is compared with the habitat at Farnham, Quebec, Canada. The Irish habitat is a complicated and rare ecosystem. On the basis of a water-logged sandy soil which is superficially inundated during {{a major part of the}} year and moreover <b>poor</b> in <b>lime,</b> mesotrophic and extensively grazed, it presents four gradients: (1) a ‘macro-gradient’ from the calcareous soils east of Lough Mask to the silurian slates at its western shore; (2) a ‘meso-gradient’ starting from alternating low sandy ridges, from which sand is blown over marshy depressions; (3) a ‘minigradient’ from depressions poor in humus or running dry for a short time to depressions rich in humus or running dry for a longer time; (4) a ‘micro-gradient’, being a grazing pattern of tussocks and hollows. The conclusion is drawn that Hypericum canadense appears to be a long-established native species and not a neophyte. In this respect the author agrees with WEBB (1957, 1958) and JONKER (1935, 1959). However, no argument is found in favour of the supposition that a relic species is concerned. The specialized gradient ecosystem which Hypericum canadense appears to require in Europe may in itself be a sufficient explanation for its rareness and discontinuous distribution...|$|R

Up to 1959 only 2 localities on the Dutch coast were known. In 1961 the species was discovered in large quantities on the brackish estuary shore of the island of Goeree, by far the richest occurrence in the country. The habitat in the three Dutch localities is similar: low, sandy, dry, irregularly submersed dunes in the ecotone between xerosere and halosere, with fluctuating, but mostly low, salt content and rather high lime content; i. e. in the dry desalinated “Koelerion”-variant of the Saginetum maritimae. Scirpus planifolius Grimm, another ecotone species, is rather common in Britain, but much rarer on the continent, {{although it is not}} an atlantic or subatlantic plant. Here it is probably diminishing by reclamation of the suitable habitats. It is a characteristic species of the “disturbance ecotone”, the transition zone between some contrasting habitats: salt-fresh, dry-wet, rich in nutrients-poor in nutrients. In the island of Goeree it was observed in large quantities in moist dune valleys, as well in the salt-fresh transition zone as in the wet-dry one. Its ecology as a species of the alliance Agropyro-Rumicion crispi is discussed. Finally a new locality of the mediterranean-atlantic Trifolium micranthum Viv. is described.

40|$|The ‘Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen’ is a {{dune area}} near Haarlem in the {{calcareous}} Dune district. Since 1851 {{it is the}} water catchment area of Amsterdam. Due to the lowering of the groundwater level the moist dune slacks have disappeared gradually. Since 1957 infiltration {{of water from the}} river Rhine takes place for the water supply of Amsterdam. This water, rich in nutrients, causes among others a ruderal vegetation of high forbs and poor in species instead of the former species-rich dune slack vegetation. Since about 1970 locally a divergent vegetation is developing. In the so-called Groot Zwarteveld not only dune slack species have established, but also a number of species characteristic for dunes <b>poor</b> in <b>lime</b> and nutrients: Empetrum nigrum, Erica tetralix, Dryopteris cristata, Osmunda regalis and some Sphagnum species.

The {{properties}} of magnesian lime mortars are not yet clearly established: some authors claim that Mg-lime has no hydraulicity and produces poor quality mortars that fracture, while others state that it produces quality hydraulic mortars. Here, Mg-lime was produced by burning magnesium limestone in a traditional limekiln. Mortars were made with increasing proportions of Mg-lime and calcium lime (CL 90), and tested according to both European and ASTM Standards, and RILEM recommendations. Shrinkage, compressive and flexural strengths, absorption, capillary suction, density and porosity were evaluated, and the relationships between workability (measured as initial flow), water demand and strength investigated. The process of lime production evidenced that fabrication parameters are instrumental {{on the quality of}} Mg-lime and the subsequent mortar?s performance. Temperatures over 900 ?C induced over-burning resulting in clinker formation and a lack of reactivity. The choice of kiln fuel and burning arrangement proved essential in order to reach a homogeneous calcination; and sieving of unslaked and over/underburnt particles as well as trials to determine raw feed proportions, were needed in order to avoid <b>poor</b> quality <b>lime.</b> Testing evidenced that the higher the Mg content, the greatest the mortar?s shrinkage. However, shrinkage did not reach unacceptable values and cracking didn?t occur. It was also evidenced that the Mg-lime possessed a lower water demand than the CL; and that Mg mortars behave well towards fluids (their capillary suction was lower and their porosity and absorption similar to those of CL 90 mortars). The results also suggest that Mg-lime mortars possess compressive and flexural strengths equivalent to those of some feebly-hydraulic lime mortars: Mg-lime strength falls within the EN 459 - 1 strength requirements for natural feebly-hydraulic lime. This research concludes that, providing production is correct, Mg-limes produce reliable masonry mortars which will shrink further but will possess a lower water demand and a slightly higher mechanical strength than CL mortars...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} is {{examined}} the anatomical structure of the species Drypis spinosa L., {{one of the most}} important representatives of the vegetation of the rolling-stones in Croatia. The genus Drypis (fam. Caryophyllaceae subfam. Silenoideae) is represented by two subspecies, according to the earlier investigations (particularly those of Wettstein and M u r b e c k) : Drypis spinosa subsp. Linneana and Drypis spinosa subsp. Jac- quiniana. The first subspecies covers the rolling-stones of the mountains stretching from Carniola to Greece, and in the central part of the Apennines, where it builds a special, phytoce- nological, excellently characterized community Drypetum Lin- neanae Horv. The second subspecies is represented in the Kvar- ner-Istrian area, where it is found on the rolling-stones near the sea, in a very well examined community —- Drypetum Jacquinianae H-ic. As the two subspecies are morphologically different, and also from the point of view of botanical geography and phyto- cenology, so it is the aim of this investigation to find out if there are differences in the anatomical structure. As in the existing literature about the anatomical structure of the genus Drypis there are almost no details, it has also been interesting to examine the anatomical structure of this genus comparing it with other representatives of the family Caryophyllaceae. It seemed to us important to examine the anatomical structure of both subspecies, so that the possible anatomical differences could have a considerable influence in deciding the systematic relations of both relationships. The anatomical examinations of the vegetative organs of the species Drypis spinosa L. show the following: The root is unusually well developed, better on lime basis then on ground <b>poor</b> with <b>lime.</b> In the primary stage, the root is covered with epiblema and underneath of it is found the primary bark, which ends with endodermis. The central cylinder is found underneath the endodermis which is difficultly distinguishable from the primary bark. It begins with pericam- bium in which peridermis is very early developed and in the middle is found the diarch vessel. The secondary stage begins with the forming of the cork peridermis (after this the external parts of the root fall off), and with the appearing of the secondary xylem. The xylem, the conducting elements of which are very wide and unusually short netlike tracheae, fuse quickly in a close circle. It is important, however, that tracheae are regularly arranged in the secondary stage, so that there cannot be distinguished the primary xylem from the secondary one. In the anatomical structure of the root, both the subspecies do not show any differences. The stem as the over-ground organ is more exposed to the ecological factors, and shows in the anatomical structure considerable differences between both subspecies. In the primary stage the stem is covered with an epidermis consisting of one layer. The membranes of its cells are tender and of the same thickness. Underneath the epidermis is the primary bark; it contains in the outer part a lot of chlorophyll, which is spread continuously underneath the whole epidermis. The endodermis is the last layer of the primary bark, and it is difficult to distinguish it from the primary bark. The central cylinder begins with the pericycle, where is very early formed the cork peridermis. Six collaterally opened vessels, arranged in a circle are usually found in the inside of the peridermis. It is important for the tracheae that a lot of them are very little lignified. In the middle is the pith, built of parenchym cells. In the secondary stage there are considerable differences between the part near the ground and the flower-part. The part of the stem near the ground is covered with a very strong epidermis. Underneath it is the primary bark which contains chlorophyll only on corners of the stem. It is very difficult to distinguish the endodermis, which is found round the central cylinder from the other cells of the primary bark (the same as at the flower-part of the stem). The peridermis, which the central cylinder begins with, is developed in the pericycle. It is built of some layers of plate-like cork cells; when the outer parts of the stem fall off, its transverse section is very similar to that one of the root, but it can still be easily distinguished because it contains the pith. In the center is found the vascular system. It consists of collaterally open bundles arranged in a closed circle. In the middle of the stem is the pith which is built of paren- chym cells. The flower-part of the stem is also covered with epidermis, which is built more delicately than the part near the ground, but still the outer part of the walls is considerably thickened. Underneath the epidermis are found some cell-layers with very thickened membranes which have a mechanical function. They are usually placed in the corners of the stem. The primary bark contains chlorophyll in the peripheric parts, and it ends inwards with endodermis. The central cylinder consists from outside of a ring of sclerenchymatous cells inside of which are some collaterally open bundles, and at last the pith. It was mentioned before that in the flower-part of the stem the cork had been changed into sclerenchymatous cells. This ring consists of more layers (usually 1 — 4) of lignified cells. According to the details which Petersen (1888) states, the genus Drypis has not such a mechanical ring, which is found in all representatives of the subfamily Silenoideae. However, it can be seen from the results of this research, that also the genus Drypis has such a ring — and according to this, it does not represent any exception in the mentioned subfamily. In the anatomical structure of the stem both subspecies show the following differences: subsp. Linneana subsp. Jacquiniana more round the form of the more forecomered stem the thickness of stem thinner the stem stem thicker the epidermis the cuticle the stomata walls thinner thinner ordinarily cca 103 walls thicker thicker ordinarily cca 83 the hairs to 1 mm 2 simple to 1 mm 2 simple and glandular mechanical elements scleren- more layers chyma ring less layers The leaf as organ is most exposed to different ecological influences, and it shows most differences in anatomical structure between both subspecies. The leaf is built dorsiven- tral. From the outside it is covered with epidermis, which has in its corners two or three layers. The membranes of the epidermal cells are of different thickness. On the upper side of the leaf they are in the middle part thin, and on the lower side they are thicker in the middle part and in the corners, whilst between them there are cells with thin membranes. On the thin parts of the epidermis are the stomata, the structure of which corresponds to the structure of the stomata of the other representatives of the family Caryophyllaceae. They border usually with two cells. In mezophyll we can easily distinguish on the upper side the palisade-layer, and on the lower part the parenchyma of the transpiration. Through the mezophyll pass three vessels, which are surrounded by parenchyma cells. The main vessel, which is always mostly developed, goes through the middle of the leaf, and the other sidevessels are often less developed. The vessel is collaterally open, from the lower side there is always the characteristic mechanical tissue, with ligni- fied membranes. With this we usually find druse-crystals of calcium oxalate, which are by their shape different from the other crystals in the mezophyll. The differences in the anatomical structure of the leaf in both subspecies of Drypis spinosa are the following: the shape of the leaf the epidermis cuticle stomata hairs vessels subsp. Linneana thinner and narrower the membranes thinner, in the corners has one or two layers with a small number of pits, the part with stomata has thin membranes with-pits thinner cca 100 - 130 to 1 mm 2 regularly of 4 - 6 cells smaller and thinner mechanical tissue subsp. Jacquiniana thicker and wider the membranes are thicker, the epidermis in the corners has regularly three layers and more pits; the part of the epidermis with stomata has thicker walls and is interrupted by pits thicker cca 65 - 85 to 1 mm 2 regularly od 1 - 2 cells bigger and thicker mechanical tissue According to this, there exist differences i the anatomical structure of both subspecies. Almost all these differences developed under the influence of ecological factors. As these differences are considerable, and also constant, I think therefore that, as proposed by Degen (1936), both relationships till now considered as subspecies, could be considered as separate species...|$|R
