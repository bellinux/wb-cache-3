Stratigraphic calibration of the phylogenetic trees indicates {{that most of the}} pre-Silurian record can be inferred only through ghost ranges. Assessment ofthe available data suggests that this is due to a shift in ecological niches after the latest Ordovician extinction event and a broadening of geographical range following the amalgamation f Euramerica during the early Silurian. Two major patterns are apparent in the bio-geographic data. Firstly, the majority of jawless fishes with dermoskeletal, p ated 'armour' were highly endemic during Cambrian-Ordovician time, with arandaspids restricted to Gondwana, galeaspids to China, and anatolepids, astraspids and, possibly, heterostracans confined to Laurentia. These Laurentian groups began to disperse to other continental blocks as the 'Old Red Sandstone continent ' amalgamated through a series of tectonic collisions. The second maj or pattern, in contrast, encompasses a number of microsquamous and naked, jawed and jawless primitive vertebrates such as conodonts, thelodonts, <b>placo...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of antibacterial drugs to overcome various pathogenic species, which inhabit the oral cavity, faces several challenges, such as salivary flow and enzymatic activity that restrict dosage retention. Owing to their amphipathic nature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) {{serve as the}} first line of defense of the innate immune system. The ability to synthesize different types of AMPs enables exploitation of their advantages as alternatives to antibiotics. Sustained release of AMPs incorporated in biodegradable polymers can be advantageous in maintaining high levels of the peptides. In this study, four potent ultra-short lipopeptides, conjugated to an aliphatic acid chain (16 C) were incorporated in two different biodegradable polymers: poly (lactic acid co castor oil) (<b>PLACO)</b> and ricinoleic acid-based poly (ester-anhydride) (P(SA-RA)) for sustained release. The lipopeptide and polymer formulations were tested for antibacterial activity during one week, by turbidometric measurements of bacterial outgrowth, anti-biofilm activity by live/dead staining, biocompatibility by hemolysis and XTT colorimetric assays, mode of action by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and release profile by a fluorometric assay. The results show that an antibacterial and anti-biofilm effect, as well as membrane disruption, can be achieved by the use of a formulation of lipopeptide incorporated in biodegradable polymer...|$|E
40|$|The TG 162 -HO {{cassette}} {{was constructed}} from the TG 81 -HO cassette (Hirano and Sugimoto, 2007). An MfeI site was {{introduced into the}} TG 81 sequence by PCR amplification. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with MfeI and NotI, and cloned into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pTG-HO (Hirano and Sugimoto, 2007), creating pTG 162 -HO. The TetO 2, TetO 4, or TetO 8 construct was obtained as follows. First, two oligonucleotides were annealed to generate a TetO 2 array containing two copies of the 19 bp tetO promoter sequence (Dingermann et al., 1992). TetO 2 was first cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pSD 155 (Diede and Gottschling, 1999, 2001), generating ptetO 2. To duplicate the TetO 2 sequence, the MfeI-NotI fragment of ptetO 2 was cloned into EcoRI/NotI-treated ptetO 2, generating ptetO 4. Likewise, ptetO 8 was obtained using ptetO 4. These plasmids were treated with EcoRI and SalI. The resulting EcoRI-SalI fragments containing the TetO 2, TetO 4 or TetO 8 sequence were cloned into MfeI/SalI-treated pHO plasmid (Hirano and Sugimoto, 2007), generating ptetO 2 -HO, ptetO 4 -HO or ptetO 8 -HO, respectively. Oligonucleotides containing four copies of lacO sequence (Lewis, 2005), were used to generate the <b>placO</b> 4 plasmid containing the LacO...|$|E
6000|$|So {{spoke the}} stewardess: but Hector rushed From the house, {{the same way}} back, down stately streets, Through the broad city, to the Scaian gates, Whereby he must go forth toward the plain, There running toward him came Andromache, His ample-dowered wife, Eetion's child-- Eetion the great-hearted, he who dwelt In Thebe under <b>Placos,</b> and the woods Of <b>Placos,</b> ruling over Kilic men. His {{daughter}} wedded Hector brazen-helmed, And met him then; and with her came a maid, Who bore in arms a playful-hearted babe An infant still, akin to some fair star, Only and well-loved child of Hector's house, Whom he had named Scamandrios, but the rest Astyanax, because his sire alone Upheld the weal of Ilion the holy. He smiled in silence, looking on his child But she stood close to him, with many tears; And hung upon his hand, and spoke, and called him. 'My hero, thy great heart will wear thee out; Thou pitiest not thine infant child, nor me The hapless, soon to be thy widow; The Greeks will slay thee, falling one and all Upon thee: but to me were sweeter far, Having lost thee, to die; no cheer to me Will come thenceforth, if thou shouldst meet thy fate; Woes only: mother have I none, nor sire. For that my sire divine Achilles slew, And wasted utterly the pleasant homes Of Kilic folk in Thebe lofty-walled, And slew Eetion with the sword! yet spared To strip the dead: awe kept his soul from that. Therefore he burnt him in his graven arms, And heaped a mound above him; and around The damsels of the Aegis-holding Zeus, The nymphs who haunt the upland, planted elms. And seven brothers bred {{with me in the}} halls, All in one day went down to Hades there; For all of them swift-foot Achilles slew Beside the lazy kine and snow-white sheep. And her, my mother, who of late was queen Beneath the woods of Places, he brought here Among his other spoils; yet set her free Again, receiving ransom rich and great. But Artemis, whose bow is all her joy, Smote her to death within her father's halls. Hector! so thou art father to me now, Mother, and brother, and husband fair and strong! Oh, come now, pity me, and stay thou here Upon the tower, nor make thy child an orphan And me thy wife a widow; range the men Here by the fig-tree, where the city lies Lowest, and where the wall can well be scaled; For here three times the best have tried the assault Round either Ajax, and Idomeneus, And round the Atridai both, and Tydeus' son, Whether some cunning seer taught them craft, Or their own spirit stirred and drove them on.' Then spake tall Hector, with the glancing helm All this I too have watched, my wife; yet much I hold in dread the scorn of Trojan men And Trojan women with their trailing shawls, If, like a coward, I should skulk from war. Beside, I have no lust to stay; I have learnt Aye to be bold, and lead the van of fight, To win my father, and myself, a name. For well I know, at heart and in my thought, The day will come when Ilios the holy Shall lie in heaps, and Priam, and the folk Of ashen-speared Priam, perish all. But yet no woe to come to Trojan men, Nor even to Hecabe, nor Priam king, Nor to my brothers, who shall roll in dust, Many and fair, beneath the strokes of foes, So moves me, as doth thine, when thou shalt go Weeping, led off by some brass-harnessed Greek, Robbed of the daylight of thy liberty, To weave in Argos at another's loom, Or bear the water of Messeis home, Or Hypereia, with unseemly toils, While heavy doom constrains thee, and perchance The folk may say, who see thy tears run down, [...] "This was the wife of Hector, best in fight At Ilium, of horse-taming Trojan men." [...] So will they say perchance; while unto thee Now grief will come, for such a husband's loss, Who might have warded off the day of thrall. But may the soil be heaped above my corpse Before I hear thy shriek and see thy shame!' He spoke, and stretched his arms to take the child, But back the child upon his nurse's breast Shrank crying, frightened at his father's looks. Fearing the brass and crest of horse's hair Which waved above the helmet terribly. Then out that father dear and mother laughed, And glorious Hector took the helmet off, And laid it gleaming on the ground, and kissed His darling child, and danced him in his arm; And spoke in prayer to Zeus, and all the gods 'Zeu, and ye other gods, oh grant that this My child, like me, may grow the champion here As good in strength, and rule with might in Troy That men may say, [...] "The boy is better far Than was his sire," [...] when he returns from war, Bearing a gory harness, having slain A foeman, and his mothers heart rejoice. Thus saying, on the hands of his dear wife He laid the child; and she received him back In fragrant bosom, smiling through her tears.|$|R

I want to identify the causes of undesired behavior of workers {{in the workplace and}} examine the consequences of this unwanted behaviors for the company. The thesis is divided into four main sections. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, will be presented general information and characteristics of the workplace. I will also examine the area of motivation in the workplace and the satisfaction of workers at the workplace. In the second part we will state and describe the key causes of undesirable behavior of workers at the workplace. Causes, which people usually deal with are following: inadequate working conditions, misunderstanding with colleagues and superiors, dissatisfaction with salary and other allowances, monotony of work, mobbing in the workplace and the inability of progression and ownership. The third part of the thesis is focused on the consequences of an unwanted behavior of workers in the company. Key implications are: termination of employment, the greater desire for early retirement, loss of productivity, etc. In the last part of the thesis follows the research work, in which I will present analysis of the survey that was conducted. Analysis of the survey will include the graphic illustration, as well as an explanation of the results obtained...|$|E
40|$|Zavedanje o pomembnosti zadovoljstva zaposlenih z delom se pri delodajalcu po navadi pojavi šele takrat, ko pride do menjave kadra oz. prostovoljnega odhoda kadra iz podjetja. Z vidika zaposlenega je prav zadovoljstvo z delom tisti glavni razlog, ki ga ne samo zadrži pri podjetju, ampak tudi motivira k ustvarjalnosti, novim idejam, spodbuja njegovo pripadnost in lojalnost ter ga nasploh naredi dragocenega (delavca). Z vidika delodajalca je to največ, kar si ta lahko želi za svoje podjetje in k čemur mora stremeti, če si želi dolgoročnega uspeha. Ker je torej zadovoljstvo z delom obojestransko zaželeno, bi moralo biti njegovo zagotavljanje ustaljena praksa podjetij. Na podlagi podatkov, pridobljenih z rednim merjenjem zadovoljstva zaposlenih se tako izvaja upravljanje zadovoljstva, katerega rezultat bodo zadovoljni zaposleni in s tem boljši poslovni rezultati ter konkurenčnost podjetja. Magistrska naloga se v prvem – teoretičnem delu poleg opisa osnovnih pojmov dotakne še teorij, povezanih z zadovoljstvom z delom, razsežnosti zadovoljstva ter njegovega vpliva. Nadalje se v nalogi pojasnita merjenje in upravljanje zadovoljstva ter izpostavi pomembnost organizacijske kulture in klime ter motivacije. V empiričnem delu naloge je opisana primarna statistična analiza, anketa izpeljana s pomočjo spletnega orodja 1 ka. Ugotavlja se zadovoljstvo zaposlenih v odvetniški pisarni, in sicer na delovnem mestu »tajnica«. Poleg splošnega zadovoljstva se meri še zadovoljstvo s <b>plačo,</b> delovnim časom, delovnimi pogoji in zadovoljstvo z nadrejenimi/sodelavci, pa tudi ocena varnosti zaposlitve, ocena lastnega dela ter ocena uspešnosti pisarne. Zadnji del magistrske naloge vsebuje povzetek rezultatov raziskave skupaj s pomanjkljivostmi, njihovo interpretacijo ter odgovore na postavljena raziskovalna vprašanja. Poleg dejstva, da so tajnice v odvetniških pisarnah na splošno zadovoljne s svojo zaposlitvijo, je pomemben še izsledek raziskave, da na to njihovo (splošno) zadovoljstvo najbolj vplivata zadovoljstvo z nadrejenimi ter zadovoljstvo s sodelavci. Za tajnice v odvetniških pisarnah so torej najbolj bistveni medosebni odnosi na delovnem mestu. Zanimiv je tudi rezultat raziskave, da tajnice, ki so zaposlene za nedoločen čas, svoje zaposlitve ne smatrajo za (bolj) »varno« v primerjavi s tistimi, ki so zaposlene za določen čas ali po pogodbi. Awareness on the {{importance}} of employee satisfaction with the work they do for their employer usually becomes apparent only when either a change in staff or a voluntary resignation of staff takes place. From the perspective of the employee, it is exactly employee satisfaction that plays the main role in not only retaining that same employee within the company but also in motivating the employee to be creative and bring forward new ideas, at the same time encouraging the employee 2 ̆ 7 s sense of belonging to and being loyal to the company, thus making the employee generally valuable for and valued by the company. On the other hand, from the employer 2 ̆ 7 s perspective such an employee represents the maximum of what the employer looks for in an employee for the company and what the employer should aspire to if the objective is long-term success of the company. Employee satisfaction is therefore desired by both sides and ensuring it should be a common practice in any company. By performing a regular follow-up on employee satisfaction with their work, this satisfaction is managed, the outcome of which are truly satisfied employees and with that improved both business results and corporate competitiveness. The first part of the master thesis is theoretical and includes, besides a definition of the basic terminology, the theories connected with employee satisfaction, dimensions of employee satisfaction and the overall impact of the latter. In the continuation, the measuring methods used and the management of satisfaction are explained, and {{the importance}} of organizational culture and climate at workplace, but also motivation, revealed. The empirical part of the thesis represents the primary statistical analysis, based on a survey performed by means of the 1 ka online tool. The analysis observes the satisfaction of employees in a law firm and focuses on the position of »secretary« working in such a firm. The areas measured in the survey do not only cover payment satisfaction, but also work time satisfaction, work conditions satisfaction, satisfaction with superiors and colleagues, including an assessment of employment protection, a self-assessment and an assessment of the company 2 ̆ 7 s overall performance. In the final part of the thesis, a summary of the outcome of the survey is provided together with all of its drawbacks and their respective interpretation, and with all the answers to the formulated research questions. Apart from the fact that secretaries in law firms are generally satisfied with their jobs, another important outcome of the survey shows that their satisfaction with superiors and colleagues has the strongest impact on how satisfied secretaries are in the end with their job. The survey thus reveals that interpersonal relationships at workplace play the most important role in the satisfaction of secretaries in law firms. Another outcome of the survey that calls for attention is that the secretaries who are permanently employed do not consider their employment to be (much) safer than the jobs of those secretaries with a fixed-term or contract employment...|$|E
