25|$|Asplenium platyneuron (syn. Asplenium ebeneum), {{commonly}} known as ebony spleenwort or brownstem spleenwort, is a fern native to North America east of the Rocky Mountains and to South Africa. It takes its common name from its dark, reddish-brown, glossy stipe and rachis (stem and leaf axis), which bear a once-divided, <b>pinnate</b> <b>leaf.</b> The fertile fronds, which die off in the winter, are darker green and stand upright, while the sterile fronds are evergreen and lie flat on the ground. An auricle {{at the base of}} each pinna points towards the tip of the frond. The dimorphic fronds and alternate, rather than opposite, pinnae distinguish it from the similar black-stemmed spleenwort.|$|E

The monopin-nate-compound leaf category is further classified as parimonopinnate, imparimonopinnate, and trifoliolate-monopinnate. The bipinnate-compound leaf category is further classified as paribipinnate, and imparibipinnate. Also, the terms foliole versus pinnae, and foliate versus foliolate are discussed.

60|$|My {{house was}} {{on the side of}} a hill, {{immediately}} on the edge of the larger wood, in the midst of a young forest of pitch pines and hickories, and half a dozen rods from the pond, to which a narrow footpath led down the hill. In my front yard grew the strawberry, blackberry, and life-everlasting, johnswort and goldenrod, shrub oaks and sand cherry, blueberry and groundnut. Near the end of May, the sand cherry (Cerasus pumila) adorned the sides of the path with its delicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its short stems, which last, in the fall, weighed down with good-sized and handsome cherries, fell over in wreaths like rays on every side. I tasted them out of compliment to Nature, though they were scarcely palatable. The sumach (Rhus glabra) grew luxuriantly about the house, pushing up through the embankment which I had made, and growing five or six feet the first season. Its broad <b>pinnate</b> tropical <b>leaf</b> was pleasant though strange to look on. The large buds, suddenly pushing out late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead, developed themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs, an inch in diameter; and sometimes, as I sat at my window, so heedlessly did they grow and tax their weak joints, I heard a fresh and tender bough suddenly fall like a fan to the ground, when there was not a breath of air stirring, broken off by its own weight. In August, the large masses of berries, which, when in flower, had attracted many wild bees, gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson hue, and by their weight again bent down and broke the tender limbs.|$|R
40|$|The Bletterbach flora is {{the most}} {{important}} late Permian (Lopingian) flora of the Southern Alps. The study of a new fossiliferous bed stratigraphically below the cephalopod bed yielded almost 500 plant fossils, 28 of which belong to rare Lopingian plant groups: horsetails, seed ferns and possible cycads. Forty-five other fossils from the collection of Utrecht University were examined. The study of these more than fossils reveals a higher diversity of seed ferns and putative cycadophytes in the Lopingian of Europe than previously documented. Horsetails are represented by dispersed sporophylls, stem fragments and leaf sheaths too badly preserved for attribution to a species. Seed ferns are represented by Sphenopteris and the new genus Germaropteris, which includes G. martinsii (Germar in Kurtze 1839) Kustatscher, Kerp et Van Konijnenburg-van Cittert comb. nov., a species from the German Zechstein formerly assigned to various genera (e. g., Callipteris, Lepidopteris, Peltaspermum). Two species of Sphenopteris (S. suessii, S. sp.) are recorded for the first time from Lopingian strata of the Southern Alps. Remarkable are pinnae with alethopteroid pinnules, because similar forms have not been described from Lopingian deposits of Europe. Putative cycadophytes are represented by two taeniopterid leaves (Taeniopteris sp. A and T. sp. B) and a fragment of a <b>pinnate</b> cycad-like <b>leaf.</b> The Bletterbach flora {{is one of the most}} diverse European Lopingian floras, at least with regard to the non-conifer taxa.

In Europe, plant fossils are generally very rare in Lopingian strata and the presence of plant fossils in the Zechstein Basin and the Southern Alps is apparently related to sea-level changes.

40|$|The {{effects of}} leaf shape, serration, {{roughness}} and flexural rigidity on drag force imposed by flowing water and its time variability were experimentally studied in an open-channel flume at seven leaf Reynolds numbers ranging from 5 to 35 × 103. The study involved artificial {{leaves of the}} same surface area but with three shapes (‘elliptic’, ‘rectangular’ and ‘pinnate’), three flexural rigidities, smooth-edge and sawtooth-like serration, and three combinations of surface roughness (two-side rough, one-side rough/one-side smooth, and two-side smooth). Shape {{was the most important}} factor determining flow-leaf interactions, with flexural rigidity, serration and surface roughness affecting the magnitude but not the direction of the effect on drag control. The smooth-edge elliptic leaf had a better hydrodynamic shape as it experienced less drag force, with the rectangular leaf showing slightly less efficiency. The <b>pinnate</b> <b>leaf</b> experienced higher drag force than the other leaves due to its complex geometry. It is likely that flow separation from 12 leaflets of the <b>pinnate</b> <b>leaf</b> prevented leaf reconfiguration such as leaflets folding and/or streamlining. Flexural rigidity strongly influenced the leaf reconfiguration and augmented the serration effect since very rigid leaves showed a strong effect of serration. Furthermore, serration changed the turbulence pattern around the leaves by increasing the turbulence intensity. Surface roughness was observed to enhance the drag force acting on the leaf at high Reynolds numbers. The results also suggest that there are two distinctly different flow-leaf interaction regimes: (I) regime of passive interaction at low turbulence levels when the drag statistics are completely controlled by the turbulence statistics, and (II) regime of active interaction at high turbulence levels when the effect of leaf properties on the drag statistics becomes comparable to the turbulence contribution. ...|$|E

40|$|Insects {{have evolved}} diverse methods of {{predator}} avoidance, {{many of which}} implicate complex adaptations of their wings (e. g., Phylliidae, Nymphalidae, Notodontidae). Among these, angiosperm leaf mimicry {{is one of the}} most dramatic, although the historical origins of such modifications are unclear owing to a dearth of paleontological records. Here, we report evidence of <b>pinnate</b> <b>leaf</b> mimesis in two lacewings (Neuroptera) : Bellinympha filicifolia Y. Wang, Ren, Liu & Engel gen. et sp. nov. and Bellinympha dancei Y. Wang, Ren, Shih & Engel, sp. nov., from the Middle Jurassic, representing a 165 -million-year-old specialization between insects and contemporaneous gymnosperms of the Cycadales or Bennettitales. Furthermore, such lacewings demonstrate a preangiosperm origin for leaf mimesis, revealing a lost evolutionary scenario of interactions between insects and gymnosperms. The current fossil record suggests that this enigmatic lineage became extinct during the Early Cretaceous, apparently closely correlated with the decline of Cycadales and Bennettitales at that time, and perhaps owing to the changing floral environment resulted from the rise of flowering plants...|$|E
40|$|Network-matrix {{architectures}} {{have drawn}} considerable attention in wide varieties of practical applications. Networks are the highways for perfusing (or extracting) physical flows into (or from) matrices, thus determine {{the performance of}} network-matrix architectures. Constructal law states that “for a finite-size system to persist in time (to live), it must evolve {{in such a way}} that it provides greater and greater access to the currents flowing through it”. Plant leaves are ubiquitous network-matrix architectures selected by nature during the long evolution, which will shed light on efficient network-matrix architectures. The two basic kinds of plant leaves are pinnate and palmate leaves. Palmate leaf vein networks with multiple first-order veins confer greater tolerance of vein damage, especially the first-order vein damage, than <b>pinnate</b> <b>leaf</b> vein networks with a single first-order vein. However, few studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of first-order vein number on the transport efficiency of leaf vein networks. In this study, inspired by palmate leaves, we analytically investigate the effect of first-order channel number on physical flow transport efficiency of the network in the network-matrix architecture. The results show that the palmate leaf-like network is more efficient, which can achieve lower maximum and total potential drops than the pinnate leaf-like network. The results can be applied to designing more efficient network-matrix architectures...|$|E
40|$|Cinnamomum chago (family Lauraceae) is an {{essential}} source of timber and oil. This plant is narrowly distributed {{in the western part}} of the Yunnan Province. In this study, the distribution, habitat, and biological characteristics of C.  chago were examined through field investigation. The genetic diversity and the variation of the remnant populations were also studied using the inter-simple sequence repeat technique. Results showed that C.  chago is mainly distributed in the upstream tributary mountains of Lancang River in Yunlong County of Yunnan Province. The species distribution exhibited a fragmented pattern with five isolated populations and high-frequency anthropogenic interference. A combination of morphological features (opposite leaves, <b>pinnate</b> <b>leaf</b> veins, absence of glandular fossa, large drupe, small punch, and pollen surface with triangular spike grain, with cushion bumps at the base) indicated that C.  chago is a key phylogenetic taxon between the two sections of Asian Cinnamomum plants (Sect. Camphora (Trew) Meissn. and Sect. Cinnamomum). Analysis of the genetic diversity of C.  chago indicated that it has a moderately high level of genetic diversity at the population and species levels (populations level: Ne =  1. 629, H =  0. 348, I =  0. 504, and PPB =  83. 3 %; species level: Ne =  1. 864, H =  0. 460, I =  0. 652, and PPB =  100 %). Analysis of molecular variance revealed that 17 % of the genetic variation was divided between the populations, whereas 83 % was observed within the populations. Based on these results, we suggest the inclusion of C.  chago in the Wild Plants with Extremely Small Populations in China. Moreover, the species should be given special attention and protection. Some strategies were proposed for the conservation of the C.  chago populations...|$|E
40|$|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Noeggerathiales are an extinct {{group of}} heterosporous shrubs and trees that were {{widespread}} and diverse during the Pennsylvanian– Permian Epochs (323 – 252 Ma) but are of controversial taxonomic affi nity. Groups proposed as close relatives include leptosporangiate ferns, sphenopsids, progymnosperms, or the extant eusporangiate fern Tmesipteris. Previously identifi ed noeggerathialeans lacked anatomical preservation, limiting taxonomic comparisons to their external morphology and spore structure. We here document {{from the upper}} Permian of China the fi rst anatomically preserved noeggerathialeans, which enhance the perceived distinctiveness {{of the group and}} better indicate its systematic affi nity. METHODS: We describe in detail the newly discovered, anatomically preserved heterosporous strobilus Dorsalistachya quadrisegmentorum, gen. et sp. nov., and redescribe its suspected foliar correlate, the <b>pinnate</b> <b>leaf</b> Plagiozamites oblongifolius. KEY RESULTS: Plagiozamites possesses an omega (Ω) -shaped vascular trace and prominent cortical secretory cavities—a distinctive anatomical organization that is echoed in the newly discovered strobili. Dorsalistachya strobili bear highly dissected sporophylls alternately in two vertical rows, suggesting that they are homologs of leaf pinnae. If so, the “strobilus” is strictly a pseudostrobilus and consists of sporangium-bearing units that are one hierarchical level below true sporophylls. The “sporophylls” bear four microsporangia on the lower (abaxial) surface, occasionally interspersed with short longitudinal rows of megasporangia. A single functional megaspore develops within each winged megasporangium, suggesting adaptation for dispersal as a single unit. CONCLUSIONS: Dorsalistachya presents a unique combination of reproductive features that amply justifi es establishment of a new family, Dorsalistachyaceae. Noeggerathiales represent a distinct taxonomic Order of free-sporing plants that most resembles early-divergent eusporangiate ferns and the more derived among the extinct progymnosperms. By the early Permian, noeggerathialeans had attained levels of reproductive sophistication similar to the most derived among the Paleozoic sphenophytes and lycophytes, but their heterosporous life history may have contributed to their extinction during the Triassic climatic aridifi cation...|$|E

It is clear that the increased number of the floral organs and the development of the pulp vesicles are undoubtedly very important systematic features of the subfamily, but such are those out of many significant characteristics which take part in the classification of the whole group. A character like the increase or decrease of the number of locules, for instance, can occur even within one genus, as in the well-known case of Citrus and Fortunella. The ovules may be single, or binary, either superposed or collateral, or otherwise numerous in uni-, or biseriate arrangement: the gradation of this character is also continuous, {{as in the case of}} Merope Triphasia, and Wenzelia, all having similar floral characteristics but the last only has biseriate ovules. Unquestionably, the biseriate character is derived from collateral arrangement which is commoner in rather advanced groups. The increase of the number of filaments more than ten, occurs also in tribes not closely related, as Aegle (also Feroniella, and Balsamocitrus Section Afraegle), Oxanthera, and Citrus (also Poncirus and Fortunella), but the true pleiotaxy of stamens occurs only in Aegle and in the Section Citrophorum of the genus Citrus. The pulp-vesicle formation is also seen in various tribes widely divergent from each other, such as Aegleae-Swingleinae (Swinglea), Lavangeae (Pleiospermium), Atalantieae (Atakmtia and Severinia), Microcitreae (Microcitrus, Eremocitrus, Monanthocitrus and Pleurocitrus), Aurantieae-Citropsinae (Citropsis), and Aurantieae-Citrinae (Poncirus, Citrus and Fortunella). It is very clear that the starting point of the subfamily is represented by Micromelum and Glycosmis, both having pinnate leaves with alternate leaflets and unwinged rachis, many-flowered inflorescences, an ovary with less than 5 locules and one or two superposed ovules in each locule. Having dry fruits and contortuplicate cotyledons, Micromelum forms the most primitive tribe Micromeleae, somewhat analogous to the Rutoideae-Cusparieae of tropical America. The genera Glycosmis, Murraya and Clausena, altogether forming the tribe Clauseneae, have fleshy fruit, plano-convex cotyledons and unarmed branches with pinnate leaves, resembling the Micromelum in general appearance of the plant. It is worthy of note that the great reduction of the number of leaflets is seen in such species, as Micromelum diversifolium MIQ., Clausena Guillauminii TANAKA, and Murraya stenocarpa TANAKA (= Chalcas stenocarpa TANAKA), and the alate rachis is found in Clausena Wallichii OLIV., C. Guillauminii TANAKA and Murraya alata DRAKE. The reduction of the number of locules in Murraya is also to be noted. No thorn-bearing plants occur in these tribes, except in the doubtful species, Clausena impunctata HIERN, which has curved paired axillary spines, almost entirely opposite leaflets, and a distinctly winged rachis. The gradation of this tribe into the next tribe Aegleae, having hard-shelled fruits, is seen in the Malayan genus Merrillia, which has large flowers, reminding of Murraya (Subgen. Euchalcas TANAKA), and a winged rachis like M. alata, mentioned above...|$|E
