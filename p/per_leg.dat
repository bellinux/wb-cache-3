Many years ago the League introduced a system of play, whereby each player bowls alternatively against a player of the opposing team for each leg. This proved to be a successful format creating tension and excitement down to the last leg - last man.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to their}} low weight {{and the fact}} that they had only one control wire <b>per</b> <b>leg,</b> the puppets were unable to walk convincingly. Therefore, scenes {{involving}} movement were filmed from the waist up, with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a [...] "bobbing" [...] action to simulate motion. Alternatively, dynamic shots were eliminated altogether: in an interview with New Scientist, director of photography John Read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets [...] "appear, for example, to walk through doors (although the control wires make this impossible) or pick up a coffee cup (although their fingers are not in fact jointed)." [...] Live-action shots of human hands were inserted whenever scripts called for more dexterous actions to be performed.|$|E
500|$|In dinosaurs, {{the most}} {{important}} locomotor muscle was located in the tail. This muscle, called caudofemoralis, attaches to the fourth trochanter, a prominent ridge on the thigh bone, and pulls the thigh bone backwards when contracted. Scott Persons and Phil Currie (2011) note that in the tail vertebrae of Carnotaurus the caudal ribs did not protrude horizontally ("T-shaped"), but were angled against the vertical axis of the vertebrae, forming a [...] "V". This would have provided additional space for a caudofemoralis muscle larger {{than in any other}} theropod—the muscle mass was calculated at [...] <b>per</b> <b>leg.</b> Therefore, Carnotaurus could {{have been one of the}} fastest large theropods. While the caudofemoralis muscle was enlarged, the epaxial muscles situated above the caudal ribs would have been proportionally smaller. These muscles, called the longissimus and spinalis muscle, were responsible for tail movement and stability. To maintain tail stability in spite of reduction of these muscles, the caudal ribs bear forward projecting processes interlocking the vertebrae with each other and with the pelvis, stiffening the tail. As a consequence, the ability to make tight turns would have been diminished, because the hip and tail had to be turned simultaneously, unlike in other theropods.|$|E

2500|$|The JetStar has {{a fairly}} typical {{business}} jet design layout, with a swept wing and a cruciform tail. The wing has a 30° sweepback and features large fuel tanks at about half-span, extending some distance {{in front and}} behind the wing. [...] The wings hold 10,000 pounds of fuel, and each slipper tank holds 4,000 pounds of fuel for a total fuel load of 18,000 pounds. [...] The wing also includes leading edge flaps (not slats) along {{the front of the}} wing outboard of the tanks (these leading edge flaps reduce the stalling speed by an additional three knots), while double-slotted trailing edge flaps span the entire rear surface inboard of the ailerons. [...] The wing incorporates inflatable rubber deicing boots for the removal of accumulated inflight ice. The horizontal stabilizer is mounted nearly halfway up the fin to keep it clear of the engines' jet blast. One feature is that the horizontal stabilizer is trimmable by pivoting the entire tail fin and stabilizer assembly, which has a distinctive unpainted area {{at the base of the}} fin that is noticeable in most pictures. The JetStar does not have any tail deicing capability, nor was it required for certification. [...] A speed brake is located on the underside of the fuselage to aid deceleration for landing. The original prototypes used a tricycle landing gear with one wheel <b>per</b> <b>leg,</b> but after an accident in 1962 the nose gear was modified with two tires.|$|E
