5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of <b>papilledema,</b> which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the <b>papilledema</b> has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding <b>papilledema</b> leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of steroids}} {{in the attempt}} to reduce the ICP is controversial. These may be used in severe <b>papilledema,</b> but {{otherwise}} their use is discouraged.|$|E
5|$|IIH {{does not}} {{normally}} affect life expectancy. The major complications from IIH arise from untreated or treatment-resistant <b>papilledema.</b> In various case series, the long-term risk of ones vision being significantly affected by IIH {{is reported to}} lie anywhere between 10 and 25%.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} {{around the}} brain may rise, causing <b>papilledema</b> (swelling of the optic disc) {{which may be}} experienced as visual obscurations. In severely raised intracranial pressure, the level of consciousness is decreased, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate falls and the patient assumes an abnormal posture.|$|E
5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant <b>papilledema</b> or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
25|$|<b>Papilledema,</b> or the {{swelling}} of the optic disc, can be a reliable sign that ICP is elevated. Unlike other conditions that may result in {{the swelling}} of the optic disc, {{it is in the}} case of <b>papilledema</b> that vision may go largely unaffected.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} and signs that suggest {{a rise in}} ICP including headache, vomiting without nausea, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, back pain and <b>papilledema.</b> If <b>papilledema</b> is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness. The headache is classically a morning headache which may wake them from sleep. The brain is relatively poorly supplied by oxygen {{as a result of}} mild hypoventilation during the sleeping hours, and also cerebral edema may worsen during the night due to the lying position. The headache is worse on coughing / sneezing / bending, and progressively worsens over time. There may also be personality or behavioral changes.|$|E
25|$|Jugular vein {{thrombosis}} {{is a condition}} that may occur due to infection, intravenous drug use or malignancy. Jugular {{vein thrombosis}} can have a varying list of complications, including: systemic sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and <b>papilledema.</b> Though characterized by a sharp pain {{at the site of}} the vein, it can prove difficult to diagnose, because it can occur at random.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with <b>papilledema</b> may be present.|$|E
25|$|Neuroimaging is not {{indicated}} {{for patients}} with stable headaches which are diagnosed as migraine. Studies indicate that presence of migraine does not increase a patient's risk for intracranial disease. A diagnosis of migraine which notes the absence of other problems, such as <b>papilledema,</b> would not indicate a need for neuroimaging. In the course of conducting a careful diagnosis, the physician should consider whether the headache has a cause other than the migraine and might require neuroimaging.|$|E
25|$|Other common neuropsychiatric {{manifestations of}} SLE include {{cognitive}} dysfunction, mood disorder, cerebrovascular disease, seizures, polyneuropathy, anxiety disorder, psychosis, depression, {{and in some}} extreme cases, personality disorders. Steroid psychosis can also occur {{as a result of}} treating the disease. It can rarely present with intracranial hypertension syndrome, characterized by an elevated intracranial pressure, <b>papilledema,</b> and headache with occasional abducens nerve paresis, absence of a space-occupying lesion or ventricular enlargement, and normal cerebrospinal fluid chemical and hematological constituents.|$|E
25|$|Ptosis, chemosis, {{cranial nerve}} palsies (III, IV, V, VI). Sixth nerve palsy {{is the most}} common. Sensory deficits of the {{ophthalmic}} and maxillary branch of the fifth nerve are common. Periorbital sensory loss and impaired corneal reflex may be noted. <b>Papilledema,</b> retinal hemorrhages, and decreased visual acuity and blindness may occur from venous congestion within the retina. Fever, tachycardia and sepsis may be present. Headache with nuchal rigidity may occur. Pupil may be dilated and sluggishly reactive. Infection can spread to contralateral cavernous sinus within 24–48 hours of initial presentation.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases. The most common {{abnormality}} is {{involvement of the}} facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or {{both sides of the}} face (65% resp 35% of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of <b>papilledema</b> (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
500|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to <b>papilledema,</b> which is {{swelling of the}} optic disc, {{the spot where the}} optic nerve enters the eyeball. This occurs in practically all cases of IIH, but not everyone experiences symptoms from this. Those who do experience symptoms typically report [...] "transient visual obscurations", episodes of difficulty seeing that occur in both eyes but not necessarily at the same time. Long-term untreated <b>papilledema</b> leads to visual loss, initially in the periphery but progressively towards the center of vision.|$|E

2500|$|Optic nerve {{involvement}} in Behçet's disease is rare, typically presenting as progressive [...] optic atrophy and visual loss. However, cases of acute optic neuropathy (specifically anterior ischemic optic neuropathy) {{have also been}} reported to occur. Optic nerve atrophy {{has been identified as}} {{the most common cause of}} visual impairment. Behçet's disease may result in primary or secondary optic nerve involvement. <b>Papilledema</b> as a result of dural sinus thrombosis and atrophy resulting from retinal disease, have been characterized as secondary causes of optic nerve atrophy in Behçet's disease.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, {{signs of}} {{elevated}} intracranial pressure, such as <b>papilledema</b> {{and loss of}} pupillary reflexes, are not reliable, and occur late in the disease process. [...] CT imaging of the brain is also unhelpful in detecting early cerebral oedema, but is often performed to rule out intra-cerebral bleeding. [...] Invasive intracranial pressure monitoring via subdural route is often recommended; however, the risk of complications must be weighed against the possible benefit (1% fatal haemorrhage). [...] The aim is to maintain intracranial pressures below 25mm Hg, and cerebral perfusion pressures above 50mm Hg.|$|E
50|$|Papillitis {{may have}} the same {{appearance}} as <b>papilledema.</b> However, papillitis may be unilateral, whereas <b>papilledema</b> is almost always bilateral. Papillitis can be differentiated from <b>papilledema</b> by an afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil), by its greater effect in decreasing visual acuity and color vision, and {{by the presence of}} a central scotoma. <b>Papilledema</b> that is not yet chronic will not have as dramatic an effect on vision. Because increased intracranial pressure can cause both <b>papilledema</b> and a sixth (abducens) nerve palsy, <b>papilledema</b> can be differentiated from papillitis if esotropia and loss of abduction are also present. However, esotropia may also develop secondarily in an eye that has lost vision from papillitis. Retrobulbar neuritis, an inflamed optic nerve, but with a normal-appearing nerve head, is associated with pain and the other findings of papillitis. Pseudopapilledema is a normal variant of the optic disk, in which the disk appears elevated, with indistinct margins and a normal vascular pattern. Pseudopapilledema sometimes occurs in hyperopic individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Papilledema: <b>Papilledema</b> (swelling of retinal optical discs) occurs in29% to 64% of cases. <b>Papilledema</b> in POEMS {{syndrome}} {{patients may}} occur {{with or without}} visual disturbances, increased intracranial pressure, or changes in cerebral spinal fluid protein levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Papilledema</b> of {{the eyes}} has been {{observed}} (2%) and may lead to disturbed visual acuity and even temporary or permanent blindness. Patients with preexisting <b>papilledema</b> or with involvement of {{the central nervous system}} may be at higher risk.|$|E

50|$|The eyes {{may show}} retinal {{hemorrhage}} or an exudate. <b>Papilledema</b> must be present before {{a diagnosis of}} malignant hypertension can be made. The brain shows manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, vomiting, and/or subarachnoid or cerebral hemorrhage. Patients will usually suffer from left ventricular dysfunction. The kidneys will be affected, resulting in hematuria, proteinuria, and acute renal failure.
