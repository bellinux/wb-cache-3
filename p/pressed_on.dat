5|$|During 1978 and 1979, for {{the album}}'s tenth anniversary, EMI reissued the album <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> limited edition white vinyl in several countries. In 1981, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) issued a unique half-speed master {{variation}} of the album using the sound from the original master recording.

5|$|In early September, Franklin D. Richards, {{returning}} from Europe {{where he had}} served as the Church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies.

40|$|Superstitions were {{demonstrated}} with human subjects when <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> one button were reinforced on a VI 30 -sec schedule while <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> a second were never reinforced. Superstitious responding, {{on the second}} button, was often maintained because <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> that button were frequently followed by reinforcement for a subsequent <b>press</b> <b>on</b> the first button. The introduction of a changeover delay (COD), which separated in time <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> the second button and subsequent reinforced <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> the first button, reduced or eliminated the superstitious responding of these subjects. Some complex superstitions were also demonstrated with other subjects for which the COD was in effect {{from the beginning of}} the session...|$|R
40|$|Concurrent variable-ratio {{schedules}} {{of electrical}} brain stimulation, food, and water were paired in various combinations as reinforcement of rats' lever presses. Relative {{prices of the}} concurrent reinforcers were varied by changing {{the ratio of the}} response requirements on the two levers. Economic substitutability, measured by the sensitivity of response ratio to changes in relative price, was highest with brain stimulation reinforcement of <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> both levers and lowest with food reinforcement of <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> one lever and water reinforcement of <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> the other. Substitutability with brain stimulation reinforcement of <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> one lever and either food or water reinforcement for <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> the other was about as high as with brain stimulation for <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> both levers. Electrical brain stimulation for rats may thus serve as an economic substitute for two reinforcers, neither of which is substitutable for the other...|$|R

5|$|The Mongol army <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> {{after the}} monsoon season. In the {{following}} dry season of 1277–78, c. December 1277, a Mongol army of 3800 led by Nasr al-Din, son of Gov. Sayyid Ajjal, advanced to Kaungsin, which defended the Bhamo Pass. They occupied the fort and destroyed {{a large number}} of abandoned stockades. But they found the heat excessive and returned.|$|E

50|$|The {{editorial}} board recently decided to re-launch the magazine <b>on</b> World <b>Press</b> Freedom Day {{in order to}} mark the date, however it was immediately blocked by the authorities.

5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E
5|$|By December, {{there was}} still no word of García de Celís, nor had Spanish {{assistance}} arrived from any other direction, and the Spanish at Buena Esperanza had lost hope. They were <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> all sides by hostile natives, with resistance led by Sicumba. Cerezeda got word of a plan by Sicumba to assault Buena Esperanza and destroy it. In response he sent parties to seize and execute hostile Indian leaders, thus defusing the imminent threat, although Sicumba managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 09:00 that the 1st RUR were in {{position}} {{to carry out a}} left flanking attack on Longuerval. The village was clear of Germans so they <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> towards Sainte-Honorine. When between the two villages, the battalion was engaged by German mortar, artillery and assault gun fire, and suffered several casualties. Two companies managed to reach Sainte-Honorine, but with no artillery fire support of their own, and out of radio contact with their battalion headquarters, they were forced to withdraw back to Longueval.|$|E

5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I <b>pressed</b> <b>on.</b> Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|No Line on the Horizon was {{released}} in five physical formats, three of which—the digipak, magazine, and box formats—were limited editions. The standard jewel case release contained a 24-page booklet. The LP vinyl release was <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> two black discs and contained a 16-page booklet. The digipak release had a 36-page booklet and a poster, which was {{also included in the}} box release. A 60-page magazine was included in the magazine release. Linear was a downloadable feature in the digipak and magazine formats, and was a bonus DVD in the box release, which also contained a 64-page hardcover book.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Kean {{kicked off}} its attack on 7 August, moving out from Masan. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade surged forward to Pansong, quickly inflicting 350 {{casualties}} on the North Koreans as it overran the North Korean 6th Division's headquarters. The other {{units of the}} Task Force, however, were slowed by North Korean resistance. Task Force Kean <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> the Chindong-ni area, resulting in a confused battle where the fragmented force {{had to rely on}} air strikes and airdrops to keep it effective. Task Force Kean's offensive had collided with one being delivered simultaneously by the North Korean 6th Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposed}} Trent and Mersey Canal {{was seen}} as a threat by the Trustees of the Navigation, for it ran parallel to the River Weaver for some distance near Anderton. However, the commissioners <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> with upgrading the river, completing new locks at Barnton in 1771 and at Acton Bridge in 1778. They also set about repaying their debts, which were liquidated in July 1775, resulting in some of the profits being given to the County of Cheshire, as stated in the original Act.|$|E
5|$|With the Red House {{batteries}} out of action, Smyth immediately <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> {{with his}} invasion plans. However, attempts to embark his 3,000 men ended in chaos; with only 1,200 men managing to board {{because of a}} shortage of boats and the artillery taking up an unexpected amount of space on board. Amid torrential rain and freezing cold, a council of war headed by Smyth decided to postpone the invasion pending more thorough preparations that would enable the embarkation of whole force.|$|E
5|$|As the First Baltic {{began moving}} towards Lithuania and into eastern Latvia, {{it became clear}} that Army Group North would attempt to outflank Bagramyan's forces near Daugavpils, as he had {{previously}} predicted. Vasilevsky, keeping his promise, appealed to Stalin to allow Bagramyan to move to Daugavpils but he refused to do so. Vasilevsky in turn, took it upon his own initiative and gave Bagramyan the go ahead. However, with the loss of 4th Shock Army, Bagramyan was left shortchanged since his promised 39th Army had not only not arrived but was composed of only seven divisions (in comparison to 4th Shock's ten). Feeling that time was being lost, he <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> with the units he had.|$|E

5|$|At 4:00pm, {{following}} {{a period of}} artillery preparation, the commandos launched their attack. Amidst thick mist and heavy rain, the attack went badly from the start. Shortly after stepping off, No. 5 Troop was ambushed by a German force disguised as locals, reducing its strength to just five men. The main assault force <b>pressed</b> <b>on,</b> although by now it consisted of only 67 men due to earlier losses. Part of the assault force—No. 6 Troop—took heavy fire and lost forward momentum; however, the other two troops gained {{the top of the}} hill and broke in to the German position. Upon reaching the summit they were greeted by an intense volume of heavy machine gun fire and at this point it became clear that the preparatory bombardment had not been successful. Calls for further artillery support were denied due to a shortage of ammunition amongst the field batteries and eventually after a number of unsuccessful attempts at taking the position the commandos were forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|Construction was financed {{through a}} loan of NOK218 million from Handelsbanken, which was secured on the revenue {{which would be}} {{generated}} {{from the sale of}} Hamar stadion and Fuglsetmyra. However, the bank was not willing to lend money secured on the basis of sales price of Hamar stadion being based on the re-regulation of the lot. The municipality was <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> time by the possibility of NFF denying Ham-Kam the right to play at Briskeby. Hamar Energi Holding AS (HEH), which owns Hamar Municipality's share of Eidsiva Energi, had large assets. Both HEH and BE1 had as chair Hans Kolstad, who proposed that HEH could issue a guarantee of NOK75 million for BG and BE1—which was issued in September 2007. This allowed construction to start, but the project was still under-financed by NOK50 million. HEH therefore issued another guarantee the same month, for NOK58.75 million. Because of delays in the regulation work, HEH issued another two guarantees, NOK60 million in March and NOK25 million in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|Historian Samuel E. Morison {{noted in}} 1949 that Spruance was {{subjected}} to much criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, thus allowing their surface fleet to escape. Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance <b>pressed</b> <b>on,</b> {{he would have been}} unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruisers would have been overwhelmed by Yamamoto's powerful surface units, including Yamato. Furthermore, the American air groups had suffered considerable losses, including most of their torpedo bombers. This made it unlikely that they would be effective in an airstrike against the Japanese battleships, even if they had managed to catch them during daytime. Also, by this time Spruance's destroyers were critically low on fuel.|$|E
