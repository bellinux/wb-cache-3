5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens {{and a second}} prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of soap opera-style twists and turns in the {{personal}} lives of the characters. They proceed {{through a series of}} often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{after the}} {{cancellation}} of their Psychoville, writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith were commissioned to produce two series for the BBC by controllers Janice Hadlow and Cheryl Taylor, partially in response to Sky beginning to produce comedy. At the time, {{it was unclear whether}} this would be two series of Inside No. 9, then known by the working title Happy Endings, or a series of Inside No. 9 and a series of some other programme. Inside No. 9 was to be <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> BBC team, which was later revealed to be David Kerr (director), Jon Plowman (executive producer) and Adam Tandy (producer).|$|E
5|$|Mercury (0.4AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the closest}} planet to the Sun and the {{smallest}} planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses). Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle {{have not yet been}} adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.|$|E
5|$|Methane {{can exist}} in the Martian {{atmosphere}} for only a limited period before it is destroyed—estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6–4 years. Its presence despite this short lifetime indicates that an active source of the gas must be present. Volcanic activity, cometary impacts, {{and the presence of}} methanogenic microbial life forms are among possible sources. Methane could be <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> non-biological process called serpentinization involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars.|$|E

5|$|Mutations are {{changes in}} the DNA {{sequence}} of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter {{the product of a}} gene, or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{it has been suggested that}} if a mutation changes a protein <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Server Sundaram is a 1964 Indian Tamil-language comedy-drama film {{directed}} by Krishnan–Panju and <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>A.</b> V. Meiyappan. The film stars Nagesh {{as the title}} character. R. Muthuraman and K. R. Vijaya play the other lead roles while S. N. Lakshmi and Major Sundarrajan play supporting roles. The story focuses {{on the life of}} a hotel waiter and how he strives to reach greater heights after he becomes an actor to attain the love of his restaurateur's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are one of}} the few animals {{where the}} {{molecular}} basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined. However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams. Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep. OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.|$|E

5|$|Techniques such as {{artificial}} insemination and embryo transfer are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small selection of the best quality parent animals. On one hand, this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final product. On the other, it decreases genetic diversity, increasing the severity of certain disease outbreaks among other risks.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} food waste <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{household}} and its occupants is affected by several factors; WRAP found the most impacting factors to be: firstly {{the size of the}} household, followed by the age of the individual occupants and finally the household composition (e.g. single occupant household). The other factors: job status, lifestage, ethnicity and occupation grouping of individuals were found to have less correlation between the amount of avoidable waste.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{standard}} {{is a set}} of guidelines which are used to ensure that the animals <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> breeder or breeding facility conform to the specifics of the standardized breed. All registered Highland cattle must conform to it. The {{breed standard}} was created in Inverness on 10 June 1885. There are four main parts to the standard: the head, the neck, the back and body, and the hair. Below is a concise list of the main points of the breed standard. A judge in a show will judge the cattle against a provided breed standard.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} transport pathways {{produced by}} these alternative NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower ATP yields than the full pathway. The advantages <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> shortened pathway {{are not entirely}} clear. However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold, reactive oxygen species, and infection by pathogens, {{as well as other}} factors that inhibit the full electron transport chain. Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organisms' resistance to injury, by reducing oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of these emissions {{are thought to be}} <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce {{back and forth between the}} poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk. The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1GW.|$|E
5|$|The plots shown {{of image}} impedance, {{attenuation}} and phase change are the plots of a low-pass prototype filter section. The prototype has a cut-off frequency of ωc = 1 rad/s and a nominal impedance R0 = 1 Ω. This is <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> filter half-section where L = 1 henry and C = 1 farad. This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled {{to the desired}} values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E

This {{is followed by the}} sound of dance music, <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> powerful beat from the instruments.

5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
5|$|After {{just two}} weeks of rehearsals, the play opened at the Boston Museum on May 9, 1887, as the first American {{adaptation}} of Stevenson's novella. On May 14, it closed for rewrites. The updated version, <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>A.</b> M. Palmer, opened at the Madison Square Theatre on Broadway on September 12 of that year. Sullivan invited Stevenson, who {{had moved to the}} U.S. that summer; Stevenson was ill, but his wife and mother attended and congratulated Sullivan on the play. The Madison Square production closed on October 1, when Mansfield took his company on a nationwide tour. The tour began at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia and visited over a dozen cities, including several returns to Boston and New York. It ended at the Madison Square Theatre, where Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was performed for a final season matinee on June 29, 1888.|$|E
