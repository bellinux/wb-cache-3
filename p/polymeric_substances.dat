2500|$|A biofilm is {{any group}} of {{microorganisms}} in which cells stick {{to each other and}} often also to a surface.

2500|$|Besides {{bacterial}} size, {{there are}} several factors affecting the predation of protists. Bacterial shape, the spiral morphology may play a defensive role towards predation feedings. For example, Arthrospira may reduce its susceptibility to predation by altering its spiral pitch. This alteration inhibits some natural geometric feature of the protist’s ingestion apparatus. Multicellular complexes of bacterial cells also change the ability of protist’s ingestion. Cells in biofilms or microcolonies are often more resistant to predation. For instance, the swarm cells of Serratia liquefaciens resist predation by its predator, Tetrahymenu. Due to the normal-sized cells that first contact a surface are most susceptible, bacteria need elongating swarm cells {{to protect them from}} predation until the biofilm matures. [...] For aquatic bacteria, they can produce a wide range of extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (EPS), which comprise protein, nucleic acids, lipids, polysaccharides and other biological macromolecules. EPS secretion protects bacteria from HNF grazing. The EPS-producing planktonic bacteria typically develop subpopulations of single cells and microcolonies that are embedded in an EPS matrix. The larger microcolonies are also protected from flagellate predation because of their size. The shift to the colonial type may be a passive consequence of selective feeding on single cells. However, the microcolony formation can be specifically induced in the presence of predators by cell-cell communication (quorum sensing).|$|E

The total exocellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substance</b> produced was proportional to the total biomass. The polymer is a heteropolysaccharide containing mannose as the major component. Glucose, galactose, and another unidentified sugar were also present, as well as amino sugars, uronic acids, and a considerable amount of sulfate, which accounts for the acidic nature of the polymer. The infrared spectrum and specific assays showed the absence of acyl groups. The rheological properties of polymer solutions were studied, showing a pseudoplastic behavior and a high apparent viscosity at relatively low concentrations. Viscosity was remarkably resistant to extremes of pH, temperature, or salinity.

50|$|Pellicle is {{a variety}} of biofilm that is formed between {{the air and the}} liquid in which {{bacteria}} grow. In a biofilm, bacterial cells interact with each other to protect their community and co-operate metabolically (microbial communities). In S. oneidensis, pellicle formation is typical and is related to the process of reducing heavy metal. Pellicle formation is extensively researched in this species. Pellicle is usually formed in three steps: cells attach to the triple surface of culture device, air and liquid, then developing a one-layered biofilm from the initial cells, and subsequently maturing to a complicated three-dimensional structure. In a developed pellicle, a number of substances between the cells (extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances)</b> help maintain the pellicle matrix. The process of pellicle formation involves significant microbial activities and related substances. For the extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances,</b> many proteins and other bio-macromolecules are required.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{addition}} to their capacity to attach to surfaces, various groups of microorganisms also produce an extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substance</b> known as “slime”. This slime forms a thin layer around cells known as biofilm. Thus, biofilm structure comprises bacterial cells and an extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substance.</b> It also presents a defined architecture, providing the microorganisms with an excellent protective environment and favoring the exchange of genetic material between cells as well as intercellular communication. The ability to produce biofilm is observed in {{a large group of}} bacteria, including coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) which are the predominant microorganisms of normal skin flora and have been implicated as the causative agents of hospital infections. Bacteremia caused by these agents is common in immunodepressed persons, in patients with cancer, in adult and neonatal intensive care units (ICU) and in patients using catheters or other prosthetic devices. The pathogenicity of CNS infections is probably related to the production of slime, which adheres preferentially to plastic and smooth surfaces, forming a biofilm that protects against attacks from the immune system and against antibiotic treatment,...|$|R

50|$|A {{biofilter}} is a bed {{of media}} on which microorganisms attach and grow to form a biological layer called biofilm. Biofiltration is thus usually {{referred to as a}} fixed-film process.
