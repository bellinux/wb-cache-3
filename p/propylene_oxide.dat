40|$|AbstractA {{study of}} the fast-atom {{bombardment}} tandem mass spectrometry behavior {{of a number of}} ethylene glycol polymers (PEGs) has been carried out. Both linear (hydroxyl, amino, and/or alkyl end groups) and cyclic (crown ether) polymers were studied. One of the materials is a block copolymer of ethylene and <b>propylene</b> <b>oxides.</b> Collisional activation was carried out in the collision octapole of a BEoQ hybrid mass spectrometer at a translational energy of 50 eV, with collision gas air. For the linear polymers, the most intense product ions are lithiated, linear polyglycol oligomers. These ions are formed via internal hydrogen transfer reactions that are facilitated (charge-induced) by lithium. This series of product ions allows for the observation of consecutive losses of monomer units from the chain end; this is useful to determine the sequence of monomers in a copolymer. The most abundant product ions from cyclic PEGs are lithiated radical cations. An especially interesting finding in this work is the preferential loss of two internal ethylene oxide (EO) units (dioxane, 88 u) from some [M + Li]+ precursors. Factors that influence this loss include (a) the sequence length of EO repeat units in the oligomer and (b) the identity of the end group(s) on the oligomer. It is proposed that this elimination of dioxane involves a six-membered ring intermediate; this decomposition reaction is believed to be a lithium-mediated (charge-induced) rearrangement.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} covers, {{through seven}} peer-reviewed publications, {{a number of}} observations conducted in two different continents, Antarctica and Australia, spanning from the near-infrared to submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths. The work begins in 2001 with a fundamental contribution {{to the development of}} SUMMIT, a sky-brightness monitoring instrument operating at 350 μm. This rugged, low power and low maintenance instrument was designed for astronomical site testing and allowed the measurement of atmospheric precipitable water vapour at very dry sites. It was successfully operating at two locations in Antarctica—South Pole and Dome C—making the first measurements of submillimeter sky opacity at the latter one, and demonstrating the site’s outstanding potential for submillimeter astronomy. Improvements and corrections to the skydip observing strategy and to the data reduction algorithms are described. NISM (Near-Infrared Sky Monitor) is an instrument operated with the same observing strategy as SUMMIT—skydips—but in the Kdark window at 2. 4 μm. The instrument was installed at the South Pole Station in 2001, and showed good performance in the subsequent winter, confirming that the sky brightness at the site is more than an order of magnitude lower than excellent astronomical sites such as Mauna Kea. The work highlights results from exploiting the submillimeter windows at the South Pole, where I operated without interruption, for the entire year of 2003, SPARO (Submillimeter Polarimeter for Antarctic Remote Observations) a 9 -pixel, 450 μm polarimeter installed at the focal plane of Viper, a 2 m submillimeter telescope. Most of the winter was dedicated to measure the magnetic fields in four Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs). These observations demonstrated that in these regions the magnetic field direction was preserved through the GMC formation process, and that the magnetic energy density was comparable to the turbulent energy density, imposing important constraints on GMC evolution models. The work concludes with results from several observation campaigns from 2004 at the Mopra millimetre telescope, including mapping of 13 CO, measurements of glycine and <b>propylene</b> <b>oxides</b> in different GMCs, and a survey of 83 methanol masers in massive star-forming regions...|$|R

The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity.

2500|$|Sarnia, Ontario was Dow's first {{manufacturing}} site in Canada, {{located in the}} Chemical Valley area alongside other petrochemical companies. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for World War II). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. In August 1985, the site accidentally discharged 11,000 litres of perchloroethylene (a carcinogenic dry cleaning chemical) into the St. Clair River, which gained infamy in the media as [...] "The Blob", and Dow Canada was charged by the Ministry of the Environment. Up to the early 1990s, Dow Canada's headquarters was located at the Modeland Centre, and a new three-story complex called the River Centre was opened up on the Sarnia site in 1993 to house Research and Development. Since then, several plants (Dow terminology for a production unit) on the site have been dismantled, particularly the Basic Chemicals including Chlor Alkali unit whose closure was announced in 1991 and carried out in 1994 which affected {{nearly half of the}} site's employees. The Dow Canada headquarters were moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1996, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia with Dow leasing some office space. [...] The Dow Fitness Centre was donated to the YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton in 2003. The Sarnia Site's workforce declined from a peak of 1600 personnel in the early 1990s to about 400 by 2002. In the late 1990s, land on the site was sold to TransAlta which built a natural gas power plant that begun operations in 2002 to supply electricity to the remaining Sarnia site plants and facilities, so that Dow could close its older less efficient steam plant (originally coal fired and later burning natural gas). On August 31, 2006, Dow announced that the entire Sarnia site would cease operations at the end of 2008. The Sarnia site had been supplied with ethylene through a pipeline from western Canada but BP officials warned Dow that shipments from the pipeline had to be suspended for safety reasons, and the loss of an affordable supply for the low density polyethylene plant rendered all the other operations at the site non-competitive. The Low-Density Polyethylene and Polystyrene units closed in 2006, followed by the Latex Unit in 2008, and finally the <b>Propylene</b> <b>Oxide</b> Derivatives Unit on April 2009.

It {{is shown}} that mineral acids (H 2 SO 4, H 3 PO 4), their salts, molybdenum and tungsten heteropolyacids of 12 range and zeolites {{are used as}} the catalysts. The reaction proceeds with high selectivity at 1 - 100 atm pressure and 473 - 673 K through carbonium ion formed via interaction of adsorbed olefin with proton H+ and then with H 2 O yielding alcohol. It is concluded that for gas phase hydration of olefins use of proton substituted zeolites with ratio Si / Al = 7 – 9 and strength of Bronsted centers from – 8. 2 to – 5. 6, with high heat of adsorption for olefins and low heat of adsorption for water is effective instead of mineral acids on SiO 2. In oxidative catalysis direct selective oxidation of alkanes to oxygen containing products and their oxidative dehydrogenation into olefins and further conversion of the olefins into valuable products through oxidation and hydration is a priority direction [1, 2]. Utilization of monolith porous catalyst in multifunctional rectors for combination of processes is perspective [3]. It is known from the world practice that olefins are the main raw material for synthesis of different organic compounds. Majority of ethylene and propylene obtained through catalytic and steam pyrolysis of ethane, propane and gasoline fractions is used for polymerization (20 - 50 %), production of styrene and its derivatives (20 - 24 %), acrylonitrile (15 - 20 %), ethylene and <b>propylene</b> <b>oxides</b> (12 - 16 %), alcohols (ethanol 8 - 10 %, butanol 10 - 13 %, isopropanol 7 - 14 %) and also ethylenglycol, acetone, acetaldehyde, acetic acid acroleyne, propionic aldehyde, vinyl acetate through oxidation and hydration over heterogeneous catalysts [4 - 9].

The as-prepared MSNFs using 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.225, 0.3, 0.35, and 0.4 mg/mL of P 123 in the precursor solution were denoted as MSNFs- 1, MSNFs- 2, MSNFs- 3, MSNFs- 4, MSNFs- 5, MSNFs- 6, and MSNFs- 7, respectively. The AAO template including MSNFs was denoted as AAO/MSNFs.|$|R
