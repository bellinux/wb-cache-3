50|$|The {{position}} of acting <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>is</b> {{a special case}} of an acting minister, and generally occurs when the <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>is</b> travelling overseas, is on vacation, or is in ill health. In the early 20th century, when travel by ship was still the norm, {{it was not uncommon}} for there to <b>be</b> an acting <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> for months on end. The deputy <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>is</b> usually designated as the acting <b>prime</b> <b>minister,</b> although another senior member of the government may fill the role if both the <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> and deputy <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>are</b> unavailable. An acting <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>is</b> required quite frequently - for instance, between 3 December 2007 and 23 February 2009 (during Kevin Rudd's first term), Julia Gillard acted as <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> on 16 separate occasions.|$|R

The Progressive Conservatives won 67 seats to the Liberals' 125, with smaller parties and independents winning 52 seats. Diefenbaker {{increased}} his majority to over 1,000 votes, and had the satisfaction of seeing Mackenzie King defeated in Prince Albert—but by a CCF candidate. The <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>was</b> returned in an Ontario by-election within months.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker was {{initially}} inclined {{to go along}} with Kennedy's request that nuclear weapons be stationed on Canadian soil as part of NORAD. However, when an August 3, 1961, letter from Kennedy which urged this was leaked to the media, Diefenbaker was angered and withdrew his support. The <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>was</b> also influenced by a massive demonstration against nuclear weapons, which took place on Parliament Hill.

5|$|The Tories {{had last}} governed Canada under R.B. Bennett, {{who had been}} elected in 1930.

The Liberals won five consecutive majorities between 1935 and 1953. The Liberals worked closely with the civil service (drawing several of their ministers from those ranks) and their years of dominance saw prosperity.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the third largest party, Clegg had {{announced}} that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats.

Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The Scottish National Party (SNP) signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government {{as part of a}} rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that Gordon Brown's continued presence as <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>was</b> seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour–Liberal Democrat deal.|$|E
5|$|Copies were {{leaked to}} the press via a Dutch news agency during the 1983 general {{election}} campaign. The U.S. State Department and British Government believed the tape to be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>was</b> personally aware of the tape and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E

He returned to Australia in 1921, having arranged for the funding of Australia's debts and reorganised Australia House.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of {{different}} countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. One of Modi's first visits as <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>was</b> to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{failure to}} secure {{independence}} concurrently {{with the end}} of the Federation caused his Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him on the grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>was</b> put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.|$|E

The bill disfranchised 60 of the smallest boroughs, and reduced the representation of 47 others.
