25|$|Swan {{was born}} on the Cheyenne River Reservation to Lakota, Western Sioux parents in 1928. She was the fifth child of ten, of which only five survived to adulthood. Makoka Winge’ Win (Goes Around The World Woman) was her Indian name given to her by her father. Her parents, James Hart Swan and Lucy Josephine High Pine-Swan were born {{around the turn of}} the 20th century. Madonna’s father James {{completed}} education at both Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, an Indian school in Oklahoma, where he would have been taught a skilledtrade geared toward agriculture, and two years at Haskell Indian College, which was the equivalent to a junior college. For the first five years of her life the Swan family lived with Madonna’s paternal great-uncle, known as Grandpa <b>Puts</b> <b>On</b> <b>His</b> Shoes, or Grandpa Puts for short. American Indian elders of the age cohort of Grandpa Puts (born before 1900) were alive during the nomadic days before the Indian victory and defeat of Custer at Little Big Horn and the subsequent final Indian confinement on indian reservations. Madonna Swan’s childhood was filled with beliefs and customs of the traditional Indian lifestyle. She relates a story of being cured of warts with the rubbing of a raw potato on them, applied by her father.|$|E

George is very impressed and attempts to get Jerry to reveal its cost. Kramer enters the apartment and asks for two minutes' help guarding his illegally parked car as he carries down some doves that he is looking after for a magician friend. However, they refuse to help because he often underestimates how long things take to do.|$|E

After being sent to bed, he falls asleep and wakes up in his pajamas in bed {{on top of a}} hill. Giant helmet-wearing potato men tell him that their king Boobus Tuber has brought him to their land with his Dream Machine, and Keen is now his slave.

2500|$|The general {{culture has}} very mixed views about cross-dressing. A woman who wears her husband's shirt to bed is {{considered}} attractive while {{a man who}} wears his wife's nightgown to bed may be considered transgressive. [...] Marlene Dietrich in a tuxedo was considered very erotic; Jack Lemmon in a dress was considered ridiculous. All this may result from an overall gender role rigidity for males; that is, because of the prevalent gender dynamic throughout the world, men frequently encounter discrimination when deviating from masculine gender norms, particularly violations of heteronormativity. A man's adoption of feminine clothing is often considered a going down in the gendered social order whereas a woman's adoption of what are traditionally men's clothing (at least in the English-speaking world) has less of an impact because women have been traditionally subordinate to men, unable to affect serious change through style of dress. Thus when a male cross-dresser <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> clothes, he transforms into the quasi-female and thereby becomes an embodiment of the conflicted gender dynamic. Following the work of Butler, gender proceeds along through ritualized performances, but in male cross-dressing it becomes a performative [...] "breaking" [...] of the masculine and a [...] "subversive repetition" [...] of the feminine.|$|E

About.com praised songs like Let Us Live as [...] "Game <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> best Nas impersonation as he flows off the beat with intricate and polysyllabic rhymes." [...] Allmusic writer David Jeffries noted [...] "the cuts that truly matter on LAX aren't the ones where the rapper's hardcore, unswayable definition of loyalty {{comes into play}} but the ones that go outside the usual topics and explore both the profound (the African-American struggle) and, more surprisingly, the profane (rump shaking)" [...] and that [...] "this scattershot album is easy to recommend despite its flaws." [...] USA Today gave the album a perfect score saying [...] "throughout, The Game flays rivals and trumpets his own skills and success. He attacks the beats — provided {{by the likes of}} J.R. Rotem, Kanye West, Cool & Dre, Scott Storch, Hi-Tek and DJ Toomp — with lyrical ferocity." [...] The A.V. Club noted [...] "Only three major-label albums into his career, The Game has already appropriated the angst of rap's most beloved icons" [...] and praised the album's production while stating [...] "The Game has always borrowed from the greats. Here, he cannibalizes his own tired shtick so extensively, he lapses even further into self-parody." ...|$|E
