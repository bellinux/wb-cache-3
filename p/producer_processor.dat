40|$|ABSTRACT- Traceability {{in a food}} sector can be {{obtained}} by developing traceability systems. These systems refer to recording all important data referring to the evolution of a product along the production and supply chain. The benefits derived from the application of this model are great for those involved in the wine production chain (<b>producer,</b> <b>processor</b> and distributor), and for the consumers ’ health. Thus, consumers are certain of the safety of the wines they buy, and their right for free choice is ensured by the transparency of the production and marketing chain. Wine producers and processors are more efficient from the viewpoint of products logistics. They might receive fewer complaints from consumers and apply the so-called due diligence defense – the proof they fulfilled their tasks, and they could finally use traceability in marketing to differentiate the products. The benefits for a better protection of public health and traceability help preventing frauds, when the authenticity of certain wines cannot be traced by analyses.

40|$|There are {{problems}} in {{the functioning of the}} food supply chain related to price transmission and value-added distribution. Vertical price transmission analysis is an important research area in the aspect of the assessment of impact on the welfare at the <b>producer,</b> <b>processor</b> and retailer levels. The paper investigates vertical price transmission along the whole milk supply chain after the end of European Union milk quotas in the Slovak market using a vector error correction model. Monthly farm-gate, processor and retail prices in the Slovak Republic covering the period from 2010 to 2016 were used in the analysis. Using the Johansen co-integration technique, empirical evidence has been found for two co-integration equations between farm-gate, processor and retail prices. We show that short-term and long-term bilateral causal relationships exist between prices at different market stages. The estimation of the price transmission elasticity supports the assumption that price changes are not transmitted efficiently from one level to another. However, symmetric price transmission exists between farm-gate and processor prices for whole milk in the long term. The perfect price transmission may also be due to recently emerging and strengthening the producer organisations that enable producers support their bargaining position in the supply chain...|$|E

These two techniques are complementary approaches to hiding the latency of communication-induced misses. This paper compares the effectiveness of data forwarding and data prefetching to hide communication-induced misses. Although both techniques require comparable hardware support, forwarding usually has a lower instruction overhead. We evaluate prefetching and forwarding algorithms in a parallelizing compiler using execution-driven simulations of a sharedmemory multiprocessor. Both data forwarding and prefetching reduce the execution time of applications significantly (30 - 40 % on average). Forwarding performs better on average, while prefetching is more robust to changes in cache and memory parameters. Finally, we propose two ways of integrating the two techniques. The integration of the two techniques reduces the execution time even more (43 - 48 % on average) and is very robust. 1 Introduction As increases in processor speed continue to outstrip increases in memory system speed, it becomes crucial to develop and refine techniques that enhance the effectiveness of cache hierarchies. An important reason why cache hierarchies are sometimes ineffective in multiprocessors is the intrinsic interprocessor communication required by applications. To tolerate this communication, popularly known as data sharing, techniques that overlap processor computation with the communication have been proposed. Two of these techniques are data forwarding and data prefetching. In data forwarding [1, 8, 10], producer processors send the data to the caches of the processors that will use the dat...|$|E
40|$|Research and {{development}} {{have influenced the}} development of the canola industry in Canada. This study uses a three region equilibrium displacement model {{to examine the effects of}} two kinds of research {{and development}} on canola seed producers, canola processors, canola meal consumers and canola oil consumers. Given health information changes taste the conventional estimate of consumer surplus can not be applied. We modify the Dixit and Norman (1978) methodology to define an ex post measure of consumer surplus. Two hypotheses are examined. The first is that canola producers, processors and consumers have benefited from the health and nutrition research, that increased the demand for canola oil. The second hypothesis is that <b>producer,</b> <b>processor</b> and consumer groups experienced a net gain from the canola's industry decision to focus on the agronomic research that reduced the potential yield of the canola seed in exchange for better quality characteristics. The empirical findings of the study lead to a rejection of the first hypothesis. Although the industry as a whole has gained from health research, Canadian consumers, surprisingly, were worse off with improved health information because they were already enjoying the health benefit at a lower price. Furthermore, the increased consumption of canola oil is shown to generate a positive externality due to a reduction in coronary heart disease costs. These external benefits exceeded the total internal/private benefits within the industry. We fail to reject the second hypothesis. There is not enough empirical evidence to determine whether or not the canola industry or other social groups are worse off from focusing research on the quality characteristics of canola products at the expense of potential yield. It is interesting to note that, according to the mathematical model presented, there are some instances, or parameter ranges, which show that the entire canola industry and/or other social groups were made worse off by pursuing quality based research goals. While this result seems negative at the outset, one should keep in mind the opportunity cost of not pursuing the quality based research goals. In other words, had quality based research not been pursued one might expect the growth of the industry to be either inhibited or ceased altogether...|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Economia Agrária e Gestão do Território - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThis {{work has}} as its {{starting}} point the Porter report on the competitiveness of the Portuguese, published in 1994 that identified the cork sector as a cluster of our economy, identifying the same for a huge competitive advantage. In this report are defined a set of initiatives for action {{in order to enhance}} those same competitive advantages, creating the Diamond level of competitiveness of the sector a set of interconnections, which increase the strength of this sector, both in terms of their importance in national economy still at the relative weight of Portugal in the international context of the business. The Portuguese cork industry is an export sector par excellence, and our country are the leading <b>producer,</b> <b>processor</b> and exporter of cork and its products, finding as final consumers in particular countries producers and bottlers of wine and some countries where the cork has a positive image us a material used in construction. The cork oak is the second species in forest area, occupying nearly a quarter of the forest area of Portugal, is the country that in the world has a greater area of cork oak, is the world's largest producer of cork and the largest processor and supplier of cork products. Is commonly considered a key sector of the Portuguese economy, the level of the economic analysis to the sector has hardly begun, with a series of studies to characterize the sector in a manner satisfactory to the level of their technical and technological variables, but an inadequate bibliography in terms of economics and competitiveness of the sector. Under these assumptions, it is intended to assess how this thesis is that this sector has evolved in the period since before the Porter report, and after 10 years of that report. This assessment is mainly intended to quantify and measure the evolution of the main qualitative and quantitative variables in terms of primary production (raw materials), industrial production (intermediate and final) and national and international trade of cork products. It is intended to implement the main indicators of competitiveness, to measure changes in the competitive sector, while through a literature review, statistical and the application of a direct survey of industrial cork, assess how it is that companies have applied and used the dynamic factors of competitiveness to amplify the natural competitive advantages in this sector in Portugal. We also analyzed a set of initiatives for action on key competitiveness factors, such as, quality, innovation, research and development and training. The {{purpose of this study was}} to validate these changes and positioning conditioned the competitiveness of the sector in Portugal, which have evolved as the macroeconomic and sectorial indicators, and the way in which the various sector actors have interacted to catalyze these competitive advantages. We conclude that there is a structure in the primary well-organized, with a structure downstream clearly stratified and schematic, which allows you to enjoy the best of the different types and qualities of cork. All economic indicators point to study a positive development of such indicators in the period considered, pointing to the fact that the sector has increased in this period, as shown by the significant vi increase in the ratio of productivity, the growth of fixed assets, value of production, the gross value added, sales value and the reduction of the staff costs to sales. Analyzing the data of international trade, it appears that this is an unequivocal product of an exchange, although this fact has declined in recent years with increasing weight of imports compared to exports, however, remain much higher than the former. The cork industry in Portugal has significantly increased the value and volume of their exports and cork has, however, also increased, and significantly, the volume and value of its imports of raw materials. It should be stressed that exports of cork, rose sharply their relative rates compared to the year 1994, growing larger in value than in quantity. A potential disadvantage of the current situation of Portuguese cork exports, relates to a concentration of its export destinations, with the top ten importing countries represent approximately 80 % of total Portuguese exports, a figure that has remained constant in the series considered, but that shows that any fluctuations, international crises centered on one or a number of these countries can severely constrain the results of the business. For imports of cork, which are mainly raw materials for industrial use by the Portuguese, they grew significantly in terms of quantity, but mainly in terms of value, giving an indication of the growing dependency on the Portuguese industrial raw material produced in other producing markets, including Spain and the Maghreb. This could be very harmful to the national economy by the instability of some of the traditional North African countries, either by the growth of the industrial fabric of Spain, that this growth process may make the prices of raw materials from Spain and affecting in considerably the capacity to supply the domestic industry in view of their installed capacity. However, observing the revealed comparative advantage of the business in Portugal, it appears that these are significant, and that the relationship between exports and imports increased during the period considered both in terms of quantity, both in terms of value. Based on economic data, particularly in international trade data, we can consider that the sector in Portugal, not only has strong comparative advantage compared to other countries, as these competitive advantages have grown significantly since the passage of the Porter report until the year 2003...|$|E
