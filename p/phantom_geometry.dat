However, for many scenes, especially multi-object, these hulls may contain significant artifacts known as <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry.</b> In depth hulls the <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry</b> appears behind the scene objects in regions occluded from all the reference views. In visual hulls the <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry</b> may also appear in front of the objects because there is not enough information to unambiguously imply the object positions. In this work we identify which parts of the depth and visual hull might constitute <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry.</b> We define the notion of reduced depth hull and reduced visual hull as the parts of the corresponding hull that are phantomfree. We analyze the role of the depth information in identification of the <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry.</b> Based on this, we provide an algorithm for rendering the reduced depth hull at interactive frame-rates and suggest an approach for rendering the reduced visual hull. The rendering algorithms take advantage of modern GPU programming techniques. Our techniques bypass explicit reconstruction of the hulls, rendering the reduced depth or visual hull directly from the reference views.

Specifically, a comparison between the Anisotropic Analytic Algorithm (AAA) and other common dose-calculation algorithms in regions downstream (≥ 2 cm) from low-density material in anthropomorphic and slab <b>phantom</b> <b>geometries</b> is presented. Two measurement setups involving rectilinear slab-phantoms (ACDS Level II audit) and anthropomorphic geometries (ACDS Level III audit) were {{used in conjunction with}} ion chamber (planar 2 D array and Farmer-type) measurements. Measured doses were compared to calculated doses for a variety of cases, with and without the presence of inhomogeneities and beam-modifiers in 71 audits. Results demonstrate a systematic AAA underdose with an average discrepancy of 2. 9  ±  1. 2 % when the AAA algorithm is implemented in regions distal from lung-tissue interfaces, when lateral beams are used with anthropomorphic phantoms. This systemic discrepancy was found for all Level III audits of facilities using the AAA algorithm. This discrepancy is not seen when identical measurements are compared for other common dose-calculation algorithms (average discrepancy − 0. 4  ±  1. 7 %), including the Acuros XB algorithm also available with the Eclipse TPS.

In this work, a wide variety of solutions are deduced by considering choices for the form function, a specific linear equation of state relating the energy density and the pressure anisotropy, and various <b>phantom</b> wormhole <b>geometries</b> are explored. A large class of solutions impose that the spatial distribution of the exotic matter is restricted to the throat neighborhood, with a cutoff of the stress-energy tensor at a finite junction interface, although asymptotically flat exact solutions are also found.

40|$|The {{effect of}} patient inhomogeneities {{surrounding}} the oesophagus on the dosimetry planning of an upper thoracic oesophageal 192 Ir HDR brachytherapy treatment is studied. The MCNPX Monte Carlo code {{is used for}} dosimetry in a patient-equivalent <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry</b> and results are compared in terms of isodose contours as well as dose volume histograms with corresponding calculations by a contemporary treatment planning system software featuring a full TG- 43 dose calculation algorithm (PLATO BPS version 14. 2. 4). It is found {{that the presence of}} patient inhomogeneities does not alter the delivery of the planned dose distribution to the planning treatment volume. Regarding the organs at risk, the common practice of current treatment planning systems (TPSs) to consider the patient geometry as a homogeneous water medium leads to a dose overestimation of up to 13 % to the spinal cord and an underestimation of up to 15 % to the sternum bone. These findings which correspond to the dose region of about 5 - 10 % of the prescribed dose could only be of significance when brachytherapy is used as a boost to external beam therapy. Additionally, an analytical dosimetry model, which is efficient in calculating dose in mathematical phantoms containing inhomogeneity shells of materials of radiobiological interest, is utilized for dosimetry in the patient-equivalent inhomogeneous <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry.</b> Analytical calculations in this work are in good agreement with corresponding Monte Carlo results within the bone inhomogeneities of spinal cord and sternum bone but, like treatment planning system calculations, the model fails to predict the dose distribution in the proximal lung surface as well as within the lungs just as the TPS does, due to its inherent limitation in treating lateral scatter and backscatter radiation. © 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: IMRT QA is {{commonly}} {{performed in a}} <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry</b> but the clinical interpretation of the results in a 2 D phantom plane is difficult. The main objective of our work is to move from film measurement based QA to 3 D dose reconstruction in a patient CT scan. In principle, this could be achieved using a dose reconstruction method from 2 D detector array measurements as available in the COMPASS system (IBA Dosimetry). The {{first step in the}} clinical introduction of this system instead of the currently used film QA procedures is to test the reliability of the dose reconstruction. In this paper we investigated the validation of the method in a homogeneous phantom with the film QA procedure as a reference. We tested whether COMPASS QA results correctly identified treatment plans that did or did not fulfil QA requirements in head and neck (H&N) IMRT. Materials and methods: A total number of 24 treatments were selected from an existing database with more than 100 film based H&N IMRT QA results. The QA results were classified as either good, just acceptable or clinically rejected (mean gamma index 0. 5, respectively with 3 %/ 3 mm criteria). Film QA was repeated and compared to COMPASS QA with a MatriXX detector measurement performed on the same day. Results: Good agreement was found between COMPASS reconstructed dose and film measured dose in a phantom (mean gamma 0. 83 +/- 0. 09, 1 SD with 1 %/ 1 mm criteria, 0. 33 +/- 0. 04 with 3 %/ 3 mm criteria). COMPASS QA results correlated well with film QA, identifying the same patients with less good QA results. Repeated measurements with film and COMPASS showed changes in delivery after a modified MLC calibration, also visible in a standard MLC check in COMPASS. The time required for QA reduced by half by using COMPASS instead of film.

The primary neutron and photon spectrums have been derived from narrow beam attenuation measurements. The positions and strengths of the effective primary neutron, scattered neutron, and photon sources have been derived from dual ion chamber measurements. The size of the effective primary neutron source has been measured using a copper activation technique.

40|$|A {{new method}} {{to assess the}} scatter {{component}} in positron emission tomography (PET) based on estimating the low-frequency component corresponding to scattered events using ordered subsets- expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstructions is proposed in this paper and evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation studies, experimental phantom measurements and clinical studies. The rationale of this method called Statistical Reconstruction-Based Scatter Correction (SRBSC) is that the image corresponding to scattered events in the projection data consists of almost low-frequency components of activity distribution and that the low-frequency components will converge faster than the high-frequency ones in successive iterations of statistical reconstruction methods such as OSEM. The second assumption is that the high-frequency components will be smeared, i. e. filtered by the scatter response kernels. A simple model has been devised to parameterize the scatter component using Monte Carlo simulations. The unscattered component estimated using SRBSC was compared to the true unscattered component as estimated by Monte Carlo simulations for simple <b>phantom</b> <b>geometries</b> and clinically realistic source distributions.

40|$|The {{objective}} and planning {{of the present}} research work were the determination of a mathematical model which accounts for the variability of the absorbed dose, on the central axis of the beams (CO- 60 and X-Rays 25 MV). A statistical methodology, based on the multi treatment regression design, as developed by Mexia, was adopted {{to interpret the results}} of the model. The thermoluminescence dosimetry was adopted, and the dosemeters in chips (LiF TLD 100, Harshaw). On the basis of the TLD readings and applying Burlin's Theory, the values of the absorbed doses at different depths along the central axis of the beams found. Data obtained in this present work are presented and discussed. Mean values of the absorbed doses, based on a large number of measurements, are showed in separate figures. Each figure deals only with a particular radiation, field size and <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry.</b> The results are given as a percentage of depth doses. In each figure is also included the absorption depth dose curve in a homogeneous medium (muscle). The study of the curves shows: a) in the interfaces, exists a variation of absorbed dose different from that which occurs in the central zone of each layer; b) a discontinuity of the absorbed dose values is observed in each interface; c) complex phenomena occur, in lung layers, which depend on the thickness of the media and the quality of radiation. A mathematical model consisting of two curses, representing both the dose variation in the build-up and in absorption regions, is presented.

40|$|PURPOSE A beamlet based direct {{aperture}} optimization (DAO) for modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) using photon multileaf collimator (pMLC) shaped electron fields {{is developed}} and investigated. METHODS The Swiss Monte Carlo Plan (SMCP) allows {{the calculation of}} dose distributions for pMLC shaped electron beams. SMCP is interfaced with the Eclipse TPS (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) which can thus be included into the inverse treatment planning process for MERT. This process starts with the import of a CT-scan into Eclipse, the contouring of the target and the organs at risk (OARs), and {{the choice of the}} initial electron beam directions. For each electron beam, the number of apertures, their energy, and initial shape are defined. Furthermore, the DAO requires dose-volume constraints for the structures contoured. In order to carry out the DAO efficiently, the initial electron beams are divided into a grid of beamlets. For each of those, the dose distribution is precalculated using a modified electron beam model, resulting in a dose list for each beamlet and energy. Then the DAO is carried out, leading to a set of optimal apertures and corresponding weights. These optimal apertures are now converted into pMLC shaped segments and the dose calculation for each segment is performed. For these dose distributions, a weight optimization process is launched in order to minimize the differences between the dose distribution using the optimal apertures and the pMLC segments. Finally, a deliverable dose distribution for the MERT plan is obtained and loaded back into Eclipse for evaluation. For an idealized water <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry,</b> a MERT treatment plan is created and compared to the plan obtained using a previously developed forward planning strategy. Further, MERT treatment plans for three clinical situations (breast, chest wall, and parotid metastasis of a squamous cell skin carcinoma) are created using the developed inverse planning strategy.

40|$|Although {{wide bore}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) scanners provide increased space for patients, the scan {{field of view}} (sFOV) remains considerably smaller than the bore size. Consequently, patient anatomy which spans beyond the sFOV is truncated and the information is lost. As a solution, some manufacturers provide the capacity to reconstruct CT images from a partial dataset at an extended field of view (eFOV). To assess spatial distortion within this eFOV three phantoms were considered a 30 x 30 x 20 cm 3 slab of solid water, the Gammex electron density CT phantom and a female anthropomorphic phantom. For each phantom, scans were taken centrally within the sFOV as a reference image and with the phantom edge extended at 1 cm intervals from 0 to 5 cm beyond the sFOV into the eFOV. To assess CT number accuracy various tissue equivalent materials were scanned in the eFOV and resulting CT numbers were compared to inserts scanned within the sFOV.

A comparison of the results obtained indicates that the GOSD provides superior contrast than the Anger camera for every tumor to collimator distance and for every tumor dimension. Also, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), and full-width at tenth maximum (FWTM) show a better response for the germanium pixellated detector with respect to Anger camera due to better energy and spatial resolution of the germanium-based device...|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} {{candidate for}} the present accelerated expansion of the Universe is "phantom energy", which possesses an equation of state of the form ω≡ p/ρ<- 1, consequently violating the null energy condition. As this is the fundamental ingredient to sustain traversable wormholes, this cosmic fluid presents us with a natural scenario {{for the existence of}} these exotic geometries. In this context, we shall construct <b>phantom</b> wormhole <b>geometries</b> by matching an interior wormhole solution, governed by the phantom energy equation of state, to an exterior vacuum at a junction interface. Several physical properties and characteristics of these solutions are further investigated. The dynamical stability of the transition layer of these phantom wormholes to linearized spherically symmetric radial perturbations about static equilibrium solutions is also explored. It is found that the respective stable equilibrium configurations may be increased by strategically varying the wormhole throat radius. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures.

40|$|Abstract—The {{high density}} and atomic number of hip {{prostheses}} for patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy challenge {{our ability to}} accurately calculate dose. A new clinical dose calculation algorithm, Monte Carlo, will allow accurate calculation of the radiation transport both within and beyond hip prostheses. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate, for both <b>phantom</b> and patient <b>geometries,</b> the capability of various dose calculation algorithms to yield accurate treatment plans. Dose distributions in <b>phantom</b> and patient <b>geometries</b> with high atomic number prostheses were calculated using Monte Carlo, superposition, pencil beam, and no-heterogeneity correction algorithms. The phantom dose distributions were analyzed by depth dose and dose profile curves. The patient dose distributions were analyzed by isodose curves, dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and tumor control probability/normal tissue complication probability (TCP/NTCP) calculations. Monte Carlo calculations pre-dicted the dose enhancement and reduction at the proximal and distal prosthesis interfaces respectively, whereas superposition and pencil beam calculations did not. However, further from the prosthesis, the differences between the dose calculation algorithms diminished. Treatment plans calculated with superposition showed similar isodose curves, DVHs, and TCP/NTCP as the Monte Carlo plans, except in the bladder, where Monte Carlo predicted a slightly lower dose. Treatment plans calculated with either the pencil beam method or with no heterogeneity correction differed significantly from the Monte Carlo plans. © 2003 American Association o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Phase-Contrast MR imaging {{methods are}} widely used for {{measurement}} of blood flow velocity components. Also {{there are some other}} tools such as CT and Ultrasound for velocity map detection in intravascular studies. These data are used in deriving flow characteristics. Some clinical applications are investigated which use pressure distribution in diagnosis of intravascular disorders such as vascular stenosis. In this paper an approach to the problem of measurement of intravascular pressure field by using velocity field obtained from flow images is proposed. The method presented in this paper uses an algorithm to calculate nonlinear equations of Navier-Stokes, assuming blood as an incompressible and Newtonian fluid. Flow images usually suffer the lack of spatial resolution. Our attempt is to consider the effect of spatial resolution on the pressure distribution estimated from this method. In order to achieve this aim, velocity map of a numerical phantom is derived at six different spatial resolutions. To determine the effects of vascular stenoses on pressure distribution, a stenotic <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry</b> is considered. A comparison between the pressure distribution obtained from the phantom and the pressure resulted from the algorithm is presented. In this regard we also compared the effects of collocated and staggered computational grids on the pressure distribution resulted from this algorithm. Keywords—Flow imaging, pressure distribution estimation, phantom, resolution. I...|$|E
40|$|Background: Velocity-encoded {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (VENC-MRI) is a commonly used technique in cardiac exam-inations. This technique utilizes the phase shift properties of protons moving along a magnetic field gradient. VENC-MRI offers a unique way of measuring the severity of valve regurgitation by directly quantifying the regurgitation flow volume. Purpose: To compare flow analysis results of different software programs and to assess the effect of background correction in sample patient cases. Material and Methods: A phantom was built out of Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) which provides tubes of different diameters. These tubes can be connected to an external water circuit to generate a water flow inside the tubes. Expected absolute flow quantities inside the tubes were determined from preset tube- and flow-parameters. Different flow conditions were measured with a VENC-MRI sequence and the images evaluated using different software packages. In a second step six randomly selected patients showing different degrees of aortic insufficiency were evaluated in clinical terms. Results: The contour propagation algorithms used in the software packages performed differently even on static <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry.</b> In terms of clinical evaluation the software packages performed similarly. Enabling background correction or leaving out manual correction of propagated contours changed results for severity of aortic insufficiency. Conclusion: Turning on background correction and manual correction of propagated contours in MRI flow volume measurements is strongly recommended...|$|E
40|$|C-arm {{angiography}} systems offer great {{flexibility in}} the acquisition of trajectories for computed tomography. Theoretically, these systems are able to scan patients while standing in an upright position. This would allow novel insights into structural changes of the human anatomy while weight bearing. However, this would require a scan on a horizontal trajectory {{parallel to the ground}} floor which is currently not supported by standard C-arm CT acquisition protocols. In this paper, we compared the standard vertical and the new horizontal scanning trajectories by analysis of the source positions and source to detector distances during the scan. We employed a C-arm calibration phantom to compute the exact scan geometry. Based on the analysis of the projection matrices, we computed the source position in 3 D and the source to detector distance for each projection. We then used the calibrated scan geometries to reconstruct the calibration phantom. Based on this reconstruction in comparison to the ideal <b>phantom</b> <b>geometry</b> we also evaluated the geometric reconstruction error. As expected, both the vertical and the horizontal scan trajectories exhibit a significant C-arm "wobble". But in both kinds of trajectories, the reproducibility over several scans was comparable. We were able to reconstruct the calibration phantom with satisfactory geometric reconstruction accuracy. With a reconstruction error of 0. 2 mm, we conclude tha...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two general}} {{paradigms}} for treatment planning: forward planning and inverse planning. In forward planning, an initial set of treatment parameter values are refined {{by trial and}} error until a desired dose distribution is produced. In inverse planning the problem is to determine the appropriate parameter values directly from the desired dose distribution. In this thesis the inverse planning problem (IPP) is posed mathematically as an inverse problem and as an optimization problem. In the case where scatter and attenuation are ignored (the NS-NA model) the inverse problem reduces to the inversion of the Dual Radon operator; if rotational symmetry is assumed, the problem simplifies to the solution of the Abel integral equation. The inverse solutions exhibit negative components and are therefore nonphysical. By formulating the IPP as a constrained optimization problem, the occurrence of negative components can be eliminated using non-negativity constraints. Additional constraints, such as dose limits, can be easily incorporated. The optimality criteria are based on minimizing the L 1 and the L 2 norms: the former is formulated as a linear program and the latter is formulated as a quadratic program. The numerical solutions of these mathematical programs are obtained in the NS-NA model and in the case where attenuation and scatter are present (SCAT models). In the case of the symmetric NS-NA model, analytical solutions are found using the variational calculus. Since linear and quadratic programs are convex programs, the solutions are global solutions (but not necessarily unique). Comparisons are made between the L 1 and the L 2 solutions in both the SCAT and the NS-NA dose models for various <b>phantom</b> <b>geometries.</b> The results indicate that norm minimization is a viable approach in the resolution of the IPP; furthermore, the underlying algorithms are sufficiently fast for use in an interactive environment. On a PC running Window NT 4. 0 with 192 MB RAM, solving the L 1 linear program with 800 to 1190 constraints and 2776 variables takes 145. 9 seconds on average, with a median of 66. 3 seconds; solving the L 2 quadratic program with 1128 to 1510 constraints and 324 variables takes 648. 1 seconds on average, with a median of 281. 2 seconds. ...|$|R
30|$|Alternatively, tomographic {{scans of}} large {{cylindrical}} phantoms containing accurately measured amounts of radioactive materials {{have been proposed}} [12, 13, 20 – 26]. This approach is more cumbersome, especially when radioisotopes with long half-lives are used. However, its rationale is that the geometry of the extended calibration phantom better models {{the body of a}} patient and the physical effects (photon attenuation and scatter) which occur in patients’ acquisitions. Therefore, all approximations (and potential inaccuracies) due to the clinical reconstruction method which may affect the accuracy of patient images will be replicated in the reconstructed images of the calibration <b>phantom.</b> The <b>geometries</b> which have been used in the extended phantom experiments can be divided into three categories: (a) small container(s) filled with activity (hot sources (HS)) placed in the large cylinder filled with non-radioactive water (cold background (CB)) [13, 22, 23, 26], (b) small container(s) with activity placed in the large cylinder filled with radioactive water (warm background (WB)) [21], and (c) large cylinders with no inserts, filled uniformly with activity (hot-cylinder (HC)) [12].|$|R
