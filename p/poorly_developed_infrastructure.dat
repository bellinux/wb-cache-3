Oftentimes, {{as is the case}} in the Ecuadorian Amazon, oil is used to control dust on roadways, causing the precipitation runoff from these roads to also be contaminated. Direct human health hazards occur since many people, including children walk barefoot on these oiled roads putting them in direct contact with the crude oil. Other hazards to humans include seepages into ponds that provide drinking water for the population. During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. Environmental concerns are primarily focused on a group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). “PAHs accumulate on particles and sediments, which tend to protect them from biodegrading processes", Green and Trett as cited in. During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. Samples were collected from four sites (13 stations) in the Ecuadorian Amazon where crude oil was the main pollutant. The water collected from Site B, a drinking water pond located 100m from an in use pit, had the highest total petroleum hydrocarbon (THP) concentration. Sediments were found to be acutely phototoxic. This area which has <b>poorly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is one where residents collect water for drinking, cooking and bathing from the rivers and ponds nearby. “A recent study observed excess cancer rates in a village in this region” Sebastian et.

These samples were collected from four sites where crude oil was the main source of pollution. 1-4 day old organisms of both species were used in the tests. Immobility of D. magna was recorded after 24 hours of exposure indoors. They were then moved outdoors where they were exposed to sunlight. After 1-2 hours the samples were removed from the sunlight and it was found that D. Magna often recovered within an hour after UV exposure.Hyalella azteca was cultured in the same medium as was used for the D. Magna species.

Initially the hitherto uninhabited {{island was}} baptized Santo Antão or Santo António de Abade, the Catholic saint’s day of January 17, the date {{the island was}} discovered. Later the island was renamed Príncipe in homage to Prince Dom João--later King João II (1481-95)--who was entitled to the taxes levied on the sugar produced on the island. Príncipe’s settlement by Portuguese colonists and African slaves began in 1500 when the island was granted to the donatary António Carneiro, whose family possessed {{it for more than}} 250 years. After the decline of the sugar industry in the early seventeenth century until the mid-nineteenth century, the production of food for the provision of ships and the slave trade dominated the island’s economy. In 1753, Príncipe reverted to the Crown when, due to the political instability in São Tomé, the archipelago’s capital was transferred to its main settlement Santo António {{that at the same time}} was granted city rights. Despite its new status, Santo António always remained a small town with <b>poorly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> During the hundred years that it remained the capital it did not even provide an official residence for the governor, who, consequently, relied on private accommodation.Until 1965 there was not a single tarred road in Príncipe. Only during the reign of Governor Silva Sebastião (1963-72), when the armed struggle in Angola, Portuguese Guinea, and Mozambique had already commenced and Portugal started to invest more in the development of her colonies, Príncipe started benefiting from the various public works programs. In the second half of the 1960s, three tarred roads, a tarred airstrip, and a new primary school were constructed in Príncipe. After São Tomé and Príncipe’s independence in 1975, however, the smaller island continued to feel the adverse consequences of its double insularity. In December 1981, a lack of food supplies provoked a revolt against the government in São Tomé, which was accompanied by secessionist slogans. In 1995, a few years after the country’s democratic transition, Príncipe became an autonomous region. The island’s first regional government was elected in the same year. The central government’s failure to hold any local election in the years thereafter caused another popular protest in June 2006 that forced Príncipe’s regional government to step down.|$|R

This is informed by indications that the use of LDV (a) fills the gap left by the lack of formal public transport services in large parts of rural South Africa; and (b) provides an invaluable service to residents in remote rural villages. It was further observed that in various provinces and municipalities (including those in rural areas of the Limpopo Province) transport authorities are seeking ways of formalizing the use of LDV to carry passengers.

The reasons for the poor performance required an objective analysis. The main objective of this paper, therefore, was to identify and analyze the factors that hinder the full realization of Sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s tourism potential. Specifically, the study analyzed the following variables: location, accessibility, climate, attractions, infrastructure, facilities, services, {{and the image of}} the sub-region as an attractive tourist destination. The geographical scope of the study was confined to that part of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The study was based primarily on secondary data sources. These included the World Tourism Organization (WTO), World Travel and Tourism Council, United Nations World Tourism Barometer, and the Regional Tourism Organisation of Southern Africa (RETOSA). They all compile annual reports as well as world tourism rankings by number of visits, revenue generated and employment created. The major findings of the study were that the weak state of tourism in Sub-Saharan Africa was due to: poor and circuitous connectivity with the major tourist generating countries as well as within the subregion itself; inadequate and <b>poorly</b> <b>developed</b> tourism <b>infrastructure</b> and related facilities; widespread poverty; and a generally poor image.

Almost its entire produce is consumed in the domestic market {{and the country is}} neither an importer nor an exporter, except in a marginal sense. Despite being the world’s largest producer, the dairy sector is by and large in the primitive stage of development and modernization. Though India may boast of a 200 million cattle population, the average output of an Indian cow is only one seventh of its American counterpart. Indian breeds of cows are considered inferior in terms of productivity. Moreover, the sector is plagued with various other impediments like shortage of fodder, its poor quality, dismal transportation facilities and a <b>poorly</b> <b>developed</b> cold chain <b>infrastructure.</b> As a result, the supply side lacks in elasticity that is expected of it.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} factors which make non-immune {{pregnant}} women {{particularly vulnerable to}} falciparum malaria and examines the problems of adequately protecting them in relation to current control strategies. Women are most at risk in areas of high and continuous transmission, particularly during their first pregnancy, and also under conditions of unstable malaria which do not permit immunity to develop. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for pregnant women in holoendemic and hyperendemic areas in Africa and Papua New Guinea. Chloroquine is safe, but drug resistance problems are beginning to limit its utility. Distribution is a formidable problem in rural areas with a <b>poorly</b> <b>developed</b> health care <b>infrastructure,</b> and research studies reveal widespread ignorance and lack of motivation. In countries in which primary health care systems are fairly well developed, and where malaria transmission is relatively less intense, {{the emphasis is on}} early diagnosis and treatment of cases. The assumption is made that women and men have equal access to medical facilities. The preponderance of reported cases among adolescent and adult males in some areas has been attributed solely to the well-known greater occupational risks in some traditionally male activities. Two recent studies, however, suggest that underprivileged women, weighed down by domestic chores, do not readily attend clinics at some distance from home, and therefore are liable to be missed in passive surveillance. It is essential that services within the village should be strengthened, but there are problems in implementation. Lacunae in existing knowledge are discussed. malaria women control strategy...|$|R

The general objective {{of the study was}} assessment of the current extent and practices, benefits realized by banks, driving forces, opportunities and challenges for the adoption of e-banking service in Ethiopia. From this general objective, five specific issues were explored. An exploratory research design was employed to conduct this study. Both primary and secondary qualitative data were collected {{for the purpose of this}} study from the IT manager’s of each bank at the head office level and bank web sites respectively. The collected data was analyzed by using descriptive analysis such as tables and percentages. From an analysis of the collected data, the findings revealed that: balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, funds transfers, statement printing are among the major practice of e-banking among those banks that are providing the service to the customer. The different e-banking channels by which banks are using to provide these services to the customer are ATM card, debit card, credit card, salary card, visa card, master card, Internet banking and Mobile or SMS banking. Cost reduction, coverage of wide geographical area, customer satisfactions etc are among the benefits of adopting the system from the viewpoint of the bank. Among the different driving forces that initiate banks to adopt e-banking services: existence of high competition in the banking industry, desire to improve organizational performance, desire to reduce transaction cost, desire to cover wide geographical area, and desire to build organizational reputation are among others.
