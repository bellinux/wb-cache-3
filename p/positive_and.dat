30|$|One can {{see that}} both the Bayesian and the Decision Tree {{classifiers}} have presented good results, giving rise to very steep inflexions in the graph. This translates into achieving high values in TPR for low values in FPR.

5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix of <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative {{in the case of}} a global alignment, but must be both <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative, {{in the case of a}} local alignment.|$|E

30|$|Errors of S 3 {{come from}} false <b>positives</b> <b>and</b> false negatives. S 3 seeks to achieve higher {{performance}} than prior work by reducing false <b>positives</b> <b>and</b> false negatives. However, {{to choose the}} optimal threshold in the trade-off of false <b>positives</b> <b>and</b> false negatives, we seek less false negatives than false positives. This is because false positives identify normal data as sensitive, and thus cause over protection, while false negatives leave sensitive data unprotected, and cause more serious consequences, e.g., data exposed to attackers. In statistics, Recall can reflect the measure of false negatives and Precision reflects false positives. Therefore we seek higher recall value than precision value in this paper.|$|R

(The latter is because a particle with <b>positive</b> charge <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> mass responds to electric and magnetic fields {{in the same way as}} a particle with negative charge and negative mass.) That explains why holes can be treated in all situations as ordinary positively charged quasiparticles.|$|R

5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment of <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E

The remaining two interactions, the weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|E
