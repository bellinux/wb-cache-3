40|$|Introduction A {{complete}} design usually specifies {{a mechanical}} system {{in terms of}} component parts and assembly relationships. Each part has a fully defined nominal or ideal form and well defined material properties. Tolerances are used to <b>permit</b> <b>variations</b> in the form and properties of the components, and are used also to <b>permit</b> <b>variations</b> in the assembly relationships. Thus the geometry and material properties {{of the system and}} all of its pieces are fully defined (at least in principle). Henceforth we shall focus on geometry and, for reasons that will become evident, will not deal with materials despite their obvious importance. Mechanical systems specified in the manner just described meet functional specifications that appeared initially as design goals. The process of design {{can be thought of as}} 'generating the geometry' [...] . the breakdown into components with coarsely specified geometry, and then the detailed specification of the component forms and fitting relationships.

The experiments consistently revealed that adding helium, and thereby decreasing the water concentration at a fixed system pressure, increased the phenol conversion. In addition, experiments showed that lowering the water concentration using pure water as the solvent also increased the phenol conversion. The results suggest that dilution with helium (and perhaps other inert gases) may be a new way to control SCWO reaction rates...|$|E

Thrust augmentation ratios above a factor of 2 were measured. In these tests, the pulsed detonation device was run on approximately stoichiometric air-hydrogen mixtures, at a frequency of 20 Hz.

40|$|Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) has {{increasingly}} become the tool {{of choice for}} investigating the <b>permitted</b> <b>variation</b> of fundamental constants during the earliest epochs of the Universe. Here we present a BBN calculation that has been modified to permit changes in the QCD scale, Lambda_QCD. The primary effects of changing the QCD scale upon BBN are through the deuteron binding energy, B_D, and the neutron-proton mass difference, delta-m_np, which both play crucial roles in determining the primordial abundances. In this paper, we show how a simplified BBN calculation allows us to restrict the nuclear data we need to just B_D and delta m_np yet still gives useful results so that any variation in Lambda_QCD may be constrained via the corresponding shifts in B_D and delta-m_np by using the current estimates of the primordial deuterium abundance and helium mass fraction. The simplification predicts the helium- 4 and deuterium abundances to within 1 % and 50 % respectively {{when compared with the}} results of a standard BBN code. But Lambda_QCD also affects much of remaining required nuclear input so this method introduces a systematic error into the calculation and we find a degeneracy between B_D and delta-m_np. We show how increased understanding of the relationship of the pion mass and/or B_D to other nuclear parameters, such as the binding energy of tritium and the cross section of T + D -> He 4 + n, would yield constraints upon any change in B_D and delta-m_np at the 10 % level...|$|E
40|$|To {{the present}} time much of the {{hydrodynamic}} analysis of the locomotion of ciliated micro-organisms has concentrated on the localized interaction between the cilia and the fluid medium. In doing so most investigators have {{found it necessary to}} simplify the larger scale flow and to consider "infinite sheet models" in which the fluid flow solutions are purely harmonic and the wave properties invariant in the rectilinear coordinate parallel to the sheet. The resulting mean motion is purely unidirectional and thus the hydrodynamic solution greatly simplified. Since these "infinite sheet models" conveniently termed the "envelope" and "sub-layer" models are discussed in detail by Blake and Sleigh (1974 a, b) elsewhere in this volume further amplification is unnecessary. It is convenient, however, for our purposes to think of these as fluid/cilia interaction models describing the local interaction between the cilia and the fluid. The relative merits of the two types of model and criteria which describe their respective region of validity are discussed by Brennen (1974) and by Blake and Sleigh (1974 b). In the present paper we will discuss some of the characteristics of the flow around "finite" ciliated micro-organisms, pointing out along the way those effects not experienced in the infinite sheet models but which are important in evaluating, say, the propulsive velocity of a ciliated micro-organism. The only previous solution for a "finite" body to appear in the literature seems to be that of Lighthill (1952), later modified by Blake (1971 a) in which traveling surface waves on a sphere (to use the "envelope" model) are approximated by combining two spherical harmonic functions whose orders differ by one. But this solution is very restrictive in terms of the <b>permitted</b> <b>variation</b> of waveform and wave amplitude over the body and its extension to nonspheriodal bodies would involve prohibitive algebraic complexity...|$|E
40|$|With over 80 {{original}} publications on foliar sclereids, {{published in}} the last 30 years, Dr. T. Ananda Rao is a well qualified author for a compendium on the subject. The book consists of a general and a special part. The former includes a historical and methodological introduction, a major chapter on the morphological classification of {{the various types of}} sclereids and tracheoids and their distribution patterns, and sections on their taxonomic significance as well as their ontogeny and (presumed) functions. The special part is an ‘abstract review’ of literature records and original observations on 121 families of angiosperms, arranged according to the Takhtajan system. The book is richly illustrated with line drawings as well as numerous halftone plates. Especially the review by family makes this book a useful source of reference. I could not help being somewhat disappointed by the first chapters, in which the various types are defined and classified. A comparison of the illustrations and the fairly vague definitions in the text soon make it impossible for the reader to see the distinctions between, for instance, several of the 5 main types and 9 subtypes of the socalled polymorphic sclereids (all astrosclereids in the good old terminology of Tschirch, 1889). The author would have done us a real service if in a series of drawings the <b>permitted</b> <b>variation</b> range and defining characteristics of each type would have been unambiguously illustrated. Now the subtle differences between trichosclereids, zosterosclereids, and ophiuro-sclereids as illustrated in plate 3. 3 and defined on pp. 10 - 12 will elude most. With full respect for the view that some more terms are needed than the mere four which Tschirch introduced in his classification, I feel that Rao has gone too far to the other extreme by recognizing most types, {{at one time or another}} introduced by zealous authors who wished to make their mark on anatomical history by introducing a superfluous name for a sclereid type. The author himself is perhaps not entirely without blame: his ‘gnarliform sclereids’, elevated to the superrank of the sole ‘cacomorphic type’ seems to me as well described as “an astrosclereid with irregularly curved or curly branches. ” Do we need new terms for each aberrant type? In this respect I feel that an opportunity has been missed to clean up the confusing terminology in the literature even further by a really unambiguous and concise classification of types (of course with full recognition of intermediate forms). Another criticism is aimed at the publisher as much as the author: the number of uncorrected major printing errors exceeds all acceptable levels, and even makes reading of the general chapters difficult and irritating...|$|E
