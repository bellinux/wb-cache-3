Presenters included Sarah Calderon (Karma Films), Satu Elo (EAVE), Bernd Buder (Berlin International Film Festival), Roshanak Behesht Nedjad (Flying Moon), David Grumbach (French filmmaker), and Elma Tataragic (<b>Program</b> <b>Selector,</b> Sarajevo Film Festival).|$|E
50|$|OS/2 1.0 was {{announced}} in April 1987 and released in December. The original release is textmode-only, and a GUI was introduced with OS/2 1.1 about a year later. OS/2 features an API for controlling the video display (VIO) and handling keyboard and mouse events so that programmers writing for protected-mode need not call the BIOS or access hardware directly. In addition, development tools include {{a subset of the}} video and keyboard APIs as linkable libraries so that family mode programs are able to run under MS-DOS. A task-switcher named <b>Program</b> <b>Selector</b> is available through the Ctrl-Esc hotkey combination, allowing the user to select among multitasked text-mode sessions (or screen groups; each can run multiple programs).|$|E

We study this approach {{by means of}} a unifying framework for characterizing dierent logic programming semantics using level mappings (Hitzler and Wendt 200 x, Hitzler 2003), thereby supporting the claim that this framework is very exible and applicable to very diversely de ned semantics...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} {{is to provide a}} documentation for theMonitor program in the PISA framework [1, 2]. It can be used {{for those who want to}} (a) apply the existing Monitor program together with existing Variator and <b>Selector</b> <b>programs,</b> or to (b) add new <b>Selector</b> and/or Variator <b>programs</b> that are compatible with it. In order to properly understand the document, knowledge about the basic specification and background of PISA as described in [1] is necessary. The purpose of the Monitor is • to observe the communication between a Variator and Selector pro-gram in order to store information about the generated populations in text files, • to automatically invoke several optimization runs as an input to a sub-sequent statistical analysis, and • to control the Variator and <b>Selector</b> <b>programs.</b> In particular, the monitor initiates a number of R runs of a specific selector-variator pair with different seeds of the variator. Each run consists of a number of G generations, each one generating a population. The monitor writes a set of output files where each one is related to exactly one generation. The output file for generation x contains information about the populations after x generations for all runs. Following the concept described in [1], the Monitor is an independent program and the communication to the other entities (Variator and Selec-tor) is done via a shared file system. The Monitor writes the collected information into a set of human-readable files that can be used by other pro-grams for further processing...|$|R

BACKGROUND: ARITHMETIC-LOGIC UNIT (ALU) Arithmetic logic unit {{is the most important}} element of microprocessor which performs both math and logic functions. An ALU loads data from input registers, an external Control Unit then tells the ALU what operation to perform on that data, and then the ALU stores its result into an output register.

The program writes a record for each segment on a data file which contains the pertinent acquisition data. The weather data file can also be generated from a NASA supplied tape. The Segment Acquisition <b>Selector</b> <b>Program</b> (SACS) selects data from the segment reference file based upon data input manually and from a crop window file. It writes the extracted data to a data acquisition file and prints two summary reports. The POUT program reads from associated LACIE files and produces printed reports.

5000|$|During Belyayev's final {{studies at}} the Red banner Air Force Academy he had been interviewed and tested for {{possible}} inclusion in the space <b>program.</b> The <b>selectors</b> were impressed by his ability to withstand high g-Forces. Belyayev was sent to Air Squadron 661 4th IAD of the Black Sea Fleet. A month later he was appointed commander of the regiment's 241st squadron. By {{the time he was}} finally selected he had logged over 1,000 hours flight time in both piston and jet aircraft and had also completed approximately 40 parachute jumps.Belyayev reported for assignment at the newly formed TsPK (cosmonaut training centre) on 25 March 1960. At 34, he was the oldest candidate accepted into the program. As a major he was the highest ranking candidate and the only one to have seen active service in World War II. Because of his senior rank, Belyayev became the first commander of the cosmonaut corps. Belyayev and Vladimir Komarov (2 years Belyayev's junior) were the only candidates to have Air Force Academy training. Yuri Gagarin nicknamed the two senior officers [...] "The Professors"In August Belyayev fractured his lower leg just above the ankle in parachute training, an accident that delayed his progress by approximately 12 months and excluded him from any early space flights. Due to the severity of the injury it seemed unlikely that Belyayev would be re-admitted to the program, but he worked constantly to recover and regain his fitness. After a year's absence he passed his medical and returned to training.|$|R

After the 1924 season, Little left Michigan to accept the head coach and athletic director positions at Wisconsin, returning athletic director Yost to the head coaching position.

40|$|Prediction of {{efficient}} oligonucleotides for RNA interference {{presents a}} serious challenge, {{especially for the}} development of genome-wide RNAi libraries which encounter difficulties and limitations due to ambiguities in the results and the requirement for significant computational resources. Here we present a fast and practical algorithm for shRNA design based on the thermodynamic parameters. In order to identify shRNA and siRNA features universally associated with high silencing efficiency, we analyzed structure-activity relationships in thousands of individual RNAi experiments from publicly available databases (ftp://ftp. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pub/shabalin/​siRNA/si_shRNA_selector/). Using this statistical analysis, we found free energy ranges for the terminal duplex asymmetry and for fully paired duplex stability, such that shRNAs or siRNAs falling in both ranges have a high probability of being efficient. When combined, these two parameters yield a ~ 72 % success rate on shRNAs from the siRecords database, with the target RNA levels reduced to below 20 % of the control. Two other parameters correlate well with silencing efficiency: the stability of target RNA and the antisense strand secondary structure. Both parameters also correlate with the short RNA duplex stability; as a consequence, adding these parameters to our prediction scheme did not substantially improve classification accuracy. To test the validity of our predictions, we designed 83 shRNAs with optimal terminal asymmetry, and experimentally verified that small shifts in duplex stability strongly affected silencing efficiency. We showed that shRNAs with short fully paired stems could be successfully selected by optimizing only two parameters: terminal duplex asymmetry and duplex stability of the hypothetical cleavage product, which also relates to the specificity of mRNA target recognition. Our approach performs {{at the level of the}} best currently utilized algorithms that take into account prediction of the secondary structure of the target and antisense RNAs, but at significantly lower computational costs. Based on this study, we created the si-shRNA <b>Selector</b> <b>program</b> that predicts both highly efficient shRNAs and functional siRNAs (ftp://ftp. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pub/shabalin/​siRNA/si_shRNA_selector/).
