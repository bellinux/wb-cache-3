25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson was {{particularly}} {{pleased with the}} episode showing a different side of Scully and said, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great idea. I personally was going through a dark period at the time, and I wanted to explore Scully's dark side. For some reason, Glen and Jim were on the same wavelength that week. Afterward, a lot of <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that on that episode I was so 'unlike' Scully or that 'it showed my range'. I told them I thought they were wrong. I don't think that what I did here was out of character for Scully. The only thing different is that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship". Morgan obliged and wrote a scene where Scully enjoys a passionate night with Jerse. This was later removed from the script by series creator Chris Carter, the only time in Glen Morgan's tenure on the show where a scene of his was removed by Carter. Morgan later noted [...] "I think Chris thought that I was monkeying around with him, but I really wasn't." ...|$|E

5|$|From 1998, I {{started coming}} across <b>people</b> who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{they had seen}} people change into a {{non-human}} form. It's an age-old phenomenon known as shape-shifting. The basic form is like a scaly humanoid, with reptilian rather than humanoid eyes.|$|R
2500|$|In 1989, Haggard {{recorded}} a song, [...] "Me and Crippled Soldiers Give a Damn," [...] {{in response to}} the Supreme Court's decision not to allow banning flag burning, considering it to be [...] "speech" [...] and therefore protected under the First Amendment. After CBS Records Nashville avoided releasing the song, Haggard bought {{his way out of the}} contract and signed with Curb Records, which was willing to release the song. Haggard commented about the situation, [...] "I've never been a guy that can do what <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me....</b> It's always been my nature to fight the system." ...|$|E
2500|$|In sheer power, {{her high}} notes were {{sometimes}} {{compared to those}} of the Broadway belter Ethel Merman. However Nilsson claims her [...] "explosive" [...] high notes that were her biggest asset on-stage [...] "have not been recorded like they should have been" [...] in the studio. She later lamented: [...] "It always made me a little bit sad when I heard my own recordings. And many <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I sang much better in person than I do on the recordings! That didn't flatter me at all, because I know what's going to be left when I am no longer singing". Once urged to follow Nilsson in the same role at the Metropolitan Opera, the eminent soprano Leonie Rysanek refused.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbis have {{discussed}} the precise location of the rock. David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra was convinced that “under the dome on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt is {{the location of the}} Foundation Stone”. The Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon, c.1180, The Travels of Benjamin of Tudela and The Travels of the Student of the Ramban all equally state that [...] "on the Temple Mount stands a beautiful sanctuary which an Arab king built long ago, over the place of the Temple sanctuary and courtyard”. Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura, who wrote a letter from Jerusalem in 1488, says that “I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the Ark of the Covenant was placed, and many <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it is under a tall and beautiful dome which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct".|$|E
60|$|And I {{related to}} {{him what the}} doctor and the vicar and the other <b>people</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and {{explained}} to him how my life depended upon my taking brandy and blankets and sunshades and plenty of warm clothing with me.|$|R

5000|$|Critics later chastised Messiaen for {{beginning}} the action after Francis’s conversion. The composer defended his choice {{in an interview with}} Claude Samuel: [...] "Some <b>people</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> 'There's no sin in your work.' But I myself feel sin isn't interesting, dirt isn't interesting. I prefer flowers. I left out sin." ...|$|R

5000|$|In February 2017, Bell {{announced}} that he would contest the March 2017 Assembly Election as an Independent. He said: [...] "I shone a light on the cash for ash scandal and as a result my party suspended me. Everywhere I have gone not a single person has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I was wrong, in fact <b>people</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I was not wrong.

6000|$|... "I {{told you}} that I should do just what the wise <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> I asked papa, {{and he said that}} it would be better. So the lawyers were driven out of their minds, and the milliners out of their bodies, and the thing was done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was not a}} row, {{but there}} was enough of a quarrel to be visible and audible. He walked about and talked loud to the poor woman. Of course it was my own fault.

6000|$|... "That is {{at least}} five times as much as I expected, Hilda. I have heard all sorts of {{marvelous}} stories of the power of your old woman.

6000|$|... "It {{was one of}} your <b>people</b> who <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> They {{said the}} man was short of temper. So are {{a good many of}} us; and, it seems, he had some reason. Still, there's rather more against Mrs. Heaton than that she's not living with her own husband. Knowing you meant to ask her here, I made inquiries." ...|$|R

50|$|When you {{get back}} into the ancient world, you find this {{recurring}} theme of a union between a non-human race and humans—creating a hybrid race.From 1998, I started coming across <b>people</b> who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> they had seen people change into a non-human form.

6000|$|He {{had fallen}} asleep then and after his {{recovery}} he had not alluded to the matter again. I had forgotten it, but I recalled it now as I sat on the steps among the geraniums that June evening. I liked to think of Margaret ... the lovely girl who had died so long ago, taking her lover's heart {{with her to the}} grave. She had been a sister of my grandfather, and <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I resembled her slightly. Perhaps that was why old Mr. Lawrence had always made such a pet of me.|$|E
6000|$|From {{this point}} we could easily see the wide gape of the Rembwe, the {{south-eastern}} influent, or rather fork, of the Gaboon, which rises in the south-western versant of some meridional chain, and which I was assured can be ascended in three tides. The <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> when too late of a great cavity or sink, which they called Wonga-Wonga; Bowdich represents {{it to be an}} [...] "uninhabited savannah of three days' extent, between Empoöngwa and Adjoomba (Mayumba). I saw nothing of the glittering diamond mountains, lying eastward of Wonga-Wonga, concerning which the old traveller was compelled to admit that, [...] "when there was no moon, a pale but distinct light was invariably reflected from a mountain in that quarter, and from no other." [...] It has now died out--this superstition, which corresponds with the carbuncle of Hoy and others of our Scoto-Scandinavian islands.|$|E
5000|$|Missy BK’s {{mother is}} an {{important}} inspiration for her philanthropy. According to Missy, “My mother taught me, I don’t {{have to wait until}} I have millions to start helping <b>people,</b> she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it’s not how much I give but it’s the love that I put into what I give that matters and a little something given to someone could {{make a big difference in}} their lives.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is {{something}} that I had set my heart on, though I hardly like to propose it on so short an acquaintance; but from what <b>people</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> I thought that you and I might keep house together comfortably, if you would only agree to try. I have several fields belonging to me, {{and if they are}} kept well watered they bear wonderful crops.' ...|$|R
500|$|We are {{sometimes}} {{up against a}} flat refusal to apply this law rigidly. One <b>People's</b> Judge <b>told</b> <b>me</b> flatly that he could never bring himself to throw someone in jail for stealing four ears. What we're up against here is a deep prejudice, imbibed with their mother's milk... a mistaken belief {{that people should be}} tried in accordance not with the Party's political guidelines but with considerations of [...] "higher justice".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was well}} nigh my wits' end {{as to what}} to do for a living, and had just spent my last shilling, when I met an English captain, who told me that across at Gottenburg there were a good many Irish and Scotchmen who had, like myself, been in trouble at home. He gave me a passage across, and took me to the house of a man he knew. Of course, it was no use my trying to doctor people, when they could not tell me what was the matter with them, and I worked at one thing and another, doing {{anything}} I could turn my hands to, for four or five months. That is how I got to pick up Swedish. Then some <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that Russia was a place where a doctor might get on, for that they had got no doctors for their army who knew anything of surgery, and the czar was always ready to take on foreigners who could teach them anything. I had got my diploma with me, and some of my friends came forward and subscribed enough to rig me out in clothes and pay my passage. What was better, one of them happened to have made the acquaintance of Le Ford, who was, as you may have heard, the czar's most intimate friend.|$|E
60|$|Another {{and smaller}} species of Furnarius (F. cunicularius), resembles the oven-bird {{in the general}} reddish tint of its plumage, in a {{peculiar}} shrill reiterated cry, and in an odd manner of running by starts. From its affinity, the Spaniards call it Casarita (or little housebuilder), although its nidification is quite different. The Casarita builds its nest {{at the bottom of}} a narrow cylindrical hole, which is said to extend horizontally to nearly six feet under ground. Several of the country <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> that when boys, they had attempted to dig out the nest, but had scarcely ever succeeded in getting to the end of the passage. The bird chooses any low bank of firm sandy soil by the side of a road or stream. Here (at Bahia Blanca) the walls round the houses are built of hardened mud, and I noticed that one, which enclosed a courtyard where I lodged, was bored through by round holes in a score of places. On asking the owner the cause of this, he bitterly complained of the little casarita, several of which I afterwards observed at work. It is rather curious to find how incapable these birds must be of acquiring any notion of thickness, for although they were constantly flitting over the low wall, they continued vainly to bore through it, thinking it an excellent bank for their nests. I do not doubt that each bird, as often as it came to daylight on the opposite side, was greatly surprised at the marvellous fact.|$|E
6000|$|During my stay at Rurúkan, {{my curiosity}} was {{satisfied}} by experiencing a pretty sharp earthquake-shock. On {{the evening of}} June 29th, at a quarter after eight, as I was sitting reading, the house began shaking with a very gentle, but rapidly increasing motion. I sat still enjoying the novel sensation for some seconds; but in {{less than half a}} minute it became strong enough to shake me in my chair, and to make the house visibly rock about, and creak and crack as if it would fall to pieces. Then began a cry throughout the village of [...] "Tana goyang! tana goyang!" [...] (Earthquake! earthquake!) Everybody rushed out of their houses--women screamed and children cried--and I thought it prudent to go out too. On getting up, I found my head giddy and my steps unsteady, and could hardly walk without falling. The shock continued about a minute, during which time I felt as if I had been turned round and round, and was almost seasick. Going into the house again, I found a lamp and a bottle of arrack upset. The tumbler which formed the lamp had been thrown out of the saucer in which it had stood. The shock appeared to be nearly vertical, rapid, vibratory, and jerking. It was sufficient, I have no doubt, to have thrown down brick, chimneys, walls, and church towers; but as the houses here are all low, and strongly framed of timber, it is impossible for them to be much injured, except by a shock that would utterly destroy a European city. The <b>people</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was ten years since they had had a stronger shock than this, at which time many houses were thrown down and some people killed.|$|E
5000|$|Of the {{inspiration}} for her songs, Ungerleider has said [...] "A lot of that stuff comes from other <b>people</b> who have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> things. Some of it's totally made up". She also says that her Western Canadian upbringing has inspired some of her lyrics.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2011, Ford {{promised to}} release a [...] "real {{comeback}} album" [...] {{later in the year}} with drummer Chuck Spradlin, saying that 2009's nu metal-inspired Wicked Wonderland, {{was too much of a}} collective project with ex-husband Jim Gillette. [...] "A lot of <b>people</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that they want a real Lita Ford album, and I know what they mean. They are going to get it", she was quoted as saying at the time.|$|R
5000|$|... "Many <b>people</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> [...] "1000 Miles Away" [...] {{is their}} {{favourite}} Gurus song and it's also among my top ten. There are references to airports and flying but I {{was writing about}} emotional distance rather than physical travel. [...] "I Think You Know" [...] was another Punishment Song. We liked to keep bashing out the last two chords {{for a couple of}} minutes, Buzzcocks-style, a bit like a punk mantra. Punishment never felt so good." [...] Dave Faulkner ...|$|R
