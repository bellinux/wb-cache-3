5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on <b>population</b> <b>growth.</b> Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect <b>population</b> <b>growth,</b> including the tendency for <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

5000|$|The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model {{describes}} the basic population dynamics under predation. The solution to these equations {{in the simple}} one-predator species, one-prey species model is a stable linked oscillation of population levels for both predator and prey. However, when time lags between respective <b>population</b> <b>growths</b> are modeled, these oscillations will tend to amplify, eventually leading to extinction of both species. The Ricker model exemplifies this dynamic.|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of mineral accumulation in plants is genetically complex, with several genetic loci {{involved in the}} control of one mineral and loci affecting the accumulation of different minerals. To investigate the role of growth medium and organ type on the genetics of mineral accumulation, two existing (Ler×Kond, Ler×An- 1) and one new (Ler×Eri- 1) Arabidopsis thaliana Recombinant Inbred Line populations were raised on soil and hydroponics as substrates. Seeds, roots, and/or rosettes were sampled for the determination of their Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P or Zn concentrations. For seeds only, the concentration of phytate (IP 6), a strong chelator of seed minerals, was determined. Correlations between minerals/IP 6, <b>populations,</b> <b>growth</b> conditions, and organs were determined and mineral/IP 6 concentration data were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits. A striking difference was found between QTLs identified for soil-grown versus hydroponics-grown populations and between QTLs identified for different plant organs. Three common QTLs were identified for several <b>populations,</b> <b>growth</b> conditions, and organs, one of which corresponded to the ERECTA locus, variation of which has a strong effect on plant morphology...|$|R

5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid <b>population</b> <b>growth.</b> These early phases of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E
