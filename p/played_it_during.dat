Segments of the children's educational TV show, Sesame Street, showing Keola Beamer and Mr. Snuffalupagus, one of the large puppet characters, playing `ohe hano ihu brought the instrument to national attention. Winona Beamer, Keola Beamer's mother, a noted kumu hula, also taught the use of the `ohe hano ihu in hula. Her hānai daughter, Maile Beamer Loo, continues to preserve and teach that legacy, and document such important aspects of Hawaiian musical and performing heritage through the Hula Preservation Society.|$|E

When discussing his choice of material for the tour, Harrison's first since his 1974 North American tour, he told Billboard that the song was an obvious inclusion, given that the Beatles had <b>played</b> <b>it</b> <b>during</b> their only visit to Japan, in 1966. On this 1991 live version, in Inglis' description, Clapton's [...] "looping guitar solos" [...] complement Harrison's vocal, which is more prominent than on the Beatles' original and sung {{in the style of}} Dylan. In November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, Clapton performed the song at the Concert for George, held at London's Royal Albert Hall.|$|E
