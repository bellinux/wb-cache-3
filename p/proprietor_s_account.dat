Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account,</b> however, has three serious problems: i) it cannot allow {{necessarily}} coextensive properties to differ in whether they are intrinsic; ii) it falsely classifies non-qualitative properties like being Obama as non-intrinsic; and iii) it is incompatible with a number of metaphysical theories that posit irreducibly non-categorical properties. I argue that, {{as a result of these}} problems, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> should be rejected and replaced with an alternative account, which also analyses intrinsicality in terms of perfect naturalness, but which avoids these problems...|$|R

40|$|Galen Strawson has {{articulated}} {{a spectrum}} of 2 ̆ 7 temporal temperaments 2 ̆ 7 populated at one end by 2 ̆ 7 Diachronics, 2 ̆ 7 who experience their selves (understood as a 2 ̆ 7 present mental entity 2 ̆ 7) as persisting across time, and {{at the other end}} by 2 ̆ 7 Episodics 2 ̆ 7, who lack this sense of temporal extension. Strawson provides lucid descriptions of Episodic self-experience, and further argues that nothing normatively significant depends upon Diachronicity. Thus, neither temperament is inherently preferable. However, this last claim requires a non-reductive phenomenology of Diachronicity that Strawson does not supply. I offer Kierkegaard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> of 2 ̆ 7 contemporaneity 2 ̆ 7 as a candidate for this missing phenomenology of Diachronic self-experience. Kierkegaard offers a compelling description of Diachronic self-experience that offers more parsimonious explanations for certain puzzling features of Episodicity than Strawson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> does. Yet Kierkegaard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> is irreducibly normative in character; if Strawsonians reject this account of Diachronicity, they must either provide another, normatively-neutral one, or abandon neutrality between Episodicity and Diachronicity...|$|R

Linear dynamic regression and vector autoregression models are employed to estimate the relationships during the period from 1986 to 2011. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the current and lagged private saving rate and foreign current account for East Asian economies have played a vital role in affecting the U. <b>S.</b> current <b>account.</b> Additionally, using Granger causality tests and variance decompositions, the change of the productivity growth and foreign domestic demand are determined to influence significantly the change of the U. <b>S.</b> current <b>account.</b> To summarize, the empirical relationship between the U. <b>S.</b> current <b>account</b> deficit and its determinants is sensitive to alternative regression models and specifications.

Next, the ethics requirements necessary for certification after successfully completing the examinations were determined. Finally, the Continuing Professional Education (CPE) (Continuing Professional Development (CPD)) requirements necessary to maintain the certifications were examined. The results indicate that there is little emphasis on ethics in the qualifications, testing, and continuing education of certified accountants in the United States...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I explore {{questions}} related to {{the unity of the}} conscious self over time. To start, I provide philosophical background to the mind in the British empiricist tradition and outline Hume 2 ̆ 7 s various arguments against the continuous self. As a potential response to Hume, I offer David Woodruff-Smith 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> of the modality of self-consciousness and then draw a parallel to Joseph Levine 2 ̆ 7 s conscious experience 2 ̆ 2 E 2 ̆ 2. Differing from these authors, I explore Sven Bernecker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> of first-person extroversive memories and the reidentification question relevant to personal identity. Here, I defend John Locke 2 ̆ 7 s answer that the same consciousness constitutes the same person over time. In order to do this, I distinguish between my ongoing conscious state EV and my memory report EVχ. I analyze EVχ through an internalist perspective by subjecting it to Bernecker 2 ̆ 7 s five conditions for a first-person extroversive memory. I claim that I avoid the circularity objection plaguing Locke 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> only if this internalist reflection results in the designation of EVχ as a genuine memory report. The origins of my memory EVχ lies in the external world impressions that my same, continuing conscious state EV received at the time of memory formation. Taking Locke 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> further, I claim if EV is conscious and in reception of impressions that comprise potential memories, there are a substantial number of these potential memories that could later become actualized. Genuine or actual memories of the past, such as report EVχ, are clear references to my same consciousness EV. To illustrate my claims, I provide an analogy and respond to objections. I argue that if my internalist attempts succeed, then I have defended Locke 2 ̆ 7 s answer to the reidentification question...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} nature of {{scientific}} realism. I begin by considering the anomalous fact that Bas van Fraassen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> of scientific realism is strikingly similar to Arthur Fine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>account</b> of scientific non-realism. To resolve this puzzle, I demonstrate how the two theorists understand {{the nature of}} truth and its connection to ontology, and how that informs their conception of the realism debate. I then argue that the debate is much better captured by the theory of truthmaking, and not by any particular theory of truth. To be a scientific realist is to adopt a realism-relevant account of what makes true the scientific theories one accepts. The truthmaking approach restores realism 2 ̆ 7 s metaphysical core-distancing itself from linguistic conceptions of the debate-and thereby offers a better characterization of what is at stake in the question of scientific realism...|$|R

40|$|An in‡uential {{explanation}} for the recent rise in the U. <b>S.</b> current <b>account</b> de…cit is the boom in U. S. productivity. As U.
