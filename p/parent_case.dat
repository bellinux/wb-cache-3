The use of the [...]338 cartridge case with its capability to operate at high chamber pressures resulted in magnum case capable of producing high muzzle velocities.|$|E
2500|$|The commercially {{successful}} [...]338 Lapua Magnum cartridge has {{functioned as}} the <b>parent</b> <b>case</b> for the [...]300 Lapua Magnum, {{which is essentially}} a necked-down version of the [...]338 Lapua Magnum. The [...]338 cartridge case was used for this since it has the capability to operate with high chamber pressures which, combined with smaller and hence lighter bullets result in very high muzzle velocities.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]270 Winchester (or 6.8×64mm) was {{developed}} by Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1923 and unveiled in 1925 as a chambering for their bolt-action Model 54. The cartridge is a necked down [...]30-03, {{which is the same}} length as the [...]280 Remington, both of which are longer than the [...]30-06 Springfield. The [...]270, [...]280, and [...]30-06 were all derived from the [...]30-03 <b>parent</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The [...]460 Weatherby Magnum is a belted, bottlenecked rifle cartridge, {{developed}} by Roy Weatherby in 1957. The cartridge {{is based on}} the [...]378 Weatherby Magnum necked up to accept the [...] bullet. The original [...]378 Weatherby Magnum <b>parent</b> <b>case</b> was inspired by the [...]416 Rigby. The [...]460 Weatherby Magnum was designed as an African dangerous game rifle cartridge for the hunting of heavy, thick skinned dangerous game.|$|E
2500|$|While it {{has been}} {{occasionally}} factory chambered in various rifles, the chief reason for its survival has always been wildcatting. Wildcats are not governed by C.I.P. or SAAMI rules so wildcatters can capitalize on achievable high operating pressures. With the [...]284 Winchester as the <b>parent</b> <b>case</b> wildcatters have created 6mm-284, 6.5mm-284, [...]284 Shehane, [...]30-284, [...]338-284,35-284, [...]450 Bushmaster and the [...]375-284 variants and the [...]475 Wildey Magnum pistol cartridge.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]338 Lapua Magnum case is {{also used}} as the <b>parent</b> <b>case</b> {{for a host of}} {{modified}} variants that are not officially registered with or sanctioned by C.I.P. or its American equivalent, SAAMI. Such cartridges which use commercial factory cases are generally known as wildcats. By changing the shape of standard factory cases (decreasing case taper and/or changing the shoulder geometry) the wildcatter generally increases the case capacity of the factory parent cartridge case, allowing more propellant to be used to generate higher velocities. Besides changing the shape and internal volume of the parent cartridge case, wildcatters also can change the original calibre. A reason to change the original calibre can be to comply with a minimal permitted calibre or bullet weight for the legal hunting of certain species of game. Because the [...]338 Lapua offers a large and exceptionally sturdy, pressure resistant cartridge case that can be relatively easily reloaded and hence be reused several times it has become quite popular amongst wildcatters. With the [...]338 Lapua Magnum as the <b>parent</b> <b>case</b> wildcatters have created 7mm (7mm Allen Magnum, 7mm Katzmeier, 7mm Fatso), [...]30 (.30-338 Lapua (Triebel), [...]30 Wolf, 300 Allen Express), 8mm (8mm-338 Lapua (Triebel), LM-101), [...]338 (.338 Yogi, LM-105), [...]343 (.343 Lapua Magnum LM-107), 9.3mm (9,3-338 Lapua Magnum (Triebel)), [...]375 (9.5×70 ELR) and [...]50 calibre (.510 Whisper) variants. The current (2008) benchrest [...] 5-shot group world record holder Tom Sarver used a [...]300 Hulk wildcat cartridge, which is basically a necked-down, blown out, shortened [...]338 Lapua Magnum variant, to achieve a [...] diameter 5-shot group on 7 July 2007.|$|E

40|$|Family {{reports are}} {{critical}} documents in family <b>parenting</b> <b>cases.</b> They {{are often the}} only social science information available to the judge, the lawyers and the parties. They are influential in judicial decision-making and out-of-court negotiations. Despite their importance {{there has been little}} direct research about the quality and impact of family reports in Australia. It is also known that family violence is a common occurrence in <b>parenting</b> <b>cases</b> that progress to ligation, and therefore the kinds of cases in which family reports are ordered, but again this is an under-researched issue. This article presents foundational information about the existing research to identify what is known about family reports and family violence. It examines the legislative framework for family report writing and analyses the official guidelines and documents and informal information that provide context to this work. It considers what family report writers need to know and understand about family violence to write reports that deal appropriately with family violence and make safe recommendations. Australian and international research on family violence, its impact on parenting, its role in family law proceedings and its influence in family report writing is reviewed. The article concludes that Australian research in this area is required to contribute to improved practices in family reports...|$|R
