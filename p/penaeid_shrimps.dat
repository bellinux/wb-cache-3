2500|$|The {{crevalle jack}} is a {{powerful}} predatory fish which predominantly takes other small fishes as prey at all stages of its life, with various invertebrates generally being of secondary importance to its diet. Several studies conducted on the species' diet over its range have found other aspects of its diet vary widely, including the specific types of prey the species takes and the change in diet with age. The most detailed of these studies was conducted in the Southern USA, which showed the species diet comprised between 74% and 94% [...] fish. The remainder of the diet was various prawns, shrimps, crabs, molluscs and stomatopods. The types of fish taken varied throughout the range, with members of Clupeidae, Sparidae, Carangidae and Trichiuridae all taken in variable amounts, usually with members of one family dominating the local diet. The percentage of various invertebrates also was highly variable, with <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> portunid crabs, stomatopods and squid being of importance to different populations. The study also indicated young crevalle jack predominantly take clupeids, adding sparids and later carangids to their diets as they grow larger. The larger individuals also took much higher amounts of invertebrates, and also small quantities of seagrass, indicating larger fish are more opportunistic. This general change in diet with age also seems spatially variable, with young crevalle jack in both Maryland and Puerto Rico consuming almost exclusively crustaceans, including shrimps, crabs (and juvenile tarpon) in Maryland and harpacticoid copepods in Puerto Rico before moving to fish-dominated diets later in life. Research in Ghana shows a pattern somewhat intermediate to the previous two locations; adults take larger fish, predominantly Engraulis guineensis and Sardinella eba, while juvenile fish take smaller fishes such as Epiplatys sexfasciatus or juvenile caridian and <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimps.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{virus has}} a wide host range. While shrimp can survive with the virus for {{extended}} periods of time, factors like stress can cause the outbreak of WSS. The disease is highly virulent and leads to mortality rates of 100% within days {{in the case of}} cultured <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimps.</b> Most of the cultured <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimps</b> (Penaeus monodon, Marsupenaeus japonicus, Litopenaeus vannamei, and Fenneropenaeus indicus) are natural hosts of the virus. Several non-penaeid shrimps were also found to be severely infected during experimental challenges. Many crustaceans like crabs (Scylla spp., Portunus spp.), spiny lobsters (Panulirus spp.), crayfish (Astacus spp., Cherax spp.) and freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium spp.) are reported to be infected with variable severities depending on the life stage of the host and presence of external stressors (temperature, salinity, bacterial diseases, pollutants).|$|E

50|$|A {{characteristic}} of the family is the broad host range susceptible to infection by vibrios. Pathogens of man, other than V. cholerae, include V. parahemolyticus, a cause of gastroenteritis and V. vulnificus {{that can lead to}} acute and fatal septicaemia. Other species of Vibrionaceae are associated with disease {{in a wide variety of}} finfish, one of the most notable and commonly occurring pathogens being Vibrio anguillarum, the cause of septicaemia in farmed salmonids such as Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout. Species such as V. tubiashii cause disease in larval stages of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) while V. harveyi causes luminous vibriosis in <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimps</b> (prawns). The extent of the host range is seen with species such as V. mediterranei and V. coralliilyticus, which can infect zooxanthellae, the plant symbionts of coral. These species of Vibrio are thought to be a cause of coral bleaching.|$|E
40|$|Although dietary {{phospholipids}} (PL) {{and particularly}} phosphatidylcholine (PC) {{have been found}} to enhance growth and survival in <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> precise requirements have yet to be established.

50|$|The bigeye {{trevally}} is a fast-swimming predatory {{species that}} has had several studies determine its diet in various places throughout its distribution. As mentioned above, the species is mostly inactive during the day, and feeds at dusk and through the night. The large stationary aggregations break off as the fish move off to hunt in small groups or individually. The species predominantly takes small fish as prey, however supplements its diet with a varied array of invertebrates. These include crustaceans such as shrimps, decapods, copepods and stomatopods, cephalopods, gastropods, jellyfish, sponges and even species of open ocean sea-skater insects. Bigeye trevally {{were found to be}} the primary fish predators of these sea-skates, and took far more of these than any other species of carangid. Evidence from South African estuaries indicates there is a shift in the species diet as it grows. Young fish below 200 mm in length take mostly the juveniles of other fish species but still have a significant intake of <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> while fish larger than this take small fish nearly exclusively. The larger fish on reefs tend to move between these reefs regularly, which is thought to be due to prey availability. Bigeye trevally are also an important prey for larger species, ranging from sharks and larger species of carangid to sea lions and various birds.|$|E
50|$|Selection {{for growth}} in <b>Penaeid</b> <b>shrimps</b> yielded {{successful}} results. A selective breeding program for Litopenaeus stylirostris saw an 18% increase in growth after the fourth generation and 21% growth after the fifth generation. Marsupenaeus japonicas showed a 10.7% increase in growth {{after the first}} generation. Argue et al. (2002) conducted a selective breeding program on the Pacific White Shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei at The Oceanic Institute, Waimanalo, USA from 1995 to 1998. They reported significant responses to selection compared to the unselected control shrimps. After one generation, a 21% increase was observed in growth and 18.4% increase in survival to TSV. The Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV) causes mortalities of 70% or more in shrimps. C.I. Oceanos S.A. in Colombia selected {{the survivors of the}} disease from infected ponds and used them as parents for the next generation. They achieved satisfying results in two or three generations wherein survival rates approached levels before the outbreak of the disease. The resulting heavy losses (up to 90%) caused by Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) caused a number of shrimp farming industries started to selectively breed shrimps resistant to this disease. Successful outcomes led to development of Super Shrimp, a selected line of L. stylirostris that is resistant to IHHNV infection. Tang et al. (2000) confirmed this by showing no mortalities in IHHNV- challenged Super Shrimp post larvae and juveniles.|$|E

Vibrio harveyi is a luminous gram-negative marine bacterium that is widely distributed in the marine environment (23, 24).

40|$|The {{cultivation}} of penaeid shrimp is a worldwide economic activity {{which has the}} potential to contribute to increasing shrimp production. However, <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimps</b> are susceptible to bacterial and viral diseases, and may thus cause significant losses to the aquaculture industry. In view of this, it is imperative to understand the immune response of shrimp against pathogens as this could help in devising efficient strategies to control, and eventually eradicate, shrimp diseases. At present, a considerable number of research studies on the identification and characterization of antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs) in <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimps.</b> Such research activities will contribute to finding solutions to shrimp diseases. AMPs are widespread in animals and plants, involved in their innate immunity, and considered as the front liners of host defense against pathogens.

Data collected from 10, 206 tows during 5, 197 sea days of observations were analyzed by geographical area and target species. The majority of tows (~ 70 %) sampled were off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Based on total hours towed, the highest concentrated effort occurred off South Texas and southwestern Florida.
