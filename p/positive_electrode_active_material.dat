The core-shell materials were fabricated with a continuous co-precipitation process, which created an Al-poor core and an Al-rich shell during the nucleation and particle growth stages, respectively. The Al-rich shell became α-Ni(OH) 2 after electrical activation and remained intact through the cycling. Pouch cells with the high-capacity β-α core-shell positive electrode material show higher charge acceptances and discharge capacities at 0. 1 C, 0. 2 C, 0. 5 C, and 1 C, improved self-discharge performances, and reduced internal and surface charge-transfer resistances, at both room temperature and − 10 °C when compared to those with the standard positive electrode material. While the high capacity of the core-shell material {{can be attributed to}} the α phase with a multi-electron transfer capability, the improvement in high-rate capability (lower resistance) is caused by the unique surface morphology and abundant interface sites at the β-α grain boundaries. Gravimetric energy densities of pouch cells made with the high-capacity and standard positive materials are 127 and 110 Wh·kg− 1, respectively.

The electrodes of these batteries contain large amounts of nickel, cobalt and rare earth metals. Recovery of these metals is economically and environmentally beneficial as it mines an easily accessible source of raw material. Recovery should be performed using a method which minimizes the use of energy and chemicals. One way to perform the recovery is to selectively dissolve electrode materials during hydrochemical processing. In the case of NiMH batteries, the <b>positive</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>active</b> <b>material,</b> nickel hydroxide, can be dissolved without dissolving the electrode backing material (usually nickel metal).

This work shows that rapid dissolution of the active material on the positive electrode can be achieved at a low temperature and a relatively low acid concentration (pH 0. 5 – 1. 5) whilst leaving the major part of the nickel metal undissolved. This is possible with all three tested minerals: acids nitric, sulphuric and hydrochloric. The speed of dissolution is mostly affected by the pH and only slightly affected by the type of acid.

30|$|Nickel {{hydroxide}} (Ni(OH) 2), {{as one of}} {{the most}} important transition metal hydroxides, has received increasing attention due to its extensive applications, especially as a <b>positive</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>active</b> <b>material,</b> in alkaline rechargeable Ni-based batteries [16]. It has been reported that the capacity of the positive electrode could be significantly increased when nanophase Ni(OH) 2 was added to micrometer-size spherical Ni(OH) 2 [17, 18]. Further efforts have focused on searching for new synthetic methods of Ni(OH) 2 nanocrystals with high quality and various exciting morphologies. 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D nanostructures of Ni(OH) 2, including nanorods [19], nanoribbons [20], nanotubes [21], nanosheets [22], and superstructures patterns [23 – 28], have been fabricated successfully by a variety of methods. Nickel oxide (NiO) is a very prosperous inorganic material which was widely applied in the fields of smart window, electrochemical supercapacitor, battery cathodes, catalyst, etc. [29 – 32]. NiO can be conveniently prepared by thermal decomposition of its precursors [33]. By contrast, there are only limited reports concerning the synthesis of Ni(OH) 2 and NiO hollow architectures and their interesting properties. For example, Wang’s group synthesized hollow architectures of Ni(OH) 2 with unusual form and hierarchical structures by using styrene-acrylic acid copolymer (PSA) latex particles as the templates [23]. Hierarchically porous β-Ni(OH) 2 microspheres constructed with nanoflakes were recently prepared with the help of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as the basic source, exhibiting small blue shift compared with the bulk counterpart [24]. Duan et al. reported the fabrication of hierarchical Ni(OH) 2 monolayer hollow-sphere arrays with a fine structure of nanoflakelets by an electrochemical strategy based on a polystyrene (PS) sphere colloidal monolayer. Such hierarchically structured hollow-sphere arrays have demonstrated a tunable optical transmission stop band in the visible-near-IR (Vis–NIR) region from 455 to 1855 nm, depending on the hollow-sphere size and the fine structure [25]. However, hollow structures prepared from hard templating routes (e.g. PS latex particles) usually suffer from disadvantages related to high cost and tedious synthetic procedures, which may prevent them from being used in large-scale applications [11]. Thus, it still remains a challenge to develop simple approaches to synthesize hierarchical Ni(OH) 2 and NiO hollow architectures.|$|E
40|$|The {{recycling}} of batteries {{is an important}} issue in a sustainable society where materials {{recycling of}} complex products is a necessity. Without an efficient recycling there will be an unnecessary loss of both materials and energy due to inefficient or non-existent recycling. This project concerns the recycling of nickel metal hydride (NiMH) hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) batteries and aims to outline the potentials and possibilities inherent in this waste stream. The main valuable metals in the batteries are nickel, cobalt and lanthanoids. The active cathode material is a triprecipitate of mainly nickel with zinc and cobalt in hydroxide form with yttrium and magnesium added, pasted onto a nickel metal foam-mesh support. The active anode material is a hydrogen absorbing alloy containing approximately 54 % nickel and 31 % lanthanoids and smaller amounts of manganese, cobalt, aluminium and yttrium. The recovery of these metals should be performed using a method which minimizes the use of energy and chemicals. The work presented in this thesis is a characterization of the batteries and a dissolution study of individual electrode materials as a first step in a hydrometallurgical recycling process. A nickel removal and purification process has also been investigated, the so called Mond process, by which nickel reacts with carbon monoxide and forms nickel tetracarbonyl. The nickel tetracarbonyl both forms and is highly volatile at a low temperature, unlike other relevant carbonyl compounds. This means that the volatilized nickel can easily be separated {{from the rest of the}} material and thereby purified. This gives both pure nickel and an interesting residue to work with. The <b>positive</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>active</b> <b>material,</b> nickel hydroxide, can be dissolved without dissolving the electrode backing material (nickel metal).

40|$|The spinel LiMn{sub 2 }O{sub 4 } {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied as a <b>positive</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>active</b> <b>material</b> in lithium rechargeable batteries. Partial substitution of Mn by another metal has also {{been the subject of}} recent study in an effort to improve the cycling performance. In general, the literature has shown that Mn substitution results in improved cycling stability at the expense of capacity (1, 2). Resistance to the formation of tetragonal phase upon lithiation of the starting spinel (via a higher nominal Mn oxidation state in the substituted spinel) has been suggested as a mechanism for the improved performance. The degree of substitution is an important factor to optimize in order to minimize capacity loss and costs. The spectroscopic investigations on LiMn{sub 2 }O{sub 4 } described in the previous paper (LixMn 2 O 4) confirmed that the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect (CJTE) from the [Mn{sup 3 +}O{sub 6 }] octahedra is the mechanism for the cubic to tetragonal phase transformation. The driving force for the CJTE is based upon the electronic structure, therefore changes in electronic structure should lead to changes in the phase behavior. The fact that the LiMn{sub 1. 5 }Ni{sub 0. 5 }O{sub 4 } does not form tetragonal phase upon discharging (FUJI 3, MUCK?), unlike the 100 % Mn{sup 4 +} spinel Li{sub 4 }Mn{sub 5 }O{sub 12 } (THAC 5), led to the hypothesis that an increased degree of covalency as a source for the behavior. An increased covalence would remove the driving force for the transformation, the increased electronic stability achieved in tetragonally-distorted [Mn{sup 3 +}O{sub 6 }] octahedra, due to a change in electron density and widening of the Mn 3 d bands. The STH field is dependent upon the amount of unpaired spin density transferred between the magnetic (transition-metal) and diamagnetic ions through an intermittent oxygen ion, attributable to overlap and electron transfer effects. Therefore, the magnitude of the STH coupling constant reflects the degree of covalency (GESC, HUAN). In the case of LiMn{sub 2 -y}Me{sub y}O{sub 4 }, the STH coupling constant characterizes the amount of unpaired spin density transferred to the Li{sup +} from the Mn, Co, or Ni. Similarly, the La/Lb ratio of the Mn L-XES is sensitive to the amount of electron density at the Mn site as a higher ratio indicates that the Mn 3 d{sub 5 / 2 } level is more populated (GRUS 1). An investigation into the effects of Mn-substitution on the electronic structure along with the ramifications to the phase behavior upon changing lithium content was carried out. To accomplish this, a set of LiMn{sub 2 -y}Me{sub y}O{sub 4 } with Me = Li, Co, or Ni over a range of y were synthesized, characterized, and subjected to changes in lithium content by various techniques...|$|E

Because lithium transfer number of solid electrolyte is almost unity in general, the practical lithium ionic conductivity is nearly the same level with conventional liquid electrolyte. However, even when those solid electrolytes are combined with <b>electrode</b> <b>active</b> <b>materials,</b> the resultant battery does not always perform well. One of the reasons originates from the problems of electrode/solid electrolyte interface. Both electrodes and electrolytes are solid, thus the interface tend to make point contacts.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{lithium ion}} {{batteries}} (LIBs) has shown tremendous increases in areas of mobile device applications and electric vehicles. The capacity fade with charge-discharge cycles is a serious issue, especially for automotive application, and is generally associated with structural and chemical changes in electrodes. Coating of artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on electrode suppresses the dissolution of <b>electrode</b> <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> and inhibits the formation and growth of thick resistive layer at electrode-electrolyte interface during electrochemical cycling. In earlier publications, lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) and Al 2 O 3 were studied as the artificial SEI materials, and reduced capacity fades were obtained for both materials [1 - 2]. However, most studies on artificial SEI are focused on cathode surfaces...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the {{electrochemical}} performance of tin intermetallic phases as <b>electrode</b> <b>active</b> <b>material</b> for lithium-ion batteries, Fe 1 −xCoxSn 2 solid solutions with x = 0. 0, 0. 25, 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 6 and 0. 8 were prepared by chemical reduction in tetraethylene glycol. Precise control of the synthesis conditions allowed single-phase nanocrystalline materials to be prepared, with particle diameters of about 20 nm and cubic, nanorods, and U-shaped morphologies. The substitution of iron by cobalt induced a contraction of the unit cell volume. The hyperfine parameters of the 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra were sensitive to the Co/Fe substitution and revealed a superparamagnetic behaviour. In lithium cells nanocrystalline Fe 1 −xCoxSn 2 <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> delivered reversible capacities above 500 mAh g− 1 that depended on the composition and cycling conditions. The intermediate compositions exhibit better electrochemical performance than the end compositions CoSn 2 and FeSn 2...|$|R

We show that Li 6 PS 5 Cl has an electrochem. redox activity in the pos. electrode. It is partially oxidized into LiCl, P 2 S 5 and polysulfides Li 2 Sn upon charge, with some reversibility upon discharge. Li 6 PS 5 Cl also reacts with LiCoO 2 upon cycling, leading {{to the formation of}} phosphates at the interfac...|$|R

Different from the traditional tedious technology of fabricating electrochemical <b>electrodes,</b> <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> have been directly grown on the electrode surface successfully. The robust firmness of oxide/substrate interaction ensures both the excellent electrical contact between <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> and the current collector and superior strain accommodation during preparation. Both the electrochemical advantages of array structure on conductive substrate and the electroactivity of carbon enhance the electrochemical performances of the novel array nanostructure. This new electrode is found to show high rate capability and long cycle life. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report on the application of carbon-coated SnO 2 nanorod array electrode in LIBs. This new nanostructure has been demonstrated to be an ideal electrode as anode of LIBs.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLi- 7 MAS NMR, {{usually a}} bulk {{characterization}} technique, is used here {{to analyze the}} positive electrode/electrolyte interphase. The sharpening of the NMR spectra line shape {{as the amount of}} surface species increases shows that the observed signal is clearly the sum of signals due to the distribution of lithium ions in the interphase in terms of distance from the bulk of <b>electrode</b> <b>active</b> <b>material.</b> This technique is then used to compare characteristics of the interphase coming from the contact with LiPF 6 -based electrolyte in the case of storage or electrochemical cycling. A clear influence of the change of potential on the interphase configuration and in particular on its intimacy with the bulk of <b>active</b> <b>material</b> is deduced from the change in NMR spectra lineshape.

40|$|JPL is {{involved}} in the development of rechargeable Li-ion cells for future Mars Exploration Missions. The specific objectives are to improve the Li-ion cell cycle life performance and rate capability at low temperature (<<- 20 C) in order to enhance survivability of the Mars lander and rover batteries. Poor Li-ion rate capability at low temperature has been attributed to: (1) the electrolytes becoming viscous or freezing and/or (2) reduced electrode capacity that results from decreased Li diffusivity. Our efforts focus on increasing the rate capability at low temperature for Li-ion cells. In order to improve the rate capability we evaluated the following: (1) cathode performance at low temperatures, (2) <b>electrode</b> <b>active</b> <b>material</b> particle size on low temperature performance and (3) Li diffusivity at room temperature and low temperatures. In this paper, we will discuss the results of our study...|$|R
