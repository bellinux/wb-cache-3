50|$|Squash {{varieties}} that showed some resistance to pickleworms include the varieties: Butternut, Golden Hubbard, and Improved Green Hubbard. Summer Squash varieties {{tend to be}} susceptible to <b>Pickleworm</b> damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pickleworm</b> {{damage on}} cucurbit crops is {{evidenced}} by the lack of flowers and new leaves and shoots, as these are the first parts of the plant to be consumed. The larvae also eat the fruit, burrowing down into the flesh and leaving a hole marked with a pile of white frass.|$|E
50|$|Diaphania nitidalis, the <b>pickleworm,</b> is {{a serious}} {{agricultural}} pest insect in the Crambidae family. It damages squash primarily, {{but it is also}} a common pest of other cucurbits such as cucumbers and melons. It is a tropical species which can be found in the southern United States. In the southern United States, earlier plants are less affected compared to later plantings. It does not tolerate cold temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Because {{chrysanthemums}} contain pyrethrums, {{they are}} used as companion plants to repel pest insects from nearby crops and ornamental plants. They are thought to repel aphids, bed bugs (Cimex lectularius), leafhoppers, spider mites, harlequin bugs, ticks, <b>pickleworms,</b> and imported cabbage worms, among others, in gardens and farms. For example, they are planted among broccoli plants for protection from several common insect pests.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of incubated cow urine and its application rates against melon aphids (Aphis gossypii) and <b>Pickleworms</b> (Diaphania hyalinata) was investigated. Incubation periods of 7, 14 and 21 days at doses 5, 10 and 15 % were tried in a randomized block design with three replications. Results from analysis of variance (Anova) show that all treatments significantly reduced the incidence of both pests. However, a post hoc analysis using Turkeys HSD reveals that 14 days incubation at the various dosage levels proved superior to other treatments. Maximum fruit yields of 79816, 78178 and 54109 kg/ha were also recorded for 14 days incubation at 10, 15 and 5 %, respectively. Therefore, 14 days incubation time is recommended for cow urine FOR adoption in pest control on watermelon...|$|R
50|$|The <b>pickleworm</b> {{adult is}} a flashy moth with wide {{triangular}} wings and a wingspan {{of about one}} inch. The wings are mostly iridescent brown, with a central band of yellow and thin white borders. The legs are white. The abdomen is mostly brown except for the tail segment, which is white and has a large fluffy tuft. Adults are not active during daylight hours and eggs are laid only at night. It lays tiny eggs in small clusters on growing areas of the plant, such as flowers, shoots, and new leaf buds. These areas are the feeding spots for the larvae, which emerge {{after a few days}} and eat voraciously for two weeks. The younger larvae are thin white caterpillars with numerous small black spots. As the larvae mature they become plump and darker in color, and they lose their spots. The larvae tuck themselves into crumpled dead leaves to pupate for 8 to 10 days. The life cycle varies by environmental conditions ranging from 22 - 55 days. In warm areas the <b>pickleworm</b> can produce four generations per year.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pickleworm</b> is a {{tropical}} insect which routinely survives the winter only in south Florida and perhaps south Texas. Pena et al. (1987 a) documented the overwintering biology in south Florida, but overwintering {{has been observed}} {{as far north as}} Sanford, in central Florida, during mild winters. <b>Pickleworm</b> is highly dispersive, and invades much of the southeast each summer. North Carolina and South Carolina regularly experience crop damage by <b>pickleworm,</b> but often this does not occur until August or September. In contrast, northern Florida is flooded with moths each year in early June as warm, humid tropical summer weather conditions become firmly established. Although it regularly takes one or two months for the dispersing pickleworms to move north from Florida to the Carolinas, in some years they reach locations as far north as Michigan and Connecticut...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pickleworm</b> survives {{the winter}} in south Florida and migrates north in the summer; each female moth can lay 300 - 400 eggs. • Cucumbers that are entered by the <b>pickleworm</b> are unfit for human {{consumption}} because of the tunneling and excrement of the insect. • Spraying of cucumbers with insecticides can reduce the <b>pickleworm</b> from 80 % to 0. 5 %. • Cucumber beetles transmit bacterial wilt which results in plant death due to the presence of masses of bacteria inside the plant. Technical Summary U. S. growers produce 1. 6 billion pounds of cucumbers with a value of $ 322 million from 131, 000 acres. 66 - 97 % of cucumber acres in individual states are treated with insecticides [22]. Insecticide costs for cucumbers in the southeast are approximately $ 31 -$ 38 /A which represents about 2 % of the cost of producing the crop [16][20]. In North Central states and Texas the cost of insecticides is approximately $ 8 -$ 12 /A for cucumbers [17]-[19]. In Florida the cost of insecticides for cucumbers is $ 219 /A representing about 5 % of the cost of production [21]...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of techniques toensure agricultural productivity, both in quality and quantity, has caused {{an increase in}} the use of pesticides, which control harmful organisms in a relevant manner. Although pesticides are used to control pests, diseases, and weeds, they may contaminate foods, other products, and the environment due to their application at a given stage of the crop’s production cycle, storage, transport, or due to soil contamination from previous treatments, crop rotation, or to irrigation water contamination (Eom, 1994).

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. <b>Pickleworm</b> (Diaphania nitidalis Cramer) {{is a major}} pest of cucurbits. This study {{investigated}} the potential of using squash (Cucurbita pepo L.), as a trap crop and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus [Thunb. ] Matsum. & Nakai) as an intercrop in a push-pull cropping approach to manage <b>pickleworm</b> on cantaloupe (Cucumis melo L.). A series of oviposition and larval preference experiments were conducted. Females preferred to lay their eggs on a squash plant, to a watermelon or cantaloupe plant when presented with all three. Females were not averse to laying their eggs on watermelon; though the non-cucurbit, bean, stimulated reduced oviposition. While neonate larvae may be capable of moving between plants {{they do not have}} a feeding preference between squash, cantaloupe, or watermelon. Overall squash has the potential to be an effective trap crop, however a non-cucurbit, such as bean, would be better suited than watermelon as a potential intercrop in this system...|$|E
40|$|Push-pull {{cropping}} {{approaches for}} pest management target the oviposition behavior of adult females. However, insect larvae may {{move from the}} natal host and undermine {{the effectiveness of this}} approach. We investigated the longevity and feeding preference of <b>pickleworm</b> neonates (Diaphania nitidalis Cramer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)) in relation to a potential push-pull cropping approach incorporating squash as a trap crop (pull) and watermelon as a deterrent intercrop (push) to protect a main crop of cantaloupe. Neonates could survive between 24 to 64 h without food, indicating they have some initial energy reserves to keep alive while in search of a suitable feeding site. To assess neonate feeding preferences, naive neonates were given the choice of five foods; leaves of squash, cantaloupe, watermelon, bean, and a pinto bean-based artificial diet. To assess if previous feeding experience influences neonate food source preference, neonates were allowed to feed on one of the five foods for 24 h and then given the same choice of the five food sources. The neonates, with or without previous feeding experience, did not appear to have a significant preference for any of the cucurbits: squash, cantaloupe, or watermelon, but they did prefer a cucurbit to the bean leaf or artificial diet. Feeding experience on one of these non-host foods made neonates more accepting of these food sources in the choice arena even when host plant food sources became available. It appears that neonate feeding preferences of <b>pickleworm</b> would neither hinder nor enhance the potential success of the proposed cucurbits to be used in a potential push-pull cropping approach for <b>pickleworm</b> management...|$|E
40|$|A {{nematode}} {{identified as}} Heterorhabditis sp. {{was discovered in}} June 1982 in larval cadavers of the banded cucumber beetle, Diabrotica balteata, in soil on wooded land. Effective beetle control (over 95 %) was obtained when larvae were exposed to potted soil containing infective stage nematode juveniles or infected larval cadavers. The nematode was propagated in vivo on larvae of D. balteata, Diaphania nitidalis (the <b>pickleworm),</b> and Galleria mellonella (the greater wax moth). This Heterorhabditis sp. has promising potential as a biocontrol agent for the banded cucumber beetle...|$|E
40|$|A resistência de genótipos de abobrinha italiana Cucurbita pepo L. à broca das cucurbitáceas Diaphania nitidalis Cr. foi avaliada a campo. O genótipo Duda apresentou o maior número de frutos produzidos (33 frutos/parcela), enquanto Lita- 186 foi o mais preferido, com a maior percentagem de frutos broqueados (3, 6 %). Os genótipos AG- 202, Lita- 186 e Duda, mais o inseticida deltametrina 25 CE foram avaliados. Duda comportou-se novamente como mais produtivo (35 frutos/parcela) e menos danificado (0, 35 %), confirmando os resultados obtidos no primeiro ensaio; já os genótipos AG- 202 e Lita- 186 revelaram-se os mais preferidos por D. nitidalis, com maiores índices de frutos danificados (2, 7 e 6, 3 %, respectivamente). Resistance to the <b>pickleworm</b> Diaphania nitidalis Cr. on squash genotypes Cucurbita pepo L. was {{evaluated}} in the field. The number {{of fruits and}} the percentage of the bored fruits were observed on the genotypes Caserta AG- 202, HE- 303, Clarice AG- 772, Lita- 186, Duda, and Novita. Genotype Duda produced the greatest number of fruits (33 fruits/plot). Genotype Lita- 186 was the most preferred with the greatest number of damaged fruits (3. 6), while genotype Duda was not damaged. Genotypes AG- 202, Lita- 186 and Duda, were selected to observe the interaction of squash genotypes with deltamethrin insecticide 25 CE to control the <b>pickleworm.</b> Genotype Duda was the most productive (35 fruits/plot) and least damaged one (0. 35 %), confirming the results of the 1 st experiment. Genotypes AG- 202 and Lita- 186 were greatly preferred by D. nitidalis (2. 7 and 6. 3 %, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide residues, {{especially}} in vegetables and fruits, are {{a reason for}} concern {{with respect to the}} health of consumers and workers that need to return to areas that have been treated with these agrochemicals. The objectives of this experiment were to (a) study the behavior of deltamethrin residues from different formulations on cucumber fruits; and (b) correlate insecticide contents in the fruits with <b>pickleworm</b> control. Treatments were as follows: (a) control; (b) three 30 mL applications of deltamethrin 25 EC 100 L- 1 water (emulsifiable concentrate formulation); (c) three 7. 5 mL applications of deltamethrin 100 EC 100 L- 1 water (emulsifiable concentrate); and (d) three 3. 75 mL applications of deltamethrin 200 CS 100 L- 1 water (concentrate suspension). Samples were taken at (- 1), zero, 1; 3; 5; 7, and 14 days after the last application. Residues were determined by the gas chromatography technique, using an electron capture detector. In order to evaluate insecticide effectiveness, six infestation surveys were conducted during the same sampling times. Although at low levels, the deltamethrin residues in the fruits were above the maximum residue level (MRL = 0. 03 mg kg- 1), even one day {{after the end of the}} safety interval (2 days), and were higher for the CS formulation. The insecticide was effective to control the pest during the entire evaluation period...|$|E
