50|$|Concave cakes are {{commonly}} made with eggs, egg yolk, low gluten flour, honey {{and a small}} portion of sugar. Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cakes is fairly consistent in all recipes. First, <b>preheat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> at around 170 degree Celsius, at the same time, mix the 1 eggs and 3 egg yolks by adding sugar and honey which depend on preference. The mixture will be creamed by using a wooden spoon or electric mixer. The gluten flour will be added and stir them softly for a while. Then, pour the mixture into molds. Place them into <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> and adjust <b>to</b> 170 degrees Celsius for 16 minutes. Someone may prefer to well done, then prolong the time to 20 minutes.|$|R

Also, J.I.S. and CSTB only drop their safes from 13-15 feet (as opposed to 30). Rarely are safes dropped 15 ft or more and they are usually artificially cooled by the fire department. UL also runs an indirect explosion test on all safes. Additionally UL-768 certifies the combination lock against tampering. UL-140 certifies a relocking mechanism that will permanently lock the safe bolts, in case an electronic lock fails or a UL-768 rated lock is compromised.|$|R

40|$|Public {{concern about}} leakage from {{microwave}} ovens is present {{from the beginning}} of its use when many people believed that the leakage was similar to atomic radiation and could result in serious health problems, including cancer. This paper presents the results of the evaluation of electromagnetic emissions produced by microwave ovens that are in the area of meals of the ITM campus Fraternidad and are used by students, teachers and workers to heat food. First, measurements were made at 5 cm from <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> maximum values of leakage generated by <b>the</b> <b>ovens.</b> Subsequently, it was evaluated the electric field level in the surrounding tables <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> levels to which people to frequent the area were exposed.
