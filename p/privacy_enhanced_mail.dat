Chimaera uses the PEM (<b>Privacy</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Mail)</b> format which enables the receiver to authentificate the sender identity using special informations (certificates, signature, hash-coding) held into the message. PEM is a model for e-mail authentification and certification. PEM complies to X 509 standard as for the handling of certificates. Chimaera provides a way to generate PEM formatted mails.

A version of these protocols was released in August 1989, and revised two years later. Since then, several other changes were made to the protocols, many of them minor, but some major.

These protocols provide sender authenticity, message integrity and confidentiality, and under certain circumstances non-repudiation. A key tool for these protocols is cryptography; first, the message is encrypted using one cryptosystem and key (the session key), and then that key and algorithm identifier are themselves encrypted by a second cryptosystem and key (the interchange key).

40|$|Abstract. Research in <b>Privacy</b> <b>Enhancing</b> Technologies has a {{tradition}} of about 25 years. The basic technologies and ideas were found until 1995 while the last decade was dominated by the utilisation of such technolo-gies. The question arises if there is a market for <b>Privacy</b> <b>Enhanced</b> Tech-nology. The answer is yes, however <b>Privacy</b> <b>Enhancing</b> Technology may not have been broadly known yet {{in order to make it}} profitable. The gov-ernments or non-profit organisations must therefore run such systems or at least promote their further development and deployment. Especially governments have however conflicting interests: While governments of democratic nations are responsible to keep the freedom of citizens (and privacy as a part of it), governments also need instruments to prose-cute criminal activities. Subsequently, <b>Privacy</b> <b>Enhancing</b> Technologies have to consider law enforcement functionality in order to balance these different targets. ...|$|R

In particular, it addresses the problems associated with secure file sharing, and the problems of high administrative overhead.

Truffles must deal with several important security problems, including secure transport of data, authentication of the users sharing files, handling of different administrative domains, and permitting system administrators to control, flexibly, yet easily, what sorts of sharing are done.

40|$|There {{are several}} tools {{available}} {{that can be}} used to hold multimedia conference sessions within the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBone). Most of these tools provide means for public and private conferencing, but offer no possibility to register participants of particular conference sessions, or to authenticate them accordingly.

40|$|Recently, many {{protocols}} in the Internet {{are proposing}} {{the use of}} public key cryptography in support of integrity and authentication security services. However, each of these protocols lacks a globally available public key distribution and management system. A secure version of the Domain Name System (DNS) is being developed which, conveniently, provides an infrastructure ideally suited for the distribution and management of public keys. We propose how this infrastructure of the secure DNS could be exploited by today's users of the Internet to distribute and manage their personal public keys. 1. Introduction The use of public key cryptography in the Internet was first proposed by <b>Privacy</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Mail</b> (PEM) [1, 2, 3, 4].
