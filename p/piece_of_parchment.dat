5|$|Most of {{the bones}} in Turku were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a {{transfer}} to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War. The man behind the idea was the infamous Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side {{during the war and}} {{was in charge of the}} grim occupation of Finland. What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities.|$|E

5000|$|Mezuzahs are <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> (often {{contained}} in a decorative case) inscribed with specified Hebrew verses from the Torah ( [...] and [...] ) some interpret Jewish law to require a mezuzah on every doorway in the home apart from bathrooms, and closets too small to qualify as rooms.|$|R
25|$|The commandment {{to affix}} a mezuzah is widely {{followed}} in the Jewish world, even by Jews who are not religiously observant. While the {{important part of the}} mezuzah is the klaf, or the parchment, and not the case itself, designing and producing mezuzah cases has been elevated to an art form over the ages. Mezuzah cases are produced {{from a wide variety of}} materials, from silver and precious metals, to wood, stone, ceramics, pewter, and even polymer clay. Some dealers of mezuzah cases will provide or offer for sale a copy of the text that has been photocopied onto paper; this is not a Kosher (valid) mezuzah, which must be handwritten onto a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> by a qualified scribe.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Bonham v College of Physicians, {{commonly}} known as Dr. Bonham's Case or simply Bonham's Case, was a case decided in 1610 by the Court of Common Pleas in England, under Sir Edward Coke, the court's Chief Justice, who explained why he thought that [...] "in many cases, the common law will control Acts of Parliament". Coke's meaning has been disputed over the years. According to one interpretation, Coke intended the kind of judicial review that would later develop in the United States, but other scholars believe that Coke meant only to construe a statute, not to challenge parliamentary sovereignty. If Coke intended the former, he may have later changed his view. The statement by Coke is sometimes considered to be obiter dicta, rather than part of the ratio decidendi of the case. Dr Bonham's case was a statement that engaging in peaceful and honest trade without a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> called a [...] "license" [...] was not a [...] "crime", and that no command of the monarch or Act of the Monarch in Parliament could make engaging in peaceful and honest trade without a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> called a [...] "license" [...] a [...] "crime".|$|E
500|$|Legrand {{explains}} {{that on the}} day he found the bug on the mainland coastline, Jupiter had picked up a scrap <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> to wrap it up. Legrand kept the scrap and used it to sketch the bug for the narrator; in so doing, though, he noticed traces of invisible ink, revealed by the heat of the fire burning on the hearth. The parchment proved to contain a cryptogram, which Legrand deciphered as a set of directions for finding a treasure buried by the infamous pirate [...] "Captain Kidd." [...] The final step involved dropping a slug or weight through the left eye of the skull in the tree; their first dig failed because Jupiter mistakenly dropped it through the right eye instead. Legrand muses that the skeletons may be the remains of two members of Kidd's crew, who buried the chest and were then killed to silence them.|$|E
50|$|The scroll {{was made}} by one person only. Most of the {{patterns}} were drawn on two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> that were put together, and then pasted on the scroll. The placement of the patterns on the scroll is somewhat disorganized. Patterns of similar themes are fallen apart, and some patterns formed on two parchment pieces are combined imperfectly.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 the Volterra {{database}} {{was used}} by Corcoran and Salway to identify previously unknown fragments of the Gregorian Code. The [...] "Fragmenta Londiniensia" [...] are seventeen <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> estimated to date from AD400, the document having been cut up and re-used as book-binding material. This is the first direct evidence yet discovered of the Gregorian Codex.|$|R

2500|$|Another common amulet in {{contemporary}} use is the Chai (symbol)—( [...] "living" [...] ), {{which is also}} worn around the neck. Other similar amulets still in use consist {{of one of the}} names of the god of Judaism, such as ה (He), יה (YaH), or שדי (Shaddai), inscribed on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> or metal, usually silver.|$|E
2500|$|A mezuzah ( [...] "doorpost"; plural: [...] mezuzot) {{comprises}} a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> {{called a}} klaf {{contained in a}} decorative case and inscribed with specific Hebrew verses from the Torah ( [...] and [...] ). These verses consist of the Jewish prayer Shema Yisrael, beginning with the phrase: [...] "Hear, O Israel, the LORD (is) our God, the LORD is One". In mainstream Rabbinic Judaism, a mezuzah is affixed to the doorpost of Jewish homes to fulfill the mitzvah (Biblical commandment) to [...] "write the words of God on the gates and doorposts of your house" [...] (...) [...] Some interpret Jewish law to require a mezuzah in every doorway in the home except bathrooms (which is not a living space), laundry rooms and closets, if they {{are too small to}} qualify as rooms. The klaf parchment is prepared by a qualified scribe ("sofer stam") who has undergone many years of meticulous training, and the verses are written in black indelible ink with a special quill pen. The parchment is then rolled up and placed inside the case.|$|E

50|$|The High Middle Ages (1000-1300) saw {{the rise}} of the medieval chancery, which was usually the place where most {{government}} letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom. The rooms of the chancery often had walls full of pigeonholes, constructed to hold rolled up <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> for safekeeping or ready reference, a precursor to the book shelf. The introduction of printing during the Renaissance did not change these early government offices much.|$|R
5000|$|The Chronicle of Novalesa was written, c.1050, by an {{anonymous}} monk at the monastery of San Pietro in Novalesa. The Chronicon {{was written in}} the form of a rotulus (or scroll) rather than a codex. The original, and sole extant copy, of the scroll is preserved in Turin (Archivio di Stato, Nuova collezione, [...] "museo"). The scroll consists <b>of</b> twenty-eight <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> sewn together, <b>of</b> which fragments are now missing. The work is divided into five sections, plus an appendix; of which sections four and five are incomplete.|$|R
500|$|The {{document}} is a [...] scroll consisting <b>of</b> three <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> glued together and rolled, and {{is believed to}} have been created in the Fulda monastery. A scientific study <b>of</b> the purple <b>parchment</b> took place in Munich in 1966, which showed that minium (red lead) and madder were used for staining the document, indicating that it was created in the Holy Roman Empire, rather than in the Byzantine Empire, where the Murex shell for making Tyrian purple was tightly controlled. This {{document is}} one of the oldest surviving examples of madder being used in the Middle Ages. The purple background was made from Byzantine silk woven with fourteen circular medallions and two half medallions. The medallions contain representations of animals fighting, inspired by Near Eastern art.|$|R

50|$|Shorter <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> {{or paper}} are called rolls or rotuli, {{although}} {{usage of the}} term by modern historians varies with periods. Historians of the classical period tend to use roll instead of scroll. Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and {{were used in the}} medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for manuscript administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories. A distinction that sometimes applies is that the lines of writing in rotuli run across the width of the roll (that is to say, are parallel with any unrolled portion) rather than along the length, divided into page-like sections. Rolls may be wider than most scrolls, up to perhaps 60 cm or two feet wide. Rolls were often stored together in a special cupboard on shelves.|$|R

500|$|The {{manufacturing}} processes {{of both the}} boxes and the parchment scrolls are intricate and governed by hundreds of detailed rules. In earlier Talmudic times, tefillin were either cylindrical or cubical, but later the cylindrical form became obsolete. Nowadays the boxes should be fashioned from a single <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> animal hide and form a base with an upper compartment to contain the parchment scrolls. They are made in varying levels of quality. The most basic form, called peshutim ("simple"), are made using several <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> to form the inner walls of the head tefillin. The higher quality tefillin, namely dakkot ("thin"), made by stretching a thin <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> leather, and the more durable gassot ("thick") are both fashioned from the single <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> hide. Black leather straps (retsu'ot) pass through {{the rear of the}} base and are used to secure the tefillin onto the body. On both sides of the head-tefillin, the Hebrew letter shin (...) is moulded; the shin on the wearer's left side has four branches instead of three. The knot of the head-tefillin strap forms the letter dalet (...) or double dalet (...) (known as the square-knot) while the strap that is passed through the arm-tefillin is formed into a knot {{in the shape of the}} letter yud (...) [...] These three letters spell Shaddai (...) , one of the names of God.|$|R

The signature is successfully recovered. The experiment works and they present a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> genuine <b>parchment</b> with a genuine signature to the government for authentication. The scheme fails when the government investigators decide that the parchment is too new to be genuine; because it skipped forward hundreds of years in time, the parchment scrap appears only a year or two old.|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} {{collection}} in this series, are {{the records of}} the Middlesex Deeds Register. By the Middlesex Registry Act 1708 a registry was established for the registration of all deeds, conveyances, wills, encumbrances etc., affecting freehold land and leased land for periods of 21 years or more, within the ancient county of Middlesex. In 1862 the national land register was introduced on a voluntary basis. In 1899 it became compulsory for land in the new area of North London that was formally Middlesex to be registered nationally. This dramatically reduced the amount of entries to the Middlesex Deeds Register, though it continued to serve the outer part of Middlesex until 1938 when all land within Middlesex had to be registered through the national land register. Deeds and documents brought to the registry were copied onto <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> called memorials and then bound into large volumes or registers. The documents are not complete copies of the originals and certain information such as covenants and other restrictions may be missing. Information entered includes date of the transaction, names of the parties and a description of the property. From the mid-19th century this also often included a plan of the property.|$|R
