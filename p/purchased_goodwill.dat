40|$|The {{principal}} goal of {{this research}} study was to critically evaluate the current accounting treatment of <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> {{in terms of a}} theoretical framework established, including an evaluation of the true nature of goodwill. The main conclusion {{of this study is that}} goodwill is an intangible asset representing various intangible factors contributing to the enterprise's earning capacity and providing returns in excess of a normal return on assets employed for which an acquiring enterprise is willing to pay an amount in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. The cost of <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> is measured as the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired after ensuring that all assets, tangible and intangible, had been properly identified. <b>Purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> should be amortised over the estimated period that the enterprise is expected to benefit from the acquisition of the goodwill.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the value relevance of goodwill {{that has been}} eliminated through reserves {{in the year of}} acquisition. Specifically, it investigates the association beiween goodwill reserve write-off and the value placed on the firm by the stock market. In so doing, the thesis describes the relationship between the implied value of <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> and that of other assets, and we seek to explain the underlying paffern of the amortisation of goodwill over time. The empirical method uses cross-sectional equity valuation models for the period 1994 - 6. Based on the modified balance sheet identity, the equity valuation model parameterises <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> and other assets separately, and a more meaningful interpretation is given of the intercept term than in previous studies relating to <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill.</b> The results confirm that the market incorporates information on the goodwill reserve write-off in the valuation of a firm, and the results also show that the market: book ratio is similar to tangible assets but its behaviour suggests a relatively higher amortisation rate. Although the present study provides evidence supporting the requirement in FRS 10 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to capitalise <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill,</b> the findings also show that the incremental value of capitalised goodwill declines far more quickly than FRS 1 O suggests, thus placing particular importance on the impairment test required by FRS 10...|$|E

40|$|The {{relevance}} of goodwill {{has become an}} increasingly important topic for accounting since FASB and IASB have both taken stance toward fair value accounting. There are many studies about market reactions and abnormal profits in acquisitions and also about the association between goodwill impairments and the market value. However, the findings of previous studies are somewhat inconsistent. This thesis examines the association between new <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> and the market value and also the association between goodwill write-offs and the market value. Also the impact that goodwill write-offs have on quality and {{relevance of}} the balance sheet is studied. Analysis is done through ordinary linear least squares regression. Goodwill balance increases through acquisition {{as a part of}} the acquisition price is allocated to the goodwill. Goodwill balance can be later impaired if its fair value is lower than its balance value. This goodwill write-off decreases the balance value. Findings show that neither <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> nor goodwill write-offs are fully associated with the market value. <b>Purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> has significant positive impact on the market value. On the other hand, goodwill write-offs have significant negative impact on the market value. There is also evidence that after a goodwill write-off is done the balance sheet better represents its fair value. Thus, quality and relevance of the balance sheet improves for investors...|$|E

The subjects for the Munster & Leinster Bank course at the time were: English, French, Arithmetic, Totting, Typewriting and Shorthand. Skerry's always secured numerous appointments with Munster and Leinster (AIB), Bank of Ireland and Cork Savings Bank (TSB). About this time also, the various County Councils began to hold competitive examinations for clerical shorthand/typists, and Skerry's students always secured the majority of the vacancies. These successes were printed in list form in the national daily newspapers. On Mr. McCarthy's death in 1962, his wife Gladys became governing director. Mrs. McCarthy maintained the tradition of Skerry's, viz. that of fulfilling the particular training requirements of modern day business.

40|$|The recent {{movement}} in standards setting toward fair-value-based accounting beyond financial {{assets and liabilities}} calls for more empirical evidence on fair-value measurement, especially that of intangible assets. This article studies the initial valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets after acquisitions. We find that the allocation of <b>purchase</b> price to <b>goodwill</b> and identifiable intangible assets {{is related to the}} economic determinants of the valuation. However, it is also significantly affected by managerial incentives arising from the differential treatments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142. The same managerial discretions are not exhibited in the purchase price allocation prior to SFAS 142, when goodwill and other intangibles are both amortized. These findings suggest that unverifiable fair value measures are associated with the underlying economics but also deviate from the true values in the presence of management reporting incentives. Further analysis suggests that external appraisers constrain managerial discretion in intangible asset valuation to an extent but do not completely eliminate it.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{suggests}} that a hypothesis in a previous paper in this journal is false. The hypothesis relates to the tax deductibility of goodwill, but the paper does not distinguish between goodwill on consolidation (which is not tax deductible) and other <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> (which is deductible in some jurisdictions). Dunne and Ndubizu [1995] (henceforth D&N) examine in this journal "the economic effects of differential international accounting and tax treatments for goodwill {{on the market for}} foreign control of U. S. target firms " (p. 362). They purport to find that "those firms that can deduct goodwill for tax pur-poses provide greater wealth to U. S. target shareholders than acquirers that cannot deduct goodwill " (p. 374). This comment paper {{suggests that}} one of their findings is wrong because their analysis of tax treatments is flawed. D&N's basic assumption in developing their tax hypothesis (H 2) is that: "Most countries that require the amortization of goodwill for financial report-ing purposes allow goodwill amortization as an expense for tax purposes [...] . which increases cash flow because of the lower taxes paid [...] . [which] leaves foreign acquirers at an advantage " (p. 365). This hypothesis is false. As will be shown below, in none of the countries considered by D&N is the relevant goodwill amortization deductible for tax purposes. The problem occurs because of a failure to distinguish between goodwill on consolidation and other <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill.</b> The former arises when a com-pany (or group of companies) acquires another company. Such goodwill therefore arises only in consolidated financial statements. In the countries use...|$|E
40|$|Business {{acquisition}} {{has become}} a common practice and <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> recognised through these business acquisitions makes up {{a significant part of}} the total assets acquired. Under current New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRSs), goodwill acquired from a business combination (<b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill)</b> is recognised as an unidentifiable intangible asset and should be tested for impairment annually to determine whether or not it has been impaired. This study aims to explore the accounting practices relating to goodwill acquired from business acquisition as reported by 15 New Zealand companies and the impact of these practices on the reliability and relevance of goodwill accounting information. By a combination of data driven and prior research driven method, this study analyses a broad range of financial data on companies’ annual reports, and show five themes to present the reliability and relevance of goodwill accounting information on financial statements. The overall finding provides evidence that the reliability and relevance of goodwill impairment practices from sampled NZ companies under current NZIFRSs have been well preserved. One significant theme is that the sampled NZ companies have practiced timely write-offs of overpaid price for goodwill and an acceptable level of compliance with goodwill impairment testing requirements in the selection and disclosure of key estimates. The findings also suggest that at least some components of goodwill have shorter economic lives and by no means indefinite. Finally, this study indicates an ongoing need to monitor the high percentage goodwill in term of total assets, the possibility of opportunistically eliminating goodwill by managers, and more informative disclosure on financial statements...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: For my collection, I went on {{a journey}} of self-discovery to find my {{personal}} design aesthetic. I reflected upon my personal fashion sense and drew inspiration from a recent fascination with swag pop music, which is a side genre of pop music utilizing upbeat drums, catchy melodies, top- 40 hooks, and rap-style bridges. In my closet, I have a cheetah print trench coat, which I bought before starting college. I wore the coat so much that I became known as “cheetah girl. ” This jacket and newfound persona were {{a major source of}} inspiration for this piece. Process: “Cheetah Girl“ is my rendition of the little black dress with a fun and sexy twist. I wanted the piece to be very structured; I love structured dresses because they are classic and figure flattering. I used the pop of cheetah print in the waistband, bow, and cap sleeve to keep the piece fun and young. The low back adds subtle sex appeal while still maintaining a sense of modesty. I added the studs at the shoulders for an unexpected edge. I think the piece is a perfect mix between sexy, sweet, and edgy. It is the perfect look for a girl who wants to stand out in a crowd. Techniques: This piece was created using the draping technique. Draping is the smoothing, contouring, and the manipulation of fabric on a dress form to create a design and ultimately a pattern. From this pattern, I constructed a sample garment using sheets <b>purchased</b> from the <b>Goodwill.</b> After the sample was created, I fit it to my model and made major changes to the pattern to assure proper fit.

40|$|In {{this article}} we have {{investigated}} whether the determinants of excess returns (especially of target excess returns) are valid for <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill</b> as well. Among them are acquirer’s and target’s Tobin’s q, and debt assets ratio, that explain value creation of acquisitions, and relative size, source of financing of the acquisition, number of bidders, and relatedness of businesses of acquiror and target, that explain overpayment or overvaluation of acquisitions. The study is confined to mergers and acquisitions between US publicly quoted companies announced and effective in between January 2002 and December 2005. Databases used are SDC Platinum, CRSP and Compustat industrial annual file. Goodwill amounts are derived from acquirer’s 10 -K forms in Edgar database of SEC. Results show that in line with our expectations, the correlation coefficient for target excess return amounts and goodwill is positive, whereas it is negative for acquirer and combined excess returns. Further {{it turns out that}} goodwill is significant positively influenced by acquisitions of high Tobin’s q targets by either low or high Tobin’s q acquirers, compared to acquisitions of low Tobin’s q targets by low Tobin’s q acquirers. Also the method of payment matters: payments other than cash or stock negatively influence goodwill. Moreover, a higher leverage of the target positively influences <b>purchased</b> <b>goodwill.</b> Although some of the determinants of excess return have a significant influence on goodwill, the pattern is sometimes different. Therefore, further research needs to take into account both the nature of goodwill and its unique determinants. Goodwill, overpayment, value creation...|$|E

40|$|The Goodwill Model of the Competitive Market Allowing for Trust and Creating Jobs Consumers often cannot {{judge the}} quality of goods and {{services}} {{at the time of the}} <b>purchase</b> decision. The <b>goodwill</b> model explains how the market participants deal with this problem. It makes a distinction between markets for search goods, experience goods and credence goods. In markets for experience goods the goodwill mechanism can ensure completely by itself that suppliers behave with integrity. The goodwill mechanism causes irreversible costs of the market entrance in the form of goodwill investments for new suppliers. These irreversible costs of the market entrance lead to the fact that established suppliers can permanently achieve prize and volume premiums if they behave with integrity. Established suppliers, therefore, abstain from a hidden reduction of {{the quality of}} their products. The strength of the goodwill mechanism lies in the fact that it adapts itself in markets for experience goods to changed circumstances of the market by changes in the communications behavior of the market participants and thereby it stabilizes the market development and optimizes the market result. Markets for credence goods, however, are, in spite of the social institution Goodwill, characterized by market failure. The root causes for this result are selected sporadic bad quality deliveries which cannot be recognized by the consumers as those. Suitable regulations to stabilize markets for credence goods artificially generate irreversible costs of the market entrance for new suppliers. These created irreversible costs enable the established suppliers of credence goods to permanently earn positive economic profits by behaving with integrity. Numerous regulations which exist today in functioning markets for credence goods establish such irreversible costs of the market entrance. The abolition of such regulations can lead to market failure. An example having a lasting effect even today is the transformation which occurred between 1980 and 1999 of the US banking system which developed from a system of separated commercial and investment banks to a system of fully integrated banks. ...|$|R
