5|$|In 1930, {{the armed}} forces forced the Radicals from power and {{improved}} economic conditions, but political turbulence intensified. In 1932, Argentina required immigrants to have a labour contract prior to arrival, or proof of financial means of support. The Roca-Runciman Treaty of 1933 gave Argentina a quota of the British market for exports of its <b>primary</b> <b>products,</b> but the discriminatory British imperial tariffs {{and the effects of}} deflation in Britain actually led to a small decline of Argentine exports to Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Since then, thermal {{anomalies}} (hot spots) and {{gas emissions}} (including hydrogen sulfide) have occurred {{especially on the}} summit plateau and indicate that Adams is dormant, not extinct. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of andesite or basalt. Because the <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams {{tend to have a}} low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens {{and some of the other}} Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large landslides and other debris flows.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of permitted farm products includes (among other items) produce, flowers, eggs, cultivated mushrooms, meat, cultured shellfish, and dairy products. There {{is also a}} broader category of supplemental farm products such as wild-harvested berries and mushrooms, non-edible bee products, or holiday wreaths.

25|$|Import {{substitution}} {{policies were}} adopted by most nations in Latin America from the 1930s {{until the late}} 1980s. The initial date is largely attributed {{to the impact of}} the Great Depression of the 1930s, when Latin American countries, which exported <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> and imported almost all of the industrialized goods they consumed, were prevented from importing due to a sharp decline in their foreign sales. This served as an incentive for the domestic production of the goods they needed.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} New Zealand's economy {{was built on}} a narrow range of {{agricultural}} products, such as wool, meat and dairy. These products became New Zealand's staple and most valuable exports, underpinning {{the success of the}} economy, from the 1850s until the 1970s. For example, from 1920 to the late 1930s, the dairy export quota was usually around 35% of New Zealand's total exports, and in some years made up almost 45%. Due to the high demand for these <b>primary</b> <b>products,</b> manifested by the New Zealand wool boom of 1951, New Zealand had one of the highest standards of living in the world for 70 years.|$|E
25|$|Orbital Sciences Corporation (commonly {{referred}} to as Orbital) was an American company specializing in the design, manufacture and launch of small- and medium- class space and rocket systems for commercial, military and other government customers. It was headquartered in Dulles, Virginia and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol ORB. Orbital’s <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> were satellites and launch vehicles, including low-Earth orbit, geosynchronous-Earth orbit and planetary spacecraft for communications, remote sensing, scientific and defense missions; ground- and air-launched rockets that delivered satellites into orbit; missile defense systems that were used as interceptor and target vehicles; and human-rated space systems for Earth-orbit, lunar and other missions. Orbital also provided satellite subsystems and space-related technical services to government agencies and laboratories.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{established}} kurtrice {{and tobacco}} as Cuba's <b>primary</b> <b>products,</b> {{and the island}} soon supplanted Hispaniola as the prime Spanish base in the Caribbean. Further field labor was required. African slaves were then imported to work the plantations as field labor. However, restrictive Spanish trade laws {{made it difficult for}} Cubans {{to keep up with the}} 17th and 18th century advances in processing sugar cane pioneered in British Barbados and French Saint-Domingue (Haiti). Spain also restricted Cuba's access to the slave trade, which was dominated by the British, French, and Dutch. One important turning point came in the Seven Years' War, when the British conquered the port of Havana and introduced thousands of slaves in a ten-month period. Another key event was the Haitian Revolution in nearby Saint-Domingue, from 1791 to 1804. Thousands of French refugees, fleeing the slave rebellion in Saint Domingue, brought slaves and expertise in sugar refining and coffee growing into eastern Cuba in the 1790s and early 19th century.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{identifies}} {{and compares}} the energy balance of winter wheat, spring barley and white mustard – all grown in crop rotation under different tillage conditions. The field trial included the conventional tillage (CT) method, minimum tillage (MT) {{and a system}} with no tillage (NT). The energy inputs included both the direct and indirect energy component. Energy outputs are evaluated as gross calorific value (gross heating value of phytomass dry matter) of the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> and the total harvested production. The energy effectiveness (energy output: energy input) was selected for evaluation. The greatest energy effectiveness for the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> was established as 6. 35 for barley, 6. 04 for wheat and 3. 68 for mustard; {{in the case of}} total production, it was 9. 82 for barley, 10. 08 for wheat and 9. 72 for mustard. When comparing the different tillage conditions, the greatest energy effectiveness was calculated for the evaluated crops under the MT operation and represented the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> of wheat at 6. 49, barley at 6. 69 and mustard at 3. 92. The smallest energy effectiveness for the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> was found in wheat 5. 77 and barley 6. 10 under the CT option; it was 3. 55 for mustard under the option of NT. Throughout the entire cropping pattern, the greatest energy effectiveness was established under the minimum tillage option – 5. 70 for the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> and 10. 47 for the total production. On the other hand, the smallest values were calculated under CT – 5. 22 for the <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> and 9. 71 for total production...|$|R
