40|$|We {{formulate}} a <b>principle</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> {{with the knowledge}} of the marginal distribution over the data points (unlabeled data). The principle is cast in terms of Tikhonov style regularization where the regularization penalty articulates {{the way in which the}} marginal density should constrain otherwise unrestricted conditional distributions. Specifically, the regularization penalty penalizes any information introduced between the examples and labels beyond what is provided by the available labeled examples. The work extends (Szummer and Jaakkola, 2003) to multiple dimensions, providing a regularizer independent of the covering of the space used in the derivation. In addition we lay the learning theoretical framework <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> with information regularization and provide a sample complexity bound. We illustrate the regularization principle in practice by restricting the class of conditional distributions to be logistic regression models and constructing the regularization penalty from a finite set of unlabeled examples. ...|$|R
40|$|Bias, {{precision}} and {{confidence of the}} classification framework are crucial elements for decisions to invest large sums to improve the ecological quality. In this study the statistical <b>principles</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> in relation to WFD are outlined and exemplified. Indicator adjustment to seasonal variation and other significant covariates reduces bias and improves precision. Precision is generally improved using annual means with seasonal adjustment instead of seasonal means. For classification I argue that the balance between costs of monitoring and reduction measures is only fully maintained by the fail-safe approach. The required monitoring efforts to ensure a precise classification are substantially higher than envisaged in WFD, for nutrients and phytoplankton measurements as high as 500 observations to characterise a water body. It must be ensured that sufficient monitoring data become available for classification, while indicator bias and precision is improved through modelling and further development of measurement techniques.

These models should highlight the relevant objects in the domain, as well as their relationships and attributes, removing of the representation the objects that are not important for its consistency in relation to reality. Library and Information Science has been working on theoretical and methodological bases capable of providing for the construction of conceptual models, and therefore knowledge organization systems such as conceptual thesaurus. In Computer Science, whose focus is the representational possibility of communication between systems, seems to have been in recent years, perceptions that allow the modeling part of a domain with independent theories of a domain, like foundational ontologies, applying philosophical and cognitives theories to this process, providing ontological <b>principles</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> of concepts. The aim of this study is, through comparative analysis, to verify if the theoretical and methodological bases used in the construction of conceptual thesauri can contribute to the conceptual development of foundational ontologies, pointing out the existing conceptual thesauri elements that must be observed in the construction of a foundational ontology. The study is based on the analysis of theoretical and methodological bases used in the construction of conceptual models of conceptual thesaurus, the Concept Theory of Ingetraut Dahlberg, Faceted Classification Theory of Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan, in Library and Information Science, and foundational ontologies, from the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO-A), developed by Giancarlo Guizzardi, which is based on principles of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences to build its conceptual model based on objects (endurants). It is concluded that Library and Information Science has theoretical and methodological bases (Concept Theory and Faceted Classification Theory) to build terminological instruments, like conceptual thesaurus, which constitutes a solid knowledge framework that can be created to allow an independent theory about a domain. The foundational ontologies have strong subsidies from Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences, allowing the real structure of a domain is represented in a consistent manner, being the holder of a semantic representation based on the real world, restricting their interpretations of concepts. The foundational ontologies allow the construction of a theory about the field, allowing to test and validate a conceptual model. It is understood that this study helps to make explicit the largest number of differences than similarities between these models and, consequently, between the instruments themselves...|$|E

The requirements shall guarantee a reasonable level of protection for both humans and environment and is intended to create a system taking into account different types of substances and packaging. <b>Principles</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification,</b> packing requirements, testing procedures shall be simple and clear and guarantee that a minimum level of safety can be achieved without advanced technical equipment and expertise. No requirements concerning test temperatures are given in the regulations but in the standard SS-EN-ISO 16104 : 2003 “Packaging – Transport packaging for dangerous goods – Test Methods” the internal hydraulic pressure test, for plastics drums, jerricans and composite packaging, shall be performed at a temperature of + 12 °C, otherwise the internal test pressure shall be adjusted with a pressurization factor corresponding to the temperatures used in the test. At temperatures below + 12 +/- 2 °C the test pressure is increased and if the temperature is higher the pressure is lowered. Correction factors exist from + 2 °C to + 20 °C, and for all temperatures above + 20 °C the correction factor {{is the same as}} for + 20 °C. Neither ADR, IMDG-code, ICAO-TI or the UN-recommendations recommend any test temperature. The aim with this project was to perform internal pressure test at different water temperatures. Three jerricans of each type were tested at the following temperatures: + 3, + 20, + 40 and + 55 °C. As {{can be seen in the}} test results the burst pressure decreases substantially with rising temperature. For jerrican A the burst pressure is reduced from 234 kPa at + 3 °C to 175 kPa at + 20 °C, 151 kPa at 40 °C and 114 kPa at + 55 °C. At + 55 °C the burst pressure is reduced to less than half what it was at + 3 °C. Jerrican B is also reduced from 545 kPA at + 3 °C to 226 kPa at + 55 °C while jerrican C is only reduced from 185 kPa to 136 kPa in the same temperature interval. The gradient of the correction factor in table 3 in EN ISO 16104 : 2003 correspond very well with gradient of the tested jerricans in the temperature span between + 2 °C and + 20 °C. All jerricans were made of PE. The pressure/temperature curves show a linear gradient but indicates that the gradient can differ between different materials. Jerrican A and B are produced by the same manufacturer in the same material and show corresponding behaviour, also corresponding to the correction factors in the standard. Jerrican C is produced by another manufacturer and does not show such significant reduction of burst pressure at higher temperatures...|$|E

But the induction, once made, accomplishes the purposes of colligation likewise.

The criterion for deciding when a group of hypotheses should be “retested ” (a cascade) versus partitioned into smaller groups (“divide-and-conquer”) is motivated by recent theoretical work on optimal search strategies. The key concept is the cost-to-power ratio of a classifier.

40|$|Narratives of Nordic pre-history {{are common}} in {{textbooks}} of the Swedish 'folk school'. This thesis discusses them from an ideological critical perspective and analyses them as textbook myths. This analytic concept of myth is constructed and used {{as a tool for}} studying ideological expressions in pedagogical texts. It is compatible with a historical materialist, social constructivist and Gramsci inspired perspective towards folk schooling and can handle questions of selection and re-organisation of ancient narrative material. The study shows how a paternalistic ethnic ideology which showed the pupils how their ancestors immigrated and set up society and order is replaced by nationalistic myths where the Swedes are projected on the totality of the past. Idealisation of farmers and expressions that neutralise poverty and legitimates subordination are used continuously throughout the study period. After 1868 a national folk concept is established. Textbook myths with a euhemeristic portrayal of civilisation are replaced by other scientific ways of handling pre-historic religions including elements from nature mythology and evolutionary theory. The myths handle religions both through Christian polemics and theological projections. The results of the analyses are interpreted {{in the light of the}} contemporary socio-economic changes where a feudal agrarian society's <b>principles</b> <b>for</b> <b>classifications</b> and hierarchies are challenged and broken by the principles of a class society with a nationalistic ideology. In the concluding chapters the myths are discussed and interpreted in relation to curriculum codes and in a Gramsci inspired perspective as expressions of a passive bourgeois revolution, where intellectuals of the middle class conquered the school and the textbook myths by making alliances with the farming class and trying to neutralise the poor and the working class.

40|$|This study {{examined}} germination and dormancy in Galeopsis speciosa (Lamiaceae), a common summer annual weed in cold-temperate areas. Seeds collected in southern Sweden {{were subjected to}} several experiments. The seeds were dormant at maturity. Seeds sown outdoors after collection produced {{a small number of}} seedlings, that emerged early in the spring. After long cold stratification or stratification outdoors over two winters, the maximum germination was 40 to 50 %; germination occurring over a wide range of temperatures. Warm stratification preceding cold stratification had no effect on germination, but repeated warm and cold periods seemed to promote germination. Gibberellic acid (GA) stimulated germination but full germination was only achieved after more than two months of incubation at the most suitable temperature regime tested. Excised embryos grew and developed into normal seedlings. With these results, the species does not fit into the currently used system <b>for</b> seed dormancy <b>classifications.</b> The response to GA and the growth of excised embryos indicate non-deep or intermediate physiological dormancy, but dormancy alleviation by stratification was not in line with the guiding <b>principles</b> <b>for</b> these <b>classifications.</b> Galeopsis speciosa has a strong dormancy that is sufficiently alleviated during the winter to allow germination of only part of a seed batch each year, hence a stepwise germination pattern occurs {{over a period of several}} years.

40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the basic}} {{prerequisites}} for generating evidence-based data is the availability of classification systems. Attempts to date to classify breast cancer operations have focussed on specific problems, e. g. the avoidance of secondary corrective surgery for surgical defects, rather than taking a generic approach. Methods Starting from an existing, simpler empirical scheme based on the complexity of breast surgical procedures, which was used in-house primarily in operative report-writing, a novel classification of ablative and breast-conserving procedures initially needed to be developed and elaborated systematically. To obtain proof of principle, a prospectively planned analysis of patient records for all major breast cancer-related operations performed at our breast centre in 2005 and 2006 was conducted using the new classification. Data were analysed using basic descriptive statistics such as frequency tables. Results A novel two-type, six-tier classification system comprising 12 main categories, 13 subcategories and 39 sub-subcategories of oncological, oncoplastic and reconstructive breast cancer-related surgery was successfully developed. Our system permitted unequivocal classification, without exception, of all 1225 procedures performed in 1166 breast cancer patients in 2005 and 2006. Conclusion Breast cancer-related surgical procedures can be generically classified according to their surgical complexity. Analysis of all major procedures performed at our breast centre {{during the study period}} provides proof of <b>principle</b> <b>for</b> this novel <b>classification</b> system. We envisage various applications <b>for</b> this <b>classification,</b> including uses in randomised clinical trials, guideline development, specialist surgical training, continuing professional development as well as quality of care and public health research. </p...|$|R
40|$|Integrated Deterministic and Probabilistic Safety Analysis (IDPSA) {{of dynamic}} systems {{calls for the}} {{development}} of efficient methods for accidental scenarios generation. The necessary consideration of failure events timing and sequencing along the scenarios requires the number of scenarios to be generated to increase with respect to conventional PSA. Consequently, their postprocessing for retrieving safety relevant information regarding the system behavior is challenged because of the large amount of generated scenarios that makes the computational cost for scenario postprocessing enormous and the retrieved information difficult to interpret. In the context of IDPSA, the interpretation consists in the classification of the generated scenarios as safe, failed, Near Misses (NMs), and Prime Implicants (PIs). To address this issue, in this paper we propose the use of an ensemble of Semi-Supervised Self-Organizing Maps (SSSOMs) whose outcomes are combined by a locally weighted aggregation according to two strategies: a locally weighted aggregation and a decision tree based aggregation. In the former, we resort to the Local Fusion (LF) <b>principle</b> <b>for</b> accounting the <b>classification</b> reliability of the different SSSOM classifiers, whereas in the latter we build a classification scheme to select the appropriate classifier (or ensemble of classifiers), for the type of scenario to be classified.
