25|$|In 2004, News Corporation {{retained}} {{the services of}} public relations firm Glover Park to launch a campaign aimed at delaying Nielsen's plan to replace its aging household electronic data collection methodology in larger local markets with its newer electronic <b>People</b> <b>Meter</b> system. The advocates in the public relations campaign charged that data derived from the newer <b>People</b> <b>Meter</b> system represented a bias toward underreporting minority viewing, {{which could lead to}} a de facto discrimination in employment against minority actors and writers. However, Nielsen countered the campaign by revealing its sample composition counts. According to Nielsen Media Research's sample composition counts, , nationwide, African American households using People Meters represented 6.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 6.0% in the general population. Latino households represent 5.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 5.0% in the general population. By October 2006, News Corporation and Nielsen settled, with Nielsen agreeing to spend an additional $50 million to ensure that minority viewing was not being underreported by the new electronic <b>people</b> <b>meter</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Media {{planners}} and advertisers used television ratings to broadcast programs on various channels {{to reach the}} target reach. PUT is a television rating {{used to analyze the}} television rating, which is used to strategize and evaluate television viewing on a particular daypart i.e. evening, prime-time, late night. A <b>people</b> <b>meter</b> is used to calculate the viewing habits of TV and cable audiences. PUT gets the ratings figures from <b>people</b> <b>meter.</b> PUT combines the viewing all persons watching the television in a particular house, rather than just reporting specific program viewing. The terms PUT and PVT (Persons viewing television) can be used interchangeably in common usage.|$|E

For several weeks of the winnings streak, Jeopardy! was ranked as TV's highest-rated syndicated program. By the end of Jeopardy!s 20th season several weeks later, the show had surpassed Wheel of Fortune in the ratings but Wheel, which is usually paired with Jeopardy! in programming, also benefited from Jennings' streak.|$|E

50|$|The {{debut of}} {{personal}} <b>people</b> <b>meters</b> in 2010 meant {{changes for the}} show. Other stations succeeded with more music and less talk, so the show was adding music and cutting down on time spent with callers. Not all listeners accepted the changes.|$|R
25|$|In October 2007, {{their share}} of the 18–34 {{demographic}} in New York City slipped, ranking second in the mornings overall with a 2.1% share. Following the introduction of the portable <b>people</b> <b>meter</b> ratings system in 2008, Opie and Anthony failed to reach top 10 in morning drive; WXRK ranked 20th out of 24 stations overall, and outside the top 10 in the coveted 25–54 demographic. In October 2007, following insufficient ratings, WYSP in Philadelphia dropped the show in favor of a rock music format. On December 1, 2008, the show was dropped at WBCN in Boston in favor of the local The Toucher and Rich Show, and WKRK in Cleveland switched to an alternative rock format. The final Opie and Anthony broadcast aired on WXRK in New York City on March 9, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Season 7 of American Idol overall was {{the most}} watched primetime program in the United States for the fourth {{consecutive}} year, during {{the conclusion of the}} 2007-2008 television season. [...] The Tuesday episode viewership averaged 27.665 million while the Wednesday episode averaged 26.843 million, taking the top 2 spots for the season. [...] The show helped Fox become the most watched overall television network in the U.S. {{for the first time in}} its history (as well as a record first for a non-Big Three major network in American television history), and lead the 18-49 demographic ratings with still-standing largest ever margin since the introduction of the <b>people</b> <b>meter</b> technology in the Nielsen nationwide television tallies during the 1985-1986 television season.|$|E
2500|$|NPR {{stations}} {{generally do}} not subscribe to the Arbitron rating service and {{are not included in}} published ratings and rankings such as Radio & Records. However, NPR station listenership is measured by Arbitron in both Diary and PPM (<b>people</b> <b>meter)</b> markets. NPR stations are frequently not included in [...] "summary level" [...] diary data used by most advertising agencies for media planning. Data on NPR listening can be accessed using [...] "respondent level" [...] diary data. Additionally, all radio stations (public and commercial) are treated equally within the PPM data sets making NPR station listenership data much more widely available to the media planning community. According to Arbitron's National Broadcast Audience Estimate report for September 29, 2011, NPR's signature morning news program, Morning Edition, is the network's most popular program, drawing 12.9 million listeners a week, with its afternoon newsmagazine, All Things Considered, a close second, with 12.2 million listeners a week. Arbitron data is also provided by Radio Research Consortium, a non-profit corporation which subscribes to the Arbitron service and distributes the data to NPR and other non-commercial stations and on its website.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{metering}} {{technology is}} the heart of the Nielsen ratings process. Two types of meters are used: set meters capture what channel is being tuned, while <b>People</b> <b>Meters</b> go a step further and gather information about who is watching the channel at that time.|$|R

5000|$|In the mid-2000s, {{networks}} cried foul, blaming Nielsen for inaccurate rating measurements. This {{public attention}} {{was just the}} beginning, as Nielsen implemented its automated Local <b>People</b> <b>Meter</b> (LPM) technology. The LPM marked the shift from active, diary based local measurement to more passive, meter-monitored measurement of local markets. Technologically, the LPM {{is very similar to}} the original Nielsen <b>People</b> <b>Meter.</b> The key advancement was that the LPM provided accurate measurements of particular local markets. The LPM system has also allowed the industry to measure year-round, rather than the quarterly [...] "sweeps" [...] periods. Researchers believed that the LPM more accurately reported the full range of programming viewers watched, including that while channel-surfing. Arbitron's Portable <b>People</b> <b>Meter</b> uses a microphone to pick up and record subaudible tones embedded in broadcasts by an encoder at each station or network. It has even been used to track in-store radio.|$|E
50|$|Until 1991, AGB McNair {{provided}} television ratings data, covering only {{homes in}} Sydney and Melbourne. From 1991 until 2000, 'Nielsen Media Research Australia' was {{the company that}} measured television ratings, introducing <b>People</b> <b>meters</b> for the first time. From 2001 onwards, OzTAM and Regional TAM took over. OzTAM is wholly owned by the three commercial broadcasters (Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten), while Regional TAM is owned {{by a number of}} regional broadcasters, however both operate independently.|$|R
50|$|In TV {{advertising}} measurement, single-source {{data are}} used to explore an individual’s loyalty and buying behavior in relation to advertising exposure within different windows of time - e.g. year, quarter, month, week. In this sense, single-source data is a compilation of (1) Home-scanned sales records and/or loyalty card purchases from retail or grocery stores and other commerce operations, (2) TV tune-in data from cable set top boxes or <b>people</b> <b>meters</b> (pushbutton or passive) or household tuning meters, and (3) Household demographic information.|$|R

50|$|The <b>People</b> <b>Meter</b> is a 'box', {{about the}} size of a {{paperback}} book. The box is hooked up to each television set and is accompanied by a remote control unit. Each family member in a sample household is assigned a personal 'viewing button'. It identifies each household member's age and sex. If the TV is turned on and the viewer doesn't identify themselves, the meter flashes to remind them. Additional buttons on the <b>People</b> <b>Meter</b> enable guests to participate in the sample by recording their age, sex and viewing status into the system.|$|E
50|$|Before the <b>People</b> <b>Meter</b> advances, Nielsen {{used the}} diary method, which {{consisted}} of viewers physically recording the shows they watched. However, there were setbacks with the system. Lower-rated stations claimed the diary method was inaccurate and biased. They argued that because they had lower ratings, those who depended on memory for the diary method may only remember to track their favorite shows. Stations also argued that if it wasn’t low ratings that skewed the diary method, {{it might also be}} the new variety of channels for viewers to choose from. Viewers {{may not be able to}} record everything they watch and there is no way of discovering the truth. Finally in 1986, Nielsen developed an electronic meter, <b>People</b> <b>Meter,</b> to solve the problem. The <b>People</b> <b>Meter</b> is an electronic method of television measurement that moved from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored. The meter also recorded real time simultaneously viewing, reducing memory bias.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, {{following}} {{the cancellation of}} KIRO's short-lived long-form newscast - [...] "The Big Story with Tony Miner" [...] - the Ron & Don Show was extended by an hour to its current time slot of 3:00pm to 7:00pm. As of winter 2008 the program was designated as the top rated radio show in its time slot in the Seattle-Tacoma market but in summer of 2009 Arbitron's introduction of PPM's (Personal <b>People</b> <b>Meters)</b> dropped the now FM-only KIRO along with [...] "Ron and Don" [...] to approximately 15th in the market.|$|R
5000|$|The {{criticism}} in the media is primarily about the system design (low speed and capacity), {{the route of the}} monorail and the idea of elevated platform transport (it is alleged that a tram can have the same capacity and speed).For example, the journalist Alexandr Lebedev noted:The amount of space per person on the monorail (either 200 people with 5 <b>people</b> per <b>meter</b> squared or 290 people at an average of about 8 <b>people</b> per <b>meter</b> squared) has been criticized as too little space for something deemed an [...] "alternative to the light metro". For example, journalist Elena Komarova wrote in 2006 that: ...|$|R
2500|$|A more technologically {{sophisticated}} {{system uses}} Set Meters, which are small devices connected to televisions in selected homes. These devices gather the viewing {{habits of the}} home and transmit the information nightly to Nielsen through a [...] "Home Unit" [...] connected to a phone line. The technology-based home unit system is meant to allow market researchers to study television viewing habits on a minute to minute basis, seeing the exact moment viewers change channels or turn off their television set. In addition to set meters, individual viewer reporting devices, such as <b>people</b> <b>meters,</b> have allowed the company to separate household viewing information into various demographic groups.|$|R

50|$|Along with {{changing}} their counting methods, Nielsen also started emphasizing their sample in 2003 {{in reaction to}} census shifts and requests from some industry sectors. Nielsen’s automated Local <b>People</b> <b>Meter</b> (LPM) technology was introduced in New York and Los Angeles. The LPM improved the method of measurement from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored. More importantly, the LPM provides accurate measurements to particular local markets, verse a nationwide sample from the <b>People</b> <b>meter.</b> While diary-based surveys concentrated on quarterly “sweeps” periods, the industry has been pushed towards year-round measurement, due to the automated LPM system.|$|E
