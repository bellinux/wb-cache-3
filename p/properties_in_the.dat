5|$|A {{cultivator}} of olives, Davenport {{had planted}} {{a limited number}} of olives around Beaumont House in 1852 after he purchased the land the year before.

As {{a result of this}} initiative, Valley View {{was one of the first}} eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register. The other seven were Capon Chapel, Fort Kuykendall, Hickory Grove, Hook Tavern, North River Mills Historic District, Old Pine Church and Springfield Brick House. The house at Valley View was listed on the NRHP on December12, 2012.|$|E

5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the debts}} {{related to the}} costs for the {{construction}} of the building having been settled in the early-mid 19th century, and the church ceasing to exist 100 years later, the three acts of Parliament allowing trustees of the church to levy rates on <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parish for the purpose of settling those debts remained in force and untouched until the Law Commission proposed their repeal in July 2014, with a view to presenting recommendations to Parliament in 2015.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th {{century the}} economy of Southampton {{improved}} {{as a result of}} the Italian wool trade and the presence of many foreign merchants. The Medieval Merchant's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants, but it remained intact as a detached dwelling, unlike many other <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century. In the middle of the 16th century, however, Southampton's economy collapsed once again as trade with Italy declined, taking with it the prosperity of FrenchStreet. A new parlour was installed in the house, and a floor was added halfway across the open hall to produce additional sleeping space.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 Liverpool Corporation {{attempted}} {{to acquire the}} entire area to safeguard its water supply, and proposed demolishing the entire village. The Act of Parliament known as the Liverpool Corporation Act 1902 protected some buildings but others were left vulnerable. The Act allowed the corporation to acquire by compulsory purchase <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west of the village, including the Black-a-Moors Head public house (known locally as the 'Black Lad') and New Hall, which were demolished between 1902 and 1905. The result was the small settlement that has remained largely unchanged since then.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Housing Act 1980 gave council tenants {{the right}} to buy their homes. In light of this, a group of 1500 <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area was given Conservation Area status, and Plumbe's {{northern}} section of the estate was granted Article Four Direction by Michael Heseltine, Secretary of State for the Environment, preventing any alterations to the external appearances of the properties without planning permission, in recognition of its architectural and historic interest. St Mark's Church was meanwhile Grade II listed. However, these measures have not been consistently enforced, and Noel Park has been cited in a report by English Heritage as a prominent example of the failure of conservation areas.|$|E

Following this survey, the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place these identified structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places. Preparation of the necessary documentation for Hebron Church, French's Mill, Yellow Spring Mill, and the Nathaniel and Isaac Kuykendall House began in April 2013, when Governor Earl Ray Tomblin awarded $10,500 to the Hampshire County Commission. The cost of the commission's documentation of the history and significance of the four properties was $15,000, of which the county paid $4,500.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Chinese {{community}} leaders secured approximately 50ten-year leases on <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newly developing Chinatown. Jim Moy, {{director of the}} Association, then decided that a Chinese-style building should be constructed as a strong visual announcement of the Chinese community's new presence in the area. With no Chinese-born architects in Chicago at the time, Chicago-born Norse architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad were asked to design the On Leong Merchants Association Building {{in the spring of}} 1926. Moy decided to employ the pair again after Michaelsen and Rognstad's firm built Moy's Peacock Inn in Uptown in 1920.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century farming {{became less}} {{economic}} when {{construction of the}} reservoirs reduced the amount of agricultural land in the village. The weaving industry was mechanised, small mines closed and the population declined further when <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village were demolished in the early 20th century. Agriculture, mainly sheep farming, continues although on a small scale. Tourism at Rivington began in Victorian times and after the reservoirs were filled in the 1860s {{was known as the}} Little Lake District. Rivington became a popular destination when Lever Park opened in 1904. From the late Victorian period until the mid-20th century tourists from Bolton travelled on day trips by tram along Chorley New Road and then on to Rivington on foot, many more visitors arrived by train.|$|E

Potential dangers for both cultural and natural sites include development projects, armed conflicts, insufficient management systems or changes in the legal protective status of the <b>properties.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of cultural sites, gradual changes due to geology, climate or environment can also be potential dangers.|$|E
5|$|James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas, the 12th Earl of Angus, was forced, due to {{gambling}} debts accrued {{by himself}} and his father, to consolidate his estates. The ruins of Tantallon were sold, in 1699, to Sir Hew Dalrymple, the President of the Court of Session, who also owned the Barony of North Berwick, the Bass, Fidra and other <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Dalrymple allowed the castle to decay further, and to be quarried {{to a certain extent}} for stone. Sir Walter Scott described the castle at length in his 1808 epic poem Marmion. Some restoration was carried out by the Dalrymples in the late 19th century, and in 1924, the castle was handed over to the UK Government's Office of Works by Dalrymple's descendant, Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple, Bt. It is now in the care of Historic Scotland as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
5|$|Korketrekkeren was {{originally}} part of Frognerseterveien, a road which {{ran up to}} Frognerseteren. It was completed in 1867 to the orders of landlord Thomas Johannessen Heftye, who had been purchasing forest <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The section between Svendstuen and Frognerseteren gradually became known as Korktrekkeren. Holmen- og Voksenkollselskapet was established in 1888 and undertook a series of public infrastructure investments in the area, including the construction of roads, skiing trails, natural tobagganing tracks and a chapel. The property was given to Kristiania Municipality (today Oslo Municipality) in 1894. Tobagganing became a popular sport from the 1880s and Holmen- og Voksenkollselskapet rented out sleds which were permitted to be used on roads and designated tracks after 19:00 on evenings with moonlight.|$|E
