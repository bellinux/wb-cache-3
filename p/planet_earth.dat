5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} iridium in the <b>planet</b> <b>Earth</b> is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} <b>planet</b> <b>Earth)</b> {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on <b>planet</b> <b>Earth.</b> They are {{rare in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean and generally form only once every several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|On 29 and 30 May, {{biological}} and medical experiments were performed and the Oasis garden was started. Studies of the stars, <b>planets,</b> <b>Earth</b> and its atmosphere were started on 2 and 3 June. Some 2,000 {{photographs of the}} Earth and 600 of the sun were reported taken.|$|R

5|$|Human {{cultures}} have developed many {{views of the}} <b>planet.</b> <b>Earth</b> is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity, and by the mid-20th century, the Gaia Principle compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.|$|E
5|$|Scientific data on {{the water}} {{currents}} and food availability of the seamount was collected, as was information on the age and growth patterns of the corals themselves. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) filmed the cruise for their series, <b>Planet</b> <b>Earth.</b> A total of 70 hours of observations and 102 deep-sea animal and rock specimens were collected during the cruise. The expedition, which lasted from January 26 through February 4, made use if the MBARI's research vessel Western Flyer and the ROV Tiburon.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the album's artwork was by Hipgnosis, the company {{responsible}} for previous Wings album covers such as Venus and Mars (1975) and the recent Wings Greatest compilation (1978). The front cover depicts the five members of Wings in a room, looking down through space at <b>Planet</b> <b>Earth</b> through an open hatchway in the floor; the picture was taken by photographer John Shaw at his London studio. Photos of the individual band members appeared on the back cover, credited to Linda and Paul McCartney.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, {{a planet}} {{was found by}} the Anglo-Australian Planet Search team to be {{orbiting}} the star in a very eccentric orbit. It has a minimum mass {{more than three times}} that of Jupiter and has an orbital period of over three years. The planet orbits its star at a distance of approximately two AU away; the <b>planet</b> <b>Earth,</b> in comparison, orbits at a distance of one AU away from the Sun. HD 2039 b's discovery was reported quietly; no press release was provided by the observatory that discovered the star's planet, and no formal announcement of the planet's existence was made. The entity was the 100th exoplanet to have been verified by the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of <b>planet</b> <b>earth.</b> The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} The Life and Death of <b>Planet</b> <b>Earth,</b> authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee {{have argued that}} some form of animal life may {{continue}} even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.|$|E

5|$|Jason X (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last {{performance}} as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon {{in a research}} facility, {{where it has been}} determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the <b>planet</b> <b>Earth</b> 2, burning in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, no {{official}} album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs {{featured in the}} film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release. Two singles of The Sounds, Dance with Me and Rock 'n Roll, were promoted on Kimberly's car stereo. Besides these, the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film's DVD. Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. Rocky Mountain High by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed My Name is Death during Brian's death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC/DC (on Kimberly's car AV), Jon F. Hennessy by FT (on Rory's vehicle audio), Vitamin by Incubus (during Evan's house fire) and I Got You by (hed) <b>Planet</b> <b>Earth</b> (during Rory's party).|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is in a humid {{subtropical}} region. Oklahoma lies in {{a transition}} zone between humid continental climate to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern portions of the state. Most of the state {{lies in a}}n area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on <b>planet</b> <b>Earth.</b> An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.|$|E
