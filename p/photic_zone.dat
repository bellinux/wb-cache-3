However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the <b>photic</b> <b>zone</b> has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here.

Their produc-tivity arises from wind-driven upwelling of nutrient-rich water into the <b>photic</b> <b>zones</b> of coastal oceans and supports 20 % of global fish-ery yield (1). Upwelling also transports oxygen-poor waters onto productive continental shelves, where respiration can further reduce water-column dissolved oxygen (DO) content and thus subject coastal ecosystems {{to the risk of}} hypoxia or anoxia. Of the world’s four major eastern boundary current systems, water-column shelf anoxia is previously known for only the Humboldt and Benguela Current systems (2).

40|$|As {{the first}} enzyme in the carbon-fixation pathway {{employed}} {{by the majority of}} autotrophs, rubisco is the both cornerstone of the productivity in the <b>photic</b> <b>zones</b> of the world’s oceans and prevalent in the seafloor chemoautotrophic habitats of hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. The presence of rubisco in the subphotic water column, however, has not been addressed. This study presents the results of a PCR screen of the water column of Monterey Bay for the presence of Form II rubisco, via DNA depth profiles and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries. A novel group of Form II rubisco was found in the 750 m BAC library, and two major clades of Form II rubiscos were found between 100 m and 3000 m deep. Although the identity of these potential autotrophs has not yet been determined, they may provide insight into the physiology of the some of the uncultivated microorganisms in the sea, as well as expand our understanding of the marine component of the global carbon cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} which microborings occur in Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous macrofossils (mainly brachiopods and lamellibranchiats), and to determine to what extent microborings {{can be used to}} reconstruct the palaeodepth of an environment. The specimens were selected from seven different Mesozoic basins: Wessex Basin, Paris Basin, Rhone Basin, South-German shelf-sea, Keltiberian area, Lusitanian Basin, Tethys area. Preference e was given to samples that came from deposits where certain facies parameters were already known. A special technique of preparation (Cast-Embedding-Technique) together with SEM was used to register and document the microborings. Present in the samples a total of 34 ichnotaxa and ichnoforms were distinguished. These microborings were compared with microborings made by modern endoliths. Similarities occur with endoliths of the following groups of organisms: Cyanophyta/Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, Fungi, Rhizopoda, Porifera, Phoronoida and Bryozoa. For 18 specimen units the conventional facies interpretation was compared to the actualistic interpretation of the ichnocoenose. The results of these comparisons lead to the characterisation of four ichnocoenoses which are typical for distinct <b>photic</b> <b>zones.</b> (orig.)

5|$|Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous Scleractinia coral genera {{failed to}} cross the K–Pg {{boundary}} into the Paleocene.

The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the <b>photic</b> <b>zone)</b> areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg boundary. Colonial coral species rely upon symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K–Pg boundary, however, the use of data from coral fossils to support K–Pg extinction and subsequent Paleocene recovery, must be weighed against the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the <b>photic</b> <b>zone</b> down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E

40|$|Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) {{is one of}} the Earth’s most {{abundant}} organosulphur molecules, a signalling molecule, a key nutrient for marine microorganisms, and the major precursor for gaseous dimethyl sulphide (DMS). DMS, another infochemical in signalling pathways, is important in global sulphur cycling 2, and affects the Earth’s albedo, and potentially climate, via sulphate aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei production. It was thought that only eukaryotes produce significant amounts of DMSP, but here we demonstrate that many marine heterotrophic bacteria also produce DMSP, likely using the same methionine (Met) transamination pathway as macroalgae and phytoplankton 10. We identify the first DMSP synthesis gene in any organism, dsyB, which encodes the key methyltransferase enzyme of this pathway and is a reliable reporter for bacterial DMSP synthesis in marine alphaproteobacteria. DMSP production and dsyB transcription are upregulated by increased salinity, nitrogen limitation and lower temperatures in our model DMSP-producing bacterium Labrenzia aggregata LZB 033. With significant numbers of dsyB homologues in marine metagenomes, we propose that bacteria likely make a significant contribution to oceanic DMSP production. Furthermore, since DMSP production is not solely associated with obligate phototrophs, the process need not be confined to the <b>photic</b> <b>zones</b> of marine environments, and as such may have been underestimate...|$|R
40|$|Excavations in the <b>photic</b> <b>zones</b> of caves have {{provided}} cornerstone archaeological sequences {{in many parts}} of the world. Before the appearance of modern dating techniques, cave deposits provided clear evidence for the antiquity, relative ages and co-occurrence of ancient human remains, material culture and fauna. Earlier generations of archaeologists had generally rather limited understanding of taphonomic and depositional processes, but the twentieth century saw considerable improvement in excavation and analytical techniques. The advent of modern dating and chronological methodologies offers very powerful tools for the analysis of cave fill deposits and this has resulted in the recognition of chronological incoherence in parts of some sites, with consequent re-evaluation of previous archaeological disputes. Obtaining multiple dates per context provides a means to assess the integrity and coherence of the archaeological and environmental records from cave fills. In the case of the Haua Fteah (Libya), this technique allowed the recognition of chronological coherence in low-energy depositional environments and limited recycling in high-energy contexts. We provide a conceptual model of the relationship between recycling, sedimentation rate and process energy. High-resolution investigation enables recognition of the complexity of the formation of cave sequences, thus an increasingly sophisticated understanding of human behaviour and environmental relationships in the past, and potentially gives a new life to old data...|$|R
40|$|In late Paleocene-Eocene times, in the Tethyan area, the shallowest {{and most}} {{restricted}} carbonates deposited between the intertidal zone {{and the lower}} limit of the upper <b>photic</b> <b>zones</b> are characterized by Spirolina -dominated facies. This extremely shallow-water carbonate facies is recorded from the Cenomanian to the Miocene in the Tethyan realm with similar sedimentological characters and similar spiroliniform epiphytic taxa. All these taxa can be considered to reflect some kind of vicariance through time. In Southern Italy this peculiar facies {{is represented by the}} Trentinara Formation (Lower-Middle Eocene); in several stratigraphic sequences of this formation, three levels containing alveolinids were identified. The first is well known in the literature and allows us to assign the lowermost part of the Formation to the lowermost Ypresian (bio-chronozone SBZ 6, Alveolina ellipsoidalis zone); the second is not age diagnostic because alveolinids are rare and poorly preserved; the third allows the age of {{the upper part of the}} Trentinara Formation to be established as Early Lutetian (bio-chronozone SBZ 13, Alveolina stipes zone). The exact age of the top of the formation is still unclear, but probably falls within the Lutetian-Priabonian interval. The geographic locations of the most significant shallow-water carbonates of Early-Middle Eocene age, cropping out in the southern Apennines, have led to a first attempt to map their distribution within the central gyre of western Tethys.  </p...|$|R

Each species shows a similar but complex arrangement of layers with a cornea split into dermal and scleral components. The dermal cornea comprises an epithelium overlying a basement membrane and a dermal stroma with sutures and occasional keratocytes. Nezumia aequalis is the only species to possess a Bowman 2 ̆ 7 s layer, although it is not well-developed. The scleral cornea is separated from the dermal cornea by a mucoid layer and, in contrast to shallow-water species, is divided into three main layers; an anterior scleral stroma, a middle or iridescent layer and a posterior scleral stroma. The iridescent layer of collagen and intercalated cells or cellular processes is bounded by a layer of cells and the posterior scleral stroma overlies a Descemet 2 ̆ 7 s membrane and an endothelium. In the relatively shallow-water Microgadus proximus, the keratocytes of the dermal stroma, the cells of the iridescent layer and the endothelial cells all contain aligned endoplasmic reticulum, which may elicit an iridescent reflex. No alignment of the endoplasmic reticulum was found in N. aequalis or Coryphanoides (Nematonurus) armatus.

40|$|A {{data-driven}} {{method for}} describing the benthic cover type based on full-waveform bathymetric LiDAR data analysis is presented. The waveform of the bathymetric LiDAR return pulse is first modeled as a sum of three functions: a Gaussian pulse representing the surface return, a function modeling the backscatter and another Gaussian pulse modeling the {{return from the}} bottom surface. Two sets of variables are formed: one containing features describing the bottom return and the other describing various conditions, such as water quality {{and the depth of}} the seabed. Regression analysis is used to eliminate the effect of the condition variables on the features, after which the features are mapped onto a cell lattice using a self-organizing map (SOM). The cells of the SOM are grouped into seven clusters using the neighborhood distance matrix method. The clustering result is evaluated using the seabed substrate map based on sonar measurements, as well as delineation of <b>photic</b> <b>zones</b> in the study area. High correspondence between the clusters and the substrate type/photic zone has been obtained indicating that the proposed clustering method adequately describes the benthic cover in the study area. The bottom return pulse waveforms corresponding to the clusters and a cluster map of the study area are also presented. The method can be used for clustering full waveform bathymetric LiDAR data acquired from large areas to discover the structure of benthic cover types and to focus the field studies accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Although living {{beyond the}} {{penetration}} limits of sunlight, many deep-sea teleosts possess large eyes, lenses capable of accommodation, and various adaptations for increasing sensitivity and extending their visual field. However, {{little is known}} {{of the extent of}} the visual field and whether the spatial resolving power of the eye is constant across the retina. In order to examine whether these fish are specialized for acute vision in particular regions of the visual field, retinal wholemounts were used to examine the regional differences in the density of retinal ganglion cells in 16 species from different depths, habitats and <b>photic</b> <b>zones.</b> It was found that the retinal ganglion cell topography changes markedly across the retina with a density range of 6. 3 - 50. 6 x 10 / 3 cells mm - 2 in a pattern unique to each species. A number of mesopelagic species including the lanternfishes, Lampanyctus macdonaldi and Myctophum punctatum possess a concentric increase in cell density towards the retinal margins, putatively enhancing peripheral vision. Three tubular-eyed species including Scopelarchus michaelsarsi possess an area centralis in the centro-lateral region of the main retina supporting the premise that this specialization receives a focused image. Some benthic species such as the smoothhead Rouleina attrita and the searsid Searsia koefoedi also boast a structural specialization or fovea in temporal retina with centro-peripheral cell gradients exceeding 30 : 1. Benthic species such as the tripodfish Bathypterois dubius possess two regional increases in ganglion cell density or areae centrales, one nasal and the other temporal, thereby increasing spatial resolving power in the caudal and rostral visual fields, respectively. These quantitative analyses suggest that deep-sea fishes, like their shallow-water counterparts, also use a specific region of their visual field for acute vision. This may be an advantage for the detection and localization of bioluminescent light sources...|$|R

25|$|Fluorescence {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} {{absorption}} of electromagnetic radiation at one wavelength and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength. Thus any type of fluorescence depends {{on the presence of}} external sources of light. Biologically functional fluorescence is found in the <b>photic</b> <b>zone,</b> where there is not only enough light to cause biofluorescence, but enough light for other organisms to detect it. The visual field in the <b>photic</b> <b>zone</b> is naturally blue, so colors of fluorescence can be detected as bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens. Green is the most commonly found color in the biofluorescent spectrum, yellow the second most, orange the third, and red is the rarest. Fluorescence can occur in organisms in the aphotic zone as a byproduct of that same organism’s bioluminescence. Some biofluorescence in the aphotic zone is merely a byproduct of the organism’s tissue biochemistry and does not have a functional purpose. However, some cases of functional and adaptive significance of biofluorescence in the aphotic zone of the deep ocean is an active area of research.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the petrology, geochemistry, and palaeoecology {{of the west}} Sicilian Jurassic deposits and, where possible, compares them to similar facies elsewhere in the Alpine-Mediterranean region. The Liassic platform carbonates form the greatest part of the west Sicilian Jurassic in terms of thickness these {{are a series of}} white limestones and dolomites whose shallow-water origin is suggested by the presence of such structures as Stromatactis, birdseyes, and shrinkage cracks - and the component lithologies which include pelletal, oolitic and stromatolitic facies. The modern Bahamian pattern of sedimentation compares well with the reconstructed depositional environment of these rocks. Crinoidal limestones, which cap the Liassic platform carbonates, usually occur as discontinuous lenses, and these are interpreted as sand-waves deposited on oceanic seamounts - seamounts which were formed after the carbonate platform had disintegrated during the Lias. The Toarcian iron pisolites, which may also cap the white Liassic limestones, are considered to result from volcanic emanations that accompanied this disintegration. Fossil manganese nodules, which occur in condensed sequences of Middle Jurassic age, have been subject to detailed investigation, and these ancient concretions are comparable in their structure, mineralogy and geochemistry to Recent oceanic iron-manganese accumulations. The condensed sequences themselves - like the crinoidal calc-arenites and the iron pisolites - are interpreted as seamount deposits formed as the presence of stromatolites, boring algae and herbivorous gastropods suggests, in shallow <b>photic</b> <b>zones.</b> Seamount evolution in the Upper Jurassic followed two patterns: the seamounts either sank with the consequent formation of more basinal deposits such as red nodular limestones and radiolarites, or with possible uplift, were the site of more massive carbonate production, with the formation of oolitic and pelletal deposits. Finally, in the Tithonian and extending into the Neocomian, a more uniformly basinal coccolith ooze covered much of the area...|$|R
40|$|Okenone is a {{carotenoid}} pigment {{unique to}} certain members of Chromatiaceae, the dominant family of purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) found in euxinic <b>photic</b> <b>zones.</b> Diagenetic alteration of okenone produces okenane, the only recognized molecular fossil unique to PSB. The in vivo concentrations of okenone and bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchl a) {{on a per}} cell basis were monitored and quantified {{as a function of}} light intensity in continuous cultures of the purple sulfur bacterium Marichromatium purpuratum (Mpurp 1591). We show that okenone-producing PSB have constant bacteriochlorophyll to carotenoid ratios in light-harvesting antenna complexes. The in vivo concentrations of Bchl a, 0. 151 ± 0. 012 fmol cell^(− 1), and okenone, 0. 103 ± 0. 012 fmol cell^(− 1), were not dependent on average light intensity (10 – 225 Lux) at both steady and non-steady states. This observation revealed that in autotrophic continuous cultures of Mpurp 1591, there was a constant ratio for okenone to Bchl a of 1 : 1. 5. Okenone was therefore constitutively produced in planktonic cultures of PSB, regardless of light intensity. This confirms the legitimacy of okenone as a signature for autotrophic planktonic PSB and by extrapolation water column euxinia. We measured the δ^(13) C, δ^(15) N, and δ^(34) S bulk biomass values from cells collected daily and determined the isotopic fractionations of Mpurp 1591. There was no statistical relationship in the bulk isotope measurements or stable isotope fractionations to light intensity or cell density under steady and non-steady-state conditions. The carbon isotope fractionation between okenone and Bchl a with respect to overall bulk biomass (^(13) ε_pigment – biomass) was 2. 2 ± 0. 4 ‰ and − 4. 1 ± 0. 9 ‰, respectively. The carbon isotopic fractionation (^(13) ε_pigment-CO_ 2) for the production of pigments in PSB is more variable than previously thought with our reported values for okenone at − 15. 5 ± 1. 2 ‰ and − 21. 8 ± 1. 7 ‰ for Bchl a...|$|R

40|$|Baited remote {{underwater}} stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) {{were developed}} to determine fish abundance and size structure in a more unbiased, and relatively non-invasive manner across {{a broader range of}} depths and habitats than conventional sampling methods achieve. These characteristics make stereo-BRUVs particularly useful for research inside marine protected areas (MPAs) where researchers are required to minimize disturbance to the protected environment. Although stereo-BRUVs have been widely used around the world, they are novel to South Africa and standardised protocols for their application are required. As such, this study aimed to address i) the effect of different bait types, namely pilchard (Sardinops sagax), squid (Loligo reynaudi) and bivalves (Crassostrea gigas and Perna perna) on the observed reef fish assemblage structure and ii) the effect of artificial illumination (lighting) on the observed reef fish assemblage structure sampled with stereo-BRUVs. One key component of the stereo-BRUVs methodology is the application of bait to attract fish into the field of view. Globally, pilchard is the most often used bait type for stereo- BRUVs, however, its suitability has never been tested comparatively against other bait types for South African conditions. Significant differences in fish abundance and assemblage structure were recorded between stereo-BRUVs deployments when applying the different bait types. The bivalve baits, oyster and mussel, were typically poor when sampling the reef fish assemblages of the region. Pilchard and squid were sampled in similar communities and were able to attract the majority of the reef fish from the region, suggesting they are suitable bait types for stereo-BRUVs in the Agulhas ecoregion. However, a power analysis indicated that roughly twice the amount of samples are required to effectively sample the same abundances of Chrysoblephus laticeps (roman) and Cheilodactylidae (fingerfins) species when sampling with squid as opposed to pilchard. Both bait types can be locally sourced, however, squid is considerably more expensive than pilchard. Considering the difference in cost, together with the fact that twice as much squid bait is required, squid is not a cost-effective option relative to pilchard. As such this study recommends that pilchard is the most appropriate bait for the Agulhas ecoregion of South Africa. Due to low light levels, artificial lighting is required when conducting remote video research in the sub-photic zone. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colour lights and attenuates slower through water. In addition, blue lighting has no recorded effect on fish behaviour and {{has proven to be a}} successful light colour for underwater sampling. The use of lighting is unavoidable for sub-photic stereo-BRUVs sampling and is recommended for all stereo-BRUVs sampling for comparability of data from environments characterised by different light levels. A study was conducted to test the necessity of artificial lighting when sampling from environments characterised by ambient light levels adequate for stereo- BRUVs sampling, a comparative to measure the effect of light on the fish assemblage structure. Of the more commonly detected fish species (those observed in > 50 % of the samples), most were seen at similar abundances in samples using lighting and in those without lighting. No significant differences were observed in fish length data between samples collected with and samples collected without lighting. This suggests that standardised stereo-BRUVs sampling across <b>photic</b> <b>zones</b> on the continental shelf of South Africa can be collected without blue lighting when ambient light levels are sufficient to see the survey area...|$|R
40|$|AimTo {{determine}} {{the composition and}} biomass of functional groups around the vertical and temporal gradient correlated with environmental conditions and apply the index Q in a water-supply reservoir. MethodsWater samples were collected monthly (n = 92) between 2009 and 2011 in two points of the dam for physicochemical and biological analysis. ResultsThe pH, dissolved oxygen and water temperature showed {{significant differences between the}} <b>photic</b> and aphotic <b>zones</b> (p< 0. 05). The vertical variation of dissolved oxygen and water temperature, showed a profile of stratification. The phytoplankton community was represented by 11 functional groups: S 1, M, H 1, Lo, P, F, SN, J, W 2, MP and R. ConclusionsThe vertical variations were less pronounced than the temporal variations in the phytoplankton community. The Q index pointed out poor water quality, corresponding to the current state of eutrophication in the reservoir and it was sensitive to responsive to environmental and hydrodynamic changes in these systems, demonstrating to be an appropriate tool for monitoring and evaluating the quality of water in tropical semi-arid reservoirs...|$|R
