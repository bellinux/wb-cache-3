We {{address the issue of}} rapidly identifying a subset of candidates whose response best match a reference response curve. In order to keep the number of calls to the accurate flow simulator computationally tractable, a recent distance-based approach relying on fast proxy simulations is revisited, and turned into a non-stationary kriging method where the covariance kernel is obtained by combining a classical kernel with the proxy. Once the accurate simulator has been run for an initial subset of <b>parameter</b> <b>fields</b> and a kriging metamodel has been inferred, the predictive distributions of misfits for the remaining <b>parameter</b> <b>fields</b> {{can be used as a}} guide to select candidate <b>parameter</b> <b>fields</b> in a sequential way.

40|$|International audienceAtmospheric {{chemistry}} and air-quality numerical models {{are driven by}} uncertain forcing ﬁelds: emissions, boundary conditions, wind ﬁelds, vertical turbulent diffusivity, kinetic chemical rates, etc. Data assimilation can help to assess these <b>parameters</b> or <b>ﬁelds</b> of <b>parameters.</b> Because such parameters are often much more uncertain than the ﬁelds diagnosed in meteorology and oceanography, data assimilation is much more of an inverse modelling challenge in this context. In this article these ideas are experimented with by revisiting the Chernobyl accident dispersion event over Europe. A fast four-dimensional variational scheme (4 D-Var) is developed, which seems appropriate for the retrieval of large <b>parameter</b> <b>ﬁelds</b> from large observation sets and the retrieval of parameters that are nonlinearly related to concentrations. The 4 D-Var, and especially an approximate adjoint of the transport model, is tested and validated using several advection schemes that are inﬂuential on the forward simulation {{as well as on}} the data-assimilation results. Firstly, the inverse modelling system is applied to the assessment of the dry and wet deposition parameters. It is then applied to the retrieval of the emission ﬁeld alone, the joint optimization of removal-process parameters and source parameters and the optimization of larger <b>parameter</b> <b>ﬁelds</b> such as horizontal and vertical diffusivities or the dry-deposition velocity <b>ﬁeld.</b> The physical <b>parameters</b> used so far in the literature for the Chernobyl dispersion simulation are partly supported by this study. The crucial question of deciding whether such an inversion is merely a tuning of parameters or a retrieval of physically meaningful quantities is discussed. Even though inversion of <b>parameter</b> <b>ﬁelds</b> may fail to determine physical values for the parameters, it achieves statistical adaptation that partially corrects for model errors and, using the inverted <b>parameter</b> <b>ﬁelds,</b> leads to considerable improvement in the simulation scores.

40|$|It was {{originally}} intended to develop a numerical and extensively automated program system for optimisation of the geometry of radial compressors with respect to particular operational requirements, and thus gain experience.

Despite the loss models incorporated into Q 3 DFLO from RADIAL, which delivered good results for individual calcatuions, Q 3 DFLO crashes during <b>parameter</b> <b>field</b> calculations due to an element structure in the calculation which is suitable for the Q 3 DFLO internal blade to blade network for variable inflow. This can only be combatted with an improved network generator, better suited {{to the demands of the}} <b>parameter</b> <b>field</b> calculations, for which no development time was available. The work invested in developing this comprehensive system of programs was split into two major sections for <b>parameter</b> <b>field</b> calculation and optimisation. That part of the program dealing with the <b>parameter</b> <b>field</b> calculation was partially based on existing programs. The second section, the optimisation of the system, was to be discussed and carried out in cooperation with the Technical University of Munich. From the point of view of the amount of work, the compilation of the <b>parameter</b> <b>field</b> should be considered the major portion, because of the series of measures for accelerating, improving and completing existing programs, the writing of new programs for automatic data smoothing and calculation of impeller geometries, and the adaptation, data storage, data processing and network generation.

40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{strategy}} to determine universal properties induced by a nearby phase transition on a non-order <b>parameter</b> <b>field.</b> A general renormalizable Lagrangian is used, which contains the order parameter and a non-order <b>parameter</b> <b>field,</b> and respects all the symmetries present. We investigate {{the case in}} which the order <b>parameter</b> <b>field</b> depends only on space coordinates and the case in which this field is also time dependent. We find that the spatial correlators of the non-order <b>parameter</b> <b>field,</b> in both cases, are infrared dominated and can be used to determine properties of the phase transition. We predict a universal behavior for the screening mass of a generic singlet field, and show how to extract relevant information from such a quantity. We also demonstrate that the pole mass of the non-order <b>parameter</b> <b>field</b> is not infrared sensitive. Our results can be applied to any continuous phase transition. As an example we consider the deconfining transition in pure Yang-Mills theory, and show that our findings are supported by lattice data. Our analysis suggests that monitoring the spatial correlators of different hadron species, more specifically the derivatives of these, provides an efficient and sufficient way to experimentally uncover the deconfining phase transition and its features.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{developing a}} generic reliability analysis and design framework that enables reliability prediction and design improvement with random <b>parameter,</b> <b>field,</b> and process variables. The capability of this framework is further improved by predicting and managing reliability {{even with a}} dearth of data {{that can be used}} to characterize random variables. To accomplish the research goal, three research thrusts are set forth. First, advanced techniques are developed to characterize the random field or process. The fundamental idea of these techniques is to model the random field or process with a set of important field signatures and random variables. These techniques enable the use of random <b>parameter,</b> <b>field,</b> and process variables for reliability analysis and design even with a dearth of data. Second, a generic reliability analysis framework is proposed to accurately assess system reliability in the presence of random <b>parameter,</b> <b>field,</b> and process variables. An advanced probability analysis technique, the Eigenvector Dimension Reduction (EDR) method, is developed by integrating the Dimension Reduction (DR) method with three proposed improvements: 1) an eigenvector sampling approach to obtain statistically independent samples over a random space; 2) a Stepwise Moving Least Square (SMLS) method to accurately approximate system responses over a random space; and 3) a Probability Density Function (PDF) generation method to accurately approximate the PDF of system responses for reliability analysis. Third, a generic Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) framework is developed to solve engineering design problems with random <b>parameter,</b> <b>field,</b> and process variables. This design framework incorporates the EDR method into RBDO. To illustrate the effectiveness of the developed framework, many numerical and engineering examples are employed to conduct the reliability analysis and RBDO with random <b>parameter,</b> <b>field,</b> and process variables. This dissertation demonstrates that the developed framework is very accurate and efficient for the reliability analysis and RBDO of engineering products and processes...|$|E

Among them, the system parameters always have uncertainties because of manufacturing tolerances and material irregularity.

For structural systems such as the rotating beam, the system <b>parameters</b> are random <b>fields</b> since the uncertainty of the parameters is the function of spatial variables. Because of the <b>parameter</b> random <b>fields,</b> the transient responses of the system are also random fields.
