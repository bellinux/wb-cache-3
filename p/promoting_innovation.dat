40|$|Highly {{innovative}} organisations demonstrate six key characteristics. They create learning cultures which <b>promote</b> <b>innovation</b> as a core organisational capability; employ {{leaders who}} are 2 ̆ 7 failure-tolerant 2 ̆ 7; identify innovators; reward people who propose innovative ideas; use partnerships; and, <b>promote</b> <b>innovation</b> through teams. In this report Victor Callan analyses how well vocational education and training (VET) providers employ the above characteristics. He finds VET organisations are making good progress as innovators, but this progress is uneven as three characteristics often dominate the building of innovation. Typically, VET providers identify innovators, develop partnerships and <b>promote</b> <b>innovation</b> through teams and communities of practice well. To develop innovation further, the author suggests VET organisations need to broaden the range of strategies they are using to <b>promote</b> <b>innovation</b> and offers practical steps to do so...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Whether Intellectual Property rights (“IPRs”) can <b>promote</b> <b>innovation</b> {{and social}} welfare is {{frequently}} a focal point of debate among businesses, lawyers, economists and governments. It has been observed that businesses often acquire and enforce IPRs, {{while at the same}} time making their innovation available to competitors through standardization, patent pooling, cross license arrangements, open source license and other means. These behaviors of business players suggest that IPRs can <b>promote</b> <b>innovation</b> under certain conditions, or can even be an obstacle to innovation under other conditions. The author proposes designing a simple model that can simulate certain aspects of the innovation process affected by the enforcement of IPRs. The result of the simulation suggests the advantages and disadvantages of IPRs in <b>promoting</b> <b>innovations...</b>|$|R
