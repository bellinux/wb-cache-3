5|$|Testaroli is {{sometimes}} served with pesto sauce, {{which is a}} common addition {{to it in the}} Liguria and Tuscany regions of Italy. Another dressing method includes the addition of olive oil, <b>Pecorino</b> cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, garlic and basil. Significant amounts of sauce may absorb into testaroli.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{preparations}} of acquacotta may use stale, fresh, or toasted bread, and {{can include}} additional ingredients such as vegetable broth, eggs, cheeses such as Parmigiano-Reggiano and <b>Pecorino</b> Toscano, celery, garlic, basil, beans such as cannellini beans, cabbage, kale, lemon juice, salt, pepper, potatoes and others. Some versions may use edible mushrooms such as porcini, wild herbs, and leaf vegetables/greens such as arugula, endive, mint, chard, chicory, dandelion greens, watercress, valerian and others. As the greens boil down, {{they contribute to}} the broth's flavor. The dish may be topped with a poached egg. Contemporary versions may be prepared in advance from {{a few hours to}} a day, stored in a cold place or refrigerated, and then reheated prior to serving. It can also be preserved by freezing.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli is {{prepared}} from a batter that is cooked {{on a hot}} flat surface, after which it may be consumed. It is traditionally cooked on a testo, a flat terra cotta or cast iron cooking surface from which the food's name is derived. It is sometimes cooked further in boiling water and then served. Testaroli is {{sometimes referred to as}} a bread, similar to focaccia in composition, and is sometimes referred to as a crêpe. It may be dressed with pesto sauce or other ingredients such as olive oil, <b>Pecorino</b> cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garlic. Falsi testaroli al ragu is a similar dish prepared using sliced pasta dough and a ragù sauce.|$|E
25|$|In Rome, Italy, Fava {{beans are}} popular either cooked with guanciale or with globe artichokes, as side dish {{together}} with lamb or kid, or raw with <b>Pecorino</b> romano. Fave e <b>Pecorino</b> {{is the traditional}} dish for 1 May picnic.|$|E
25|$|Some local {{specialties}} include Caciocavallo Cheese, Cipolla rossa di Tropea (red onion), Frìttuli and Curcùci (fried pork), Liquorice (liquirizia), Lagane e Cicciari (a pasta {{dish with}} chickpeas), <b>Pecorino</b> Crotonese (Cheese of Sheep), and Pignolata.|$|E
25|$|Because of European Union food hygiene-health regulations, {{the cheese}} was outlawed for a time, and {{offenders}} faced heavy fines. However, it remained possible to acquire casu marzu {{on the black}} market, where it could sell for double the price of an ordinary block of <b>pecorino</b> cheese.|$|E
25|$|Casu marzu {{is created}} by leaving whole <b>pecorino</b> cheeses outside with part of the rind removed to allow the eggs of the cheese fly Piophila casei to be laid in the cheese. A female P. casei can lay more than 500 eggs at one time. The eggs hatch and the larvae begin to eat through the cheese. The acid from the maggots' {{digestive}} system breaks down the cheese's fats, making {{the texture of the}} cheese very soft; by the time it is ready for consumption, a typical casu marzu will contain thousands of these maggots.|$|E
25|$|Sicily {{has long}} been noted for its fertile soil due to the {{volcanic}} eruptions {{in the past and}} present. The local agriculture is also helped by the pleasant climate of the island. The main agricultural products are wheat, citrons, oranges (Arancia Rossa di Sicilia IGP), lemons, tomatoes (Pomodoro di Pachino IGP), olives, olive oil, artichokes, Opuntia ficus-indica (Fico d'India dell'Etna DOP), almonds, grapes, pistachios (Pistacchio di Bronte DOP) and wine. Cattle and sheep are raised. The cheese productions are particularly important thanks to the Ragusano DOP and the <b>Pecorino</b> Siciliano DOP. Ragusa is noted for its honey (Miele Ibleo) and chocolate (Cioccolato di Modica IGP) productions.|$|E
25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and <b>pecorino</b> romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the cuisine}} {{of the rest}} of {{southern}} Italy, pasta plays an important part in Sicilian cuisine, as does rice; for example with arancini. As well as using some other cheeses, Sicily has spawned some of its own, using both cow's and sheep's milk, such as <b>pecorino</b> and caciocavallo. Spices used include saffron, nutmeg, clove, pepper, and cinnamon, which were introduced by the Arabs. Parsley is used abundantly in many dishes. Although Sicilian cuisine is commonly associated with sea food, meat dishes, including goose, lamb, goat, rabbit, and turkey, are also found in Sicily. It was the Normans and Swabians who first introduced a fondness for meat dishes to the island. Some varieties of wine are produced from vines that are relatively unique to the island, such as the Nero d'Avola made near the baroque of town of Noto.|$|E
500|$|Though sheep's milk may {{be drunk}} rarely in fresh form, {{today it is}} used {{predominantly}} in cheese and yogurt making. Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows. However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process. It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content. [...] Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Bulgaria and Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the <b>Pecorino</b> Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy. Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk. Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin. Sheep milk contains 4.8% lactose, which may affect those who are intolerant.|$|E

2500|$|The provincial Teramo gastronomy {{is known}} for its variety and richness. [...] Typical {{ingredients}} include agnello (lamb), peperoncino (hot pepper), formaggio <b>pecorino</b> (sheep milk cheeses), and slow roasted pork. Common wines are the renowned Montepulciano and Trebbiano d'Abruzzo.|$|E
2500|$|Derived from <b>pecorino,</b> casu marzu goes {{above and}} beyond typical {{fermentation}} to a stage of decomposition, {{brought about by the}} digestive action of the larvae of the cheese fly Piophila casei. These larvae are deliberately introduced to the cheese, promoting an advanced level of fermentation and breaking down of the cheese's fats. The texture of the cheese becomes very soft, with some liquid (called lagrima, Sardinian for [...] "teardrop") seeping out. The larvae themselves appear as translucent white worms, about [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|... scrippelle [...] – [...] This dish {{is served}} in the {{throughout}} the Teramo province and is somewhat similar to French crêpes, although typically made without milk. [...] There are two common variations. [...] The first is scrippelle 'mbusse – (dialect for scrippelle in brodo or broth) and consists of scrippelle rolled up in <b>Pecorino</b> or Parmesan cheese and served in chicken broth. [...] A second variation is timballo – scrippelle layered with ragù, meat or tiny meatballs (polpettini), various cheeses such as scamorza, and sometimes peas (piselli).|$|E
2500|$|In Italy, {{broad beans}} are {{traditionally}} sown on November 2, All Souls Day. Small cakes {{made in the}} shape of broad beans (though not out of them) are known as fave dei morti or [...] "beans of the dead". According to tradition, Sicily once experienced a failure of all crops other than the beans; the beans kept the population from starvation, and thanks were given to Saint Joseph. Broad beans subsequently became traditional on Saint Joseph's Day altars in many Italian communities. Some people carry a broad bean for good luck; some believe that if one carries a broad bean, one will never be without the essentials of life. In Rome, on the first of May, Roman families traditionally eat fresh fava beans with <b>Pecorino</b> Romano cheese during a daily excursion in the Campagna. In northern Italy, on the contrary, fava beans are traditionally fed to animals and some people, especially the elderly, might frown on human consumption. But in Liguria, a maritime region near northern Italy, fava beans are loved raw, and consumed fresh in early spring as the first product of the garden, alone or with fresh <b>Pecorino</b> Sardo or with local salami from Sant'Olcese. In some Central Italian regions, a once-popular and recently rediscovered fancy food is the bagiana, a soup of fresh or dried fava beans seasoned with onions and beet leaves stir-fried, before being added to the soup, in olive oil and lard (or bacon or cured ham fat).|$|E
2500|$|Controguerra DOC - Created in 1996 {{and located}} in the hills and valleys around the commune of Controguerra (whose name means [...] "anti-war" [...] in the local dialect) in the Teramo province. Until its creation, the Trebbiano d'Abruzzo DOC was the only {{permitted}} white wine DOC in Abruzzo. [...] Reds are made predominately from the Montepulciano grape (minimum 60% of the wine) with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet franc permitted to make up to 15% and other local red varieties the remaining 25%. Whites are a blend of Trebbiano Toscano (60-70%) and Passerina (15%) with other local white varieties permitted up to 25%. A sparkling spumante style is produced from Trebbiano Toscano (60%) and at least 30% combine of Chardonnay, Verdicchio and <b>Pecorino</b> with other local white varieties permitted up to 10%. Passito and vino novello styles of wine can also be produced in this DOC as well as varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet franc, Merlot, Chardonnay, Ciliegiolo and Pinot nero.|$|E
2500|$|The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics {{reports that}} a {{comparison}} of academic studies yields a range of revenue maximizing rates that centers around 70%. In the early 1980s, Edgar L. Feige and Robert T. McGee developed a macroeconomic model from which they derived a Laffer Curve. According to the model, the shape and position of the Laffer Curve depend upon the strength of supply side effects, the progressivity of the tax system {{and the size of}} the unobserved economy. [...] Economist Paul <b>Pecorino</b> presented a model in 1995 that predicted the peak of the Laffer curve occurred at tax rates around 65%. A draft paper by Y. Hsing looking at the United States economy between 1959 and 1991 placed the revenue-maximizing average federal tax rate between 32.67% and 35.21%. A 1981 article published in the Journal of Political Economy presented a model integrating empirical data that indicated that the point of maximum tax revenue in Sweden in the 1970s would have been 70%. A 2011 paper by Trabandt and Uhlig published in the Journal of Monetary Economics presented a model that predicted that the US and most European economies were on the left of the Laffer curve (in other words, that raising taxes would raise further revenue).|$|E
2500|$|Rome's cuisine {{has evolved}} through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and {{political}} changes. Rome {{became a major}} gastronomical centre during the ancient Age. Ancient Roman cuisine was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. Later, during the Renaissance, Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since {{some of the best}} chefs of the time, worked for the popes. An example of this could be Bartolomeo Scappi, who was a chef, working for Pius IV in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook Opera dell'arte del cucinare was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance cuisine and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a fork. [...] In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby Campagna, as lamb and vegetables (globe artichokes are common). In parallel, Roman Jews -present in the city since the 1st century BC- developed their own cuisine, the cucina giudaico-romanesca. Examples of Roman dishes include [...] "Saltimbocca alla Romana" [...] – a veal cutlet, Roman-style; topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; [...] "Carciofi alla romana" [...] – artichokes Roman-style; outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; [...] "Carciofi alla giudia" [...] – artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking; outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; [...] "Spaghetti alla carbonara" [...] – spaghetti with bacon, eggs and <b>pecorino,</b> and [...] "Gnocchi di semolino alla romana" [...] – semolina dumpling, Roman-style, to name but a few.|$|E

Bugnara <b>Pecorino</b> originates in rich mountain pastures where specific herbs grow.|$|E
5000|$|It {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>pecorino</b> Toscano (from Tuscany) or <b>pecorino</b> Sardo (from Sardinia). Unlike <b>pecorino</b> Romano, these cheeses (which are not particularly salty) are generally eaten by themselves or in sandwiches. Many stores in the United States sell [...] "Romano cheese", which {{should not be}} confused for genuine <b>pecorino</b> Romano which is an Italian product recognized and protected by the laws of the European Community.

50|$|Ampelographers {{believe that}} <b>Pecorino</b> {{is a very}} old variety that likely {{originated}} as a wild grapevine growing in the Sibillini Mountains that was eventually domesticated for wine production. Despite its name, {{there is no direct}} link between the <b>Pecorino</b> grape and <b>Pecorino</b> cheese. Ampelographers believe that the grape's name stems from the Italian word pecora, meaning sheep. Local legend is that sheep in the Marche region would often eat the grapes while moving through the vineyards.|$|E
50|$|Pesto alla genovese, {{the quintessential}} pesto recipe, {{is made with}} Genovese basil, coarse salt, garlic, Ligurian {{extra virgin olive oil}} (Taggiasco), European pine nuts (sometimes toasted) and a grated cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano and <b>pecorino</b> sardo or <b>pecorino</b> romano.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pecorino</b> Romano (...) is a hard, salty Italian cheese, {{often used}} for grating, made out of sheep's milk (the Italian word pecora, from which the name derives, means sheep). <b>Pecorino</b> Romano was a staple in the diet for the legionaries of ancient Rome.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of garlic sauteed in olive oil, before adding the guanciale is also accepted , and for cheese either <b>pecorino</b> romano or Amatrice's <b>pecorino</b> (from the Monti Sibillini or Monti della Laga areas) can be used. The {{addition of}} black or chili pepper is common.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pecorino</b> sardo, {{also known}} as fiore sardo, is a firm cheese from the Italian island of Sardinia which is made from sheep milk: {{specifically}} from the milk of the local Sardinian breed. It was awarded Denominazione d'Origine status in 1991 and granted Protected designation of origin (PDO) protection in 1996, {{the year in which}} this European Union certification scheme was introduced. Its flavour is {{different from that of the}} <b>Pecorino</b> Romano, which is also made on the island. Sardo is richer while romano is much more biting and salty. <b>Pecorino</b> sardo is delicious in contexts where the romano could overpower, such as in pesto—the Ligurian pesto alla genovese is traditionally made with a mixture of <b>Pecorino</b> sardo and Parmigiano-Reggiano—or with fruit.|$|E
50|$|Of the six main {{varieties}} of <b>Pecorino,</b> {{all of which}} have Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status under European Union law, <b>Pecorino</b> Romano is probably the best known outside Italy, especially in the United States, which has been an important export market for the cheese since the 19th century. Most <b>Pecorino</b> is produced on the island of Sardinia, though its production is also allowed in Lazio and in the Tuscan Provinces of Grosseto and Siena. Ancient Roman authors wrote about this cheese and its production technique.|$|E
