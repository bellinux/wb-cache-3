Fabrication of Al or 6061 Al alloy based composites reinforced with nano-sized SiC particles (~ 500 nm), micro-sized (After cold rolling, the evolution in microstructure, texture and strength has been analysed. A typical near β fibre texture with highest intensities near Copper and Brass orientations has been developed for 6061 Al/NQX and 6061 Al/Nb composites. For 6061 Al/SiC composites, a randomized texture with very small grains has achieved due to the presence of the non-deformable SiC particles. Mechanical property tests including microhardness, three-point bending tests and tensile tests have been carried out on cold rolled samples and the results exhibit some level of improvement when compared with as-extruded samples due to work hardening.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties at high temperatures of two Mg-Ni-Y-RE alloys prepared by conventional or <b>powder</b> <b>metallurgy</b> <b>routes</b> have been evaluated. All alloys exhibit high-strength up to 250  °C but their strength depends {{more on the}} composition of the alloy rather than on the processing route. High strength of the alloys arises from their fine grain size but there is an additional contribution of load transfer from the magnesium matrix towards the second phases in the alloys processed by the conventional route while additional hardening in the alloys prepared by <b>powder</b> <b>metallurgy</b> is due to Orowan mechanism. Above 250  °C, the strength drops to very low values but all alloys exhibit high elongations and grain boundary sliding is the controlling mechanism.
