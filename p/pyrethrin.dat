500|$|Other {{insecticides}} {{are available}} for mosquito control, {{as well as physical}} measures, such as draining the wetland breeding grounds and the provision of better sanitation. Pyrethrum (from the flowering plant Chrysanthemum [...] cinerariaefolium) is an economically important source of natural insecticide. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects. A few minutes after application, the insect cannot move or fly, while female mosquitoes are inhibited from biting. The use of pyrethrum in insecticide preparations dates to about 400 BCE. Pyrethrins are biodegradable and break down easily on exposure to light. The majority of the world's supply of <b>pyrethrin</b> and Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium comes from Kenya. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of Eastern Africa during the late 1920s. The flowers of the plant are harvested shortly after blooming; they are either dried and powdered, or the oils within the flowers are extracted with solvents.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} known since the late 17th century that plants contain [...] {{chemicals}} which are avoided by insects. These chemicals {{have been used by}} man as early insecticides; in 1690 nicotine was extracted from tobacco and used as a contact insecticide. In 1773, insect infested plants were treated with nicotine fumigation by heating tobacco and blowing the smoke over the plants. The flowers of Chrysanthemum species contain <b>pyrethrin</b> which is a potent insecticide. In later years, the applications of plant resistance became an important area of research in agriculture and plant breeding, particularly because they can serve as a safe and low-cost alternative to the use of pesticides. The important role of secondary plant substances in plant defense was described in the late 1950s by Vincent Dethier and G.S. Fraenkel. The use of botanical pesticides is widespread and notable examples include Azadirachtin from the neem (Azadirachta indica), d-Limonene from Citrus species, Rotenone from Derris, Capsaicin from chili pepper and Pyrethrum.|$|E

2500|$|Since before 2000 BC, {{humans have}} {{utilized}} pesticides {{to protect their}} crops. The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which {{is derived from the}} roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. [...] Paul Müller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, <b>pyrethrin</b> compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by [...] "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".|$|E

50|$|Commercial <b>pyrethrin</b> {{production}} mainly {{takes place}} in mountainous equatorial zones. The commercial cultivation of the Dalmatian chrysanthemum takes place {{at an altitude of}} 3000 to 6000 meters above sea level. This is done because <b>pyrethrin</b> concentration has been shown to increase as elevation increases to this level. Growing these plants does not require much water because semiarid conditions and a cool winter deliver optimal <b>pyrethrin</b> production. Another variety of Chrysanthemum used for the production of pyrethrins is the pyrethrum chrysanthemum.
