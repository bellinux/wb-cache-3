Joseph Logel a notability of Sélestat close to the painter's family who devoted some writings to Fiebig, became the universal legatee of Fiebig's work.

Further, they reported {{that there was a}} large seed bank of ungerminated seeds, and these seeds had a variable release from dormancy.

5000|$|As {{a typical}} post-punk band mittageisen {{developed}} their own individual music style and became thereby [...] "one of the earliest Darkwave/electro Goth bands. These tracks were mostly recorded from 82 to 85 (seven of them in 82 when Depeche Mode still couldnt get enough), mixing the emerging Gothic sounds of the Banshees, Bauhaus and The Cure with the sparse electro of Kraftwerk. In general, its slow, dark and morose with droning guitars and vocals, under-pinned by a sharp electro beat. In other ones, {{they are one of}} the archetypal darkwave bands who were releasing albums when the Sisters (of Mercy) were only working on their early EPs. There is, however, a very simple and obvious reason why this band do not occupy the same privileged position as the classic Goth bands - they didnt sing in English. Most of the tracks are in German, with one, <b>persistance</b> de la mémoire, in French. Its the kind of music you hear as the soundtrack for oppressive, dark German sci-fi films. The sound does not stay the same all the way through, automaten, which is here in two versions, is a fairly upbeat, electro piece. Others are more sound-scapey; droning pieces that evoke factory work. This CD is more than an historical oddity, it is a must for fans of early Sisters stuff, or the Cures dark period which culminated in the oppressive Pornography".|$|E

40|$|We derive the Hamilton {{equations}} {{of motion}} for a constrained system in the form given by Dirac, by a limiting procedure, starting from the Lagrangean for an unconstrained system. We thereby ellucidate {{the role played by}} the primary constraints and their <b>persistance</b> in time. The Hamiltonian formulation for systems whose dynamics is described by a Lagrangean with singular Hessian has been given a long time ago by Dirac [1], and has been elaborated ever since in numerous papers 2. As is well known all gauge theories fall into the class of singular systems. The usual starting point for deriving the Hamilton {{equations of motion}} is the singular Lagrangean which leads, in the language of Dirac, to primary constraints. While the primary constraints have no analog on the Lagrangean level, requiring their <b>persistance</b> in time leads to equations relating the coordinates and velocities. These are part of the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. This <b>persistance</b> requirement may lead to secondary constraints and {{is the first step in}} the Dirac algorithm generating the constraints. The purpose o...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the {{development}} of the high-sensitive and species-specific methods of indication Leptospira interrogans on the base of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for studying the hostal <b>persistance</b> of leptospires and diagnostics of leptospiroses. For the first time, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method has been used for studying the hostal <b>persistance</b> of the pathogenous leptospires; the new data about the localization peculiarities and the <b>persistance</b> duration of the pathogenes of the experimental animals have been obtained. The principal possibility of use of the developed PCR test-system with the purposes of express-diagnostics of the people's leptospiroses (including the seronegative cases) has been shown. The obtained data have been used in the Russian Medical Academy of the postdiploma education and in the Information Centre of the State Sanepidinspetion of Russian Federation.

40|$|The three essays {{focus on}} the process of firm growth, its persistence, and on the role of {{innovation}} in affecting firm performance. In the first essay we concentrate on persistence of high-growth and investigate whether this peculiar growth pattern is associated with better operating capabilities. The second essay aims to explore the relationship between growth and innovation, taking into accountthe multidimensional nature of the innovation process. We provide a broad picture of the relationship between growth and innovation, by looking at a wide set of innovation variables that capture the different sources, modes and types of innovative activity undertaken within firms. In the third essay we examine the role of persistence of innovation on persistence of growth performance, assessing whether a systematic, rather than sporadic, engagement in innovation activities induces more structure in the process of firm growth. Les trois études traitent du processus de croissance des entreprises, sa <b>persistance,</b> ainsi que du rôle de l’innovation dans la performance des entreprises. Dans la première étude, nous nous concentrons sur la <b>persistance</b> de la forte croissance des entreprises et examinons si ce modèle de croissance spécifique est associé à de meilleures capacités d’exploitation. La deuxième étude vise à explorer la relation entre la croissance et l’innovation, en tenant compte de la nature multidimensionnelle du processus d’innovation. Nous observons un large ensemble de variables d’innovation qui saisissent des sources différentes, des modes et types d’activités innovantes mises en œuvre au sein des entreprises.

An important consequence is a large reduction in the carrying capacity of the fluid medium. We determine analytically the regimes where this quasi-localized behavior occurs and test our predictions by numerical simulations. Comment: 15 page...|$|E
