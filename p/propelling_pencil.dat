5000|$|A {{mechanical}} pencil (US English) or a <b>propelling</b> <b>pencil</b> (UK English) is a pencil with a replaceable and mechanically extendable solid pigment core called a [...] "lead" [...] The lead, often made of graphite, is not bonded {{to the outer}} casing, and can be mechanically extended as its point is worn away. Other names include automatic pencil, drafting pencil, technical pencil, click pencil, clutch pencil, leadholder, pen pencil (Indian English), and lead pencil (Bangladeshi English).|$|E

There was a mineral water bottle of a type {{supplied}} to hotels in Morecambe, Lancaster and Ingleton, and containing a blue 'crown' top not introduced until 1940. Other items found with the man included a wristlet watch, handkerchief, shaving tube, studs, toothbrush, fountain pen, <b>propelling</b> <b>pencil,</b> compass, box of matches, tablets, flashlamp, and toiletries.

5000|$|In 1950 <b>propelling</b> <b>pencils</b> (or {{mechanical}} pencils) {{began to}} be manufactured, the first being made out of wood. Four years later, the [...] "Lumocolor" [...] brand was registered. This brand was used to design {{the wide range of}} Staedtler markers. In 1962 Technical pens {{began to be}} produced. As from 2010, FIMO, MALI, Aquasoft and further brands are being marketed under the Staedtler name. In addition, the company celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The Yard-O-Led Pencil Company {{was founded}} in London, England in 1934 by a Mr Brenner to produce his patent <b>propelling</b> <b>pencils</b> which {{contained}} twelve three inch leads (that is to say, 36 inches or a yard of lead). After the Second World War the company merged with Sampson Mordan Ltd whose founder had patented the first mechanical pencil in 1822. They built a new factory in Birmingham and took over Edward Baker Ltd, another pencil maker.|$|R
5000|$|The writer Max Favalelli said of Marinelli: [...] "He is a pygmy. His body is no {{thicker than}} a <b>propelling</b> <b>pencil,</b> his legs no thicker than runner beans. And {{his head is}} like a fist." [...] Marinelli as an adult was 1m 62 tall and wore size 38 shoes. He was so thin and sickly-looking as a boy that his mother urged him to play {{accordion}} rather than ride a bike. Marinelli nevertheless raced and came to prominence in the Trophées Peugeot. That brought him selection for the 1948 Tour.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} memorable games was a quiz called [...] "Double or Drop", where each of three contestants was given a prize to hold for each {{question}} answered correctly, but given a cabbage if they were incorrect.

While the winner took his or her pick from a basket of toys, every runner-up won a much-envied marbled <b>propelling</b> <b>pencil</b> as a prize, which became so popular that in 1961 Queen Elizabeth was presented with Crackerjack! pencils for Anne and Charles.|$|E
40|$|It is all {{too common}} for {{technology}} companies to seek a new route to solving the same problem {{but for the most}} part the solutions address the effect and not the cause. The good old-fashioned pencil is the perfect example where inventors have sought to design-out the effect of the inherent brittleness of lead. Traditionally different methods of sharpening were suggested and more recently the <b>propelling</b> <b>pencil</b> has reigned king, the lead being supported by the dispensing sleeve thus reducing the likelihood of breakage. Developers convinced by the Single Building Model approach to design development have each embarked on a difficult journey to create an easy to use feature packed application. Unfortunately it seems that the two are not mutually compatible if we are to believe what we see emanating from Technology giants Autodesk in the guise of Architectural Desktop 3. The effect of their development is a feature rich environment but the cost and in this case the cause is a tool which is far from easy to use. However, this is only a small part of a much bigger problem, Interoperability. You see when one designer develops a model with one tool the information is typically locked in that environment. Of course the geometry can be distributed and shared amongst the team for use with their tools but the properties, or as often misquoted, the intelligence is lost along the way. The effect is the technological version of rubble, the cause is the low quality of data-translation available to us. Fortunately there is one company, which is making rapid advancements on the whole issue of collaboration, and data sharing. An old timer (Graphisoft - famous for ArchiCAD) has just donned a smart new suit, set up a new company called GDL Technology and stepped into the ring to do battle, with a difference. The difference is that GDL Technology does not rely on conquering the competition, quite the opposite in fact their success relies upon the continued success of all the major CAD platforms including AutoCAD, MicroStation and ArchiCAD (of course). GDL Technology have created a standard data format for manufacturers called GDL Objects. Product manufacturers such as Velux are now able to develop product libraries using GDL Objects, which can then be placed in a CAD model, or drawing using almost any CAD tool. The product libraries can be stored on the web or on CD giving easy download access to any building industry professional. These objects are created using scripts which makes them tiny for downloading from the web. Each object contains 3 important types of information: • · Parametric scale dependant 2 d plan symbols • · Full 3 d geometric data • · Manufacturers information such as material, colour and price Whilst manufacturers are racing to GDL Technologies door to sign up, developers and clients are quick to see the benefit too. Porsche are using GDL Objects to manage their brand identity as they build over 300 new showrooms worldwide. Having defined the building style and interior Porsche, in conjunction with the product suppliers, have produced a CD-ROM with all of the selected building components such as cladding, doors, furniture, and finishes. Designing and detailing the various schemes will therefore be as straightforward as using Lego. To ease the process of accessing, sizing and placing the product libraries GDL Technology have developed a product called GDL Object Explorer, a free-standing application which can be placed on the CD with the product libraries. Furthermore, whilst the Object Explorer gives access to the GDL Objects it also enables the user to save the object in one of many file formats including DWG, DGN, DXF, 3 DS and even the IAI's IFC. However, if you are an AutoCAD user there is another tool, which has been designed especially for you, it is called the Object Adapter and it works inside of AutoCAD 14 and 2000. The Object Adapter will dynamically convert all GDL Objects to AutoCAD Blocks during placement, which means that they can be controlled with standard AutoCAD commands. Furthermore, each object can be linked to an online document from the manufacturer web site, which is ideal for more extensive product information. Other tools, which have been developed to make the most of the objects, are the Web Plug-in and SalesCAD. The Plug-in enables objects to be dynamically modified and displayed on web pages and Sales CAD is an easy to learn and use design tool for sales teams to explore, develop and cost designs on a Notebook PC whilst sitting in the architects office. All sales quotations are directly extracted from the model and presented in HTML format as a mixture of product images, product descriptions and tables identifying quantities and costs. With full lifecycle information stored in each GDL Object it is no surprise that GDL Technology see their objects as the future for building design. Indeed they are not alone, the IAI have already said that they are going to explore the possibility of associating GDL Objects with their own data sharing format the IFC. So down to the dirty stuff, money and how much it costs? Well, at the risk of sounding like a market trader in Petticoat Lane, “To you guv? Nuffin”. That's right as a user of this technology it will cost you nothing! Not a penny, it is gratis, free. The product manufacturer pays for the license to host their libraries on the web or on CD and even then their costs are small costing from as little as 50 p for each CD filled with objects. GDL Technology has come up trumps with their GDL Objects. They have developed a new way to solve old problems. If CAD were a pencil then GDL Objects would be ballistic lead, which would never break or loose its point. A much better alternative to the strategy used by many of their competitors who seek to avoid breaking the pencil by persuading the artist not to press down so hard.

5000|$|Staedtler Mars GmbH & Co. KG is a German fine writing {{instrument}} {{company and}} a manufacturer and supplier of writing, artist, and engineering drawing instruments. The firm was founded by J.S. Staedtler in 1835 and produces a large variety of writing instruments, including drafting <b>pencils,</b> <b>propelling</b> <b>pencils,</b> professional pens and standard wooden pencils. It also produces plastic erasers, rulers, compasses and other drawing/writing accessories. Staedtler {{claims to be the}} largest European manufacturer of wood-cased pencils, OHP pens, mechanical pencil leads, erasers, and modelling clays. Staedtler has over 20 global subsidiaries and seven manufacturing facilities. Over 85% of the production takes place in the headquarters in Nuremberg, though some of its products are made in Japan. Its [...] "Noris" [...] line of pencils are extremely common in British schools.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} pencils which use {{mechanical}} methods to push lead {{through a hole}} at the end. These {{can be divided into}} two groups: <b>propelling</b> <b>pencils</b> use an internal mechanism to push the lead out from an internal compartment, while clutch pencils merely hold the lead in place (the lead is extended by releasing it and allowing some external force, usually gravity, to pull it out of the body). The erasers (sometimes replaced by a sharpener on pencils with larger lead sizes) are also removable (and thus replaceable), and usually cover a place to store replacement leads. Mechanical pencils are popular for their longevity {{and the fact that they}} may never need sharpening. Lead types are based on grade and size; with standard sizes being 2.00 mm, 1.40 mm, 1.00 mm, 0.70 mm, 0.50 mm, 0.35 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.18 mm, and 0.13 mm (ISO 9175-1)—the 0.90 mm size is available, but is not considered a standard ISO size.|$|R
50|$|An {{advanced}} ratchet type has {{a mechanism}} that rotates the pencil lead 9° counter-clockwise {{every time the}} lead is pressed on to the paper (which counts as one stroke), to distribute wear evenly. This auto-rotation mechanism keeps the lead 50% narrower than in the common <b>propelling</b> mechanical <b>pencils,</b> resulting in uniform thickness of the lines written onto the paper. The design was first developed by Mitsubishi Pencil Company, and named Kuru Toga under the Uni brand. This type of pencil is most suited for Asian languages that have multiple strokes per letter or word, where the pencil is frequently lifted off the paper. The mechanism is not suitable for cursive writing used in western scripts. Another recent auto-rotation movement by Uni rotates the lead 18 degrees per stroke (or 20 strokes per complete revolution), which is better suited for western scripts.|$|R
40|$|Authors: Yoh Wada, Minako Aoyama, Ge-Hong Sun-Wada, Nobuyuki Kawamura & Hiroyuki Tabata ### Abstract In this {{protocol}} {{we describe}} methods for observation endocytic {{activity in the}} mouse embryos. The methods are optimised for mouse embryos at E 5. 5 ~E 7. 2 pregastrulation/gastrulation stages. We optimise three different experimental schemes for tracing the embryonic endocytosis. In utero labelling scheme, an endocytic tracer is introduced into circulation of a pregnant mother to follow bulk uptake of fluid phase endocytosis. Rodent embryos are known to internalise maternal immunoglobulins, thus steady-state levels of endocytosis can be visualised by subcellular localization of mouse IgG. We also describe an in vitro labelling method for the isolated embryos. The last method allows pulse-labelling and chase experiments thus one can follow the temporal orders of events. Further, cellular processes involved in the endocytosis can be dissected pharmacologically by applying small- or large molecules with biological activities. ### Introduction Endocytosis is an important cellular process by which cells internalise macromolecules impermeable to cell membranes. During the endocytosis, a portion of cell surface membranes invaginates inwardly with extracellular and membrane-embedded substances including signalling molecules, growth factors, and nutrients to form small membrane vesicles which are destined to be transported toward the intracellular compartments like endosomes and lysosomes. The endocytosis is not only important for taking up nutritional macromolecules including a transferrin-iron complex, lipoproteins, immunoglobulins, but plays {{a central role in}} downregulation of cell-surface receptors for various signalling molecules as well. Moreover, in the various systems, signal transductions from the activated receptors to cytosolic mediators occur after ligand-receptor complexes are endocytosed. Therefore, the endocytosis plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in the signal transduction. The visceral endoderm, a polarised absorbing epithelium overlying embryo proper, actively internalises various molecules including transferrin, immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, and albumins [1 - 3]. This tissue controls multiple signalling cascades that ultimately governs antero-posterior axis formation and epiblast differentiation[4, 5]. This process, in principle, is highly dependent upon the endocytic pathways in the embryonic tissues [6 - 8]. The endocytic activity of rodent embryo has been documented by electron-microscopy in the earlier literatures. The endocytic pathway in the visceral endoderm cells is composed of the apical canaliculi, spherical bodies, and giant organelles referred as to apical vacuoles [9, 10]. We optimise protocols for observing the endocytosis under fluorescence microscopes, and with appropriate equipment setting, one can follow the endocytic process in live embryos. Here, we describe step-by-step protocols for different labelling schemes for the endocytic compartments. ### Reagents 1. 10 X Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen 70011044) - PBST 1 x PBS plus 0. 05 % Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich P 9416) - PBST+TSA+DS: dissolve TSA blocking reagent (Perkin Elmer FP 1020) at 1 %(w/v) in PBST, at 50 ºC in water bath.

Gently mix for at least 10 min, and check all the powder goes into solution, then add the same volume of glycerol, swirl well. Store at - 20 ºC, protect from light. 4 % formaldehyde in PBS, freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde (PFA/PBS) : weigh c. a. 1 g of paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma-Aldrich, 158127) into a 50 ml Falcon tube, add c. a. 15 ml milli-Q (from a small vessel dedicated to this use only, in order to avoid reverse contamination of PFA powder and vapour into milli-Q stock for other critical experiments). Heat to c. a. 70 ºC in a water bath with occasional swirling. If the powder does not go into solution, add a drop of 1 M NaOH, and swirl gently. Add 1 / 10 volume of 10 x PBS and adjust volume with milli-Q (again, from the small vessel). Place the tube on ice to cool, and use within 24 hours for primary fixation (i. e., before immunostaining or fresh tissues), or within a week for post-staining fixation (i. e., after 2 nd antibodies incubation). - Gellan gum (Sigma-Aldrich P 8169) - Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Lab H- 1000) ### Equipment 1.

Cross mice, and check vaginal plugs on next morning (E 0). - At E 5. 5 - 7. 5, anesthetise the pregnant female by injecting pentobarbital or xylazine/ketamine. Inject 100 μL of 25 mg/mL fluorescent dextran from tail vain. - After 30 min, check anaesthesia by foot pad reflection. Fix the pregnant female by introducing mouse tonic saline (c. a. 5 mL) and PFA/PBS into circulation from right ventricle. - Dissect uterus in PFA/PBS, and free embryos from deciduae in PBST in 35 mm dish. - Wash briefly with PBST in a 35 mm dish. The embryos become less sticky to pipette walls and needles. - Remove Reichert’s membrane by needles. - Fix for 2 hr ~ O/N in PFA/PBS at 4 ºC, protect from light. - Wash 2 - 3 times in PBST in 35 mm dish - Observe under microscopes (see Section D), or process for immunostaining, if necessary (Section C). B. In vitro labelling: pulse-labelling/chase experiments. 1. Cross mice, and check vaginal plugs on next morning (E 0). - Prepare 4 mL DMEM+RS (1 : 1 mixture of DMEM and rat serum) in 35 mm dish, place in the CO 2 incubator. - Prepare 20 mL isolation buffer (DMEM+ 10 % FBS+ 25 mM Hepes-Na) in 50 mL Falcon tube, tighten cap, and place in the CO 2 incubator or 37 ºC water bath. - Set up an IVF plate: Mix 16 μL of TRITC-dextran (stock soln) and 184 μL of DMEM+RS, in well # 1, 16 μL FITC-dextran stock plus 184 μL DMEM+RS in well # 3, and 200 μL DMEM+RS (no dextrans) in well # 2 and # 4. Equilibrate the media in the CO 2 incubator. - Make a drop of 0. 5 mL DMEM+RS in a 35 mm dish, three or four dishes are required. Place them in the CO 2 incubator. - Prepare four 35 mm dishes of the isolation buffer, place in 37 ºC incubator (humidified with wet paper towel). - Prepare 35 mm dishes containing freshly prepared PFA/PBS. - Sacrifice the pregnant mother by cervical dislocation, dissect the embryos as quick as possible in the isolation buffer. Remove Reichert’s membrane, but not tear the visceral endoderm layer and ectoplacental cone. Place the embryos into a DMEM+RS drop. - When all the embryos (or required numbers of embryos) are ready in DMEM+RS, transfer them into the well # 1 of the IVF plate with a minimum volume of no-dye-medium. Incubate at 30 min in the CO 2 incubator. - Transfer the embryos to a drop of DMEM+RS on the 35 mm dish with minimum carry over of the medium. chase in the well # 2 - After appropriate chase-duration, transfer them into well # 3 : incubate 5 - 15 min in the CO 2 incubator, then transfer and wash in a DMEM+RS drop. - Incubate in the well # 4, for various duration. - Terminate the labelling/chase by transferring the embryos into PFA/PBS. Fix for 1 hr on ice. - Proceed for observation (IV), or for immunohistochemical staining as described in section C. C. Immunoglobulins as an endogenous tracer 1. Cross mice, and check vaginal plugs on next morning (E 0). - At E 5. 5 - 7. 5, anesthetise the pregnant female by injecting pentobarbital or xylazine/ketamine. - Check anaesthesia by foot pad reflection. Fix the pregnant female by introducing mouse tonic saline (c. a. 5 mL) and PFA/PBS into circulation from right ventricle. - Dissect uterus, wash in PFA/PBS, and free embryos from deciduae in PBST in 35 mm dish. - Wash briefly with PBST in 35 mm dish. The embryos become less “sticky” to pipette walls and needles. - Remove Reichert membranes by needles. - Fix for 2 hr ~ O/N in PFA/PBS at 4 ºC. - Incubate the embryos in PBST+TSA+DS for 12 hr ~ O/N in a microtube. - Transfer the embryos to 100 μL of anti-mouse IgG antibodies in PBST+TSA+DS, and incubate at 4 ºC for 12 hr~O/N. For FITC-, Cy 3, and Cy 5 -labelled antibodies, use at 1 / 100, 1 / 500, and 1 / 250 dilutions, respectively. - Wash the embryos with PBST in microtubes or 35 mm dish. c. a. 5 ~ 10 min wash, 5 times, with changing the tubes or dishes twice. - Fix the embryos in PFA/PBS for 20 min. D. Observation. 1. Wash 3 -times in PBST - Incubate in 20 % glycerol/PBST for 1 hr - Incubate in 40 % glycerol/PBST for 1 hr - Add approximately an equal volume of Vectashield, tap the tube gently. - Store at 4 ºC for several days, but try to record the image ASAP. - Mix 0. 2 % gellan gum in 40 % glycerol in PBST, and microwave. Gellan gum solidifies in the presence of monovlalent or divalent ions. - Pour 500 - 1000 μL of hot Gellan gum/PBST/glycerol solution into a 35 mm glass-bottom dish. Once solidified, cool in a refrigerator to harden further. Used and washed glass-bottom dish gives less fluorescence background. - Under a dissection microscope, make a slit reaching the bottom glass with a dissecting needle. Embed an embryo into the slit, and adjust its orientation (Figure 1). - View under/on microscopes, and record. Gellan gum gel sustains the embryos and gel itself even if the dishes set inverted, therefore the samples can be viewed on upright microscopes. ### Timing - Day - 5 ~ - 7 : mating set up - Day - 4 ~ - 6 : plug check - Day 1 : embryo isolation, culture, labelling, fix and blocking - Day 2 : primary antibodies incubation - Day 3 : washing and secondary antibodies incubation - Day 4 : washing and glycerol/anti-fade substitution - Day 5 - : observation and data recording ### Troubleshooting Under in vitro labelling condition, mouse embryos actively take up rat IgG from rat serum, thus indirect immunofluorescence with combination of primary antibodies raised in rat and anti-rat secondary antibodies is practically impossible. Mouse serum works fine in the in vitro culture, whereas FBS or Knock-out Serum Replacement gave high background staining in our hands. ### References 1. Huxham, I. M. and F.

50|$|The film {{takes place}} in an office staffed by six suit-wearing dogs, or perhaps wolves, who hand-copy {{documents}} using pencils. One of the dog workers passes out because of overwork. The boss drops him through a trapdoor below the worker's desk, and replaces him with a robot that writes faster. Another worker yawns, and is also dropped through a trapdoor under his desk and replaced by a robot. Three more are eliminating for drinking water, sneezing and injury (the fourth worker desperately plugs his nose with two pencils, but is unable to keep from sneezing, <b>propelling</b> the <b>pencils</b> into the fifth one's head). They are replaced by more robots. The remaining worker, madly scribbling away, is shocked to discover that his boss {{has been replaced by}} a boss robot. When the latter leaves, the last worker decides to take action, and begins destroying the robots in various cartoony ways (blowing one up with a stick of dynamite, dropping another through its desk trapdoor, yet another by hitting it with different objects, and electrically shocking another into a pile of cinders). As the worker and the one remaining robot are locked in a life-or-death struggle, they see the boss robot threatening to push the trapdoor button. In a sudden instance of cooperating, they shove the trapdoor beneath the boss robot, who falls in. As the two workers peer down the open trapdoor, the dog becomes aware of the opportunity being presented and shoves the robot in. The worker dog clamps the boss's cigar between his teeth and pushes the trapdoor button, ending the film.|$|R
