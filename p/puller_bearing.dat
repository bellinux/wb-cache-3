50|$|Friction-disc {{clutches}} {{generally are}} classified as push type or pull type depending on {{the location of the}} pressure plate fulcrum points. In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal <b>pulls</b> the release <b>bearing,</b> <b>pulling</b> on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the release bearing is pushed into the clutch disengaging the vehicle drive. In this instance, the release bearing can be known as a thrust bearing (as per the image above).|$|R
30|$|In general, air-gap {{eccentricity}} {{is classified}} as static eccentricity, dynamic eccentricity, as well as mixed eccentricity of these two types [2]. In static air-gap eccentricity, geometric axis of rotor rotation is not the geometric axis of the stator, and position of the minimal radial air-gap length is fixed in space. In dynamic air-gap eccentricity, the rotor rotates around the geometric axis of the stator, where {{the position of the}} minimum air-gap length rotates with the rotor. In a particular case of static air-gap eccentricity, rotor geometric axis is not parallel to stator geometric axis; the degree of eccentricity gradually changes along stator axis, which is inclined static eccentricity [3]. IM air-gap eccentricity defects could result in unbalanced magnetic <b>pull,</b> <b>bearing</b> damage, excessive vibration and noise, and even stator-rotor rub failure [4]. Correspondingly, this work will focus on initial IM fault detection of static eccentricity and dynamic eccentricity.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral Toggle action. The first company to make the straight pull action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the straight <b>pull</b> ball <b>bearing</b> lock action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt's housing. With the new design came a new dry-fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to catch the firing pin. The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|R
40|$|Squeeze Film Dampers (SFDs) aid to {{suppress}} rotor vibrations {{and enhance the}} stability of high-speed rotor-bearing systems. A SFD is a simple oil lubricated film between a stationary housing and a precessing (whirling) journal. Aircraft engines use SFDs as the only means to provide damping to otherwise rigid ball bearing supports. This thesis presents experimental results for the dynamic forced performance of a test open ends SFD operating with large amplitude whirl motions, centered and off centered within the bearing clearance. The test rig comprises of an elastically supported bearing with a damper section having two parallel film lands separated by a feed groove. A film land is 25. 4 mm long, with diameter 127 mm and nominal radial clearance c= 0. 251 mm. Two orthogonally placed shakers apply dynamic loads on the bearing to induce circular orbit motions at prescribed whirl frequencies. A static loader, 45 ? away from each shaker, <b>pulls</b> the <b>bearing</b> to a static eccentric position. Circular orbit tests were performed (10 ? 100 Hz frequency range) for eight increasing orbit amplitudes (r= 0. 08 c to ~ 0. 71 c) and under four static eccentricities (es= 0. 0 c to ~ 0. 76 c). An identification method estimates the test damper force coefficients from transfer functions in the frequency domain. The analysis shows that the SFD damping force coefficients increase with the static eccentricity (es) increase. On the other hand, the damper inertia coefficients decrease as the orbit amplitude (r) becomes large and also increase modestly with the static eccentricity (es). Predictions from a physical model show good agreement with the test dynamic force coefficients. The accuracy of the linearized SFD force coefficients (K, C, M) SFD is evaluated from comparing the differences in mechanical work performed by actual and linear SFD reaction forces. The difference in mechanical work (Ediff) increases with increasing static eccentricity (es) and orbit amplitude (r). However, for most test conditions (r/c? 0. 4,es/c? 0. 25), Ediff is less than ~ 5 %, thus showing the linearized SFD force coefficients represent well the forced response of the actual test SFD system. The test and predicted force coefficients {{as well as the}} analysis of the pressure fields contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the kinetics of SFDs operating with moderate tolarge amplitude size whirl motions, centered and off-centered...|$|R
40|$|Squeeze Film Dampers (SFD) provide {{viscous damping}} in rotor bearing systems to reduce lateral {{vibration}} amplitudes and to isolate mechanical components. Aircraft engine shafts, often supported on roller bearings, operate at high rotational speeds and {{are susceptible to}} large amplitude shaft whirl due to rotor imbalance. SFDs aid to reduce such large whirl amplitudes while also eliminating rotor instabilities. he current work quantifies experimentally the forced performance of two parallel squeeze SFDs separated by a central groove. Force coefficients are identified in a specialized SFD test rig constructed to undergo similar operating and loading conditions as in jet engines. Of interest is to quantify {{the effect of a}} central feed groove on the forced performance of SFDs and to validate predictions from a computational tool. The test rig comprises of an elastically supported bearing structure and one of two journals. Tests are conducted on two open ends SFDs, both with diameter D and nominal radial clearance c; each damper with two parallel film land lengths L= 1 / 5 D and 2 L, separated by a feed groove of width L and depth 3 / 4 L. ISO VG 2 grade lubricant oil flows into the central groove via 3 orifices, 120 degrees apart, and then through the film lands to finally exit to ambient. In operation, a static loader <b>pulls</b> the <b>bearing</b> to various static off center positions with respect to the stationary journal, and electromagnetic shakers (2, 200 N) excite the test system with single frequency loads over a frequency range to generate rectilinear, circular and elliptical orbits with specified motion amplitudes. A frequency domain method identifies the SFD mechanical parameters, viz., stiffness, damping, and added mass coefficients. The long damper generates 7 times more direct damping and 2 times more added mass compared to the short length damper. The damping coefficients are sensitive to the static eccentricity (up to 50 percent c) while showing lesser dependency on the amplitude of whirl motion (up to 20 percent c). On the other hand, added mass coefficients are nearly constant with static eccentricity and decrease with higher amplitudes of motion. The magnitudes of identified cross-coupled coefficients are insignificant for all imposed operating conditions for either damper. Large dynamic pressures recorded in the central groove demonstrate the groove does not isolate the film lands by merely acting as a source of lubricant, but contributes to the generation of large added mass coefficients. The recorded dynamic pressures in the film lands and central groove do not evidence lubricant vapor or gas cavitation for the tested static eccentricities and amplitudes of motion. The direct damping coefficients for both dampers are independent of excitation frequency over the frequency range of the tests. Predictions derived from a novel SFD computational tool that includes flow interactions in the central groove and oil supply orifices agree well with the experimental force coefficients for both dampers. The current work advances {{the state of the art}} in SFDs for jet engines...|$|R
40|$|Laminated {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} employed {{in a variety}} of industries ranging from Aerospace to Wind Power. The high specific stiffness and strength of these materials renders their wider application advantageous in many fields. However, the broader implementation of such composites is frequently restrained by their poor impact resistance and damage tolerance. Even events as innocuous as a dropped tool can impart significant damage to such materials. Such damage can lead to drops in the strength and stiffness that are unacceptable for many applications, particularly those in Aerospace. 3 D woven composites present a possible means of improving the impact resistance and damage tolerance of composite materials. The incorporation of out-of-plane fibres, transversely passing through layers of in-plane fibres, is the means by which this improvement in performance is obtained. This body of work presents an investigation into the behaviour of three dimensionally woven carbon fibre composites. Specifically, the subject composite fabric had an orthogonally woven three dimensional structure. The novelty of these materials is such that knowledge and understanding of their mechanical behaviour is very limited. The purpose of this work was to remedy this through experimental and analytical analysis of these composites. The 3 D woven materials were characterized experimentally using a variety of techniques. In addition to evaluating the material experimentally, analytical methods were also used. Current analytical methods were found to be deficient in their incapacity to account for in-plane crimp on a micro scale. As a result a new micro scale approach for predicting the stiffness and strength of these 3 D woven materials was developed. The composites used for this thesis were tested using a variety of means. The range of test methodologies used subjected the materials to in-plane, out-of-plane, dynamic and quasi- static loadings. Techniques used included; tension, shear, impact, compression after impact, bolt shear out and <b>bearing</b> <b>pull</b> through. Other means implemented included microscopy, C-scanning and Digital Image Correlation. In addition, conventional composites made from unidirectional pre-pregs or Non-Crimp Fabrics (NCFs) were tested to provide a basis for comparison. Analysis and prediction of the behaviour of conventional laminated composites can be performed using a variety of methods. While the range of methods available is broad, they commonly use individual plies of composite as their fundamental building blocks. This is both convenient analytically and experimentally as the properties of such individual lamina may be found with reasonable ease. However, 3 D woven composites are integrated laminates due to the out‐of‐plane fibres they possess. As a result, the accuracy of conventional experimental or analytical methods for evaluating these materials is likely to be poor. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the behaviour of these 3 D woven materials a new micromechanics model was developed. In contrast to other available methods, this micromechanics approach examines the effect of crimp at the fibre level. The method proposed is also distinct in its capability of simultaneously accounting for varying crimp across and along a section of composite.
