40|$|Background: Widespread {{prevalence}} of extended-spectrum βeta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-producing E. coli) limits the infection therapeutic options {{and is a}} growing global health problem. In this study {{our aim was to}} investigate the antimicrobial resistance profile of the E. coli in hospitalized and out- patients in Cyprus. Results: During the period 2010 - 2014, 389 strains of E. coli were isolated from urine samples of hospitalized and out-patients in Cyprus. ESBL-producing E. coli, was observed in 53 % of hospitalized and 44 % in out-patients, latest one being in 2014. All ESBL-producing E. coli remained susceptible to amikacin, carbapenems except ertapenem (in-patients= 6 %, out-patients= 11 %). Conclusions: High emerging ESBL-producing E. coli from urine samples in hospitalized and out-patients is an extremely worrisome sign of development of untreatable infections in the near future on the island. We therefore emphasize the immediate need for establishment of optimal therapy guidelines based on the country specific surveillance programs.

40|$|AbstractBackground and purpose: It is now clearly {{acknowledged}} that unjustified <b>prescription</b> <b>habit</b> {{can lead to}} ineffective or incomplete treatment and may extend the course of illness or time to recovery. At present, there is no taught course available on prescription writing method specifically for common illnesses. Consequently, students learn through experience. In these circumstances, it seems essential to teach medical students the prescription techniques and insight into national pharmacology. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate diagnosis, treatment and prescription writing capability of graduating interns for common clinical scenarios. Materials and methods : This was a cross sectional study assessing the prescription writing ability of 41 interns for 10 common clinical situations based on an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Results : In every station, average action was 1. 57. From this, 68 % were correct performance. Average number of medicine for each prescription was 1. 8, with 70 % appropriate medicine. From correct prescriptions, 59 % had accurate dosage and 44 % with precise course of treatment. On average, there were 1. 4 right and 0. 29 wrong medical advices per prescription. Over all, 82. 7 % of recommendations were correct. Average score of interns in all stations was 56. 4 %. There was a correlation between prescription writing ability and the average mark of interns.

Results: In total, 629 CD (61 % female) and 398 UC (57 % female) patients were identified, mean observation time was 31. 8 months for CD and 31. 0 months for UC patients. Of the entire study population, 27. 1 % were prescribed iron (21. 1 % in males and 31. 1 % in females). Patients treated with IBD-specific drugs (steroids, immunomodulators, anti-TNF agents) were more frequently treated with iron compared to patients without any medication (35. 0 % vs. 20. 9 %, OR 1. 91, 95 %-CI 1. 41 - 2. 61).

Methods Two structured questionnaires, one for pharmacists and one for physicians, were constructed after review of published studies and after performed a qualitative study designed with pharmacists’ focus group sessions. Our research was developed {{in an area of}} Statistically Territorial Unity Nomenclature (NUT) II of Portugal, defined by Health Northern Regional Administration (ARS-N). ARS-N was informed about the study and questionnaires were administered to each health professional twice, at an interval of 2 to 4 weeks. Attitudes were measured using a continuous visual analogical scale, with answers scored from 0 (total disagreement) to 20 (total agreement). Statistical analyses included the determination of intraclass coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha for each questionnaire. Results A total of 43 pharmacists and 32 physicians participated in this survey. Each questionnaire evaluated 17 attitudes that were grouped in four dimensions of attitudes to antibiotic resistance: perception of the problem, attribution of responsibilities, confidence and factors associated to dispensing habits (in pharmacists questionnaire) or factors associated to <b>prescription</b> <b>habits</b> (in physicians questionnaire). Six questions, related to the first three categories mentioned are common for both questionnaires what permits to compare these attitudes between pharmacists and physicians. All evaluated attitudes demonstrated good ICC for each questionnaire and the reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was 0, 624 for pharmacists’ questionnaire and 0, 711 for physicians’ questionnaire. Conclusions These questionnaires proved to be a good tool for collecting data, since it allows compare some attitudes between pharmacists and physicians, and to detect differences among each professional group.

Andrea Kučerová, Department of Social and Clinical Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Faculty in Hradec Králové, doctorate thesis, 2010 Metformin is biquanid which, during its therapeutic use, has undergone a period of perdition and fall followed by again rising up to the imaginary pharmacological-therapeutic summit when it became a "gold standard" {{in the treatment}} of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Currently, it is recommended by the professional authorities abroad and in the Czech Republic as a first choice drug after determination of diagnosis together with diet and physical exercise. How these recommendations follow and reflect the diabetological prescription situation? What prevents the physicians-prescriptors from implementation of the recommendations into their daily practice? The aim and subject of this thesis is the issue of therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) by means of oral antidiabetics (PADs) with a special focus on the decision mechanisms of selected prescription groups of physicians. A historical development of metformin must be reminded in the theoretical part of this thesis in order to better understand and substantiate these <b>prescription</b> <b>habits,</b> and furthermore a development and changes of its position in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{an overview}} on the ethical issues of pharmaceutical industry gift-giving in the United States of America. The article shows that {{law is not}} the only way in which the relationship between physicians and pharmaceutical industry can be regulated. Most important professional associations of physicians, pharmacists, residents etc. consider industry gifts as a conflict of interest. They created different ethical guidelines for this complicated issue. The paper demonstrates various solutions of ethical matters in the relationship between physicians and pharmaceutical industry by analyzing codes and guidelines of different associations. On the one hand it shows organizations which allow exchanging of gifts of no value. On the other hand it presents associations that forbid physicians accepting even a pen. The article also shows various attitudes of these associations to situations like inviting physicians to dinner, accepting drug samples, taking subsidies from the company to defray the cost of the conference etc. The problem of those relations has been neglected for long time. From society’s point of view it is important for physicians to be informed about the rules and ways that pharmaceutical companies try to influence physicians’ <b>prescription</b> <b>habits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Man {{has been}} {{fighting}} diseases for centuries. One of the major battles is against microorganisms and diseases they cause. A health education course was organized on prescribing aminoglycoside antibiotics and postantibiotic effect. The aim of the course was to change the <b>prescription</b> <b>habits</b> in our colleagues. The postantibiotic effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics as well as impact of subinhibiting doses on duration of postantibiotic effect requires modification of previous therapeutic protocols. Single daily dose has the same or even greater effect than multiple daily doses. The toxicity of aminoglycosides is not increased and remains the same or smaller in single daily regimens. Results The single daily dose regimen of aminoglycosides {{has been used in}} 63. 6 % of cases in Clinic for Infectious Diseases of the Clinical Center of Novi Sad, 41. 2 % in Outpatient Health Care Center of Novi Sad "Liman" and this regimen has not been used in General Practice Department, Children's Health Care Department and Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic at all. The twice daily regimen has been used instead. Conclusion Doctors are aware of the postantibiotic effect, but vast majority are still bound to their old habits in regard to prescribing antibiotics. Our educational course failed to achieve its goal...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} case notes of {{patients}} attending a general hospital psychiatric outpatient clinic revealed that 75 % {{of patients with}} depressive disorders and 38 % of patients with neurotic disorders were prescribed antidepressants. Antidepressants were often prescribed for long periods in low doses and in combination with benzodiazepines. There was less polypharmacy, however, with more sedating antidepressants. The results indicate that clinical <b>prescription</b> <b>habits</b> for antidepressants may still be at some variance with recommendations from the literature. Clear guidelines for the somatic treatment of the less severe and more chronic forms of depression often seen in outpatients are not as yet available. There is, however, a consensus in the literature that polypharmacy, in particular the use of low dose antidepressants in combination with minor tranquillisers, is not advisable. For example, Weissman and Klerman (1977) reported that patients who develop chronic depression {{are more likely to}} have been prescribed minor tranquillisers than patients who recover from their depression. Akiskal and co-authors (1981) also reported sedative/hypnotic dependence as a factor associated with chronicity of depression. Schatzberg and Cole (1978) reviewed the literature and found little evidence for benzodiazepines exerting an antidepressant effect in depression. Several studies have shown, however, that a proportion of patients with chronic outpatient depression do respond to antidepressant medication alone, i f given in therapeutic dose...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Drug {{promotions}} use multifaceted approaches incorporating {{hospital and}} office detailing by marketing representatives. Very few studies exist on {{their influence on}} doctors&# 8217; prescription pattern in Nigeria. We examined the scope and effects of marketing strategies on the <b>prescription</b> <b>habits</b> of doctors in Enugu, South East Nigeria. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study; 210 self-administered structured questionnaires were distributed among doctors in six major hospitals in Enugu. Ethical approval {{was obtained from the}} University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Ethics Committee, Enugu. RESULTS: There was 88 % response rate, with more males than females (M:F= 2. 2 : 1). Most were residents-in-training/ house officers (69 %) while consultants were 7. 1 % of the group. Stickers, drug presentations/ launches and personal souvenirs were most commonly employed marketing strategies. Most doctors (60 %) attending a drug presentation felt influenced. While 87. 5 % appreciated the benefits of marketing strategies, about 70 % would consider patients&# 8217; socioeconomic status before prescribing. Continuing medical education and stiff competition were reasons adduced for the marketing strategies. CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria adopt varied strategies to influence doctors&# 8217; prescriptions. Often this aim is achieved. The practice is accepted by most who nevertheless will consider other factors when deciding on what to prescribe. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2010; 9 (1. 000) : 1 - 6...|$|R
