40|$|As {{scholars}} argue, {{there has}} been a rapid diffusion of civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> in Western Europe the last decade. In the light of the debate about the extent of civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies,</b> recent {{studies have shown that the}} diffusion is limited to certain countries. Despite a flurry of literature based on civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies,</b> attention drawn to the implication of these policies has been quite inferior. This paper tries to examine what civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> means in relation to immigration. Are civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> used as an informal tool for the purpose of limiting certain groups of immigrants? I argue in this paper that the conditional factor in the civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> creates a barrier for affected immigrants and their possibilities to gain long term residence. This is especially relevant for family migration. The material used for the empirical research emanates from Migrant <b>Integration</b> <b>Policy</b> Index (MIPEX) who addresses the existent of <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> in several European countries, and OECD International Migration Outlook who estimates the immigration to European countries based on category of entry. The results presented here demonstrate that there is a connection between civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> and reduced family immigration. In comparison to other <b>integration</b> <b>policies,</b> civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> emerge in terms of correlation and significance. The main concern is the few studied cases in this research which unfortunately obstruct the possibility for generalization. This paper, however, reveals a noteworthy intersectional correlation that ought to be of interest for further research...|$|R

The final reports {{of these projects}} deal with several aspects of implementing climate policy in Europe.

It analyses measures and means to enhance climate <b>policy</b> <b>integration</b> and improve policy coherence.The reports show that communication and awareness raising is going to be important to get public support for adaptation measures, and to help stakeholders to adapt. Since adaptation is very different from mitigation, communication should be designed specifically for that purpose, including exchange of experiences on adaptation practices. Although the inclusion of climate change mitigation and adaptation in general governmental programmes and strategies has substantially increased in recent years, much more is needed in terms of integrating climate issues into specific policy measures. Annual budgets, environmental impact assessments and spatial planning procedures are three examples of existing measures which we believe have significant potential to be climate policy instruments.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{environmental}} <b>policy</b> <b>integration</b> (EPI) {{refers to the}} process of integrating environmental objectives into non-environmental policy areas, such as energy, agriculture and transport, rather than leaving them to be pursued solely through purely environmental policy practices. This is oftentimes particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws. EPI is widely recognised as one of the key elements of sustainable development. More recently, the notion of ‘climate policy integration’, also denoted as ‘mainstreaming’, has been applied to indicate the integration of climate considerations (both mitigation and adaptation) into the normal (often economically focused) activity of government.|$|E

However, it has proven much harder to implement than many had originally expected, not least those working in the European Commission’s environment directorate-general. A significant causal factor here has been the EU’s fragmented institutional and political structure, which on the one hand has facilitated the adoption of visionary policy objectives, but has also undermined their implementation.|$|E

5000|$|The European Commission {{presented}} on 28 November 2012 a [...] "Blueprint", {{on how it}} see the path on the short + medium + long term towards building a deep and genuine EMU. In this report, the introduction of eurobonds were described as the last final step {{on the path to}} create a genuine fiscal union, and something only to be introduced in the long term (beyond 5 years from 2012). The report suggested for the medium term (18 months to 5 years), that it was more appropriate as a first step, to introduce a common issuance by eurozone Member States of the so-called eurobills, which are defined as being short-term instruments to finance government debt with a maturity of up to one or two years. This first eurobills step would still require a treaty change along with an increased call for implementing an even tighter fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>integration</b> (creating in advance a [...] "strong budgetary governance and a watertight system of monitoring and surveillance" [...] in the Eurozone, beyond of what has already been implemented by the Six-pack and Two-pack). Introduction of eurobills would however, not require a full fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>integration</b> straight from the start, {{because of the fact that}} it would only cover introduction of common short term debt, which only represents a minor fraction of the governments overall debt pile, and thus the risk of excersiced [...] "moral hazard" [...] in the individual member states would also be limited (because the majority of the governments debt, financed by medium and long-term bonds, will still be yielded according to each state's credit rating at financial markets).|$|E
50|$|The {{concept has}} become {{confused}} as each discipline {{has tried to}} mold the concept to their set of tools. This “silo” thinking inhibits the kind of <b>policy</b> <b>integration</b> {{that is needed to}} develop a sustainable urban transport solution strategy. There remains much confusion as to what a sustainable transport system would comprise. It is helpful therefore to consider different approaches to sustainable transport along a spectrum of viewpoints, ranging from weak to strong sustainability. Generally efforts to address the impact of transport on climate change to date have been largely focused on technology. The impact of this technological-led approach has been very limited in the transport sector. TDM has the potential to move the transport sector from a position of weak to strong sustainability by combining behavior-change with technology improvements.|$|E
50|$|The {{integration}} of bank regulation {{has long been}} sought by EU policymakers, as a complement to the internal market for capital and, from the 1990s on, of the single currency. However, powerful political obstacles including the willingness of member states to retain instruments of financial repression and economic nationalism led {{to the failure of}} prior attempts to create a European framework for banking supervision, including during the negotiation of the Maastricht Treaty in 1991 and of the Treaty of Nice in 2000. During the 2000s, the emergence of pan-European banking groups through cross-border mergers and acquisitions (such as the purchases of Abbey National by Santander Group, HypoVereinsbank by UniCredit and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by BNP Paribas) led to renewed calls for banking <b>policy</b> <b>integration,</b> not least by the International Monetary Fund, but with limited policy action beyond the creation of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors in 2004.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> is of {{particular}} relevance in an increasingly globalised world, since <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> was shown to be important {{to the maintenance of}} social cohesion of immigrant receiving host societies (Papillon 2002, p. iii, Schugurensky 2003, pp. 11 - 12, Friessen 2003, pp. 187 - 191). This thesis sought to examine the fit of two explanatory theoretical models in explaining <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> outcomes in two case study states, Ireland and New Zealand, during the period 1995 - 2006. More specifically, the thesis tried to determine whether the influence of the model of national membership adopted in each study case (civic membership in the New Zealand case and ethno cultural membership {{in the case of the}} Republic of Ireland) was able to anticipate the correct outcomes with regard to <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> adopted during the study period, or whether political party positioning on socio economic lines was more important in anticipating <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> outcomes. This assessment was conduct in light of apparent ‘fit’ of the respective theoretical models in each study case to <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> enacted during the study period, in order to determine whether the theories that seem to fit the best anticipate the correct outcomes in each study case. This was a salient question in light of the dichotomy in <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> approaches in the two study states. Notwithstanding that both New Zealand and Ireland were immigrant receiving states during the study period, there was a marked difference between New Zealand’s approach to <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> formulation and that of Ireland. New Zealand’s approach to <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> was well structured and became more developed, while Ireland did not have a cohesive <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> during the study period, relying instead on a reactionary approach composed of a collection of policy statements and ‘ad hoc’, reactionary policies. As noted briefly above, the two theoretical models that were assessed for fit against outcomes in <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> in the study states were the Brubaker theory of membership and the theory of political party positioning along the socio-economic left/right axis. The Brubaker theory suggests that <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> are the outcome of national membership models (i. e. a civic or ethno cultural conception of national belonging), whilst the theory of party positioning along socio-economic lines suggests that <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> are based on the influence of socio economic political party ideology. An investigation was made of the fit of the Brubaker membership models against that of the socio economic political ideology models in predicting <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> outcomes in each respective case study. In addition, an examination of the interaction between the two explanatory theories was conducted, and an assessment made of whether this interaction had an impact on <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> formulation. In exploring the interaction between two competing explanations for <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> outcomes, this thesis aimed to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding for the reasons of the divergence in the approach to <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> in the two case study states, and also a better understanding of the factors impacting on <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> in general...|$|R
30|$|The {{fieldwork}} {{and research}} undertaken for the EU- 7 framework project, UniteEurope in Copenhagen and Malmö, 1 made me question the growing {{consensus on the}} increased importance of the local level in <b>integration</b> <b>policies.</b> I therefore decided {{to look for a}} methodological and theoretical framework that would facilitate an analysis of the recent developments in Denmark and Sweden. The aim {{of this article is to}} add a new approach to the study of local <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> by looking at the multi-level governance of <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> through a power perspective lens. Power is operationalized by analysing the autonomy of local governments and their compliance with national policies. Contrary to most research, I argue that what we are witnessing is a national turn on local <b>integration</b> <b>policy,</b> where local <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> and practices are increasingly governed by the state. Using case studies from Denmark and Sweden, I show that in recent years the governments of the two countries have increased their control and local influence and thereby limited the possibilities for local governments to formulate their own <b>integration</b> <b>policies.</b>|$|R
30|$|Even {{though this}} article only investigates the {{developments}} in Denmark and Sweden, {{there are signs}} of a broader European trend towards a national turn of local <b>integration</b> <b>policy.</b> Other countries have also centralized their <b>integration</b> <b>policies.</b> For example, Germany introduced a national <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> in 2005 and state agencies are now responsible for integration programmes at the local level.

[...] The following week on 25 April 2012, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi echoed this call by noting in a speech before the European Parliament that [...] "Ensuring a well-functioning EMU implies strengthening banking supervision and resolution at European level". Suggestions for more integrated European banking supervision were further discussed during an informal European Council meeting on 23 May 2012, and appear to have been backed at the time by French President François Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso. German Chancellor Angela Merkel signalled a degree of convergence on this agenda when declaring on 4 June 2012, that European leaders [...] "will also talk about to what extent we have to put systemically (important) banks under a specific European oversight".|$|E

30|$|The main {{hypothesis}} {{of this paper}} is that, empirically, naturalisation policies are ‘complementary’ to <b>integration</b> <b>policies.</b> A strong positive relationship is assumed across Europe between a state’s openness on membership (ordinary naturalisation law) and its approach to equal rights and opportunities (several areas of <b>integration</b> <b>policy).</b> This paper hypothesises that naturalisation <b>policies</b> and <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> are used by policymakers in a complementary fashion with a certain internal coherence in terms of a generally inclusive vs. restrictive approach. Changes in naturalisation policies are expected to reflect and shape changes in <b>integration</b> <b>policies.</b> States that embrace the objective of comparative rights, responsibilities, and opportunities for immigrants and nationals will grant equal rights for foreigners in various areas of life and facilitate the ordinary naturalisation of foreigners. States that reject this equal treatment approach will have more restrictive naturalisation and <b>integration</b> <b>policies.</b> This paper hypothesises that so-called ‘republican’ or ‘denizen’ models are exceptions rather than the rule across Europe, due to specific political circumstances in these outlier states (e.g. history of immigration, political philosophy on immigrant <b>integration</b> or broader <b>policies</b> on minorities). Drawing on the literature, this paper also theorises several underlying links between naturalisation <b>policies</b> and specific <b>integration</b> <b>policies,</b> such as political participation, anti-discrimination, and family reunion, education and labour market mobility and, to some extent, long-term residence.|$|R
