5|$|In 1865, the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} as {{a summer}} residence by John Joseph Caldwell Abbott, former prime minister of Canada and Mayor of Montreal. Sir Edward Seaborne Clouston purchased the domain from Abbott's estate in 1898.|$|E
50|$|Private <b>property</b> <b>is</b> a legal {{designation}} for {{the ownership}} of property by non-governmental legal entities. Private <b>property</b> <b>is</b> distinguishable from public <b>property,</b> which <b>is</b> owned by a state entity; and from collective (or cooperative) <b>property,</b> which <b>is</b> owned {{by a group of}} non-governmental entities. Private <b>property</b> <b>is</b> further distinguished from personal property, which refers to property for personal use and consumption. Private <b>property</b> <b>is</b> a legal concept defined and enforced by a country's political system.|$|R
50|$|These three <b>properties</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} {{included among}} the Peano axioms for natural numbers. Although the symmetric and transitive <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> {{often seen as}} fundamental, they can be proved if the substitution and reflexive <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> assumed instead.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> {{minimum values}} at room temperature. Wrought {{mechanical}} <b>properties</b> for extrusions <b>are</b> in the longitudinal direction. Transverse <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> generally lower.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} by John Graf and the Priory Hospitality Group for development.|$|E
5|$|McGann {{invested}} {{in real estate}} and financial holdings near his Shelbyville home during his career. At {{the time of his}} death, his <b>property</b> <b>was</b> assessed to be worth approximately $40,000 ($ in current dollar terms).|$|E
5|$|The month-long {{show was}} widely publicized and {{covered by the}} media. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, while {{supporting}} the arts, criticized Banksy's work, calling him a vandal, contending that defacing <b>property</b> <b>was</b> not his definition of art.|$|E
50|$|The least-upper-bound <b>property</b> <b>is</b> {{an example}} of the {{aforementioned}} completeness <b>properties</b> which <b>is</b> typical for the set of real numbers. This <b>property</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called Dedekind completeness.|$|R
50|$|These <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> valid {{only for}} {{integers}} m, for nonintegers the <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> similar but slightly different.|$|R
5000|$|Rigid <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> {{designated}} by +R, and <b>properties</b> that <b>are</b> not rigid -R. An important specialization of non-rigid <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> anti-rigid <b>properties</b> (~R), which <b>are</b> <b>properties</b> that must <b>be</b> changeable. Think {{of being a}} student - all students must possibly not be students. ~R (but not -R or +R) is inherited down the class hierarchy.|$|R
5|$|The {{overriding}} plot premise was unrealistic: {{religious groups}} and other not-for-profit organizations are typically exempt from {{federal or state}} taxes; although a legislative proposal to tax such <b>property</b> <b>was</b> under consideration in Illinois at the time.|$|E
5|$|The <b>property</b> <b>was</b> {{subsequently}} {{purchased from}} the Commonwealth Bank by businessman Alan Bond in 1978 {{along with the}} adjacent Terrace Arcade.|$|E
5|$|Westbury College was a 13th-century College of Priests {{located in}} Westbury-on-Trym. A gatehouse, now a National Trust <b>property,</b> <b>was</b> {{added in the}} 15th century.|$|E
5000|$|Premise P1 is an {{intuitive}} premise; generally we distinguish between properties and relations. An intrinsic <b>property</b> <b>is</b> just a <b>property</b> {{that something has}} independently of anything else; an extrinsic <b>property</b> <b>is</b> had only in relation to something. An example of an extrinsic <b>property</b> <b>is</b> [...] "fatherhood": something is a father only if that something is a male and has a child. An example of an alleged intrinsic <b>property</b> <b>is</b> [...] "shape".|$|R
50|$|When {{we speak}} of access semantics, in context of <b>properties,</b> what <b>is</b> meant is simply that (unlike a field) the {{read-write}} operations on an object's <b>property</b> <b>are</b> managed and observed. Thus {{we can say that}} 'A <b>property</b> <b>is</b> a virtual data element of an object and the access to the <b>property</b> <b>is</b> managed by getter/read and setter/write methods'.|$|R
50|$|A two-sided <b>property</b> <b>is</b> {{fulfilled}} on both sides. A one-sided <b>property</b> <b>is</b> {{related to}} one (unspecified) of two sides.|$|R
5|$|After Ranga Rao died in 1801, {{there were}} efforts to merge Bobbili with Vizianagaram {{but these were}} thwarted and a lasting {{settlement}} of the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> made with the adopted son of Ranga Rao. Rayadappa and his son Svetachalapti who succeeded in 1830 and lived till 1862 managed their property very well. In {{the middle of the}} 19th century, successors of this lineage constructed the present Bobbili Fort, following their improved economic conditions.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} of Toronto {{expanded}} eastward and encroached on the estate, Elizabeth and Wellington Ashbridge subdivided and sold off much of the family's land for residential subdivisions. The Duke of Connaught Public School (1912) and S.H. Armstrong Community Recreation Centre were built on land {{that had been the}} Ashbridges' orchard. Woodfield Road, {{on the east side of}} the current <b>property,</b> <b>was</b> originally the farm lane going to the fields farther north.|$|E
5|$|Bessas reappears in the {{campaign}} of 554, when he was appointed joint commander in Lazica with Martin, Bouzes and Justin. Gubazes, though, soon protested to Justinian about the incompetence of the Byzantine generals. Bessas was dismissed, his <b>property</b> <b>was</b> confiscated, and he was sent in exile among the Abasgians. Nothing more is known about him thereafter.|$|E

30|$|The hasComplexCondition <b>property</b> <b>is</b> sub-property of R. R in DL syntax {{represents}} {{the top level}} abstract object property. The incorporatedByPlayer <b>property</b> <b>is</b> also sub-property of R, {{and it is a}} Functional 8 object property. The incorporatesComplexCondition object <b>property</b> <b>is</b> symmetric to the incorporatedByPlayer property, being also Functional.|$|R
5|$|Del Valle died in 1841. On his deathbed, he {{attempted}} to reconcile with his estranged son Ygnacio by writing him a letter and offering the entire rancho to him as his inheritance. Del Valle died before his son received the letter. Ygnacio did return and took possession of the land, but after a lawsuit the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> split with his stepmother.|$|E
5|$|His son, William, {{stayed behind}} {{with others to}} protect the family home, but they were {{overcome}} and the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> eventually looted and razed to the ground. Priestley's valuable library, scientific laboratory, and manuscripts were largely lost in the flames.|$|E
5|$|Immigrants {{have not}} always been readily {{accepted}} and in 1517 the Evil May Day riots, where foreign-owned <b>property</b> <b>was</b> attacked, resulted in the deaths of 135 Flemings in Stepney. The Gordon Riots of 1780 began with burnings of the houses of Catholics and their chapels in Poplar and Spitalfields.|$|E
50|$|A {{physical}} <b>property</b> <b>is</b> any <b>property</b> that <b>is</b> measurable, whose value {{describes a}} state of a physical system. The changes in the physical properties of a system {{can be used to}} describe its transformations or evolutions between its momentary states. Physical <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> often referred to as observables. They <b>are</b> not modal <b>properties.</b> Quantifiable physical <b>property</b> <b>is</b> called physical quantity.|$|R
25|$|New {{residential}} and commercial <b>properties</b> <b>are</b> subject to GST but re-sale of existing <b>properties</b> <b>is</b> not.

5|$|In 1936 {{the lodge}} became a hotel, but was badly damaged by yet another fire in 1941. During the early 1940s the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> {{used by the}} Somerset County Council as a {{children}}'s home where many children born from liaisons between African American service men and local women were housed, after being given up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> {{sold and}} the Chana School was nearly demolished. Citizens formed the Chana School Foundation {{to save the}} building. It was {{relocated}} to City Park East in Oregon, Illinois and volunteers began the process of refurbishing the building in August 1998. Five years later, in September 2003, the school had its grand opening. Since then, it has operated as a museum to help illustrate 1880s education in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, this {{experiment}} was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium-283 were positively identified. The adsorption <b>property</b> <b>was</b> confirmed {{and indicated that}} copernicium has adsorption properties completely in agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium's boiling point: 84°C, so {{that it may be}} a gas at standard conditions.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the {{parameter}} {{derived from}} the biological <b>property</b> <b>is</b> AUC or Cmax, while the physicochemical <b>property</b> <b>is</b> the in vitro dissolution profile.|$|R

50|$|Personal <b>property</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} considered <b>property</b> that <b>is</b> movable, {{as opposed to}} real property or real estate. In common law systems, personal <b>property</b> may also <b>be</b> called chattels or personalty.
