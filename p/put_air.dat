Hannam had previously directed such series as Colditz and Paul Temple while Barry had worked extensively on Doctor Who, having directed some 31 episodes at the time, including the stories The Dæmons and The Mutants for Letts and Dicks, as well as episodes of Out of the Unknown, Paul Temple and The Onedin Line. [...] Hannam and Barry alternated directing the episodes between them with filming on Moonbase 3 beginning on 24 April 1973 at the BBC film studios in Ealing. The Ealing filming mainly centred around the scenes set on the lunar surface which proved a difficult experience for the actors. Star Donald Houston told the Radio Times that the spacesuits got [...] "hot and claustrophobic. In the end they had to have oxygen standing by. [...] the dust rose in clouds and the cameramen all wore surgical masks. The actors just choked". [...] Recalling his guest appearance on Moonbase 3, in the episode [...] "Behemoth", Peter Miles told TV Zone in 1991 that he was [...] "asked to be like a gazelle and leap as I came down the hillock in full astronaut gear. [...] The tech crew wondered why I was steaming up furiously in my astronaut's head. They'd forgotten to <b>put</b> <b>air</b> holes into the helmet. [...] I said, 'Help help! Help help! I'm not breathing folks!' They took the helmet off before drilling the holes or I wouldn't be here now". [...] Filming continued at Ealing until 30 May 1973 before production moved to BBC Television Centre for the remaining scenes, mostly those set inside the moonbase, which would be recorded on videotape beginning on 18 June 1973. The episodes were recorded in a different order than that in which they were broadcast with [...] "Departure and Arrival" [...] recorded first followed by [...] "Castor and Pollux", [...] "Behemoth", [...] "View of a Dead Planet", [...] "Outsiders" [...] and, lastly, [...] "Achilles Heel" [...] with recording wrapping on 15 August 1973. [...] Music was provided by Dudley Simpson who, at this time, was the regular composer on Doctor Who. Simpson composed the main title theme that accompanied the opening and closing credits as well as approximately 60 minutes of incidental music.|$|E

The club then succumbed to their fifth defeat of the season on 9 January 2013 against Churchill Brothers at the Duler Stadium in which the club lost 3-1 due to a double by Gabon {{international}} striker Henry Antchouet and a goal by Israil Gurung all within five minutes from the 60th to the 65th minutes of the match; Pailan did have the lead though when Prathamesh Maulingkar put Arrows in {{the lead in the}} 56th minute. Despite their fifth loss of the season though, Pailan Arrows still managed to break that run in the very next match against Air India on 12 January 2013 at the Balewadi Sports Complex in which Pailan Arrows drew the match 1-1 with Rajinder Kumar giving Arrows the equalizer they needed right before halftime, after Henry Ezeh <b>put</b> <b>Air</b> India in the lead in the 37th minute.|$|E

40|$|In December 2007, a male {{equipment}} operator was fatally {{injured by}} a metal lock ring propelled from a multi-piece wheel tire assembly he was inflating. The victim was employed by an excavating and snow removal company. At {{the time of}} the incident, he and a co-worker were getting their loaders ready to remove snow from a shopping mall parking lot. Soon after he started his loader, the victim noticed that his left front tire mounted on a multi-piece wheel was “soft”(under-inflated). The multi-piece rim wheel referring to the tire assembly consisted of six components: the rim base, valve assembly, tire, side ring, O-ring and lock ring. The function of the lock ring was to hold the tire in place by locking and securing the other wheel components when the tire was inflated. The victim asked the co-worker, whose loader had an air compressor, to <b>put</b> <b>air</b> in the tire. The initial tire pressure was not checked. The co-worker connected one end of an air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the air compressor and the clip-on chuck at the other end to the valve stem of the tire. The co-worker then went to his loader’s cab and used the throttle control to maintain the airflow. The air hose did not have an in-line pressure gauge. The victim checked the air pressure at the tire valve with a hand-held pressure gauge periodically as the tire was being inflated. The maximum cold tire inflation pressure specified by the tire manufacturer was 35 pounds per square inch (psi). After a few minutes, the victi...|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly visible and politicised issue {{in a number of}} cities throughout the world. Concerns about spatial (in) justice seem to {{play a crucial role in}} this context. The uneven distribution of air, and the resulting forms of socio-ecological injustice, appear to be key factors pushing people to take action. Over the last ten years, air pollution has been a hot issue on the political agenda in Antwerp (Belgium), due to the planned construction of a new part of the ring road in Flanders’ biggest city. The decade-long campaign against this project included mobilisations of tens of thousands of people, a referendum which critical social movements imposed and won, and a series of court cases which have blocked the government’s plans. Based on a document analysis and interviews with key actors, this paper presents an analysis of how and why air pollution in Antwerp has been turned into an issue of political contestation and debate, and which role is played by the perception of spatial injustice. To this aim, the paper develops an urban political ecological perspective on air pollution, combining key insights of critical/marxist geography and post-foundational political theory. The paper starts from the observation that polluted air is not just ‘nature’, but socially produced nature or hybrid nature, modified and co-produced through power, knowledge and conflict. The focus is on the way in which the uneven development, distribution and circulation of this ‘social-natural artefact’ can trigger processes of politicisation. The assumption is that symbolically constructing air in a spatially differentiated or uneven way plays a crucial role in this perspective. In other words, the focus is on the spatial imaginaries underpinning the discourses of new social movements which <b>put</b> <b>air</b> on the public agenda and turn it into an object of contestation and debate. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies how air {{pollution}} as a largely invisible social-natural artefact has {{been translated into}} an issue of contention and debate in London during the last 20 years. Starting from the coverage of {{air pollution}} in five main newspapers, the paper identifies the critical discursive moments which significantly changed {{the terms of the}} debate. The staging of Oxford Street as the most polluted street of the world, the controversy around Sahara Dust as a ‘natural’ explanation for a smog episode in 2014, and the action of Black Lives Matter at London City Airport, which stated that those who are the first to die are not the first to fly, {{are just a few of}} the examples of initiatives that <b>put</b> <b>air</b> pollution on the agenda in recent years. The paper investigates the decisions, choices and exclusions that inevitably take place in this staging of air as a political issue. Already at the level of the construction of a scientific ‘fact’, processes of inclusion and exclusion take place. The spatial location of monitoring stations, the focus on particular pollutants and the chosen time frame influence the way the ‘fact’ of air pollution is constructed. But important choices also take place in the translation of these scientific ‘facts’ into ‘political ‘problems’. From high to illegal levels of air pollution, from the number of deaths to the level of costs, from people’s health to children’s health: these constructions all influence the terms of the debate. The emergence of political fault lines and antagonisms and the (lack of) activity of a whole range of social actors result from this and will in their turn further push the debate in specific directions. The paper analyses how this complex set of relations, and the forms of power involved, determined the framing of air pollution as we know it today. status: publishe...|$|E
