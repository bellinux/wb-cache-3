25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Rolling Stone Indonesia listed {{two songs}} that Goeslaw {{performed}} while with Potret in {{its list of}} the 150 Best Indonesian Songs of All Time, {{both of which were}} from the album Potret II. [...] "Salah" [...] ("Wrong") was ranked 74th, being noted as the best example of Goeslaw's [...] "fresh, direct, and often provocative nuances" [...] when writing songs and writing that her [...] "sweet" [...] vocals challenged the paradigm that a singer singing about an affair should be either a victim or full of revenge. The other song, [...] "Bunda" [...] ("Mother") was ranked at 110; it was noted being capable of making anyone, [...] "even the most cruel man", <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to think of their mother. Rolling Stone Indonesia noted a decrease in the quality of Goeslaw's songs since Ada Apa Dengan Cinta?.|$|E

After he was notified of his nomination, he said [...] "It's so much more satisfying to get this award now than posthumously. This way I'll be able to enjoy it. Honestly, it was a sobering moment when they called and told me I was being inducted along with some of the people I admired most growing up. It gives you reason to <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and reflect that maybe some good was accomplished along the way." ...|$|E
