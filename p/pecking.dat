5|$|An {{abnormal}} behaviour of birds in captivity, performed primarily by commercial egg-laying hens, characterized by <b>pecking</b> {{damage to the}} , the surrounding skin and underlying tissue. Vent <b>pecking</b> frequently occurs immediately after an egg has been laid when the cloaca often remains partly everted exposing the mucosa.|$|E
5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather <b>pecking</b> and vent <b>pecking</b> can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, {{both male and}} female mallards can become aggressive, driving off competitors to themselves or their mate by charging at them. Males tend to fight more than females, and attack each other by repeatedly <b>pecking</b> at their rival's chest, ripping out feathers and even skin on rare occasions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Peck</b> {{was born}} on October 19, 1850 in Providence. She was the {{youngest}} of five children, born to Ann Power Smith <b>Peck</b> (1820-1896) and George Bacheler <b>Peck</b> (1807-1882), a lawyer, member of the United States House of Representatives, and a coal and wood merchant. Her brothers, George Bacheler <b>Peck</b> (1843-1934), a doctor, William <b>Peck</b> (1848-1939), Principal of Providence Classical High School, and John Brownell <b>Peck</b> (1845-1923), an engineer, merchant, teacher and farmer, instilled a sense of competitiveness in <b>Peck</b> at a young age. The <b>Pecks</b> also had another daughter, Emily <b>Peck</b> (1847-1847), who died shortly after she was born.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Peck</b> is {{the author}} of [...] "Bulletproof," [...] a memoir that {{discusses}} <b>Peck's</b> battle with mental illness and bipolar disorder.

5|$|In a hierarchy, {{individuals}} are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant {{while the others}} are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a <b>pecking</b> order is a linear ranking of individuals {{where there is a}} top individual and a bottom individual. <b>Pecking</b> orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{well-developed}} {{social structure}} within {{large groups of}} condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and vocalizations. Generally, mature males tend {{to be at the}} top of the <b>pecking</b> order, with post-dispersal immature males tending to be near the bottom.|$|E
5|$|An {{experienced}} right-handed opening batsman, Brown was on {{his third}} campaign in England, having first toured in 1934 before the World War II. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948, Barnes and Morris had risen above him in the <b>pecking</b> order and become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown {{was selected as the}} reserve opener, a decision that generated controversy among pundits who believed he was past his best.|$|E

50|$|A <b>peck</b> is an {{imperial}} and United States customary unit of dry volume, equivalent to 2 gallons or 8 dry quarts or 16 dry pints (9.09 (UK) or 8.81 (US) liters). Two <b>pecks</b> make a kenning (obsolete), and four <b>pecks</b> make a bushel. Although the <b>peck</b> {{is no longer}} widely used, some produce, such as apples, is still often sold by the <b>peck.</b> Despite being referenced in the well-known Peter Piper tongue twister, pickled peppers are so rarely sold by the <b>peck</b> that any association between pickled peppers and the <b>peck</b> unit of measurement is considered humorous in nature.|$|R
5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the <b>pecking</b> order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by <b>pecking</b> others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{continued}} to play for Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy, but only scored 30 in his first four innings of the season. This dropped him down the <b>pecking</b> order as Patel was favoured as the reserve wicket-keeper on the 2006 tour to Pakistan. Immediately after the announcement, Karthik scored 134 against Mumbai in a losing effort, {{but was unable to}} back up with any scores beyond 50 in his five remaining innings in the competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} {{is a popular}} bird with cattle ranchers for its {{perceived}} role as a biocontrol of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets {{reduced the number of}} flies that bothered cattle by <b>pecking</b> them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Ingham {{was forced}} {{further down the}} Sunderland <b>pecking</b> order after the signing of Thomas Myhre in July 2002 and he joined Second Division club Stockport County on a one-month loan on 23 August. He made his only {{appearance}} in a 3–1 victory away to Lincoln in the League Cup on 10 September 2002 and the loan was extended for a second month, before being recalled by Sunderland in October due to an injury crisis. Despite this, he was forced further down Sunderland's <b>pecking</b> order after they signed Mart Poom on loan from Derby County and after considering handing in a transfer request he joined Third Division club Darlington on a one-month loan on 22 November 2002. He made three appearances before returning to Sunderland in December. He played for Sunderland in a friendly against Hull City {{for the opening of}} their new ground, the KC Stadium, which made him the first away goalkeeper at the ground, while also being the last to play at Hull's former ground, Boothferry Park. This was his final appearance for Darlington in a 1–0 victory over Hull, during which he denied Stuart Elliott from scoring on three occasions. He joined Third Division club York City on 24 January 2003 on a one-month loan after goalkeeper Alan Fettis left to join Hull, who Ingham made his debut against a day later in a 0–0 away draw. His loan at York was extended for second and third months in February and March 2003 and he finished the spell, in which he performed well, with 17 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{had been}} widely criticised, and even booed, by City fans at {{times during the}} {{previous}} season and Eriksson said that he hoped it would not happen again and that he appreciated why Samaras could have {{found it hard to}} play under those circumstances. Samaras was behind the likes of Valeri Bojinov and Rolando Bianchi in the <b>pecking</b> order and was included in the squad for the first time only on 25 September, when he was selected for a League Cup match against Norwich City. He started the match and scored a last-minute winner to put Manchester City into the quarter-final.|$|E
5|$|The African crake is {{territorial}} on {{both the}} breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat display involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the flanks and belly like a fan to show the barred underparts. He may march towards the intruder, or walk {{side by side with}} another displaying male. The female may accompany the male, but with feathers less widely fanned. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and <b>pecking.</b> Paired females will attack other females in the territory, especially if the male has shown an interest in them.|$|E

Meanwhile, Arrocas walks in on <b>Peck</b> having rough sex with his wife. <b>Peck</b> tries to goad Arrocas into killing her, but Arrocas accidentally shoots <b>Peck</b> in the foot instead. Avila and Wallace meet on the scene and split up. <b>Peck</b> ambushes and shoots Wallace and flees. Avila, fearing for Kathleen's safety, returns home to find <b>Peck</b> about to rape her. <b>Peck</b> pulls a knife out of his boot and lunges at Avila, who shoots him dead.

50|$|<b>Peck,</b> {{a native}} of Carlisle, Pennsylvania was born to Sarah Jones <b>Peck</b> and John C. <b>Peck</b> (1802-1875), a {{prominent}} abolitionist of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. John <b>Peck,</b> {{a native of}} Hagerstown, Maryland, was a barber, wigmaker, and minister who was active in cultural and antislavery activities in and around Pittsburgh, where he lived after 1837. From about 1844 to 1846, David <b>Peck</b> studied medicine under Dr. Joseph P. Gazzam, a white anti-slavery physician. After his two years of study with Gazzam, <b>Peck</b> entered Rush Medical College, Chicago in autumn 1846, and graduated in 1847.

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow forages {{slowly on}} or near the ground by walking or hopping under shrubs or dense grasses. Though it {{occasionally}} forages in weedy areas, it is almost never observed foraging in the open. It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low shrubs. During the breeding season, it gleans its food from grasses and low shrubs. However, normally the species obtains its food by either <b>pecking</b> or less frequently scratching at leaf litter. This bird tends to forage in a small family group and in a limited area.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a <b>pecking</b> order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's <b>pecking</b> order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{recruitment}} of Tomáš Ujfaluši and Johnny Heitinga pushed Pablo down the <b>pecking</b> order, he finished the 2008–09 season with 21 league appearances. An offer from Real Zaragoza of less than €5m {{was rejected by the}} club as insufficient, but despite the arrival of Juanito adding to the defensive competition, Pablo said he was happy to see out the remaining year of his contract. In that final season, he played rarely.

He was in goal again for United's League Cup game in a defeat against Championship club Crystal Palace on 30 November. It also seemed that he had moved above last season's second choice Tomasz Kuszczak in the <b>pecking</b> order, but was now third choice behind Anders Lindegaard and David de Gea.

5|$|Babangida's {{international}} {{chances were}} partly limited {{due to the}} fact that he often found himself behind Finidi George in the <b>pecking</b> order.

Babangida took part in Nigeria's 1998 World Cup campaign, playing a total of 120 minutes as he started one game and came on as a sub in the other three. He scored his team's only goal in the second-round defeat to Denmark. In January 2001, Babangida appeared in an exhibition game at the Yokohama International Stadium (known as the Nissan Stadium nowadays), playing for FIFA XI in a game against the unified team of Japan and South Korea.|$|E
