40|$|Introduction The problem <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> {{and related}} {{problem of the}} {{formation}} of spatial and temporal structures, i. e. the Turing and Hopf bifurcations, seems to be important up to now (see [1 - 3]). The development of the general theory <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> has been stimulated by the latest advance connecting with the universal behavior of the systems having different physical natures near the continuous phase transition point and critical (bifurcation) points. The modern theory <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> (synergetics) is based on such powerful and well-developed methods as those of nonlinear mechanics, kinetic models and <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> phase transition. It is obvious that the phase-transition methods using fundamental ideas of scaling invariance [4], renormalization group [5], collective variables [6] are preferable because various systems (not only physical but chemical, biological, sociological, etc.) exhibit an anomalous high susceptibility to external influences.

This chapter describes the history of knowledge transfer from physics, in particular <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> and evolution, to the social sciences.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Our {{understanding}} is that psychology is a biopsychosocial science {{as well as a}} developmental science. Behavioral origins stem from ontogenetic processes, behavioral as well as biological. Biological factors are simply participating factors in behavioral origins and not causal factors. Psychology is not a biological science; it is a unique psychological science, a natural science consistent and compatible with the principles of the other sciences. Accordingly, we show in this chapter how principles and ideas from other sciences play important roles in psychology. While we focus on the concepts from <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> and emergence, we also address the cosmological and evolutionary biology idea of increased complexity over time, the organizing principle of integrative levels, and the epigenetic processes that are in part responsible for transgenerational trait transmission. Our discussion stresses the developmental science concepts of embodiment and contextualism and how they structure thinking about psychological processes. We conclude with a description of how these ideas support current postpositivist conceptions of relational processes and models in contemporary developmental science...|$|E
40|$|Threshold {{systems are}} known to be some of the most {{important}} nonlinear self-organizing systems in nature, including networks of earthquake faults, neural networks, superconductors and semiconductors, and the World Wide Web, as well as political, social, and ecological systems. All of these systems have dynamics that are strongly correlated in space and time, and all typically display a multiplicity of spatial and temporal scales. Here we discuss the <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> in earthquake threshold systems at two distinct scales: (i) The “microscopic” laboratory scale, in which consideration of results from simulations leads to dynamical equations that can be used to derive the results obtained from sliding friction experiments, and (ii) the “macroscopic” earthquake fault-system scale, in which the physics of strongly correlated earthquake fault systems can be understood by using time-dependent state vectors defined in a Hilbert space of eigenstates, similar in many respects to the mathematics of quantum mechanics. In all of these systems, long-range interactions induce the existence of locally ergodic dynamics. The existence of dissipative effects leads to the appearance of a “leaky threshold” dynamics, equivalent to a new scaling field that controls the size of nucleation events relative to the size of background fluctuations. At the macroscopic earthquake fault-system scale, these ideas show considerable promise as a means of forecasting future earthquake activity...|$|E

40|$|The <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> and {{complexity}} is manifested {{on a variety}} of biological scales, from large ecosystems to the molecular level. Protein molecules exhibit characteristics of complex systems in terms of their structure, dynamics, and function. Proteins have the extraordinary ability to fold to a specific functional three-dimensional shape, starting from a random coil, in a biologically relevant time. How they accomplish {{this is one of the}} secrets of life. In this work, theoretical research into understanding this remarkable behavior is discussed. Thermodynamic and statistical mechanical tools are used in order to investigate the protein folding dynamics and stability. Theoretical analyses of the results from computer simulation of the dynamics of a four-helix bundle show that the excluded volume entropic effects are very important in protein dynamics and crucial for protein stability. The dramatic effects of changing the size of sidechains imply that a strategic placement of amino acid residues with a particular size may be an important consideration in protein engineering. Another investigation deals with modeling protein structural transitions as a phase transition. Using finite size scaling theory, the nature of unfolding transition of a four-helix bundle protein was investigated and critical exponents for the transition were calculated for various hydrophobic strengths in the core. It is found that the order of the transition changes from first to higher order as the strength of the hydrophobic interaction in the core region is significantly increased. Finally, a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analysis was carried out in a model two-helix bundle. The connection between the structural free-energy landscape and folding kinetics was quantified. I show how simple protein engineering, by changing the hydropathy of a small number of amino acids, can enhance protein folding by significantly changing the free energy landscape so that kinetic traps are removed. The results have general applicability in protein engineering as well as understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of protein folding. ...|$|E

40|$|Self-organized maps {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{as a model for}} the formation of sensory maps in the cerebral cortex. The role of inputs is critical in this process <b>of</b> <b>self-organization.</b> This paper presents a systematic approach to analyzing the relationship between the input ensemble and the quality <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> achieved. We present a method for generating an input stimulus set consisting of images of curved lines.

Since there is considerable scientic interest in the processing of information in the human visual stream, we specically address the problem <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> <b>of</b> cortical areas V 1 and V 2.

We show that as the curvature of the generated lines increases, this measure <b>of</b> <b>self-organization</b> decreases. Furthermore, self-organization using curved lines as stimuli is achieved much more rapidly, as the curve images do not contain as much higher order structure as natural images do. ...|$|R
