[...] The difference is that PVT term is used especially by Arbitron. It {{is a kind of}} persuasion process used to influence audience, a fundamental part of various advertising terms. (PVT) is used especially to denote the TV ratings in relation to the persuasion process involving the process of advertising influence which is intended to change the audiences' or prospects' attitudes and purchase behavior.|$|E
40|$|Various {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} older persons' problems in potentially failing {{to keep pace}} with developments in information technology and the latest technologies that prevent physical and social loss. In contrast to such studies that treat users as static and technology as changing, it's important to understand the use of technology can change over time. For example, older <b>persons</b> have <b>used</b> technologies like <b>television</b> for many years. How do these technologies, already integrated into peoples' lives, change their meaning over the life span? For many years international statistics have shown that television viewing increases over the adult life span. Most research has largely focused on TV content preferences and televised portrayals of the elderly. The basic understanding has been that TV viewing increase because old people spend more time at home excluded from the world outside and that they watch television because they have the time and opportunity to do so. Swedish studies on the importance of watching television in old people's everyday life show that television plays an important role for old people. It is not simply a substitute for doing other things but plays a role in helping individuals maintain a social relation to society. It also helps create a space for contemplation. Older <b>persons</b> <b>use</b> <b>television</b> to increase the space of negotiating meanings in old age. This process of interaction between ageing and technology changes over time. Using the concept of "subjective age," there is evidence that television viewing marks the transition from the third to the fourth age...|$|R

50|$|PUT or <b>Persons</b> <b>Using</b> TV or People <b>Using</b> <b>Television</b> is {{television}} audience measurement term. It is quantity {{of the total number}} of people in the target audience who are viewing television for more than five minutes during an average quarter-hour. PUT is generally expressed in percentage format. It is basically defined as the number or percentage of audience of the particular area’s or market’s persons that are watching television at a particular time. PUT was first given and used by Nielsen Media Research. It is used by media planners and buyers, advertisers to appropriate the ratings of channels when individual viewership is calculated. This term is usually used in the USA to represent average percentage of People using TV across all channels within predefined time period.Media planners and advertisers <b>used</b> <b>television</b> ratings to broadcast programs on various channels to reach the target reach. PUT is a <b>television</b> rating <b>used</b> to analyze the television rating, which is used to strategize and evaluate television viewing on a particular daypart i.e. evening, prime-time, late night. A people meter is used to calculate the viewing habits of TV and cable audiences. PUT gets the ratings figures from people meter. PUT combines the viewing all persons watching the television in a particular house, rather than just reporting specific program viewing. The terms PUT and PVT (Persons viewing <b>television)</b> can be <b>used</b> interchangeably in common usage.|$|R

40|$|Research {{found that}} parents have their {{children}} watch television {{for several reasons}} (Rideout & Hamel, 2006; Zimmerman, Christakis, & Meltzoff, 2007). Parents might put their children {{in front of the}} television to calm them down or to accompany children’s bedtime. One often-heard reason among parents is to babysit the children (Evans, Jordan, & Horner, 2011; Götz, Bachmann, & Hofmann, 2007). According to several studies, parents sometimes sit their child down {{in front of the television}} set when they need something get done or when they are temporarily not able to supervise their child (Rideout & Hamel, 2006; Zimmerman et al., 2007). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that television should not be used as an electronic babysitter for young children (AAP, 1999). However, little research has examined parents’ <b>use</b> of <b>television</b> as a babysitter as predictor of children’s time spent watching television. Therefore, this study investigates the associations between parent and child factors, the <b>use</b> of <b>television</b> as a babysitter and children’s viewing time. Data from 844 parents of children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years are reported. An integrative model was constructed and structural-equation modeling was performed to assess the relationships between parent and child factors, the <b>use</b> of <b>television</b> as a babysitter, and children’s television viewing time. Moderator analyses were conducted by means of multigroup analysis to investigate whether parental education and parental attitude toward television would moderate the associations. All analyses were performed using AMOS 19. Results show that almost half of the parents (48, 1 %) admitted to <b>using</b> <b>television</b> for their child to get things done on their own. More than one third of parents (36, 2 %) sometimes <b>used</b> <b>television</b> as a babysitter while they prepared meals; three out of ten parents (31, 3 %) indicated to do this often or very often. Additionally, more than a quarter of parents (26, 5 %) indicated that they sometimes sat their child in front of the television to get dressed themselves; 14, 1 % of parents often or very often <b>used</b> <b>television</b> for their child while getting dressed. Finally, almost four out of ten parents (37, 3 %) sometimes and another 12, 4 % of parents often or very often <b>used</b> <b>television</b> for their child while cleaning. Structural-equation modeling revealed that <b>using</b> <b>television</b> as a babysitter predicted increased time spent watching television, =. 173, B = 8. 707, SE = 1. 868, p<. 001. The more parents <b>used</b> <b>television</b> to replace parental supervision, the more television children watched. Parents’ attitude toward television emerged as best predictor of <b>using</b> <b>television</b> as a babysitter, =. 256, B =. 391, SE =. 074, p<. 001, indicating that parents with strong positive attitudes toward <b>television</b> tended to <b>use</b> <b>television</b> more often as a babysitter. As such, parents’ attitude toward television had a direct positive effect on the time children spent watching television, =. 153, B = 11. 762, SE = 2. 885, p<. 001, as well as an indirect effect, by directly predicting the <b>use</b> of <b>television</b> as a babysitter. Parents’ time spent watching television was the best predictor of the time children spent watching television, =. 381, B = 1. 141, SE =. 094, p<. 001. Both parental attitudes toward television and parental education moderated the effect of <b>using</b> <b>television</b> as a babysitter. First, moderator analyses revealed that the effect of <b>using</b> <b>television</b> as a babysitter on the time children spent watching television was stronger among children whose parents had strong positive attitudes toward child television viewing, =. 300, B = 16. 805, SE = 3. 017, p<. 001. The relationship between <b>using</b> <b>television</b> as a babysitter and time spent watching television just failed to reach significance within the group of children whose parents had little positive attitudes toward television, =. 102, B = 4. 077, SE = 2. 133, p=. 056. Second, moderator analyses demonstrated that the impact of <b>using</b> <b>television</b> as a babysitter was moderated by parental education. Surprisingly, <b>using</b> <b>television</b> as a babysitter only was a predictor of children’s viewing time among children of parents with high education (undergraduate education, =. 254, B = 12. 140, SE = 2. 910, p<. 001; graduate education, =. 362, B = 13. 956, SE = 3. 265, p<. 001), but not among children of parents with low education (no education or high school education, =. 012, B =. 641, SE = 3. 481, p=. 854). The more educated parents were, the more television as babysitter led to increased viewing among children. These findings indicate that children of parents with strong positive attitudes toward television and children of parents with high education are at greater risk for the impact of <b>using</b> <b>television</b> as a babysitter. status: publishe...|$|R
