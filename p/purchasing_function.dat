The <b>Purchase</b> <b>Function</b> enables us to enhance our knowledge about the system as a whole, describing both customers and products, and we prove its usefulness in three different analyses. First, we provide one empirical observation of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs [12]. Using the <b>Purchase</b> <b>Function</b> we discover that highly ranked customers, with more sophisticated needs, tend to buy niche products, i.e., low-ranked products; on the other hand, low-ranked, low purchase volume customers tend buy only high-ranked product, very popular products that everyone buys.|$|R

5000|$|Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf {{was born}} into an old Prussian aristocratic-military family in Berlin during the {{economically}} dynamic {{first decade of the}} twentieth century. His father died in 1907. [...] Between 1923 and 1927 he studied Mechanical engineering at the Braunschweig University of Technology, emerging with an engineering doctorate in 1929.

[...] On returning to Germany he joined Adam Opel AG, Germany's largest automobile manufacturer, which in 1929 had been acquired by the US based General Motors Corporation (as it was known at the time). Within Opel von Heydekampf was soon promoted, in 1936 joining the board and taking charge of the company's <b>purchasing</b> <b>function.</b> [...] Further promotion followed in October 1938 when he took over as General Manager, in succession to Hanns Grewenig, at Opel's new Brandenburg truck plant.|$|E
5000|$|Strategic {{plans are}} drawn up with {{suppliers}} {{to support the}} manufacturing flow management process {{and the development of}} new products. In firms whose operations extend globally, sourcing may be managed on a global basis. The desired outcome is a relationship where both parties benefit and a reduction in the time required for the product's design and development. The <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> may also develop rapid communication systems, such as electronic data interchange (EDI) and Internet linkage, to convey possible requirements more rapidly. Activities related to obtaining products and materials from outside suppliers involve resource planning, supply sourcing, negotiation, order placement, inbound transportation, storage, handling, and quality assurance, many of which include the responsibility to coordinate with suppliers on matters of scheduling, supply continuity (inventory), hedging, and research into new sources or programs. Procurement has recently been recognized as a core source of value, driven largely by the increasing trends to outsource products and services, and the changes in the global ecosystem requiring stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.|$|E
50|$|Procurement {{software}} is business software {{that helps to}} automate the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> of organizations. Activities including raising and approving purchase orders, selecting and ordering the product or service, receiving and matching the invoice and order, and paying the bill is handled electronically, enabling the procurement department to see everything that is ordered, ensure that nothing can be ordered without correct approvals, and lets them get the best value by combining several orders for {{the same type of}} good or even getting suppliers to bid for the business. Buying organisation's choice can be driven by the particular strengths offered by each individual system and the number of vendors available through them. A multinational or otherwise large organization will use a shared procurement system to take advantage of economies of scale to drive down the cost of purchases. While traditionally most e-procurement software systems have been designed for larger organizations, there are now also systems available for the SMB market, such as the Free-Procurement Project and an open source alternative by ProcuMan. Whilst some services are available to purchase through automated systems, the key strength of these systems lies in the procurement of commodities that are much easier to standardise.|$|E

5000|$|Aside from {{traditional}} methods of reverse marketing, this technique is also used in B2B markets. In this instance the buyer (business) will take the initiative to approach the supplier (manufacturer) with its needs. This tactic is often used by large companies in order to decrease redundancies in their supply chain and decrease costs. The concept of reverse marketing also corresponds with Supply Chain Management. The strategy of reversing roles in some cases, has been very successful. In 2001 Richard Plank and Deborah Francis published an article studying the impact reverse marketing has on the buyer-seller relationship. They pinpointed what the motivation was behind the reversal of roles: [...] The relationship of conflict and reverse marketing activity is of interest to researchers and practicing managers alike as it suggests that by taking a reverse marketing stance affective conflict can be reduced and cognitive conflict may be enhanced. This {{is important in the}} emerging strategic orientation of supply chain management, which suggests that the focus of competitive advantage should be the supply chain rather than the individual organization. In order to forge strategic advantage, the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> must develop relationships with suppliers that have limited affective conflict.|$|E
50|$|This trend {{away from}} the daily {{procurement}} function (tactical purchasing) resulted in several changes in the industry. The first was the reduction of personnel. Purchasing departments were now smaller. There {{was no need for}} the army of clerks processing orders for individual parts as in the past. Another change was the focus on negotiating contracts and procurement of large capital equipment. Both of these functions permitted purchasing departments to make the biggest financial contribution to the organization. A new term and job title emerged - Strategic sourcing and Sourcing Managers. These professionals not only focused on the bidding process and negotiating with suppliers, but the entire supply function. In these roles they were able to add value and maximize savings for organizations. This value was manifested in lower inventories, less personnel, and getting the end product to the consumer quicker. Purchasing managers' success in these roles resulted in new assignments outside to the traditional <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> - logistics, materials management, distribution, and warehousing. More and more purchasing managers were becoming Supply Chain Managers handling additional functions of their organization's operation. Purchasing managers were not the only ones to become Supply Chain Managers. Logistic managers, material managers, distribution managers, etc. all rose to the broader function and some had responsibility for the purchasing functions now.|$|E
40|$|During recent years, {{increasing}} specialisation {{and complex}} market structures have made companies divide their purchasing functions into several organisational units {{to cope with}} increasingly diversified demands on linking the internal operations within the firm with operations at their suppliers. In this paper, we focus on organising of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> as an interface between internal and external counterparts. We suggest a framework focusing on how the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> works as an interface between the firm’s suppliers and (other) firm internal functions, such as production, product development and marketing. The framework builds on two dimensions; one that describes how the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> of a firm relates to other internal functions and one describing how it relates to suppliers. The purchasing situations described by the framework are illustrated with some examples. Also, {{the ways in which}} the organising principles can be aligned to purchasing strategies are discussed. We conclude with some possible avenues for further research to explore the insights the framework may generate.

40|$|Purpose – Prime {{contractors}} spent {{a substantial}} part of their turnover on purchasing. The management of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> therefore has a large influence on the overall performance of a prime contractor. The more developed the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> is, the greater its contribution to success of the companies. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to measure and explain the development in maturity of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> in construction firms. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review, a theoretical framework for the assessment of purchasing maturity is provided first. Then a longitudinal multiple case study is executed in order to assess the maturity development of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> in seven construction companies. Results are compared with a historical baseline assessment. Findings – The results demonstrate an increase in the maturity of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> in general and in particular in the management of strategic relations. The case companies have reached a maturity in which they start to coordinate activities in their supply chains. Increased use of IT solutions enables a more integrated approach of the construction process. Practical implications – IT and in particular Building Information Modelling pave the path towards an integrated supply chain, which in turn enables the reduction of waste in the processes. Nevertheless, companies still struggle with the tension between project-based flexibility and long-term relations with suppliers. Originality/value – The development of purchasing maturity was measured in a baseline measurement and in a second assessment performed five years later by using the exact same model and exact same case companies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Innovations {{not only}} {{contribute}} to competitiveness {{of the company}} but have also positive effects on revenues. On average, product innovations account to 14 percent of companies ’ sales. Innovation management has substantially changed during the last decade, because of growing reliance on external partners. As a consequence, a new task for purchasing arises, as firms need to understand which suppliers actually do have high potential contributing to the innovativeness of the firm and which do not. Proper organization of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> is important since {{for the majority of}} manufacturing companies deal with substantial material costs which pass through the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function.</b> In the past the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> was largely seen as a transaction-oriented, clerical function but today purchasing is the intermediate with supply chain partners contributing to innovations, be it product or process innovations. Therefore, <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> has to be organized differently to enable firm innovation potential. However, innovations are inherently risky. There are behavioral risk (that some partner will take advantage of the other party), technological risk in terms of complexity of products and processes of manufacturing and incoming materials and finally market risks, which in fact judge the value of the innovation. These risks are investigated in this work. Specifically, technological risks which deal with complexity of the products, and processes will be investigated more thoroughly. Buying components or such high edge technologies necessities careful investigation of technical features and therefore is usually conducted by a team of experts. Therefore it is hypothesized that higher the technological risk, higher will be the centralization of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> as an interface with other supply chain members. Main contribution of this research lies is in the fact that analysis was performed on a large data set of 1493 companies, from 25 countries collected in the GMRG 4 survey. Most analyses of <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> are done by case study analysis of innovative firms. Therefore this study contributes with empirical evaluations that can be generalized.

40|$|Interest {{in early}} {{supplier}} integration in new product development (NPD) has increased as an open innovation approach {{has become more}} common in firms.

The findings describe how innovative firms organise their <b>purchasing</b> <b>function,</b> distinguishing between ‘advanced sourcing’ and ‘life-cycle sourcing’ units. The results include the tools that these firms use, such as regular innovation meetings with suppliers and technology roadmaps linking firm strategy, innovation strategy and sourcing strategies.

40|$|As {{highlighted}} by Bititci et al. (2005), both academics and practitioners have developed models that aim {{to define and}} measure the overall performance of an organization and cover various business areas and processes, including, for example, performance measures for production planning and control (Kochhar et al., 1996), performance measurement for the product development process (O’Donnel and Duffy, 2002), performance measurement for human resources (Kelly and Gennard, 2001), performance measurement for service management (Wilson, 2000) and performance measurement for supply chain management (Beamon, 1999; Gunasekaran et al., 2001 and 2004; Sanchez-Rodriduez et al., 2003). However, {{although there have been}} many contributions to the debate on performance measurement systems, there is little in the literature regarding performance measurement for the purchasing process and, more in general, for the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> (Kumar et al., 2005). This appears strange {{in the light of the}} increasing importance of the role covered by the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> in the achievement of the organization’s goals (Lamming, 1993). This evolution has led to recognise the important role that the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> can play within an organization being recognised, i. e. its potential for enhancing the overall performances of the firm. Leenders et al. (2002) asserts that these are exiting times for those concerned with an effective and efficient purchasing and supply management process. Actual business context, characterised by an increasing competition among organizations, <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> is recognise as a strategic weapon in enhancing firm competitive advantage. Changing context in supply market and the introduction of new approaches to manage purchasing activities have increased the complexity related to the management of purchasing activities. In this perspective PPMS should support the employees management and the whole firm in the management of the function especially in the new roles played so far from the clerical one that have characterised the past of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function.</b> From past work experience PPMS could play a role in making purchasing contribution more visible, especially for those activities characterised as intangible, resulting in a greater recognition of the purchasing department within the firm. From the review of PPMS literature and in comparison between PMS and PPMS literatures the following research gaps have been identified: -	Few empirical researches on design, implementation and use of PMS in the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function.</b> -	Lack of a global approach to performance measurement considering all the purchasing activities undertaken and its role within the organization. -	There is no clear link to the purchasing strategy and organization’s strategy. -	There is no clear link to purchasing market maturity. Some contributions found in this context have dealt with the measurement of <b>purchasing</b> <b>function,</b> however, in the majority of cases, this contributions have proposed some models that could be applied in the measurement of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>function</b> but there is no contribution that systematically classifies what is already done in literature or proposes guidelines highlighting proprieties of PPMS useful during the implementation of the measurement system. In the literature review only Carter et al. (2005) and Fant and Panizzolo (2006) have proposed a list of proprieties. The firsts related to performance measures, whereas the latter to measurement system. Another important consideration is that nobody has taken in consideration to identify contingent factors affecting the design, implementation and use of PPMS. The aim of this research is to fill this gap, identifying organizational and operational factors affecting the adoption of a PPMS...|$|E
