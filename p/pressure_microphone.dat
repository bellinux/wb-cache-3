25|$|The inner {{elements}} of a microphone are {{the primary source of}} differences in directivity. A <b>pressure</b> <b>microphone</b> uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.|$|E

40|$|For {{compliance}} test purposes, {{the noise level}} of a HVAC is usually measured with a <b>pressure</b> <b>microphone</b> positioned at a certain distance. This measurement is normally performed in an anechoic room. However, this method doesn't provide the engineer any insight on what noise sources do contribute to the overall noise level measured. A new Microflown based low sound level source path contribution analysis measurement approach is presented to pinpoint the various noise sources that vary in time, frequency and place.

50|$|Some {{microphone}} {{techniques used}} for coverage of three front channels, include double-stereo techniques, INA-3 (Ideal Cardioid Arrangement), the Decca Tree setup and the OCT (Optimum Cardioid Triangle). Surround techniques are {{largely based on}} 3-channel techniques with additional microphones used for the surround channels. A distinguishing factor for the pickup of the front channels in surround is that less reverberation should be picked up, as the surround microphones {{will be responsible for}} the pickup of reverberation. Cardioid, hypercardioid, or supercardioid polar patterns will therefore often replace omnidirectional polar patterns for surround recordings. To compensate for the lost low-end of directional (<b>pressure</b> gradient) <b>microphones,</b> additional omnidirectional (<b>pressure</b> <b>microphones),</b> exhibiting an extended low-end response, can be added. The microphone’s output is usually low-pass filtered.A simple surround microphone configuration involves the use of a front array in combination with two backward-facing omnidirectional room microphones placed about 10-15 meters away from the front array. If echoes are notable, the front array can be delayed appropriately. Alternatively, backward facing cardioid microphones can be placed closer to the front array for a similar reverberation pickup.|$|R

40|$|Measurement {{of sound}} {{intensity}} involves determining the sound {{pressure and the}} particle velocity at the same position simultaneously. For more than 25 years the ‘p-p method ’ based on two closely spaced pressure microphones has dominated sound intensity measurement. This method is based on determining the particle velocity from a finite difference approximation of the pressure gradient. The alternative ‘p-u method’, which combines a <b>pressure</b> <b>microphone</b> with a particle velocity transducer, has been hampered {{by the absence of}} reliable particle velocity transducers. However, a micromachined particle velocity transducer called the Microflown has recently become available, and an intensity probe based on this device in combination with a small <b>pressure</b> <b>microphone</b> is now in commercial production.

This study focuses on investigating the effects of porous materials on the noise level due to the structure-borne noise excitation.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedAcoustic measurements have traditionally relied exclusively on sound pressure sensors. This research investigated {{the performance of}} Microflown 3 D hybrid pressure and acoustic particle velocity sensors in a linear array. Each Microflown sensor has three output channels proportional to the acoustic particle velocity in the three, nominally orthogonal, directions {{in addition to an}} output from an omnidirectional <b>pressure</b> <b>microphone.</b> The linear array was formed with a conventional omnidirectional microphone as the center element and two Microflown sensors located 17. 2 cm away on either side. The Microflown acoustic particle velocity channels were characterized first by the amplitude and phase relationship of their transfer functions relative to their co-located <b>pressure</b> <b>microphone.</b> The transfer function between the Microflown pressure hydrophones and the conventional center microphone was also measured. This enabled the amplitude and phase of all channels to be expressed relative to the center microphone signal. Beamforming was carried out in the frequency domain by applying the appropriate weight and phase delay for the desired steer angle. The bandwidth of the beamformer was limited from about 300 Hz to 1. 5 kHz. At lower frequencies, insufficient signal to noise limited the coherence required to establish the transfer functions while at higher frequencies the phase of the particle velocity transfer functions grew increasingly sensitive to orientation angle. Experiments carried out in the Naval Postgraduate School Anechoic Chamber using single and multiple acoustic sources compared extremely well to the theoretical performance. The addition of hybrid pressure and particle velocity sensors proved successful in eliminating the bearing ambiguity inherent in a linear array of omnidirectional sensors with no change in orientation, no complicated post-processing and no additional time expended.
