25|$|Installing {{a hybrid}} OR is a {{challenge}} to standard hospital room sizes, as not only the imaging system requires some additional space, but there are also more <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> as in a normal OR. A team of 8 to 20 people including anasthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, technicians, perfusionists, support staff from device companies etc. can work in such an OR. Depending on the imaging system chosen, a room size of 70 square meters including a control room but excluding a technical room and the preparation areas is recommended. Additional preparations of the room necessary are 2-3mm lead shielding and potentially enforcement of the floor or ceiling to hold the additional weight of the imaging system (approximately 650–1800kg).|$|E
25|$|On 16 February 2001 at Nellis Air Force Base, a Predator {{successfully}} fired three Hellfire AGM-114C missiles into a target. The newly armed Predators {{were given}} the designation of MQ-1A. In {{the first week of}} June 2001, a Hellfire missile was successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan Tarnak residence built at a Nevada testing site. A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> would have been killed. On 4 September 2001 (after the Bush cabinet approved a Qaeda/Taliban plan), CIA chief Tenet ordered the agency to resume reconnaissance flights. The Predators were now weapons-capable, but didn't carry missiles because the host country (presumably Uzbekistan) hadn't granted permission.|$|E
25|$|The {{bystander}} {{effect was}} first {{demonstrated in the}} laboratory by John M. Darley and Bibb Latané in 1968 after they {{became interested in the}} topic following the murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964. These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most replicable effects in social psychology. In a typical experiment, the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates. An emergency situation is staged and researchers measure how long it takes the participants to intervene, if they intervene. These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping, often by a large margin. For example, Bibb Latané and Judith Rodin (1969) staged an experiment around a woman in distress. 70 percent of the people alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt, but when there were other <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> only 40 percent offered help.|$|E

25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E

He showed a gun to the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and told them he had two others in his car and home. Clemmons said he planned to activate an alarm by removing a court-ordered ankle monitor, then he would shoot the police officers who responded to his house.

I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left.

2500|$|This often {{involves}} programming different effects and signal processing {{for use on}} specific songs, to make the songs sound somewhat similar to the studio versions. To manage a show {{with a lot of}} effects changes, the mixing engineers for the show often choose to use a digital mixing console so that they can save and automatically recall these many settings in between each song. [...] This time is also used by the system technicians to get familiar with the specific combination of gear {{that is going to be}} used on the tour and how it acoustically responds during the show. [...] These technicians remain busy during the show, making sure the SR system is operating properly and that the system is tuned correctly, as the acoustic response of a room or venue will respond differently throughout the day depending on the temperature, humidity, and number of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> or space.|$|E
2500|$|These {{included}} a rigid {{adherence to the}} protocol of the test, so that the subjects {{would not be allowed}} to change it in the midst of the run. This had been the modus operandi of Uri Geller while being tested at Stanford Research Institute; whenever something did not work, he simply did something else instead. The researchers then reported this as a success, when in fact the original test had failed. Other suggestions included having only one object of study at any time, permanently marking the object or objects used so they could not be switched, and having as few <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> as possible to avoid distractions. Randi also offered his services to watch the experiments as a control, noting that a conjurer would be an excellent person to look for fakery. Phillips did not take Randi up on the offer because of the skeptic's reputation of being [...] "a showman rather than an unprejudiced critic" [...] and his perceived hostility towards psychic claimants. In his letters, Randi even told the researchers that the subjects were fake, but the researchers did not check out their backgrounds.|$|E

30|$|For the {{improvement}} of heating and temperature, the main concern is to not heat too much {{when there are no}} <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b> Therefore, many different sensors and systems are incorporated to make sure this does not happen. If the system can better communicate, the temperature could possibly be lowered. More regulation according to use patterns can help, e.g. linking the booking system to temperature control. For instance, in a newer building, the temperature is increased a few hours before a room is occupied, and the temperature is lower {{for the rest of the}} time. If it can be implemented and optimized in all rooms, temperatures could be lowered when rooms are not used, resulting in energy savings.|$|R
