40|$|Abstract — Three-stage {{non-blocking}} switching fabrics are {{the next}} step in scaling current crossbar switches to many hundreds or few thousands of <b>ports.</b> <b>Congestion</b> (output contention) management is the central open problem –without it, performance suffers heavily under real-world traffic patterns. Centralized schedulers for bufferless crossbars manage output contention but are not scalable to high valencies and to multi-stage fabrics. Distributed scheduling, as in buffered crossbars, is scalable but has never been scaled beyond crossbars. We combine ideas from centralized and from distributed schedulers, from request-grant protocols, and from credit-based flow control, to propose a novel, practical architecture for scheduling in non-blocking buffered switching fabrics. The new architecture relies on multiple, independent, single-resource schedulers, operating in a pipeline. It: (i) does not need internal speedup; (ii) directly operates on variable-size packets or multi-packet segments; (iii) isolates well-behaved from congested flows; (iv) provides delays that successfully compete against output queueing; (v) provides 95 % or better throughput under unbalanced traffic; (vi) provides weighted max-min fairness; (vii) resequences cells or segments using very small buffers; (viii) can be realistically implemented for a 1024 × 1024 reference fabric made out of 32 × 32 buffered crossbar switch elements at 10 Gbps line rate. This paper carefully studies the many intricacies of the problem and the solution, discusses implementation, and provides performance simulation results. ...|$|R

Other hubs or devices can be attached to the downstream ports. During normal transmission, hubs are essentially transparent: data received from its upstream port is broadcast to all devices attached to its downstream ports; data received from a downstream port is generally forwarded to the upstream port only. This way, what is sent by the host is received by all hubs and devices, and what is sent by a device is received by the host but not by the other devices (an exception is resume signalling).

The first is the short distance to the main East-West shipping routes. Second, the central position in the Indian Ocean implies short feeder distances (see Figure 2). The exploitation of a transshipment port can generate more income for the Maldives besides the income from tourism.

This thesis defines different types of collaborative workflows, namely: intra-organisation collaborative workflow, inter-organisation collaborative workflow, and heterogeneous organisation collaborative workflow, and the challenges each of these are facing. The contribution of this thesis is that it developed several techniques to support collaborative workflow modelling, design, implementation and management of large-scale, complex collaborative environments including Extended Activities Diagrams, Coloured Petri-nets, System Dynamics Modelling, Managerial Administrative Operational (MAO) Workflow Model, Service Oriented and Self-organisation Workflow Management.

However the accessibility of the port by road is endangered by the ever increasing congestion. Although most of the congestion is caused by commuters in the rush hours, the continuing growth in container traffic in the PoR is also contributing to the traffic jams on the <b>port</b> highway. <b>Congestion</b> on the main access road A 15 to the port and at the sea terminals result in longer transport times and more important, an unreliable delivery of the cargo. A Container Transferium situated in the direct hinterland of the PoR is a new logistic concept which allows for large numbers of containers to be transferred by inland vessels in a single movement from the sea terminals at the Maasvlakte (port and industrial area situated in the west of the port of Rotterdam) to the Transferium and vice versa. The Transferium can lead to an improved reliability thanks to a better planning of the inland ships or barges, and a better handling of the trucks, which have no longer to deal with traffic-jams en route to sea terminals and waiting times on the sea terminals. The improved reliability and time-saving for trucks is very important and helps to justify the costs of the extra handling at the Container Transferium.

A {{case in point is}} the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach (LA/LB), the nation’s largest and most important port. Almost onehalf of the nation’s port-related traffic passes through the Los Angeles metropolitan area on its way into the interior. The Alameda rail corridor−developed to help accommodate the unprecedented growth of container traffic coming to and from the Port−has not significantly reduced the impact of freight movement on the Los Angeles community. A number of terminals at the Port must truck containers to the terminus of the Alameda corridor, four (4) miles from the <b>Port,</b> causing significant <b>congestion</b> and diesel pollution in the surrounding community. Costly proposals to expand the area’s existing highway system in conjunction with a growing recognition of the dangers of Diesel Particulate Emission (DPE) have prompted a novel approach to the container movement challenge. This approach utilizes a proven Maglev “conveyor belt ” technology that shows promise for both short-haul urban freight movement and interstate-bound containers. The application of this technology to container freight movement at the Port and beyond will reduce both highway congestion and pollution throughout the Los Angeles area. ...|$|R
