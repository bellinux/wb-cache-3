5000|$|A <b>phantom</b> <b>group</b> is {{composed}} of three circuits that are derived from two single-channel circuits to form a phantom circuit. Here the phantom circuit is a third circuit derived from two suitably arranged pairs of wires, called side circuits, with each pair of wires being a circuit in itself {{and at the same}} time acting as one conductor of the third circuit. The [...] "side circuits" [...] within phantom circuits can be coupled to their respective voltage drops by center-tapped transformers, usually called [...] "repeating coils". The center taps are on the line side of the side circuits. Current from the phantom circuit is split evenly by the center taps. This cancels crosstalk from the phantom circuit to the side circuits. Phantom working increased the number of circuits on long distance routes in the early 20th century without putting up more wires. Phantoming declined with the adoption of carrier systems.|$|E

40|$|Background: Genetic {{evaluation}} models {{often include}} genetic groups {{to account for}} unequal genetic level of animals with unknown parentage. The definition of <b>phantom</b> parent <b>groups</b> usually includes a time component (e. g. years). Combining several time periods to ensure sufficiently large groups may create problems since all phantom parents in a group are considered contemporaries. Methods: To avoid the downside of such distinct classification, a fuzzy logic approach is suggested. A phantom parent can be assigned to several genetic groups, with proportions between zero and one that sum to one. Rules were presented for assigning coefficients to the inverse of the relationship matrix for fuzzy-classified genetic groups. This approach was illustrated with simulated data from ten generations of mass selection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to report the {{relationship}} between radiation dose and the ability of sentence digital mammography to detect microcalcifications. All images were acquired by computed radiography and an anthropomorphic breast phantom. The tube voltage and anode/filter combination used were 28  kVp and Mo/Mo. Simulated microcalcifications with an approximate diameter of 250 – 350  μm were positioned on the <b>phantom.</b> <b>Groups</b> of six microcalcifications were arranged in one of two patterns, a line cluster 1  cm long or a hexagonal cluster 4  mm wide. One of the six microcalcifications was removed to create a negative control. Each cluster was placed on 25 different points. Four levels of milliampere-second (mAs) values were applied: 100 %, 50 %, 25 %, and 12. 5 %. Five staff radiologists participated in an observer performance test. All observers used a workstation with a 3 -megapixel monochrome LCD monitor. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC) were used to compare diagnostic performance among the four doses. The overall AUC scores were 0. 97 with 100 % mAs, 0. 93 (n. s.) with 50 %, 0. 90 (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) with 25 %, and 0. 81 (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) with 12. 5 % mAs. Among the negative series, the percentage of images on which observers were able to identify the removed microcalcification point decreased from 88. 8 % with 100 % mAs to 83. 6 % (n. s.) with 50 %, 74. 8 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) with 25 %, and 67. 2 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) with 12. 5 % mAs.

40|$|The present paper {{evaluates the}} {{efficacy}} of low frequency, high intensity auricular {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) for the relief of phantom limb pain. Auricular TENS was compared with a no-stimulation placebo condition using a controlled crossover design in a group of amputees with (1) <b>phantom</b> limb pain (<b>Group</b> PLP), (2) nonpainful <b>phantom</b> limb sensations (<b>Group</b> PLS), and (3) no phantom limb at all (Group No PL). Small, but significant, reductions in the intensity of nonpainful phantom limb sensations were found for Group PLS during the TENS but not the placebo condition. In addition, 10 min after receiving auricular TENS, Group PLP demonstrated a modest, yet statistically significant decrease in pain as measured by the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Ratings of mood, sleepiness, and anxiety remained virtually unchanged across test occasions and sessions, indicating that the decrease in pain was not mediated by emotional factors. Further placebo-controlled trials of auricular TENS in patients with phantom limb pain are recommended in order to evaluate the importance of electrical stimulation parameters such as pulse width and rate, and to establish the duration of pain relief...|$|R

The definition of <b>phantom</b> parent <b>groups</b> usually includes a time component (e. g. years). Combining several time periods to ensure sufficiently large groups may create problems since all phantom parents in a group are considered contemporaries. Methods To avoid the downside of such distinct classification, a fuzzy logic approach is suggested. A phantom parent can be assigned to several genetic groups, with proportions between zero and one that sum to one. Rules were presented for assigning coefficients to the inverse of the relationship matrix for fuzzy-classified genetic groups. This approach was illustrated with simulated data from ten generations of mass selection. Observations and pedigree records were randomly deleted. <b>Phantom</b> parent <b>groups</b> were defined {{on the basis of}} gender and generation number. In one scenario, uncertainty about generation of birth was simulated for some animals with unknown parents. In the distinct classification, one of the two possible generations of birth was randomly chosen to assign phantom parents to genetic groups for animals with simulated uncertainty, whereas the phantom parents were assigned to both possible genetic groups in the fuzzy classification. Results The empirical prediction error variance (PEV) was somewhat lower for fuzzy-classified genetic groups. The ranking of animals with unknown parents was more correct and less variable across replicates in comparison with distinct genetic groups. In another scenario, each phantom parent was assigned to three groups, one pertaining to its gender, and two pertaining to the first and last generation, with proportion depending on the (true) generation of birth. Due to the lower number of groups, the empirical PEV of breeding values was smaller when genetic groups were fuzzy-classified. Conclusion Fuzzy-classification provides the potential to describe the genetic level of unknown parents in a more parsimonious and structured manner, and thereby increases the precision of predicted breeding values. </p...|$|R
