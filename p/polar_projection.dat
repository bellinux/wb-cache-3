5000|$|The {{azimuthal}} {{equidistant projection}} is an azimuthal map projection. It has the useful properties that all {{points on the}} map are at proportionately correct distances from the center point, and that all points on the map are at the correct azimuth (direction) from the center point. A useful application {{for this type of}} projection is a <b>polar</b> <b>projection</b> which shows all meridians (lines of longitude) as straight, with distances from the pole represented correctly. The flag of the United Nations contains an example of a polar azimuthal equidistant projection.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, and {{particularly}} after the US was attacked at Pearl Harbor in 1941, government concern turned to {{protection of the}} locks and shipping channel at Sault Ste. Marie. A substantial military presence was established to protect the locks from a possible attack by Nazi German aircraft from the north.

Military strategists studied <b>polar</b> <b>projection</b> maps which indicated that the air distance from occupied Norway to the town {{was about the same}} as the distance from Norway to New York.

The atlas includes 30 plates, 26 of which are constellation maps with a sinusoidal projection. Some of the plates are hand-colored. The atlas includes a then-new, now-obsolete constellation Noctua, Norma Nilotica, and Solarium. Two celestial hemispheres of the atlas are centered on the equatorial poles via <b>polar</b> <b>projection</b> and geocentric alignment. The atlas comprises stars visible only to the naked eye, making it less cluttered.|$|E
40|$|To improve electrocardiographic {{localization}} of {{the site}} of origin of ectopic left ventricular (LV) impulse formation in the heart with prior myocardial infarction, 62 -lead body surface QRS integral maps were studied during LV pacing at a total of 221 endocardial sites in 14 patients with previous anterior (AMI), inferior (IMI), lateral (LMI), or anterior and inferior (AMI/IMI) myocardial infarction. The anatomic location of each pacing site was computed using digitized biplane fluoroscopic images and plotted on standardized LV endocardial <b>polar</b> <b>projections.</b> A data base of characteristic AMI and IMI mean QRS integral maps was developed after visually selecting subgroups with nearly identical QRS integral morphology from the ectopic activation sequences produced at 110 sites in eight patients with AMI and at 66 sites in four patients with IMI. Intrasubgroup pattern uniformity and intersubgroup pattern variability were statistically verified. The endocardial pacing site locations belonging to each AMI and IMI subgroup were depicted as segments on the respective LV <b>polar</b> <b>projections.</b> In patients with AMI, a total of 18 typical mean QRS integral patterns were obtained, whereas 22 different mean total QRS integral patterns showing more substantial intersubgroup variation were acquired in patients with IMI. Postero-lateral regions exhibited a relatively low electrocardiographic sensitivity (six AMI and five IMI patterns) as compared with anteroseptal regions (12 AMI and 17 IMI patterns).

50|$|During the European Age of Discovery, {{expeditions to}} the {{southern}} hemisphere began to result in the addition of new constellations. These most likely came from the records of two Dutch sailors, Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who in 1595 traveled together to the Dutch East Indies. Their compilations resulted in the 1601 globe of Jodocus Hondius, who added 12 new southern constellations. Several other such maps were produced, including Johann Bayer's Uranometria in 1603. The latter was the first atlas to chart both celestial hemispheres and it introduced the Bayer designations for identifying the brightest stars using the Greek alphabet. The Uranometria contained 48 maps of Ptolemaic constellations, a plate of the southern constellations and two plates showing the entire northern and southern hemispheres in stereographic <b>polar</b> <b>projection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Directly {{above the}} 24 hour dial is the dial of the Primum Mobile, so called because it reproduces the diurnal {{motion of the}} stars and the annual motion of the sun against the {{background}} of stars. It is basically an astrolabe drawn using a south <b>polar</b> <b>projection,</b> with a fixed tablet and a rete of special design that rotated once in a sidereal day. The rete was provided with 365 teeth, but was driven by a wheel with 61 teeth which made 6 turns in 24 hours. Thus the rete rotated once in 365/366 of a mean solar day, which equated 366 successive meridian transits of the vernal equinox with 365 similar transits of the sun. Dondi realised that his approximations didn't correspond with the exact length of the solar year, and recommended stopping the clock occasionally so that it could be adjusted.|$|E
