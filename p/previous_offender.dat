40|$|Abstract—Risk {{assessment}} of movements entering the UK using Kohonen SOMs and decision trees {{was found to}} be 292 % more accurate at discerning smuggling than incumbent systems. Inbound freight is currently assessed using a series of risk flags based upon data provided by ferry companies to Government border agencies and a <b>previous</b> <b>offender</b> watchlist. This data constituted the input for the analysis, but presented complex challenges; including proportionally few seizures to train predictive models and a relatively un-diverse “selected for search” population. These factors prompted use of an unsupervised clustering technique to uncover abnormalities in the data and quantify changes in behavior. A supervised technique (a binary decision tree) was also used to enhance existing profiles. Initial tests indicated movements resulting in seizures had a Euclidean distance from their average centroid 10 times greater than the non-seizure mean and only 5 % of vehicles ever moved significantly from their average centroid. Subsequent blind tests “selected ” the riskiest 20 % of movements- from which 39 % of all seizures and 57 % of high value seizures occurring over the same period were identified. Based upon this research, further work has been commissioned to design a system which uses these methods for targeting other movement types.

How to shop online by using the internet through computers and mobile devices is increasingly popular smartphone can even be said to have become a trend today. Various convenience of shopping be the main thing to offer, with enough gadgets available in the home, anyone can already shop. This study wants to describe the interpretation of the meaning of Online Shopping as lifestyle and observe several aspects into consideration. Using the media theory of Neil Postman (1992) inStraubhaar et. all (2012 : 50) that emphasizes the social system in promoting the culture of technology and dominating also Jacques Ellul (1990) which argues that technological developments lead to social dominance and reinforced with the theory of consumer behavior. Using Interpretive paradigm and descriptive qualitative study,this research found: (1) the perpetrators of online shopping informants know enough about understanding online shop, their education above the high school and already has information about online shopping (2) Online shopping for them is not as lifestyle needs in shopping (3) Sources of information based on the experience of friends and environment (4) the age and tastes play a role in making purchasing decisions (5) Encouraged perform online activities from <b>previous</b> <b>offender</b> (6) the learning process when starting an online shopping activity in addition to the experience of friends, komentardarida wall (7) online shopping is the fulfillment of which provide convenience, practicality, convenience already enjoyed today. The study recommends that Internet presence is intended to have all the information needed in people's lives can be accessed quickly, easily and inexpensively.

50|$|One of King's more {{controversial}} initiatives {{was a law}} requiring all school employees - including volunteers and contractors working in schools - to be fingerprinted by the Maine State Police, and to have background checks conducted on them. The program purported {{to protect children from}} abuse by potential predators working within the schools but met with strong resistance from teachers' unions, which considered it a breach of civil liberties. The law's supporters claimed the fingerprinting requirement would stop <b>previous</b> <b>offenders</b> from coming to Maine to work in the schools and that if Maine did not have this requirement it would send a message to <b>previous</b> <b>offenders</b> that they could work in Maine without fear of being identified as child abusers. The law's critics maintained that {{there was no evidence of}} a problem with child abuse by school employees and the fingerprinting represented a violation of constitutional guarantees (a claim not supported by Supreme Court rulings on the issue). Fifty-seven teachers from across the state resigned in protest of the bill. The Maine Legislature voted to exempt current school employees, but King vetoed that in April 1997. The cost of the requirement was initially to be paid for by the school employees themselves but the Legislature voted to have the state fund it.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Although {{studies of}} General Strain Theory (GST) {{typically}} include measures of physical health in multi-item indices of strain, no work has investigated the independent influence of physical health on criminal offending. The current research explores {{the relationship between}} physical health and criminal offending among low-income women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Methods Using data from the Welfare, Children, and Families (WCF) project, criminal behavior is predicted over two years with measures of physical health, depression, anxiety, competing strain, and relevant background factors. Results Poorer physical health at baseline and declines in physical health increase the odds of offending onset among previous non-offenders and reduce the odds of decreased offending among <b>previous</b> <b>offenders.</b> In offending onset models, higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline and increases in these symptoms partially mediate the effect of poorer baseline health and fully mediate {{the effect of the}} loss of physical health. In decreased offending models, increases in anxiety and depression fully mediate the effect of poorer baseline health and partially mediate the effect of the loss of physical health. Conclusions The data suggest that poor health and declines in physical health influence both offending onset and offending escalation directly and indirectly through increases in anxiety and depression. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} the {{international}} community to act on the legal and moral imperative to stop, punish, and prevent genocide and other mass killings has led to the establishment of genocidal regimes that institutionalize genocide as a tactic of repression and power consolidation. One such repeat offender regime was the New Order government of Indonesia, which committed mass killings of known and alleged communists throughout Indonesia in 1965 – 1966 and later carried out a genocidal, colonial occupation of East Timor. I demonstrate parallels between the actors, tactics, and discourse of the communist killings and the Timorese Genocide. The failures of domestic resistance and interna- tional pressure to punish the New Order after 1966 allowed génocidaires to retain power and rein- forced their belief in the acceptability and effectiveness of genocidal tactics.

While prior convictions are taken into account by all U.

40|$|This PhD study {{examines}} how {{people who are}} intellectually impaired are processed within the criminal justice system. In this context it analyses the understanding of intellectual disabilities, criminal justice decision-making processes, and the constructon of crime and punishment by professionals involved in criminal justice. Despite significant changes in mental health legislation and greater awareness by professionals of issues around intellectually disabled <b>offenders,</b> <b>previous</b> {{research has demonstrated that}} this population remains disadvantaged when coming into contact with the criminal justice system. The study focuses on how the criminal justice system maintains its traditional way of operating when engaging with people who are impaired in their intellectual capacities and who, therefore, often have difficulties in processing information and understanding complex situations. The study draws on qualitative data generated through thirty five unstructured interviews with custody sergeants, forensic examiners, prosecutors, magistrates, judges and probation officers from three regions in the North West of England: Cheshire, Merseyside and Greater Manchester. Through those interviews, the provision of support to alleged offenders is examined and the process of legal representation evaluated. By analysing decision-making processes around vulnerable defendants, two conflicting views that influence cimrinal justice professionals in their strategic behaviour were identified: protecting offenders' rights and protecting the public from criminal behaviour. It is argued that the criminal justice system draws its normative and enforcement powers from a 'discourse of truth' that concentrates on capacity and intent. Defendants who are classified as vulnerable because of impaired intellectual functioning whereby capacity to reason and intellectual disability are functionally separated. This way, an alleged offender's vulnerability becomes a manageable object within the criminal justice system and is integrated into a person's risk management. The disjointed discourse around intellectual disabilities increases the risk that people with an impaired level of intellectual functioning become drawn into the mainstream criminal justice system and, therefore, further compromises the empowerment and social inclusion of this population...|$|R
40|$|Swedish {{national}} statistics {{suggest that the}} number of reported stranger rapes is steadily increasing. Stranger rape {{is one of the most}} difficult types of crime for the police to investigate because there is no natural tie between the victim and offender. As a result, there is a need for more knowledge about how crime scene features could be used to make inferences of likely offender characteristics that could help investigators narrow down the pool of suspects. The aim in Study I was to examine how offender behaviors interact with contextual features, victim behaviors, and the assault outcome. Results suggest that the stranger rapes could be distinguished by five different dynamic rape pattern themes, which mainly differed on two dimensions: level of violence to control the victim, and level of impulsivity/premeditation characterizing the rapes. The results also highlight the importance of including contextual features when studying offender behaviors. The aim in Study II was to examine how single-victim rapists and serial rapists can be differentiated by the actions at their first stranger rape. Results suggest that three behaviors in conjunction: kissed victim, controlled victim, and offender drank alcohol before the offense, could be used to predict whether the offender was a single-victim rapist or serial rapist with a classification accuracy of 80. 4 %. The aim in Study III was to examine how stranger rapists could be differentiated from a normative sample on background characteristics, and if stranger rapists’ pre-assault and initial-attack behaviors could be used to predict likely offender characteristics. Results showed that the strongest predictions could be made for <b>previous</b> criminal convictions, <b>offender</b> age, and the distance traveled by the offender to offend.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} child molestation have largely used a sample of either incarcerated or convicted sex <b>offenders.</b> <b>Previous</b> studies have also failed to provide {{substantial}} analyses regarding how physical contacts between child victims and adult perpetrators were initiated and terminated at the crime scene; few {{studies have focused on}} “what exactly happened” while physical touching was taking place through an analysis of behavioral sequences of both child victims and adult <b>offenders.</b> Although <b>previous</b> literature on interpersonal child abuse used child victims of sexual abuse as their data source, those studies focused on effective victim treatment plans to deal with victims’ post-trauma as a result of sexual abuse. Also, detailed instructions on when and how to resist unwanted sexual advances have not been delivered to children, especially who participate in youth-oriented institutions as extra curricular activities. Few have examined the dynamics {{of child molestation}} in terms of physical and verbal interactions between the two parties that were related by child victims. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to fill this void by analyzing previously kept confidential files within the Boy Scouts of America (1960 through 1990). This dissertation examined victim narratives to identify how scoutmaster perpetrators carried out their sexual advances against young boys under their supervision, and how boy victims responded to unwanted sexual advances made by persons of authority within the BSA. Detailed descriptions of physical contact stage in the course of same-sex child molestation were experienced, recalled, and related by boy victims themselves. The analytical framework of the Routine Activity Theories was implemented to the qualitative analysis of victim narratives. In same-sex child molestation, scoutmasters and boy members were found to play three roles—motivated offender, suitable target, and capable guardians, to initiate and terminate physical contacts. Victim narratives exhibited behavioral sequences between boy victims and scoutmaster perpetrators while physical touching was ongoing. Scoutmaster perpetrators’ initiation patterns were captured and analyzed by using a fishing metaphor—angling, spearfishing, and handpicking methods. Significant resisting actions of boy victims at each initiation case were also examined and analyzed for practical and effective preventions of child molestation within youth-centric institutions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 This {{relationships}} among dispositional variables, situational variables and rape supportiveness was examined {{in a sample}} of incarcerated sex <b>offenders.</b> <b>Previous</b> surveys have shown that dispositional variables are determinants of sexual aggression. Research has also shown that situational variables, such as alcohol and anger, are recurrent proximal determinants of sexual aggression. This study pursued four main goals. First, we attempted to replicate Malamuth's Confluence Model of Sexual Aggression, hypothesizing Hostile Masculinity and Impersonal Sex would interactively predict higher rape supportiveness. Second, we examined whether generalized empathy would moderate the Confluence Model. Third, using audiotaped rape vignettes to vary the situational circumstances, we evaluated the effects of the actor's alcohol intoxication and anger. Lastly, based on the conventional wisdom that psychotherapeutic treatment reduces tendencies toward sexual aggression, the influence of exposure to treatment on rape supportiveness was examined. Rape supportiveness, the dependent measure, consisted of four subscales: self-reported likelihood to rape, sexual arousal to the vignette, perpetrator exoneration, and victim blame. Participants included 71 rapists and child sex offenders recruited from the sex offender treatment program at Twin Rivers Correction Center. Participants completed dispositional instruments, listened to an audiotaped rape vignette and completed the dependent measure. Overall, the data did not support the Confluence Model hypothesis that Hostile Masculinity and Impersonal sex would interactively determine rape supportiveness. However, Hostile Masculinity exerted significant main effects accounting for the variance in scores of 3 for the 4 rape supportiveness subscales. The extension of the Confluence Model was not supported since empathy did not moderate the relationship between the dispositional variables and rape supportiveness. The experimental manipulation of the situational variables did not yield the hypothesized effects; however, exploratory analyses revealed that alcohol interacted with Impersonal Sex to influence likelihood to rape and sexual arousal. Anger generated a main effect but opposite to prediction. Lastly, a significant inverse relationship was found between exposure to treatment and likelihood to rape with a trend in this direction on the remaining rape supportiveness subscales. In conclusion, the findings indicate that dispositional and situational variables influence rape supportiveness but not according to the Confluence Model hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} upon two ethnographic fieldwork projects that were conducted {{on the streets of}} Oslo, Norway. The most important data are qualitative interviews with city dwellers and street drug dealers. The first fieldwork was conducted at an ‘open drug scene’ setting and the second in a more dispersed street drug market. The most important research participants were young ethnic minority men. Themes discussed include recruitment to drug use and drug dealing, violence, processes of marginalization, and narrative presentations of self in street culture. One important argument is that marginalized people are in a continual ‘search for respect’, through both symbolic capital accumulation and creative linguistic practice. Conceptualizing a street subculture has been important in studies of youth, delinquency, deviance and crime. The present dissertation contributes two new concepts to this tradition. The first is street capital, which is understood as knowledge, competence, skills, and objects given value in a street culture. This concept is used to capture the accumulation of symbolic capital in a violent street culture. It can be used when studying practical rationality, embodied dispositions or habitus, and the complex relationships between socio-economic constraints and human agency in street culture. The second concept introduced is gangster discourse. This concept is understood as a collection of personal narratives primarily describing the toughness, smartness and sexual attractiveness of its speakers. This concept is used to capture subcultural linguistic practice emerging from a violent and masculine street culture. The two concepts are related, and the dissertation proposes a synthesis in which gangster discourse is the ‘linguistic capital’ and most important ‘linguistic practice’ of a violent street subculture where street capital is the dominant symbolic capital. Gangster discourse is both constitutive of and constituted by street culture. Street culture is not young male offenders’ only cultural influence however, and the dissertation will reveal a multitude of cultural influences by describing their creative, complex and ambivalent language use. Influences include mainstream society and concrete meetings with welfare organizations. This interdiscursivity challenges <b>previous</b> categorizations of <b>offenders</b> into ‘street’ or ‘decent’ and ‘conventionally’ or ‘unconventionally’ attached, and thus also a homogenous understanding subculture...|$|R
40|$|Female offenders’ {{experiences}} {{within the}} criminal justice system {{and the way in which}} they become involved with {{the criminal justice}} system are very different than that of male <b>offenders.</b> <b>Previous</b> research that has been conducted on female offending does show that womens’ contact with {{the criminal justice system}} can often be related to histories of abuse and to mental illness, and that these can also be related to subsequent re-contacts with the criminal justice system. Abuse, mental illness and gender, along with control variables (age, aboriginal identity, LSI-OR score), were investigated in a sample of 522 male and female Ontario Provincial offenders. When males and females were compared at the bivariate level using a chi-square comparison, females were found to be significantly more likely to re-contact. Abuse and mental illness were not found on their own to be significantly related to re-contact, but when the relationship between the three variables was examined, mental illness was found to be both significant and positively correlated to both gender and abuse. Examination into the relationship between the variables found a strong relationship between gender and abuse, gender and mental illness, mental illness and abuse as well as strong relationship in the three way interaction between gender, mental illness and abuse. The cross tabulation demonstrated that women who had experienced abuse were identified as being much more likely to be suffering from a mental illness. Logistic regression was used to model the relationship between re-contact, gender, abuse and the risk for re-contact. All possible interactions (as noted above) were included in the model, but the model that best fit the data included only the controls (age, aboriginal identity, LSI-OR score), gender, abuse, mental illness and the interaction between mental illness and gender. Results indicated that there was a significantly higherrisk for re-contact for females with mental illness, compared with men with mental illness or or to men and women without mental illness [...] Even though abuse as a single variable or as part of an interaction was not found to be significantly related to re-contact, it is still of importance to note that the chi-square comparisons demonstrated that abuse is significantly related to gender and mental illness, therefore the relationship was still important when looking at the implications of the research. It is recommended that future research further investigate the different needs of male and female offenders and the role that experienced physical, sexual and emotional abuse, mental illness and gender plays in not only offending behaviour, but in the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders within the provincial correctional system...|$|R
