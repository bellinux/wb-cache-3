The measurements were made using sources on satellites with 42 -day orbits. The angle of arrival of the ray path to a satellite changed slowly allowing observations of fluctuations caused by atmospheric irregularities as they slowly drifted across the ray path. The fluctuations were characterized by the rms variations of elevation angle and the logarithm of received <b>power</b> (<b>log</b> <b>power).</b> Over a one-year period, 458 hours of observation were amassed spanning every season, time of day, and weather conditions. The results show strong scintillation occurrences below 1 to 2 ° elevation angles characterized {{by a number of}} random occurrences of multipath events that produce deep fades, angle-of-arrival fluctuations, and depolarization of the received signal. The <b>log</b> <b>power</b> fluctuations ranged from 1 to 10 dB rms at elevation angles below 2 ° to less than 0. 1 dB at elevation angles above 10 °. The elevation angle fluctuations ranged from 1 to 100 mdeg at elevation angles below 2 ° to less than 5 mdeg at a 10 ° elevation angle.

30|$|This study {{presents}} a DNN-based VAD method {{for improving the}} performance of VAD by introducing dynamics, which may be highlighted by speech period candidates. These candidates are derived from heuristic rules based on {{the first and second}} derivatives of the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectrum of the RSF output (LPS-RSF). The speech period candidates are calculated for individual subbands and are then input into a DNN together with the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectra to generate the VAD decision. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform experiments using clean and noisy speech signals smeared with five types of noise, namely, white, babble, factory, car, and pink, with SNRs of 10, 5, 0 and −[*] 5 dB. The proposed method effectively detects speech and non-speech periods. The experimental results show that the VAD performance based on <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectra are improved after combining the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectra with the speech period candidates, particularly for noisy speech signals with low SNRs and non-stationary cases. The addition of dynamics expressed by the speech period candidates provides positive information that contributes to the detection of speech periods.|$|R
40|$|At translinear scales, the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> {{spectrum}} captures {{significantly more}} cosmological information {{than the standard}} power spectrum. At high wavenumbers $k$, the Fisher information in the standard power spectrum $P(k) $ fails to increase in proportion to $k$ {{in part due to}} correlations between large- and small-scale modes. As a result, $P(k) $ suffers from an information plateau on these translinear scales, so that analysis with the standard power spectrum cannot access the information contained in these small-scale modes. The <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectrum $P_A(k) $, on the other hand, captures the majority of this otherwise lost information. Until now there has been no means of predicting the amplitude of the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectrum apart from cataloging the results of simulations. We here present a cosmology-independent prescription for the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectrum; this prescription displays accuracy comparable to that of Smith et al. (2003), over a range of redshifts and smoothing scales, and for wavenumbers up to $ 1. 5 h$ Mpc$^{- 1 }$. Comment: Updated to published version; 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, first, major speech {{characteristics}} are highlighted using a running spectral filter (RSF) [27]. Next, masks are composed using {{the first and}} second derivatives of the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectra of the RSF output through heuristic rules. These masks, which consist of binary values, are then multiplied by spectra, expressed in decimal form, to obtain speech period candidates. Since not all subband signals may contribute to the VAD decision, we consider obtaining the speech period candidates for individual subbands. These speech period candidates, together with the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectra, are input into a DNN to obtain the VAD output. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to a DNN-based VAD method that utilizes the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectra alone.|$|R

The only information available to the investor is the one generated by the asset prices and, in particular, the return processes cannot be observed directly. This leads to an optimal control problem under partial information and for the cases of <b>power,</b> <b>log,</b> and exponential utility we manage to provide a surprisingly explicit representation of the optimal terminal wealth {{as well as of}} the optimal portfolio strategy. This is done without any assumptions about the dynamical structure of the return processes. We also show how various explicit results in the existing literature are derived as special cases of the general theory. ...|$|R

At fixed virtuality Q^ 2, as we showed previously, our expression is an expansion in <b>powers</b> of <b>log</b> (1 /x) that satisfies the Froissart bound. Here we show that for each x, the Q^ 2 dependence of the data is well described by an expansion in <b>powers</b> of <b>log</b> Q^ 2. The resulting analytic expression allows us to predict the logarithmic derivatives (∂^n F_ 2 ^p/(∂ Q^ 2) ^n) _x for n = 1, 2 and to compare the results successfully with other data. We extrapolate the proton structure function F_ 2 ^p(x,Q^ 2) to the very large Q^ 2 and the very small x regions that are inaccessible to present day experiments and contrast our expectations with those of conventional global fits of parton distribution functions.

40|$|The {{fluctuations}} of {{the cardiac}} interbeat series {{contain rich information}} because they reflect variations of other functions on different time scales (e. g., respiration or blood pressure control). Nonlinear measures such as complexity and fractal scaling properties derived from 24 h heart rate dynamics of healthy subjects vary from childhood to old age. In this study, the age-related variations during childhood and adolescence were addressed. In particular, the cardiac interbeat interval series was quantified with respect to complexity and fractal scaling properties. The R-R interval series of 409 healthy children and adolescents (age range: 1 to 22 years, 220 females) was analyzed with respect to complexity (Approximate Entropy, ApEn) and fractal scaling properties on three time scales: long-term (slope β of the <b>power</b> spectrum, <b>log</b> <b>power</b> vs. <b>log</b> frequency, in the frequency range 10 − 4 to 10 − 2 Hz) intermediate-term (DFA, detrended fluctuation analysis, α 2) and short-term (DFA α 1). Unexpectedly, during age 7 to 13 years β and ApEn were higher compared to the age 13 years (β: − 1. 06 vs. − 1. 21; ApEn: 0. 88 vs. 0. 74). Hence, the heart rate dynamics were closer to a 1 /f power law and most complex between 7 and 13 years. However, DFA α 1 and α 2 increased with progressing age similar to measures reflecting linear properties. In conclusion, the course of long-term fractal scaling properties and complexity of heart rate dynamics during childhood and adolescence indicates that these measures reflect complex changes possibly linked to hormonal changes during pre-puberty and puberty...|$|R

30|$|Voice {{activity}} detection (VAD) is {{an important}} preprocessing step for various speech applications to identify speech and non-speech periods in input signals. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based VAD method for detecting such periods in noisy signals using speech dynamics, which are time-varying speech signals that may be expressed as the first- and second-order derivatives of mel cepstra, {{also known as the}} delta and delta-delta features. Unlike these derivatives, in this paper, the dynamics are highlighted by speech period candidates, which are calculated based on heuristic rules for the patterns of the first and second derivatives of the input signals. These candidates, together with the <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectra, are input into the DNN to obtain VAD decisions. In this study, experiments are conducted to compare the proposed method with a DNN-based method, which exclusively utilizes <b>log</b> <b>power</b> spectra by using speech signals smeared with five types of noise (white, babble, factory, car, and pink) with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 10, 5, 0, and −[*] 5 dB.
