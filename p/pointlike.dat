5000|$|The {{aspect of}} the Parson magneton with the most {{experimental}} relevance (and the aspect investigated by Grondahl and Webster) was {{the existence of an}} electron magnetic dipole moment; this dipole moment is indeed present. However, later work by Paul Dirac and Alfred Landé showed that a <b>pointlike</b> particle could have an intrinsic quantum spin, and also a magnetic moment. The highly successful modern theory, Standard Model of particle physics describes a <b>pointlike</b> electron with an intrinsic spin and magnetic moment. On the other hand, the usual assertion that an electron is <b>pointlike</b> may be conventionally associated only with a [...] "bare" [...] electron. The <b>pointlike</b> electron would have a diverging electromagnetic field, which should create a strong vacuum polarization. In accordance with QED, deviations from the Coulomb law are predicted at Compton scale distances from the centre of electron, 10−11 cm. Virtual processes in the Compton region determine the spin of electron and renormalization of its charge and mass. It shows that the Compton region of the electron should be considered as a coherent whole with its <b>pointlike</b> core, forming a physical ("dressed") electron. Notice that the Dirac theory of electron also exhibits the peculiar behaviour of the Compton region. In particular, electrons display zitterbewegung at the Compton scale. From this point of view, the ring model does not contradict QED or the Dirac theory and some versions could possibly be used to incorporate gravity in quantum theory.|$|E

50|$|The {{theory was}} a radical {{rethinking}} {{of the foundation}} of physical law. By the 1940s {{it was clear that}} the proton and the neutron were not <b>pointlike</b> particles like the electron. Their magnetic moment differed greatly from that of a <b>pointlike</b> spin-½ charged particle, too much to attribute the difference to a small perturbation. Their interactions were so strong that they scattered like a small sphere, not like a point. Heisenberg proposed that the strongly interacting particles were in fact extended objects, and because there are difficulties of principle with extended relativistic particles, he proposed that the notion of a space-time point broke down at nuclear scales.|$|E

50|$|A point {{particle}} (ideal particle or point-like particle, often spelled <b>pointlike</b> particle) is an idealization {{of particles}} heavily used in physics. Its defining feature {{is that it}} lacks spatial extension: being zero-dimensional, {{it does not take}} up space. A point particle is an appropriate representation of any object whose size, shape, and structure is irrelevant in a given context. For example, from far enough away, an object of any shape will look and behave as a point-like object.|$|E

50|$|In 1911, Ernest Rutherford concluded, {{based on}} alpha {{particle}} scattering, that an atom has a central <b>pointlike</b> proton.

As a result, he believed that electrons revolved around the proton. Niels Bohr, in 1913, combined the Rutherford model of the atom with the quantisation ideas of Planck. Only specific and well-defined orbits of the electron could exist, which also do not radiate light. In jumping orbit the electron would emit or absorb light corresponding to the difference in energy of the orbits. His prediction of the energy levels was then consistent with observation.|$|E

The immense success of the Fermi theory was because the W particle has mass of about 80 GeV, whereas the early experiments were all done at an energy scale of less than 10 MeV. Such a separation of scales, by over 3 orders of magnitude, has not been met in any other situation as yet.|$|E
