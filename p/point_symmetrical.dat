For instance, a graph is considered <b>point</b> <b>symmetrical</b> {{in relation to the}} origin O when each point P of a graph as shown in Figure 1, has a corresponding point Q (also on the graph) under a reflection through O so that PO = OQ. Or equivalently in the plane, each point P of the graph can be mapped onto a corresponding point Q (also on the graph) by means of a half-turn (a rotation through 180 degrees) around O. 1 Using the transformation formula for a half turn, it therefore follows that a graph is point symmetric in relation to the origin if y = f(x) ⇔ y =-f(-x); in other words if it remains invariant under a half-turn around the origin. ...|$|E

The 16 numbers of beams were tested. 4 numbers of beams were tested to failure under two <b>point</b> <b>symmetrical</b> loading and 12 numbers of beams were tested to failure under central point loading. A complete shear deformational behavior along with load-deflection response, crack patterns {{and modes of}} failure is studied experimentally. Shear strength is evaluated using empirical equations proposed here in this work for estimation of ultimate shear strength of moderate deep beams without stirrups. Experimental results of ultimate shear strength are compared with theoretical results calculated from proposed equation proposed. The comparison shows that the equation proposed here provides the most accurate estimates of shear strength. In addition to concrete strength, the influence of other variation such as fiber factor, span to depth ratio, longitudinal steel ratio and size effect is considered in the proposed equation...|$|E

40|$|People {{experience}} an object’s motion {{even when it}} is occluded. We investigate the processing of invisible motion in three experiments. Observers saw a moving circle passing behind an invisible, irregular hendecagonal polygon and had to respond as quickly as possible when the target had just reappeared from behind the occluder. Without explicit cues allowing the end of each of the eight hidden trajectories to be predicted (length ranging between 4. 7 and 5 deg), we found as expected, if visuospatial attention was involved, anticipation errors, providing that information on pre-occluder motion was available. This indicates that the observers, rather than simply responding when they saw the target, tended to anticipate its reappearance (Experiment 1). The new finding is that, with a fixation mark indicating the centre of the invisible trajectory, a linear relationship between the physical and judged occlusion duration is found, but not without it (Experiment 2) or with a fixation mark varying in position from trial to trial (Experiment 3). We interpret the role of central fixation in the differences in distinguishing trajectories smaller than 0. 3 deg, by suggesting that it reflects spatiotemporal computation and motion-tracking. These two mechanisms allow visual imagery to form of the <b>point</b> <b>symmetrical</b> to that of the disappearance, with respect to fixation, and then for the occluded moving target to be tracked up to this point...|$|E
40|$|The {{bactericidal}} pharmacodynamics {{of antibiotics}} against Escherichia coli {{were analyzed by}} a concentration-killing curve (CKC) approach, and the novel parameters median bactericidal concentration (BC 50) and bactericidal intensity (r) for bactericidal potency were proposed. By using the agar plate method, about 500 E. coli cells were inoculated onto Luria-Bertani plates containing a series of antibiotic concentrations, and after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, all the viable colonies were enumerated. This resulted in a sigmoidal CKC that could be perfectly fitted (R 2 > 0. 9) with the function N = N 0 /[1 + er(x − BC 50) ], where N is number of colonies surviving on each plate with an x series of concentrations of an antibiotic, and N 0 represents the meaningful inoculum size. Construction of the CKC method {{was based on the}} bactericidal effect of each antibiotic against the bacterial strain versus the concentration in two dimensions and may be a more valid, accurate, and reproducible method for estimating the bactericidal effect than the endpoint minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) method. Mathematically, the CKC approach was <b>point</b> <b>symmetrical</b> toward its inflexion (BC 50, N 0 / 2); thus, 2 BC 50 could replace MBC. The parameter BC 1 can be defined as BC 50 + [ln(N 0 − 1) /r], which is the drug concentration at which only one colony survived and which is the least critical value of MBC in the CKC. The variate r, which determined the tangent slope on inflexion when N 0 was limited, could estimate the bactericidal intensity of an antibiotic. This verified that the CKC approach may be useful in studies with other classes of antibiotics and has considerable value as a tool for the accurate and proper administration of antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} of bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate and bismuth(III) chloride with heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones and derivatives of dithiocarbazonic acid methylester {{were used to}} synthesize the respective bismuth(III) complexes, which could be divided into five groups D-H because of their stoichiometrical properties and their molecular structures. The molecular structure and the near coordination sphere of the bismuth(III) central atom of four representative compounds were determined by single-crystal X-ray studies. Bis[1 -azepanyl- 4 -(2 -pyridyl) - 2, 3 -diazapenta- 1, 3 -diene- 1 -thiolato-N′,N 3,S]bismuth(III) nitrate (5) belongs to group D. The two tridentate ligands and the nitrate ion surround the bismuth atom. The best description of the coordination sphere appears {{to be that of}} a distorted trigonal dodecahedron with one position occupied by the lone pair of the bismuth atom. Bis[1 -azepanyl- 4 -(2 -thienyl) - 2, 3 -diazapenta- 1, 3 -diene- 1 -thiolato-N 3,S]bismuth(III) nitrate (9) is assigned to complex type E. Here, two deprotonated ligand molecules are coordinated to the bismuth(III) central atom as bidentate ligands. The structure of this complex can best be described as a distorted trigonal antiprism with a five-coordinated central atom. The two triangular faces are formed by the atoms S(4), N(6), O(11) and S(3), N(4) and the lone pair of the central atom. The two chelate rings are almost perpendicular to each other. Complex molecules of group F form dimeric units with bichloro-bridged bismuth atoms. The structure of di-μ-chlorobis[1 -azepanyl- 4 -(2 -pyridyl) - 2, 3 -diazapenta- 1, 3 -diene- 1 -thiolato-N′,N 3,S-chloro]dibismuth(III) (15) can be described as two six-coordinated bismuth atoms, which are bound together via two bridging chlorine atoms. The two bismuth atoms Bi(1) and Bi(1 a) and the two bridging chlorine atoms Cl(2) and Cl(2 a) form the Bi 2 Cl 2 plane. The two tridentate ligand molecules coordinate via the same atoms as shown in complex 5. In addition, they form two parallel planes, which are perpendicular to the Bi 2 Cl 2 plane. With regard {{to the center of the}} Bi(1) -Bi(2) axis they are central <b>point</b> <b>symmetrical,</b> i. e. one pyridine ring lies above and the other beneath the Bi 2 Cl 2 plane. Bismuth(III) chloride and pyridine- 2 -carboxaldehydethiosemicarbazone 1 b or 2 -acetylpyridine-thiosemicarbazone 1 c form complexes of group G. Three chlorine atoms and a bidentate ligand are coordinated to the bismuth(III) central atom. The bidentate ligand bound to the central atom through the N(3) atom and the sulfur atom of the thioketo group. The structure of 18 is completely different from the structures of the bismuth(III) complexes discussed so far and was therefore assigned to group H. The bismuth central atom is coordinated with two ligands, which are bound in different ways. One of them is deprotonated. This ligand is bound to the central atom via the sulfur atom S(3) of the thiolate group and the N(5) atom. An interaction between the sulfur atom of the thiophene ring and the bismuth atom is not possible. The other ligand molecule is not deprotonated. This ligand is bound to the bismuth(III) cation merely via the sulfur atom S(1) of the thioketo group. The best description of the coordination sphere of the bismuth atom is that of a distorted square bipyramidal polyhedron. The square face is formed by the atoms S(3), N(5), Cl(1), the lone pair and the bismuth atom within. The axial positions are occupied by the atoms S(1) and Cl(2). The bond angle between S(1), Bi(1) and Cl(2) differs by about eight degrees from the value determined for a regular square bipyramidal polyhedron of 180 degrees...|$|E
