5|$|The {{third section}} to open was from Bloor Street to the Gardiner Expressway. This section {{involved}} {{the removal of}} CPR rail sidings on the eastern bank of the Don from Eastern Avenue north. Royal Drive, which was a two-way road that connected with Bloor Street between Broadview Avenue and the Viaduct was re-purposed into a one-way north-bound on-ramp. A <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpass</b> bridge was constructed to connect {{the east and west}} sections of Riverdale Park.

50|$|<b>Pedestrian</b> <b>overpasses</b> {{connect the}} station to both sides of 36 Street NE. Stairs, escalators, {{as well as an}} {{elevator}} provide access down to the center-loading platform. As of 2011, there is now a grade-level access at the South end of the platform as well.|$|R
5|$|Construction on {{the second}} {{platform}}, an island platform connected via a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpass,</b> began in January 2014 with the closure of Mukilteo Lane near the station. Part of the existing North Platform was closed {{for use as a}} staging area in March 2014, expanding and contracting before and after rush hour, respectively. The $11 million project, designed by AECOM and HNTB in 2012, was originally scheduled to be completed in 2015. Delays in construction, including state approval of the new elevators, pushed back the completion date to April 2016. As part of the STart program, a percentage of construction funds went towards installing art made by Whidbey Island resident Linda Beaumont at the station.|$|E
5|$|The Cumberland {{station was}} first {{proposed}} in 1972 {{as part of}} an extension of the Blue Line from Logan Square to O'Hare International Airport. The station opened on February 27, 1983, along with Harlem and Rosemont. The three new stations brought 6,000 new riders to the northwest CTA line in the following month, and Cumberland became especially attractive to suburban commuters. The station at Cumberland consists of a single island platform; a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpass</b> connects the platform to a station building to the south and an exit stairway to the north. The station also includes a bus terminal and a park and ride lot. Trains serve Cumberland 24 hours a day every day; the headway between trains is 10 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. In addition to trains, Cumberland also serves CTA buses, Pace buses, Burlington Trailways buses, and Greyhound buses.|$|E

25|$|The station {{building}} was torn down in 1969, leaving just the stone foundation, which was later filled with gravel. The <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpass</b> was moved in 1971 to Route 128 station, where it remained until {{the station was}} rebuilt in 2000. The station, by then just bare platforms, was served by a state-subsidized Providence-to-Westerly commuter train starting in 1972, and later by Amtrak's Beacon Hill from 1978 to 1981. After the Beacon Hill was discontinued, the station closed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. King Fahad Road, {{a limited}} access {{cross-town}} expressway running {{north and south}} within the city of Riyadh, {{has a problem with}} numerous pedestrian crossings on the roadway surface. The problem appears to be particularly acute on the portion of roadway north of Khurais Road. This is a section of roadway severely lacking in facilities to provide for pedestrian crossings. This section of the highway had originally been designed as a typical 80 -meter street. <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>overpasses,</b> however, were not adequately provided nor were consideration taken of previous traffic and pedestrian movement patterns. In fact, and because King Fahad Road is designed as an express way, several previously-existing street intersections at grade are now blocked, resulting in inconveniences to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. While the function of the roadway has changed from a major arterial street to a limited access expressway, the needs of pedestrians, in particular, have not changed. Many people in this portion of the highway cross in order to assume commercial activities and in the opposite direction in the afternoon. This results in a significant number of pedestrian crossings taking place continuously. This paper relied on the empirical evidence gathered and the methodology utilized in gathering the data in the study area and at the time described. Data was collected using direct observational techniques in the study area, with the author and three hired junior planners serving as data collectors. The analysis is based on a computer program to simulate the optimum development of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpasses</b> locations based on the field-collected data. It confirms the shortage in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpasses...</b>|$|R

This station originally was a terminal stop as the extension to Brighton Beach was not built until 1917. Outside and to the east of the Voorhies Avenue side entrance, there is a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpass</b> running alongside the Manhattan-bound side of line, but it only crosses the Belt Parkway to the south side.|$|E
25|$|Upgrade works {{began in}} 2004 {{to prepare the}} station for the Epping to Chatswood railway line. Works {{included}} a new concourse and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpass,</b> wider platforms, an underground transfer concourse {{and the addition of}} two underground platforms for the new line. The new aerial concourse was constructed {{to the north of the}} 1967 concourse, which was demolished. The above ground upgrades were completed on 14 April 2007, while the underground concourse and platforms were opened on 23 February 2009 in conjunction with the new line.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the plan}} {{approved}} in 2006, the Husky Stadium station would have three entrances, connected via underground walkways or overpasses: {{on the east}} side of Montlake Boulevard adjacent to Husky Stadium; on the north side of Pacific Place on the Burke-Gilman Trail; and on the west side of Montlake Boulevard near the University of Washington Medical Center. In 2007, the Seattle Design Commission recommended an overpass to cross Montlake Boulevard in lieu of the underground walkway, and Sound Transit updated the station's design plan accordingly with a bridge on the north side of the Rainier Vista triangle. The University of Washington unveiled its plans to redevelop the Rainier Vista triangle into a landscaped park, with a land bridge over Pacific Place, and requested that Sound Transit connect the station through a mid-block crosswalk instead of the bridge. The mid-block crosswalk was rejected by the FTA, and a compromise <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpass</b> connecting to the center of the Rainier Vista triangle was adopted in 2011.|$|E

500|$|The Cumberland {{station was}} {{designed}} by Wojciech M. Madeyski of the architectural firm Perkins and Will. Cumberland's island platform {{is located in the}} median of the Kennedy Expressway to the west of Cumberland Avenue. It serves the Blue Line's two tracks; the northern track serves trains to O'Hare, while the southern track serves trains to Forest Park. Electronic signs on the platform offer real-time information about train arrivals and service alerts; Cumberland is one of four 'L' stations with these signs, which were installed in 2002 as part of a pilot program. A <b>pedestrian</b> <b>overpass</b> connects the platform to entrances on the north and south sides of the expressway. The north side of the overpass leads to an exit stairway, while the south side leads to the main station building. The station building houses a public art sculpture, Rock Bow by Charles Ross; the sculpture consists of a [...] high metal-cased prism set in a limestone base. Cumberland's bus terminal and park and ride lot are also located south of the platform. The park and ride lot has 1633 spaces and is operated by CPS Parking; the lot originally had 706 spaces and expanded to its current capacity in 1992. The facilities at Cumberland are handicapped accessible.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pedestrian</b> <b>overpasses</b> over {{highways}} or railroads are expensive, {{especially when}} elevators or long ramps for wheelchair users are required. Without elevators or ramps, people with mobility handicaps {{will not be}} able to use the structure. Often, people will prefer to walk across a busy road at grade rather than expend the effort to climb up the bridge and go over it. Overpasses should only be used where the number of users justify the costs.|$|R
