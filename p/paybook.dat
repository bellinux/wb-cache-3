He had not made extensive preparations for this, but he had equipped himself with a forged <b>paybook</b> {{under the name of}} Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger.

By World War I, Cerberus weapons and boilers were inoperable; the ship served as a guardship and munitions store, while carrying the personnel of the fledgling Royal Australian Naval College on her <b>paybooks.</b> In 1921, the ship was renamed HMAS Platypus II, and tasked as a submarine tender for the RAN's six J-class submarines.|$|R

When the Royal Australian Naval College was founded in 1913, its personnel were initially listed on the <b>paybooks</b> of Cerberus, as the college was not a commissioned establishment.

The sentry was not satisfied with their gate pass, so Stevens marched his party back into the camp. As the sentry was apparently unaware that the party was not genuine, a second attempt was made a week later.

5000|$|Charteris was {{sometimes}} described as Haig's [...] "evil counsellor." [...] He was not trained in military intelligence, and is sometimes blamed for Haig's errors as {{he may well}} have told Haig {{what he wanted to}} hear. He produced reports of poor German morale based on interviews with prisoners and of German manpower shortages based on statistical analysis of their <b>paybooks,</b> which gave a German soldier's age and year of callup. These reports were crucial in Haig's decisions and were increasingly criticised by Major-General Macdonogh, intelligence advisor at the War Office, and by politicians and, after Cambrai, the press. [...] "During the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele) and at Cambrai, Charteris was certainly guilty of being overly optimistic with regard to the Allies' chances of success at both set-piece battles." [...] Haig kept him on after his inadequacies had been exposed.|$|R

On 21 May, Himmler and two aides were detained at a checkpoint set up by former Soviet POWs and then handed over to the British Army. On 23 May, after admitting his real identity, a doctor attempted to examine him. However, Himmler bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes.|$|E

He found a signal lamp in the cement cottage at Hun's Walk, set up the lamp on top of it, exposed to everything, worked it there by {{daylight}} and dark (by daylight running messages). He went out on patrol after snipers & got through without a scratch.

The CO roused on him with tongue in cheek, 'You don't appear to be doing much' he said. 'Oh well I'm a bit new to this' he said, 'it's only my second stunt'.|$|E
5000|$|Flight Lieutenant Peter STEVENS (88219), Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, No. 144 Squadron.Flight Lieutenant Stevens was {{the captain}} of a Hampden {{aircraft}} detailed to bomb Berlin on 7th September 1941. After the mission had been completed the aircraft was hit by enemy antiaircraft fire {{and had to be}} crash-landed subsequently, on the outskirts of Amsterdam. Flight Lieutenant Stevens set fire to the aircraft, destroyed all documents and then, in company with the navigator, commenced to walk towards Amsterdam. They met a farmer who took them to his house and gave them food, at the same time promising to put them in touch with an organisation. Both walked across country for an hour, and then hid in a hut on a football field. They were later found by German Feldgendarmerie and taken to a Military prison, remaining there for two days. They were then sent to the Dulag Luft at Oberursel. Flight Lieutenant Stevens was moved to Lübeck on 20 September 1941. On 6 October 1941, he was entrained for Warburg, and during the journey he made his escape, accompanied by another officer, by crawling through a ventilator and dropping to the ground while the train was in motion. Shots were fired and the train was stopped but he and his companion managed to reach a wood where they hid until the departure of the train. Shortly afterwards they jumped on a goods train and reached Hannover on 8 October. Here Flight Lieutenant Stevens made contact with some pre-war acquaintances who provided him with food, money and civilian clothes. He, with his companion, then entrained for Frankfurt. Here they were challenged by Railway Police and arrested being subsequently sent to Oflag VI-B. at Warburg. On 1 December 1941, Flight Lieutenant Stevens made a further attempt to escape by disguising himself as a German Unter-Offizier. He led a party of 10 officers disguised as orderlies, and two officers disguised as guards with dummy rifles, and all marched through the gates of the camp. They had to return however as the sentry was not satisfied that the gate pass was correct. Flight Lieutenant Stevens marched his party back to the compound and the sentry was then quite unaware that the party was not genuine. A similar plan of escape was therefore adopted a week later, but on this occasion the sentry was immediately suspicious and demanded of the party their <b>paybooks.</b> The party then had to disperse hurriedly but two of its members were arrested. In September 1942, Flight Lieutenant Stevens was moved to Oflag XXI-B at Schubin. Here he made a fourth attempt to escape and managed to get away by means of a tunnel, carrying forged identity papers, wearing a civilian suit and carrying a converted great-coat. He took a train to Berlin, arriving there on the evening of 5 March 1943. He bought a railway ticket to Cologne and, when on the journey to that town, he was asked for his identity card by a Gestapo official. The latter discovered that it was forged, and Flight Lieutenant Stevens was then arrested and returned to the Oflag XXI-B, receiving as a punishment 14 days in the cells. Flight Lieutenant Stevens made a further attempt on 21 April 1943, but it was unsuccessful and he served a sentence of seven days in the cells. He was ultimately liberated by the Russian forces whilst at Stalag III-A on 21 April 1945.|$|R

Macher and Grothmann were both dressed as army privates. Macher, Himmler and Grothmann were stopped at a checkpoint, which had been set up by former Soviet POWs, on May 21 and detained. The three men were taken to an Allied barracks in Lüneburg on May 23. During a routine interrogation, Himmler admitted who he was; thereafter, at the headquarters of the Second British Army, during an attempted medical examination Himmler bit into a hidden cyanide pill and died. After Himmler's suicide, Macher and Grothmann were arrested.|$|E
