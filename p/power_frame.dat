50|$|Power {{signalling}} {{arrived in}} 1910 in Sydney Yard, with the commissioning of (Sydney) Station Box. This installation was electro-pneumatic and controlled from a miniature lever frame {{supplied by the}} McKenzie, Holland & Westinghouse Power Signal Co. of Worcester, England. Although the lines were not continuously track-circuited and absolute block telegraph remained between signalboxes, there was some control of signals by track circuit and treadle. Upon its replacement by a 432 lever pistol grip <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> in the new Sydney Station West signalbox in the late 1920s, the original miniature lever frame was divided into smaller sections for reuse at other locations. The disused 'Station Box' remained in position for decades after its retirement, but has now been demolished, along with its successor.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{controlled}} by power-operated signalling from a cabin. When the double metre-gauge line from the station up to Tambaram was electrified in 1931 with the 1,500v DC overhead system, automatic signalling was provided between the station and Madras Egmore. However, it does not signal the broad-gauge line of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway from Rayapuram, which also serves the station. The single line to Rayapuram {{was controlled by}} the Theobald's Token instrument, invented by an engineer of the Madras Railway and manufactured locally in the city by a firm named Orr & Co, which was used extensively on the lines of both the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway and the South Indian Railway. It was housed in the station office. The signalling of the station is controlled from Siemens all-electric <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> of 1935.|$|E
50|$|Signalboxes remain {{scattered}} throughout the RailCorp network, with thirty-six still in regular use in 2012, including nine controlled by local station staff, twenty-six by dedicated Signallers and one shared by both. The majority of these were commissioned before 1970, a few {{of which have been}} in continuous use since the late nineteenth century, albeit surviving in a modified state. Eleven are still fitted with Byles-type mechanical lever frames and five have early relay interlocking with Individual Function Switch (IFS) or similar electric switch panels. Newcastle Signalbox, commissioned in 1936 by Mr W.F. Barton, has the last Westinghouse miniature lever <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> in Australia, and one of few remaining in the world. Sixteen signalboxes are fitted with route control relay/solid state interlocking systems and hardwired panels, and three are equipped solely with computerised, VDU-based route control. A few other signalling installations exist outside the RailCorp network, under the control of other rail operators. Junee and Broadmeadow are home to integrated electronic control centres, both of which are run by the Australian Rail Track Corporation, custodian of the busiest lines in the country network of the state.|$|E

To maintain departmental support for the effort, DAT members had frequent meetings with relevant stakeholders in the department on other committees and also stayed in communication with the department chair.

Both research projects, one with 101 participants and the other with 600 participants, looked at youth community belonging, respectively focusing on problems connected to youth unemployment, on related resources (Arcidiacono, Sommantico and Procentese, 2001), and finally on youth planning of future actions in the community (Arcidiacono, Di Napoli and Sarnacchiaro, submitted). A reinterpretation of the categories emerging from these studies was carried out, by first adopting the grounded theory methodology and subsequently the Prillentensky approach (2007) of a greater conceptualisation within the <b>power</b> <b>frame.</b> The classification undertaken suggests that the perception of a lack of youth power is closely linked to their expectations for the local community. A lack of individual and social power, rage and hopelessness is the core evidence among our interviewees. Powerlessness firstly denies empowerment, thus it is as if young people distance themselves from the context. The assumption of this perspective opens new paths through which promoting empowerment processes...|$|E

Two additional frames were identified and composed: power and nationalisation. During the seven-month period {{leading up to the}} signing of the Treaty of Lisbon (December 2007), we analysed 341 articles from four quality papers: Le Monde (France), De Volkskrant (The Netherlands), De Standaard (Dutch speaking community of Belgium), and Le Soir (French speaking community of Belgium). Our results show that although significant differences between newspapers were found in the amount of framing, overall they reflected a similar pattern in the adoption of the news frames. The economic consequences frame, followed by the <b>power</b> <b>frame,</b> appeared most prominently in all of the newspapers' coverage. However, the conflict and nationalisation frames recurred in a significantly lesser degree. These findings indicate that the meaning behind the EU Constitution as a symbol of supranational unity could have led to a shift from a domesticated, conflict oriented coverage as found in previous studies to a more unified portrayal of the EU within and between the quality papers under study...|$|E

The first of the two hypotheses tested and verified in this study is that the geopolitics of the Levant maintains its historical importance for the global hegemon and for the international state system even though the central thrust of the Levant's geopolitics has been tranformed from trade to energy. The second hypothesis is that regional and global peace and stability increase when the geopolitics of the Levant is in the control of a hegemon. Instances of conflict increase and opportunities for cooperation decrease when the Levant's geopolitics slips from the grasp of a single hegemon as a result of shifts in the balance of power. Following a discussion of threats and opportunities for conflict and cooperation in the Levant region, possible strategies for the regional actors are evaluated. Lastly, the threats and opportunities that Turkey faces are situated within emergent trends in the energy geopolitics of the region...|$|E

Simulation results validate the new analytical model for linear IEEE 802. 11 p networks w. r. t reliability and latency performances of Cooperative Awareness Message broadcast. Evidence is given that the model not only is valid for single-lane highways but also provides good approximate results for multi-lane highway scenarios.

40|$|The thesis aims {{to address}} criticisms of cosmopolitanism that characterise {{it as an}} elite discourse, by {{exploring}} the role that it might play in Third World resistance movements. In doing so, it complicates the landscape of international normative theory, which has traditionally been mapped as a debate between cosmopolitanism and communitarianism. Part I of the thesis argues that cosmopolitanism and communitarianism can function as languages in which First and Third World states respectively justify exercises of power that impede the self-determination of Third World societies. These discourses of <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> the condition of postcoloniality, which might be understood – borrowing the terminology of International Society theorists – as an entrapment of Third World societies between 'coercive solidarism' and 'authoritarian pluralism'. A normative worldview committed to enhancing the scope for self-determination of such societies must be critical of the production of both external and internal environments that are hostile to the enjoyment of self-determination by Third World peoples. Part II of the thesis explores the political challenges of sustaining such a critique by studying four theorists of resistance who perceive themselves as manoeuvring between hostile external and internal environments. It analyses the political thought of Rabindranath Tagore and Edward Said, who were both leading figures of anti-colonial nationalist movements but also fierce critics of nationalism. It also studies the activism of two leaders {{in the field of}} 'anti-globalisation' protest – Subcomandante Marcos of the Zapatistas in Mexico and Professor Nanjundaswamy of the Karnataka State Farmers' Association in India – who struggle against both national elites and global capital. Part II concludes that if resistance in the condition of postcoloniality must grapple simultaneously with both a hostile 'outside' and 'inside', it must speak in mixed registers of universalism and particularity. Cumulatively, the thesis demonstrates that the language of common humanity operates in ways that are both oppressive and emancipatory, just as the language of community is a source of both repression and refuge. Normative theory that does not seek to hold both in tension fails the needs of our non-ideal world. Citation: Rahul Rao,'Postcolonial cosmopolitanism: between home and the world', D.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores how three {{social movements}} deployed an anti-neoliberal master frame {{during the course}} of a multi-movement protest wave. Using ethnographic content analysis. I examine the Global Justice (GJM), Antiwar (AWM), and Immigrant Rights movements (IRM) of the 2000 s to offer a theoretical synthesis of the framing perspective in social movements and Gramscian hegemony, which I call the counter-hegemonic framing approach. This approach links the contested discursive practices of social movements to historically specific political-economic contexts to offer a macro framework to make sense of this meso-level activity that illuminates the development of a counter-hegemonic master frame. I apply this approach in case studies of each movement and a culminating incorporated comparison. In the GJM chapter, I found that the GJM frames neoliberal institutions such as the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund as influenced by corporate power. Second, the GJM amplifies the symptoms of neoliberal globalization such as global inequality and environmental degradation. Third, there is a master frame specific to neoliberalism which defines neoliberal globalization as a corporate project that seeks to reduce environmental, human rights, and labor regulations by eroding sovereignty in order to open markets and increase profits. For the AWM, I found that the movement integrated the context of both rollback and rollout neoliberalism into their framing to build opposition to the Afghan and Iraq War. In addition, following the corporate <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> of the GJM, the AWM problematizes the involvement of corporations in foreign policy discussions. For the IRM, I found that one of the central goals of their framing was to deflect blame away from undocumented immigrants. There are two ways the IRM accomplished this. First, the IRM emphasized the economic contributions of immigrants. Second, the IRM emphasized the impact of neoliberal globalization as a cause of increased immigration and social problems for which migrants were blamed. Finally, in an incorporated comparison of these case studies I found a distinct anti-neoliberal “repertoire of interpretation,” which forms the basis of an anti-neoliberal master frame that emphasizes US hegemony, corporate power, economic inequality, and neoliberal rollout...|$|E

O objeto de investigaÃÃo desta pesquisa estÃ organicamente vinculado Ãs atuais configuraÃÃes sociais, econÃmicas, polÃticas e culturais do Brasil ContemporÃneo marcado por transformaÃÃes decorrentes do processo de mundializaÃÃo do capital, que impÃe uma redefiniÃÃo do papel do Estado e das suas relaÃÃes com a sociedade civil, sob a Ãgide da hegemonia neoliberal. Aponta como ponto chave de anÃlise do fenÃmeno investigativo, o contexto histÃrico de efervescÃncia das polÃticas neoliberais, marcado fortemente por uma confluÃncia entre o projeto participatÃrio/democratizante e o projeto de ajuste estrutural. Tem o propÃsito de compartilhar com as comunidades cientÃfica e escolar, algumas reflexÃes e conclusÃes sobre os mecanismos de democratizaÃÃo da escola pÃblica, exercidos pelo Conselho Escolar, em tempos de ajuste neoliberal, bem como identificar os avanÃos, limites e possibilidades dessa caminhada que contou com a efetiva participaÃÃo de representantes dos segmentos envolvidos pais, alunos, professores, funcionÃrios, nÃcleo gestor e comunidade local situada no entorno da escola, proporcionando o desenvolvimento de uma pedagogia de participaÃÃo com prÃticas inovadoras nas relaÃÃes intra-escola e, desta com a comunidade. O procedimento metodolÃgico compreendeu estudos bibliogrÃficos, documentais e pesquisa de campo de natureza qualitativa no sentido do conhecimento da experiÃncia social dos diversos sujeitos inseridos na implementaÃÃo da polÃtica de gestÃo democrÃtica na escola pÃblica via Conselhos Escolares. O resultado da investigaÃÃo empÃrica, realizada em dois Conselhos Escolares de escolas pÃblicas no municÃpio de BaturitÃ, revela que, como oferta do Estado ou conquista da sociedade civil, a gestÃo democrÃtica da escola pÃblica se faz com ambigÃidades e contradiÃÃes, ora questionando polÃticas governamentais, ora legitimando-as. Os Conselhos Escolares, por sua vez, sÃo espaÃos hÃbridos, funcionam com descontinuidades, porÃm, o pequeno alcance das conquistas nÃo apaga as aproximaÃÃes gradativas a um modo de ser democrÃtico sinalizando para ampliaÃÃo da cidadania na escola. This work aims at {{investigating}} {{the politics of}} democratic administration found in public schools of the State of Ceara considering the action of School Councils. The researchâs investigative goal is fundamentally tied to Brazilâs current social, economic, political and cultural patterns, marked by changes produced {{by the process of}} world dominance by capital that requires a redefinition of the Stateâs role and its relationship with civil society under the aegis of neo-liberal influence. It is shown as a key point to the analysis of the investigative phenomenon the historical context in which neo-liberal political stirrings took place strongly marked by a combination of the democratic/participative process and the structure-adjusting process. In addition, the work aims at sharing with the scientific and academic communities some reflections and conclusions about democratization tools for public schools as produced by the School Councils at a time for adjustments to the neo-liberal <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> as well identifying advancement, limits and possibilities related to this journey that counted on the effective participation of segments involved, such as parents, students, teachers, public servants, administrators and local community which helped promoting the development of a participation-minded pedagogy that produced innovative practices related not only to intra-school relations but also relations between school and community. The methodological procedure included bibliographic survey, documents, as well as qualitative field research in order to detect social knowledge acquired by the several subjects that were involved in the political implementation of democratic administration of public schools through School Councils. The upshot of the empirical investigation as conducted on two bodies of School Councils located in the county of Baturite reveals that democratic administration as offered by the State or as a conquest of civil society is carried out with ambiguities and contradictions, on the one hand questioning governmental policies or legitimating them on the other. In their turn, School Councils are hybrid environments that function spasmodically, but in spite of their small contribution there are real gains seen in a gradual approximation to democratic behavior that signals at amplifying citizenship in school...|$|E
