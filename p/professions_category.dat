40|$|Title: The appraiser’s {{choice of}} {{valuation}} method – factors that influences {{the choice of}} company valuation methods Seminar date: 04 / 06 / 07 Course: Master thesis in Business Administration, 10 Swedish credits. Authors: Anne Benedicks and Veronica Öberg Advisor: Eron Oxing Profession of category: Financial analysts, auditors and company lawyers. Key words: Company valuation, valuation methods, cash flow analysis, comparative valuation, the net asset value method. The Main Issue: What is of decisive importance when choosing a special company valuation method? Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify, analyse and evaluate the most common methods of valuation for financial analysts, auditors and company lawyers and those factors that influences the choice of method. Method: A multiple survey has been implemented for the actual <b>profession</b> <b>categories.</b> Primary data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey. Theoretical: The theoretical frame of reference is based upon the paper’s dependent variable, i. e. the role of the appraiser. The appraiser is dependent of following undependent variables: comparative valuation of company, situations of valuation, relevant information, the processes of valuation, the methods of valuation and common custom valuation. Empiricism: Material from the interviews and the questionnaire survey shows how the professional category respectively acts when they valuate a company and why and which valuation method is used. According to the interviews the financial analysts often uses comparative evaluation, the auditor uses the cash flow analysis while the lawyer chooses the net asset value method. Conclusion: The result of this paper considerable agrees to earlier research within the field. The main underlying factor for the appraiser to choose a certain evaluation method is simply depending on the actual situation. Example of other determining factors is customer relations, access to relevant information and which type of business under evaluation. Yrkesgrupper: Finansanalytiker, revisorer och jurister. Problemformulering: Vad är avgörande för att en specifik företagsvärderingsmetod väljs? Syfte: Syftet med uppsatsen är att identifiera, analysera och utvärdera vilka de vanligast förekommande värderingsmetoderna är för finansanalytiker, revisorer och jurister samt vilka faktorer som påverkar valet av metod. Metod: En flerfallstudie har gjorts hos de berörda yrkeskategorierna. Primärdata samlades in genom semistrukturerade intervjuer samt enkätundersökning. Teoretisk referensram: Den teoretiska referensramen utgår från uppsatsens beroende variabel, värderarens roll. De oberoende variabler som värderaren är beroende av är: relativ företagsvärdering, värderingssituationer, informationskällor, värderingsprocessen, värderingsmetoder och god värderingssed. Empiri: Material från intervjuer och enkätundersökning visar på hur respektive yrkeskategori handlar i en företagsvärderingssituation samt varför och med vilken värderingsmetod. Enligt intervjuerna använder finansanalytikern oftast jämförande värdering, revisorn väljer kassaflödesanalys medan juristen väljer substansvärdemetoden. Slutsats: Uppsatsens resultat överensstämmer på ett bra sätt med tidigare forskning inom området. Den största bakomliggande faktorn till att värderaren väljer en viss värderingsmetod beror oftast på situationen. Exempel på andra avgörande element är relationen till kunden, tillgång till information samt vilken typ av företag som ska värderas...|$|R

50|$|Wickens's {{research}} led him {{to discover}} the “release from proactive inhibition.” When consecutive trials involve items from the same conceptual category, there was decreased processing of short-term memory. However, Wickens showed that when subjects perceive {{a change in the}} category of the item to be remembered, there was increased processing of short-term memory. Wickens then used “release from proactive inhibition” as a technique in research involving semantic relatedness of words. His 1972 Psychological Review article, “Encoding Categories of Words; an Empirical Approach to Meaning,” is currently {{one of the most widely}} cited articles in the history of recent psychology. In the article, the “release from proactive inhibition” technique is used to investigate the dimension along which words are encoded in short-term memory. If the semantic content is changed in a consecutive series, a considerable amount of release from proactive inhibition is produced. In the years following this article, Wickens conducted much supporting research. For example, Wickens’ “Lack of Memory for Nonattended Items in Dichotic Listening” illustrates the relationship between “release from proactive inhibition” and semantic coding. The study consisted of 3 different groups of participants: professions, meat, and fruit. Participants in each condition listened to 3 words, counted backwards for 15 seconds, and then attempted to recall the words. Wickens repeated 4 trials with different words in each trial. The results found that the second and third trials decreased in accuracy due to the build up of proactive interference. The fourth trial, however, increased in accuracy after release from the profession and meat conditions. The release from proactive inhibition depended on the words’ <b>categories</b> (<b>profession,</b> fruit, and meat). Proactive inhibition was reduced when the item presented on a subsequent trial was drawn from a different condition. In other words, the release from proactive inhibition depended on the words’ <b>categories</b> (<b>profession,</b> fruit, and meat). The results demonstrate the operation of semantic coding in short term memory.|$|R

This essay will shed light on how {{different types}} of knowledge {{are included in the}} professional practice of teachers in a Norwegian school of arts. This basis of knowledge will be illuminated with support from selected theorists, who bring into perspective the multidimensionality of knowledge in this <b>profession.</b> The Aristotelian <b>categories</b> of episteme, techne and fronesis are central to this discussion. Considering the fact that the main part of pupils’ training in the school of arts is within the music teaching area, the teacher in the text is represented and labeled as an instrumental teacher. The empirical material is a result from close analysis of instrumental teachers in horn, violin, and clarinet in a community arts school in a Norwegian city. Eight categories that appear in the teachers practice form the basis for the observations. In sum they illustrate procedures and forms of action that are significant in the profession. It is my hope that they are included in future discussions of professionalism. Keywords: practice of teaching, basis of knowledge, instrumental teacher...|$|R

A case–control study was performed in a geographical area in which occupational TCE exposure is high. The study objective was to analyze the correlation between occupational TCE exposure and cervical cancer (including precancerous conditions). Methods: Case and control subjects were recruited by gynecologists. General and occu-pational data were collected by telephonic interviews. An industrial hygienist assessed occu-pational TCE exposure on a task-exposure matrix. Analysis focused on occupational TCE exposure at various levels and on cumulative dose. Multivariate analysis was performed {{to take account of}} the various risk factors. Results: In total, 67 case and 67 age-matched control subjects were included. Mean age was 36 years in both groups. Five of the possible general risk factors correlated significantly with cervical dysplasia or cancer: number of partners, history of genital or anal wart, interval between first period and first sexual relation, parity, and body mass index, the last three show-ing inverse correlation.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of possible {{heart disease in}} the well patient has undergone remarkable shifts over the past century. The traditional medical view places strong emphasis on the contribution of technological data to the {{diagnosis of}} disease. In the case of serious heart disease, cardiac diagnostic technologies can play a defining role but, more often in the clinical context, patients are assessed for heart disease which is minor. The question is whether disease is present at all. In this borderland between health and disease, the interpretation of technological data is inherently uncertain. The diagnosis then depends more heavily on the social utility of particular disease categories. Shifts in diagnostic categorisation are not therefore attributable solely to more extensive forms of cardiac imaging but are socially constructed in an interactive context which involves the technology, the medical profession and the wider social structures which exist {{at the time of}} diagnosis. Claims of technological certainty create a social space within which the medical <b>profession</b> generates disease <b>categories.</b> These shifting disease categories may serve the needs of patients but may also be influenced by those of other players. heart disease diagnosis medical technology...|$|R

As a systematic collecting of facts, the survey situates and captures relations, it enables identification of successive orders or traditions, it allows for recognition of characteristics and clusters, it permits the tracing of processes, both backwards and forward. And perhaps this latter aspect is the most decisive: {{the fact that as}} the careful assembling of a data set, the survey does not simply provide a record or blueprint of a situation, but constitutes itself a mapping practice, which ‘allows a trajectory to be formed in the mind and that historical trajectory is (or so we assume) the basis of beginning to know in relation to a field’ (Dilnot 2009 : 377) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The small {{accounting}} practice, {{despite being}} the most numerous part of the profession by number of firms, remains largely under-researched. Part of the reason the small practice category remains elusive is that researchers {{find it difficult to}} precisely define the object to study, and yet, this may be precisely the reason for studying it. Envisaging how this category is “represented” in institutionalized settings, constitutes a rich agenda for future research as it allows the small practitioner world to be connected to the issue of intra-professional segmentation. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper proposes reinvigorating research around Bucher and Strauss’ (1961) conceptualization of professions as “segments in movement”. At the same time as advocating a better investigation of the small practitioner segment itself, it suggests to take the latter as an example to further explore the vision of professions as segments “more or less delicately held together”. To this end, there is a potential for cross-fertilization between Bucher and Strauss’ research programme and a range of other theoretical frameworks. Findings – The discussion points towards how small practice, as a segment whose history and characteristics reflect the different struggles that have {{led to the creation of}} the professional accounting body and marked its subsequent evolution, is far from insignificant. Segmenting the <b>profession</b> in <b>categories</b> related to “size” offers an opportunity to deal with an under-investigated aspect of professions’ sociology and history, which encapsulates its inherent diversity and hierarchy. Whilst the professional body may replicate the hierarchy that structures broader society, the meaning of small itself, within a hierarchy of organizations, is also a relative concept. It is politically charged, and must be delicately managed in order to maintain harmony within the polarized professional space. Originality/value – The small practitioner has been much overlooked in the accounting literature, and the literature on the professions has overemphasized aspects of its cohesiveness.

Just as stress differs {{as a function of}} the individual, it also differs as a function of one’s type of occupation. Some occupations are, of course, inherently more stressful than others. All of the stress-strain-health relationships have an obvious impact on the organization and industry. Occupational stress is becoming increasingly globalized and affects all countries, all <b>professions</b> and all <b>categories</b> of workers, as well as families and society in general. Job stressed has made the quality of service delivery of workers to reduce drastically and as such many rich people with high socio-economic status end up moving their family abroad when they are unhealthy.

40|$|Este artigo aborda as transformações ocorridas no magistério durante o regime militar (1964 - 1985), mostrando que a sua origem deixou de ser exclusivamente as classes médias urbanas e frações das elites, passando a constituir-se também das camadas populares. Ocorreu, assim, um processo de mobilidade tanto ascendente quanto descendente, pois os que tinham origem nos "de cima" se proletarizaram enquanto os de origem popular ascenderam a uma profissão da classe média. A nova categoria, formada por essas duas frações, foi submetida a condições de vida e de trabalho determinadas pelo arrocho salarial. Analisamos este fenômeno tomando por base a Confederação dos Professores Primários do Brasil, que, por força das reformas educacionais da ditadura, cresceu numericamente e se transformou na Confederação dos Professores do Brasil. A profissão, em decorrência dessa rápida e profunda transformação, passou a sofrer uma crise de identidade - a meio caminho da proletarização e do exercício intelectual. This paper {{explores the}} {{transformation}} sUFFered {{by the teacher}} category during the military regime (1964 - 1985). It shows that teachers did not originate exclusively from the urban middle classes and fractions of the economical elite, but also from popular classes. An ascendant and descendant social mobilization process thus took place: those who originated from "upper" classes became proletarianized, while those from popular origin rose to a middle class <b>profession.</b> This new <b>category,</b> made up by these two sections, was submitted to standards of life and work determined by salary tightening.

Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to identify factors contributing to teacher retention specifically in the area of career and technical education (CTE) and determine predictability of the factors‟ influence on secondary CTE teachers‟ intent to stay in or leave the teaching profession. The career and technical areas of family and consumer sciences, trade and industrial, health occupations, and agriculture in the state of Kansas made up the population for this study. The six factors that data were collected on were educational preparation, teacher commitment, first year teaching experience, skills and abilities, Social integration and institutional factors. Participants in this study perceived their educational preparation overall as good. No item was given an overall rating of excellent leaving room for improvement in this area. Overall, participants agreed with their commitment to teaching, items pertaining to the first year teaching experience, and their skills and abilities in the <b>profession.</b> Within the <b>category</b> of Social integration, teachers rated that gaining student respect was extremely important. CTE teachers surveyed rated an inner sense of knowing they are doing a good job as extremely important in the construct of institutional factors. All overall ratings of the six factors indicate that teachers tended to agree or rate as important the items under these constructs. Predicting the intent to stay in or leave the profession of teaching was analyzed quantitatively using discriminant analysis.

The other objective of this thesis was to propose preventive measures to protect health when working and to categorize individual works. In the case of sugar beet processing equipment there are two risk factors. The employees {{are affected by the}} risk factors of noise and psychological burden. Three research questions were established: 1. Which of the working environment factors dominates? 2. Do the risk operation activities predominate? 3. Is the level of working environment factors over limits? This thesis was prepared using qualitative research methodology, particularly secondary analysis of data which is based on the study of literature, legislation and vocational background to this issue. Also the observation methodology was used, concretely disinterested and obvious observation. In the theoretical part I focused on risk factors which occur in the sugar beet processing equipment and on the assessment of health risks. Then I focused on the technology of sugar production. In the practical part I assessed the health risks of selected work environment factors. The evaluation was carried out according to the procedures set out in Government Regulation No. 272 / 2011 Coll. and in Government Regulation No. 361 / 2007 Coll., as amended. I compared the measurement results with the health limits set out in Government Regulation No. 272 / 2011 Coll., which sets the safe limits for noise and vibration. After comparing with hygienic limits I ranked the individual <b>professions</b> in <b>categories</b> according to Decree No. 432 / 2003 Coll., as amended. Based on the practical part the above-mentioned research questions were answered. Noise is the dominant factor in the working environment in the sugar beet processing equipment. We mean the noise which is variable. Technological facilities are the source of noise. Risky works occur in the mentioned devices but do not predominate in the operation. The level of the noise factor in the work environment is above the limit for certain professions. These include the following professions: sugar beet equipment operation, roots lines operation, operation of washing machines, cutting machines operation, operation of centrifuges and brewer. The factor of psychological load was evaluated according to specified criteria. Given that this is a seasonal job in the winter, the positives outweigh the negative effects of mental stress factor. Currently, when the unemployment rate rises, people appraise for each job opportunity. This Bachelor's thesis can be used in practice to raise awareness of the health risks connected with working conditions influences in the sugar beet processing equipment.

The knowledge was surveyed by a questionnaire method. 170 respondents - nurses working in Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s. ? were approached. The questionnaire consisted of 37 questions structured into three basic blocks. The first block focused on knowledge and observation of principles applicable to OSH and fire safety, obligations of employees and use of PPE. The second block focused on potential risks encountered by nurses performing their profession, methods and tools to protect themselves against the risks and their response to an occupational injury. The third block consisted of a subjective evaluation of OSH issues and threats posed by potential risks encountered during performance of their profession. Results of the questionnaire survey were evaluated by means of MS Excel software package and shown in summary tables. Hypothesis 1 : Nurses are familiar with OSH principles? has been confirmed. I have found the knowledge of OSH principles among nurses sufficient (knowledge of obligations of the employees, periodic medical checkups, principles of use of disposable gloves, principles of manipulation with oxygen pressure cylinders, awareness of principles of correct manipulation with electric equipment, principles of use of fire extinguishers, knowledge of safety signs, principles of handling of contaminated laundry, knowledge of proper response to an injury, kinesthetic principles, knowledge of nursing procedures for treatment of an injury with a contaminated needle). Hypothesis 2 : Nurses working in theselected medical facility - Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s. - are aware of the risks that may endanger their health while performing their profession ? has not been confirmed. The nurses are not aware of the risks that endanger their health while performing their <b>profession</b> (knowledge of <b>categories</b> of work at the ward, awareness of risks, probability of occurrence of risk factors, awareness of risks involved in manipulations with oxygen pressure cylinders) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} scientifically designed, using {{stratification}} approach, three representative categories (i. e. strata) were selected which included One Officials and Educationists two Teachers Trainers and third category {{was comprised of}} Teacher Trainees. Out of all three categories random sample i. e. 50; 25; and 100 respectively were drawn using close-ended questionnaire. Prior to launch full scale field data collocation, the questionnaire was pretested so that non sampling error could be minimized. The parameters were qualitative and quantitative in nature such as the perceptions opinions policies type training programs gender divisions and number of training offered in a Calendar year. The inferential statistics such as correlations and t and p values with confidence intervals were used. Also, data has been presented using statistical tools such as means, standard deviation, percentages and likert scale. In the context of Pakistan, the study identifies some pertinent {{issues such as the}} of lack of accountability, lack of incentives, little hope of a career track, and motivation confront with education system especially the teachers. Moreover, these issues appear to be widespread resulting from the failure of the system itself (led by government institutions). Although, some {{attempts have been made to}} improve of institutions, these include ADB program in the mid 1990 â€™s that supported the establishment of the Provincial Institutes of Teacher Education (PITEs) and other outposts of training. The outcome of those programs is debated as much of these programs contributed for improving infrastructure instead of quality education through reformation processes. In fact, a majority of projects and programs implemented over the years have unfortunately directed their This research study critically assesses the impact of Teacher Education Reforms (TERs) in Germany and Japan. The reforms include range of training programs initiated for teachers to enhance their capability and capabilities in imparting higher education especially at classroom levels, these training were offered at certificate levels such as, PTC, CT, B. Ed, M. Ed. The results show encouraging outcome, for example, teaching standards in both Germany and Japan are compatible with countries like USA and France. The study also intends to relate experiences of both countries i. e., Germany and Japan with Pakistan. The purpose was to suggest the standards and mechanisms for Pakistan, especially, those that were designed while initiating teacher training programs in both countries. Energies at addressing the symptoms of the problems rather than correcting the root causes. The study reveals that the system of teacher training and follow-up in the field by assessment adopted in Germany and Japan could applied in Pakistan. Also, in order to improve education system like in Japan and Germany, the appointment of teachers be made through an independent body (i. e. like HEC). The teacher recruitment must be ensured on 100 merit basis not on compromises on quality or else on political influence. As such practices have been proved to be counterproductive in terms of ensuring quality education. Further, the minimum qualification for candidates applying for Primary School Teacher should not be less than Graduation; the test standard must be maintained considering future national needs in relation to primary education. The posting of teachers must not be done in their home district and a handsome salary package may be designed for teachers. The summer and winter bonuses should be announced, family allowance, for those who have dependents, remote area allowance, for those who serve in isolated areas, special service allowance, for those who engage in activities or special services. The cold and hot place allowance for those posted at more than normal hot/cold areas, short-term benefits provide medical insurance and cover employees' and their dependents' medical expenses for illness, injury, childbirth, etc. Long-term benefits include retirement plans and other annuities that are paid upon retirement and thereafter (usually monthly), or when employees become disabled or die. The findings of this study may be helpful for policy makers, administrators and teacher educators to improve the teacher-training programs. It may also be helpful for the prospective teachers as well as working teachers in developing positive attitude toward teaching <b>profession.</b> All the <b>categories</b> of respondents exhibit no significance difference in their perceptions on quality of teachers and teacher training approaches at various levels. Teacher training programs need reevaluation and reorganization to remove the drawbacks. The teaching staff of teacher training institutions needs to reevaluate their own attitudes towards teaching profession as well as their overt behavior towards the prospective teacher...|$|R
