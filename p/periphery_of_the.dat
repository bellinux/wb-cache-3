5|$|As Hurricane Jeanne moved inland, its inner eyewall dissipated, and {{its outer}} eyewall quickly became less distinct. It turned west-northwestward over the state, curving around the western <b>periphery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge to its northeast. By 14hours after landfall, Jeanne {{weakened}} to tropical storm status near the Tampa Bay area. In western Florida, offshore winds produced {{a tide of}} 4.5feet (1.4m) below normal in Cedar Key; however, after the storm passed the area, the onshore winds produced above normal tides. Despite initial forecasts that it would emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, the storm remained over land and continued to slowly weaken. Early on September 27, dry air became entrained into the southern <b>periphery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circulation, which diminished the thunderstorms to the south. After turning northward, Jeanne entered southern Georgia and weakened into a tropical depression.|$|E

At <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galaxy, <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warp, derived from these data, may be as high as ∼ 1 kpc. <b>The</b> scale-height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulsar distribution increases exponentially from ∼ 0. 5 kpc to ∼ 1 kpc while increasing the galactocentric distance from 5 kpc to 15 kpc.

5|$|In Ocos, Guatemala {{near the}} border, winds {{from the storm}} {{destroyed}} the roofs {{of about a dozen}} palm huts, forcing over 100 residents to evacuate.

5|$|Later on June14, the JTWC {{issued a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the depression.

Outflow significantly deteriorated as the system detached itself from the TUTT. By this time, the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression. Two days later, after tracking across Luzon, the system began to regenerate. Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south.|$|E

5|$|Multinucleated cells contain {{multiple}} nuclei. Most acantharean {{species of}} protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other {{examples include the}} intestinal parasites in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the <b>periphery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.|$|E

40|$|This Review article {{discusses}} dendritic organometallic catalysis, {{originating from}} catalytic moieties present at <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> a dendrimer. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> multiple catalytic moieties at the dendrimer peripheries {{leads to a}} positive effect in majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, although a negative or a marginal improvement in the catalytic effect {{with respect to the}} corresponding monomeric catalyst were also encountered. A number of recent examples that attempt to rationalize <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dendrimer effect in catalysis are discussed. Further a tabular survey is provided by categorizing the dendritic catalysts and their influence on catalysis.
