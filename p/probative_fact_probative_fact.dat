40|$|Abstract. The recent {{popularity}} {{of research on}} topics of multimedia forensics justifies reflections on {{the definition of the}} field. This paper devises an ontology that structures forensic disciplines by their primary domain of evidence. In this sense, both multimedia forensics and computer forensics belong to the class of digital forensics, but they differ notably in the underlying observer model that defines the forensic investigator’s view on (parts of) reality, which itself is not fully cognizable. Important consequences on the reliability of <b>probative</b> <b>facts</b> emerge with regard to available counter-forensic techniques: while perfect concealment of traces is possible for computer forensics, this level of certainty cannot be expected for manipulations of sensor data. We cite concrete examples and refer to established techniques to support our arguments. ...|$|R
40|$|In Nebraska a {{directed}} verdicts {{based on}} circumstantial evidence {{leading to an}} inference presents a difficult problem. Even the Supreme Court of the United States has hedged when called upon to formulate a rule to help guide trial judges in federal courts when they are considering what degree of circumstantial evidence is needed to allow a case {{to go to the}} jury. The court stated “... the essential requirement is that mere speculation be not allowed to do duty for <b>probative</b> <b>facts,</b> after making due allowance for all reasonably possible inferences favoring the party whose case is attacked. ” The majority of the Court in refusing to adopt a general rule concluded that the problem is one that must be solved in particular situations...|$|R

30|$|Resolving complex risk {{problems}} requires {{dialogue and}} deliberation among experts and representative of stakeholder groups with special knowledge and experience. Involving members of various epistemic {{communities that have}} demonstrated expertise and competence is the most promising step in producing more reliable and valid judgments about the complex nature of a given risk. Epistemic discourse is the instrument for discussing the conclusiveness and validity of cause-effect chains relying on available <b>probative</b> <b>facts,</b> uncertain knowledge, and experience that can be tested for empirical traceability and consistency. The objective of such a deliberation {{is to find the}} most cogent description and explanation of the phenomenological complexity in question as well as a clarification of dissenting views, for example by addressing the question of which environmental and socioeconomic impacts are to be expected by specific community action plans. Deliberation among experts might generate a profile of the complexity of the given risk issue on selected intersubjectively chosen criteria. The deliberation may also reveal that there is more uncertainty and ambiguity hidden in the case than the initial appraisers had anticipated. It is advisable to include natural as well as social scientists in the epistemic discourse so that potential problems with risk perception can be anticipated. If this practice was followed, controversies would occur less as a surprise than is now often the case.|$|R
25|$|Elaborating, Lord Diplock {{stated that}} one of the {{fundamental}} rules of natural justice in the field of criminal law is that a person should not be punished for an offence unless it has been established to the satisfaction of an independent and unbiased tribunal that he committed it. This requires that there be material before the court logically <b>probative</b> of <b>facts</b> sufficient to constitute the offence.|$|R
40|$|This Article exposes {{internal}} {{contradictions in}} case law concerning {{the use and}} admissibility of film as evidence. Based on a review of more than ninety state and federal cases dating from 1923 to the present, the Article explains how the source of these contradictions is the frequent miscategorization of film as 2 ̆ 2 demonstrative evidence 2 ̆ 2 that purports to illustrate other evidence, rather than to be directly <b>probative</b> of some <b>fact</b> at issue. The Article further demonstrates how these contradictions are based on two venerable jurisprudential anxieties. One is the concern about the growing trend toward replacing the traditional testimony of live witnesses in court with communications via video and film technology. Another anxiety is the public perception of the trial itself as undisciplined and capricious rather than as controlled and truth-establishing. The Article concludes by showing that these anxieties are not well-founded because, when filmic proffers are properly considered, they are admitted as substantive and testimonial evidence. As a result, they are (or should be) subject to hearsay rules and cross-examination and to other rules intended to safeguard {{the integrity of the}} trial...|$|R
40|$|A {{decision}} {{to terminate the}} employment of a public school teacher will usually be made only after the teacher has had {{an opportunity for a}} hearing. If there is a hearing, and if the law requires evidentiary support for a termination, then such a decision must be based solely upon the evidence adduced at the hearing. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to research the law of evidence for teacher employment termination hearings. The major questions considered were: (1) What are the standards for the admission of evidence? (2) What evidence may be used to support a finding?^ Related literature from educational management, administrative law, and evidence law was reviewed. The research consisted primarily of an analysis of the judicial decisions and state statutes which relate specifically to public school teacher termination procedures. ^ It is fundamental evidence law that <b>facts</b> having rational <b>probative</b> value are to be admitted unless some specific rule forbids. Three categories of rules of evidence have evolved [...] rules of relevancy, which define probative value; rules of exclusion, which protect probative value; and rules of privilege, which invoke extrinsic policies that override probative value. ^ The formal rules of evidence used in judicial trials are not generally applied at teacher termination hearings. Instead, the more informal evidentiary procedures common to administrative agency proceedings are usually followed. Generally, when evidence is offered and objected to, the rules of relevancy are applied and the rules of privilege are recognized, but the rules of exclusion are not enforced. However, if a court examines the hearing record to determine whether there is an adequate evidentiary basis for the decision, the legal residuum rule might then be applied. That rule requires that an administrative finding must be based at least in part on evidence that would be admissible under the formal rules. ^ The standard of relevancy is generally established by the notice to the teacher. Only evidence relevant to the charges in the notice should be admitted and used in support of a termination decision. The rules of exclusion are generally not enforced when evidence is introduced. However, these rules may be applied if a court examines the record to determine whether there is some legally admissible evidence to support the findings. The rule against hearsay is perhaps the most frequently invoked exclusionary rule. Rules of privilege are seldom an issue at these hearings. However, it seems that both the constitutional and common law privileges are generally recognized. ^ The determination must be fairly based on the hearing proceedings. The teacher may introduce evidence showing that the tribunal is too biased to render an objective decision or that some unstated, impermissible reason may be the real basis for the termination. ^ The burden of proof at the hearing, and therefore the evidentiary considerations, may vary depending upon the legal rights of the teacher. The school officials may be required to prove cause for termination; in other instances, the teacher is simply provided a forum. ^ Perhaps one of the most effective means to insure that a decision has been made within the bounds of the law is to require that a termination be explained by written findings and reasons. However, such a requirement has not been consistently enforced. ^ The Nebraska law regarding the major evidentiary questions considered has not been clearly established. Although a degree of procedural informality seems to be permissible, any decision should be solidly based on evidence admissible under the formal rules. ^ The hearing procedures should promote a thorough consideration of the issues and the evidence. The objective should be a meaningful process leading to a just and rational decision. ...|$|R
