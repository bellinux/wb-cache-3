40|$|The {{prevalent}} {{microbial growth}} on carcasses {{before and after}} overnight cooling in an ostrich abattoir and de-boning plant was investigated. The effect of warm or cold trimming of the carcasses was examined together with possible causes of contamination along the processing line. An {{attempt was made to}} link the prevalent microorganisms that were identified from carcasses to those from specific external contamination sources. Samples of carcasses and possible contaminants were collected in the plant, plated out and selected organisms were typed using a commercial rapid identification system. It was indicated that the cold trim (mainly of bruises) of carcasses was advantageous in terms of microbiological meat quality. Results indicated pooled water in the abattoir as the most hazardous vector for carcass contamination and that contaminants from this source are mostly Gram-negative pathogens. Pseudomonas and Shigella were frequently isolated from surface and air samples and indicated that the control of total <b>plant</b> <b>hygiene</b> is a requirement for producing ostrich meat that is safe to consume and has an acceptable shelf-life.

40|$|Vacuum-packaged (VP) beef {{produced}} and packaged in Australia {{can have an}} unusually long shelf-life. This observation has been attributed, in part, to superior abattoir hygiene, {{but there is an}} absence of robust scientific evidence to support this claim. While <b>plant</b> <b>hygiene</b> may be an important factor in extending VP beef shelf-life, there are likely other contributing factors. Bacteria rarely exist in isolation and occur as members of a microbial niche.

40|$|Spotted wing {{drosophila}} (Drosophila suzukii) is {{an economically}} important insect pest, which causes damage on cultivated and wild-growing fruit plants. The pest, which {{is placed in}} A 2 EPPO list, occurred in Slovenia since 2010 and it is spreading progressively. Since its first record in Spain and Italy (2008), it is now present {{in the majority of}} Mediterranean countries. In the review paper the most important control methods against the spotted wing drosophila are presented. In {{some parts of the world}} the pest is efficiently controlled with synthetic insecticides, however their use is questionable owing to waiting period, since the insect occurs on fruits in the time of ripening and before harvesting. Thus, more and more researches are focused in the studies of alternative (environmentally sound) control methods of this pest. So far, biological control of spotted wing drosophila is more effective in Asia than in Europe. In the upcoming years it is therefore important to investigate the distribution and efficiency of indigenous biological control agents in the Old continent. Among them we suggest to investigate how effective are the predatory bug Orius majusculus and entomopathogenic nematodes against this pest.

40|$|This booklet {{has been}} {{produced}} {{in conjunction with}} a workshop which was convened to help South Island dairy farmers to understand the new milk payment system and to consider means for coping with it. The text is set out in three major sections which deal separately with the effects of the new payment scheme, factors affecting milk quality and managemental influences on the composition and yield of milk. Hopefully this information will equip dairy farmers with knowledge of the scope for manipulating milk protein levels and of the means by which they can avoid penalty payments. Much of this comes back to on-farm practices such as milking <b>plant</b> <b>hygiene,</b> pasture management and herd health. It is without apology that these topics are re-examined here. Nevertheless there are changes afoot in terms of technological advances in processing and on the farm.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{relation}} between occupational exposure to ceramic fibres during manufacture and respiratory health. METHODS [...] The respiratory health of 628 current employees {{in the manufacture of}} ceramic fibres in seven European plants in three countries was studied with a respiratory questionnaire, lung function tests, and chest radiography. Simultaneous <b>plant</b> <b>hygiene</b> surveys measured subjects' current exposure to airborne ceramic fibres from personal samples with optical microscopy fibre counts. The measured exposures were combined with occupational histories to derive estimates of each subject's cumulative exposure to respirable fibres. Symptoms were related to current and cumulative exposure to ceramic fibres and lung function and findings from chest radiographs were related to cumulative exposure. RESULTS [...] The mean duration of employment was 10. 2 years and mean (range) cumulative exposure was 3. 84 (0 - 22. 94) (f. ml- 1. y). Eye and skin symptoms were frequent in all plants and increased significantly, as did breathlessness and wheeze, with increasing current exposure. Dry cough and stuffy nose were less common in the least exposed group but did not increase with increasing exposure. After adjustment for the effects of age, sex, height, smoking, and past occupational exposures to respiratory hazards, there was a significant decrease in both forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced midexpiratory flow related to cumulative exposure in current smokers (P < 0. 05) and in FEV 1 in ex-smokers (P < 0. 05). Small opacities were found in 13 % of the chest radiographs; their prevalence was not related to cumulative exposure to ceramic fibres. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is concluded that exposure to ceramic fibres is associated with irritant symptoms similar to those seen in other exposures to man made mineral fibres (MMMFs) and that cumulative exposure to respirable ceramic fibres may cause airways obstruction by promoting the effects of cigarette smoke...|$|E

The system brings obvious benefits in optimising <b>plant</b> <b>hygiene,</b> ensuring compliance with legislation and providing evidence of 'due diligence' {{on the part of the}} processor. It is now being applied globally in two different situations: in one, such as that occurring in the USA, carcass contamination is clearly reduced as carcasses pass through the process and are finally chilled in super-chlorinated water. There is also the option to use a chemical-rinse treatment for further reduction of microbial contamination. In the second scenario, processors in the EU are not allowed to super-chlorinate process water, and water chilling, which has an important washing effect, is confined to carcasses intended for freezing. Also, chemical decontamination is prohibited until 2006 at the earliest. Therefore, for fresh carcasses that are air chilled, there is presently no marked reduction in carcass contamination and no Critical Control Point at which a significant reduction in pathogen contamination can be guaranteed. Overall, effective control of the organisms is best realised through a farm-to-fork approach at all stages of the supply chain...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The primary aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} if exposure to dust from absorbent hygiene products containing superabsorbent polymer is related to symptoms from the airways and from the eyes. The secondary aim was to estimate the current exposure to superabsorbent polymer among production and maintenance workers in a <b>plant</b> producing <b>hygiene</b> products. Methods The cohort comprised 1043 workers of whom 689 were exposed to super absorbent polymer and 804 were exposed to paper dust (overlapping groups). There was 186 workers not exposed to either superabsorbent polymer or to paper dust They were investigated with a comprehensive questionnaire about exposure, asthma, rhinitis and symptoms from eyes and airways. The results were analyzed with logistic regression models adjusting for sex, age, atopy and smoking habits. An aerosol sampler equipped with a polytetrafluoroethylene filter with 1 μm pore size was used for personal samplings in order to measure inhalable dust and superabsorbent polymer. Results The prevalence of nasal crusts (OR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 2. 0) and nose-bleeding (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 4) was increased among the paper dust exposed workers (adjusted for superabsorbent polymer exposure). There were no significant effects associated with exposure to superabsorbent polymer (adjusted for paper dust exposure). The average exposure to inhalable levels of total dust (paper dust) varied between 0. 40 and 1. 37 mg/m 3. For superabsorbent polymer dust the average exposure varied between 0. 02 and 0. 81 mg/m 3. Conclusions In conclusion, our study shows that workers manufacturing diapers in the hygiene industry have an increased prevalence of symptoms from the nose, especially nose-bleeding. There was no relation between exposure to superabsorbent polymer and symptoms from eyes, nose or respiratory tract, but exposure to paper dust was associated with nose-bleeding and nasal crusts.

40|$|In a {{wide range}} of crops the average yield loss caused by {{nematodes}} is estimated to be 10 - 15 %. Sometimes it can be total. Food and cash crops are susceptible to one of the many types of these tiny soil-borne, thread-like parasitic roundworms. They feed and reproduce within the host plant, affect growth, and can cause distorted seeds, and rotten or malformed roots and tubers. Damaged tissues cannot get enough nutrients and water from the soil to maintain normal growth, and a poor harvest results. Often farmers attribute this disappointing performance to poor soil, water stress, or salinity rather than to the true cause Once a soil is infested {{it is virtually impossible to}} eliminate the nematodes, removing the host plant for long periods by crop rotation is rarely adequate. However, damage can be limited. Since most plant-parasitic nematodes spend part of their life-cycle in the soil, they can be killed there by nematicides, but two major disadvantages of these are their toxicity, and the fact that their effect is short-term. Thus repeated use is necessary to prevent a resurgence of the problem later in the growing season. Despite the widespread and serious damage caused by nematodes in the Tropics, the use of nematicides is not common because farmers lack financial resources. While removing the host plant for long periods by crop rotation is inadequate to control nematodes, appropriate techniques exist which are less costly and less damaging to man and to the environment than the repeated use of chemicals. Under slash and burn systems or shifting cultivation, land was unlikely to become nematode-infested; however, the natural balance is easily upset by fixed farming and the introduction of new crops and cultivars. Identifying nematode damage The detection of nematodes is the first step to control. Relatively few nematodes can be passed on in seed but, of those that are, some are easily detectable by their effects such as the blackened seed galls caused in wheat and distorted and discoloured seeds of beans. The peanut/groundnut seed nematode found in Nigeria makes the seed shrivelled and dark brown, and is seed transmitted if the seeds are left in their pods or are not thoroughly dried. A rice nematode, Ditylenchus angustus, is found in freshly-harvested seeds, and can also be killed by sun-drying but, like a number of foliar nematodes, can still be carried in plant debris mixed with seed. In yams and potatoes, nematodes produce small yellow lesions just under the surface which develop into a dark brown dry rot and some cause knobbly tubers. Infected tubers must not be used for planting. Nematodes are common causes of damage to dessert and cooking bananas. They are spread in the vegetative corms used to grow new plants, and the symptoms are most noticeable in the roots of suckers immediately after lifting - as purple or dark brown lesions seen when the root is split lengthwise. There may also be dark areas on the root surface. The first signs of nematode infection in taro are red streaks in the centre of the corm; these allow bacteria and fungi to establish, and the corm can rot away completely. All seedlings should have their roots checked for swellings, or galls or distorted shapes prior to transplanting. Unlike Rhizobium nodules in leguminous plants, nematode galls are an integral part of the root. Damage limitation Once a farmer notices nematode damage to root or leaf, there is little to be done that season other than to remove and destroy infected plants and increase amounts of water and fertiliser to compensate. In alleycropping, perennial trees and food and cash crops can even exchange nematodes, but the problem can be contained by careful choice of planting material and land use. Nematode-free stem cuttings can be taken from sugar cane and cassava, and also from kumara, though tubers and roots can pass on the pest. Using part of a yam tuber for planting means that farmers can check for damage. Citrus can be propagated by marcotts or cuttings. Extension services must avoid distributing nematodes with cocoa, coffee or other tree seedlings. Seedbed soils can be kept pestfree by annual or seasonal rotation of the seedbed site, always using previously uncultivated ground. Dry season crop seed beds can be allowed to flood; wet season crop seedbeds should be kept free of weeds; soil can be turned frequently in dry periods since exposure to the sun kills a large proportion of nematodes; brushwood, crop, seed residues, and dried dung may be burned to kill the nematodes Nematode populations can also be reduced by incorporating chicken manure, green manure, sawdust, cocoa pods or cassava peelings into the soil. Some plants, such as mustard and marigold (Tagetes spp) have nematicidal properties. Strict <b>plant</b> <b>hygiene</b> and early detection will help prevent the disastrous damage wreaked by nematodes, and are far cheaper and less hazardous than the use of chemical nematicides.

40|$|Reports from Scandinavia have {{suggested}} behavioural impairment among long term workers exposed to solvents below regulatory standards. A cross sectional study of behavioural performance was conducted among printers and spray painters exposed to mixtures of organic solvents {{to replicate the}} Scandinavian studies and to examine dose-response relationships. Eligible subjects consisted of 640 hourly workers from four midwestern United States companies. Of these, 269 responded to requests to participate and 240 were selected for study based on restrictions for age, sex, education, and other potentially confounding variables. The subjects tested had been employed on average for six years. Each subject completed an occupational history, underwent a medical examination, and completed a battery of behavioural tests. These included the Fitts law psychomotor task, the Stroop colour-word test, the Sternberg short term memory scanning test, the short term memory span test, and the continuous recognition memory test. Solvent exposure for each subject was defined as an exposed or non-exposed category based on a <b>plant</b> industrial <b>hygiene</b> walk-through and the concentration of solvents based on an analysis of full shift personal air samples by gas chromatography. The first definition was used to maintain consistency with Scandinavian studies, but the second {{was considered to be}} more accurate. The average full shift solvent concentration was 302 ppm for the printing plant workers and 6 - 13 ppm for the workers at other plants. Isopropanol and hexane were the major components, compared with toluene in Scandinavian studies. Performance on behavioural tests was analysed using multiple linear regression with solvent concentration as an independent variable. Other relevant demographic variables were also considered for inclusion. No significant (p greater than 0. 05) relation between solvent concentration and impairment on any of the 10 behavioural variables was observed after controlling for confounding variables. Exposed/non-exposed comparisons showed a significantly poorer digit span among those exposed, but this has not been generally reported in the Scandinavian studies. The medical examination showed no abnormalities of clinical significance. The inability to replicate the findings of the Scandinavian studies could have been due to the shortness of the duration of workers' exposure, the type of solvents in the mixtures, use of different behavioural tests, or to selection factors...|$|R

Airborne exposure concentrations of 1, 3 -butadiene were determined using personal sampling for each job category. A total of 692 full shift and short-term personnel and 259 area air samples were examined for the presence of 1, 3 -butadiene. Sample results indicated that all worker exposures were well below the current OSHA PEL of 1000 ppm. Exposures ranged from less than 0. 006 ppm to 374 ppm. The average exposure for all samples was less than 2 ppm. The present American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit value for 1, 3 -butadiene is 10 ppm. To reduce the potential for occupational exposure, it is recommended that quality control sampling be conducted using a closed loop system.

Total aerobic bacteria and Listeria spp. were enumerated by plate counting and the presence of L. monocytogenes confirmed. From 91 samples, 6 were positive of L. monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes was found in one gutting machine at 2 out of the 4 plants, occasionally on floor, drains, and conveyor belts, once in a water tank, but not on ungutted fish. There was not found any correlation between the level of Listeria spp. and the total bacteria count (R 2 = 0, 026, n = 30). Even though the levels were low, the findings of L. monocytogenes in processing equipment may potentially pose a threat to food safety. L. monocytogenes is a ubiquitous bacterium that is easily introduced from different sources. The main challenge is to hinder plant colonization through improved hygienic practice and hygienic design...|$|R
40|$|Industry {{operations}} {{require a}} clean plant to make safe, quality products consistently. As well as product quality, {{the environmental impact}} of processes has become increasingly important to industry and consumers. Cleaning In Place (CIP) is the ubiquitous method used to ensure <b>plant</b> cleanliness and <b>hygiene.</b> It is therefore vital the system is optimal and efficient. I. e. the correct cleaning agent is delivered to the fouled surface at the right time, temperature, flow rate and concentration. This cannot be assured without effective online measurement technologies. Fryer and Asteriadou (2009) describe how the nature of a fouling deposit can be related to the cost of cleaning. The evolution of three key deposit types has also enabled current fouling and cleaning literature to be easily classified. In the brewery there are many types of soil that need to be cleaned of which the cost of cleaning was unknown. The cost of fermenter CIP in one brewery was found to be £ 106 k per year. Effective fouling methods for yeast and caramel; and the relationship between flow, temperature, and caustic concentration in the removal of yeast and caramel soils seen in industry has been done. This work has helped determine effective cleaning methods for these soils from stainless steel coupons and pipes. Fermentation vessels have been found by Goode et al., (2010) to have two types of soil: A – fouling above the beer resulting from the act of fermentation, and B – fouling below the beer resulting from emptying the fermenter. The type B fouling below the beer was found to be a type 1 soil that could be removed with water. An increase in flow velocity and Reynolds number decreased cleaning time. An increase in temperature did not decrease cleaning time significantly at higher flow velocities, 0. 5 m s- 1. Fouling above the beer occurs when material is transported to and stick on to the wall during fermentation foaming. This happens initially and as a result the fouling has a long aging time. This yeast film represents a type 2 deposit, removed in part by water and in part by chemical. Most of the deposit could be removed by rinsing with warm water. At 50 °C the greatest amount of deposit was removed in the shortest time. A visually clean surface could be achieved at all temperatures, 20, 30, 50 and 70 °C, using both 2 and 0. 2 wt...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} Khartoum State {{population}} increased dramatically so consumption of fruit juices increased. Quality control {{and safety of}} fruit juices in Khartoum State should be evaluated. Design: Cross sectional study to study quality control and safety of fruit juices in Khartoum State. Setting: Five plants for fruit juices manufacturing in Khartoum State were included in this study. Objectives: The main objective was to study the quality control and safety of fruit juice in manufacturing plants in Khartoum State. Specific Objectives were to identify the microbiological contamination sources in juice manufacturing, to determine the microbial quality of finished product and to evaluate monitoring systems in fruit juices manufacturing plants. Methods: Microbiological analysis for seventy five samples collected from water, syrup and finished products were done to evaluate juice quality during production stages. Observation notes were taken to evaluate: buildings, workers and hygiene situation. Questionnaires were distributed among quality control and production managers in plants under study to evaluate fruit juices manufacturing process. Results: Findings indicate defective quality of fruit juices {{as a result of}} crosscontamination during preparation of juices. Laboratory analysis showed that the microbial quality of finished products was at unacceptable limit (≥ 102 CFU/ml). Pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella, S. Aureus, Shigella, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter and Bacillus cereus were isolated in syrup rooms and finished product stages. Water was the source of contamination by Klebsiella in plant (A) and by Enterobacter in plant (D). Questionnaires results showed that juices were not handled hygienically and not stored at right temperature. Monitoring systems established were not effective. Finished products shelf lifes were extended beyond the shelf life of raw materials. Observation notes showed that cleaning schedules were neglected and cleaning labours were involved in syrup preparation which considered as risk for cross-contamination in some <b>plants.</b> Poor personal <b>hygiene</b> and wrong handling were the main sources for cross-contamination in syrup and finished products stages. No raw materials analyses were carried to ensure safety of juices in all tested plants. X All plants were using automatic filling system to reduce cross contamination during filling process, but cross contamination occurred in some plants due to neglect sanitation. Conclusion: Some of fruit juices produced in Khartoum State were not prepared according to food safety procedures. Food control systems such as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP), Good Hygiene Practice (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) should be applied to produce safe products...|$|R
40|$|The Preschool {{education}} is {{the first stage of}} school education. This work aims to introduce the realityof Environmental Education in Early Childhood Education through the development of Thematic withpractical activities and teaching, so that the child being aware of environmental problems in theirneighborhood and awoke the interest in environmental issues. This project began with a literaturesearch and exploratory conducted between March and May 2010 to verify the feasibility of thisproposal. The research was conducted in a School of Early Childhood Education at the periphery ofthe city of Cachoeira do Sul, south of Brazil. Were considered the opinion of 80 students agedbetween one and five years. Five Thematic containing educational learning activities and practicesconcerning the environment such as <b>plants,</b> animals, health, <b>hygiene,</b> water, care for theenvironment and where they live were worked. The proposal proved to be positive because thestudents showed much interest in the topic. They participated actively in all the activities withenthusiasm and dedication. With this study it is ended that the Environmental Education not only itcan, but it should be developed with children in this age group, because, besides the same ones theybe avid for new knowledge, the students of the school Pré presented the capacity to suggest of newactivities, besides to discuss and to point possible solutions for the presented environmentalproblems. A Educação Infantil é a primeira etapa da educação escolar. Este artigo teve como objetivo principal inserir a Educação Ambiental na realidade da Educação Infantil, através do desenvolvimento de temáticas com atividades práticas e didáticas, a fim de que a criança tomasse conhecimento dos problemas ambientais de seu bairro e despertasse o seu interesse para as questões ambientais. Para tanto foi realizada uma pesquisa bibliográfica e exploratória desenvolvida entre março a maio de  2010, para verificar a viabilidade desta proposta. A pesquisa foi desenvolvida em uma Escola de Educação Infantil na periferia do município de Cachoeira do Sul. O público alvo foi 80 alunos com idades entre 1 e 5 anos. Foram desenvolvidas cinco temáticas contendo atividades didáticas e práticas referentes ao Meio Ambiente como: plantas, animais, saúde, hábitos de higiene, água, cuidados com o meio ambiente e com o local onde vivem. A proposta mostrou-se ser positiva, pois os alunos demonstraram muito interesse pelos temas abordados. Eles participaram ativamente de todas as atividades desenvolvidas com entusiasmo e dedicação.
