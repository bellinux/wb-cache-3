The number of bases for charter aircraft was reduced, cutting <b>personnel</b> <b>costs.</b> Eleven of the airline's twenty-four aircraft were sold. A key part of this plan was not allowing the aircraft to remain idle during the daytime, thereby maximizing revenue. The number of employees were reduced from 720 to 480.

25|$|Archaeology has {{discovered}} that the famous circular military harbour at Carthage, the Cothon, received a significant buildup during or after this war. Though shielded from external sight, it could house and quickly deploy about 200 triremes. This appears a surprising development as, after the war, one {{of the terms of}} surrender restricted the Carthaginian fleet to only ten triremes. One possible explanation: as has been pointed out for other Phoenician cities, privateers with warships played a significant role besides trade, even when the Roman Empire was fully established and officially controlled all coasts. In this case {{it is not clear whether}} the treaty included private warships. The only reference to Carthaginian privateers comes from the First Punic War: one such privateer, Hanno the Rhodian, owned a quinquereme (faster than the serial production models that the Romans had copied), manned with about 500 men and then among the heaviest warships in use. Later pirates in Roman waters are all reported with much smaller vessels, which could outrun naval vessels, but operated with lower <b>personnel</b> <b>costs.</b> Thus piracy was probably highly developed in Carthage and the state did not have a monopoly of military forces. Pirates probably played an important role in capturing slaves, one of the most profitable trade-goods, but merchant ships with tradeable goods and a crew were also their targets. No surviving source reports the fate of Carthaginian privateers in the periods between and after the Punic Wars.|$|E

Statistical {{analysis}} {{reveals that}} a coverage of approximately ten times {{is required to}} get coverage of both alleles in 90% human genome from 25 base pair reads with shotgun sequencing.

40|$|The {{personnel}} {{planning process}} in any organization aims {{to ensure that}} the organization can offer a desired service level to their customers at a minimal <b>personnel</b> <b>cost</b> and maximal <b>personnel</b> satisfaction. This process consists of three hierarchical phases characterized by differing levels of decision freedom and uncertainty about the future personnel demand and availability. In this respect, the personnel planner faces a large and medium level of uncertainty and decision freedom in the strategic staffing phase and the tactical scheduling phase, respectively. In these phases, the personnel planner manages the uncertainty by making assumptions and predictions about the future. Based on these assumptions and predictions, the personnel planner makes decisions about the number of employees to be hired and assigned to work during specific points in time. These decisions constrain the decision freedom in the operational allocation phase, in which the personnel planner obtains the most recent information on the actual personnel demand and availability. This information may differ from the assumptions and predictions, and affect the service level and <b>personnel</b> <b>cost</b> and satisfaction. As such, the moment the personnel planner faces the lowest level of uncertainty, (s) he also has the lowest level of decision freedom. In this respect, this dissertation aims to propose strategies to anticipate and deal with unexpected divergences between the previously established assumptions and predictions, and the actual personnel demand and availability...|$|R
