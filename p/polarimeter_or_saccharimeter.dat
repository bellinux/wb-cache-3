40|$|In-fiber <b>polarimeters</b> <b>or</b> {{polarization}} mode interferometers (PMIs) are fabricated by cascading two CO 2 -laser-induced in-fiber polarizers along a {{piece of}} hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber. Since the two interfering beams are the orthogonal polarizations of the fundamental mode, which are tightly confined to the core and have much lower loss than higher order modes, the PMIs can have either short (e. g., a few millimeters) or long (tens of meters or longer) device length without significantly changing the fringe contrast and hence provide design flexibility for applications required different device lengths. As examples of potential applications, the PMIs have been experimentally demonstrated for wavelength-dependent group birefringence measurement; and for strain, temperature and torsion sensors. The PMI sensors are quite sensitive to strain but relatively insensitive to temperature as compared with fiber Bragg grating sensors. The PMIs function as good directional torsion sensors that can determine the rate and direction of twist at the same time.

40|$|The energy range above 60 keV is {{important}} for the study of many open problems in high energy astrophysics such as the role of Inverse Compton with respect to synchrotron or thermal processes in GRBs, non thermal mechanisms in SNR, the study of the high energy cut-offs in AGN spectra, and the detection of nuclear and annihilation lines. Recently the development of high energy Laue lenses with broad energy bandpasses from 60 to 600 keV have been proposed for a Hard X ray focusing Telescope (HAXTEL) in order to study the X-ray continuum of celestial sources. The required focal plane detector should have high detection efficiency over the entire operative range, a spatial resolution of about 1 mm, an energy resolution of a few keV at 500 keV and a sensitivity to linear polarization. We describe a possible configuration of the focal plane detector based on several CdTe/CZT pixelated layers stacked together to achieve the required detection efficiency at high energy. Each layer can operate both as a separate position sensitive detector and <b>polarimeter</b> <b>or</b> work with other layers to increase the overall photopeak efficiency. Each layer has a hexagonal shape in order to minimize the detector surface required to cover the lens field of view. The pixels would have the same geometry so as to provide the best coupling with the lens point spread function and to increase the symmetry for polarimetric studies.

40|$|The small asymmetries {{measured}} at G{sub {gamma}} = 7. 5 during the RHIC spin commissioning were a serious concern. In earlier runs, asymmetries double {{those from the}} spin commissioning time (September 2000) had sometimes been observed, {{and there had been}} few changes to the AGS <b>polarimeter</b> hardware <b>or</b> operating conditions. Recently, the observed changes in the asymmetries {{measured at}} G{sub {gamma}} = 7 : 5 have been ascribed to contamination of the carbon target asymmetry with that from the fishline target and vice-versa, because of the sizeable beam spot size compared to the separation of the targets. This note addresses this hypothesis using the observed asymmetries. This problem could directly impact spin physics at RHIC...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{polarimetry}} {{promises to}} deliver unique {{information about the}} geometry of the inner accretion flow of astrophysical black holes {{and the nature of}} matter and electromagnetism in and around neutron stars. In this paper, we discuss the possibility to use Stokes parameters – a commonly used tool in radio, infrared, and optical polarimetry – to analyze the data from X-ray polarimeters such as scattering polarimeters and photoelectric effect polarimeters, which measure the linear polarization of the detected X-rays. Based on the azimuthal scattering angle (in the case of a scattering <b>polarimeter)</b> <b>or</b> the azimuthal component of the angle of the electron ejection (in the case of a photoelectric effect polarimeter), the Stokes parameters can be calculated for each event recorded in the detector. Owing to the additive nature of Stokes parameters, the analysis reduces to adding the Stokes parameters of the individual events and subtracting the Stokes parameters characterizing the background (if present). The main strength of this kind of analysis is that the errors on the Stokes parameters can be computed easily and are well behaved – in stark contrast of the errors on the polarization fraction and polarization direction. Another advantage of the Stokes parameter method is that it avoids the information loss associated with azimuthally binning the data. We demonstrate the power of the Stokes analysis by deriving several useful formulae, e. g. the expected error on the polarization fraction and polarization direction for a detection of NS signal and NBG background events, the optimal observation times of the signal and background regions in the presence of non-negligible background contamination of the signal, and the minimum detectable polarization (MDP) that can be achieved when following this prescription...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in retrieving profiles of aerosol effective radius, total number concentration, and {{complex refractive index}} from lidar measurements of extinction and backscatter at several wavelengths. The combination of three backscatter channels plus two extinction channels (3 β  +  2 α) is particularly important since it {{is believed to be}} the minimum configuration necessary for the retrieval of aerosol microphysical properties and because the technological readiness of lidar systems permits this configuration on both an airborne and future spaceborne instrument. The second-generation NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL- 2) has been making 3 β  +  2 α measurements since 2012. The planned NASA Aerosol/Clouds/Ecosystems (ACE) satellite mission also recommends the 3 β  +  2 α combination. Here we develop a deeper understanding of the information content and sensitivities of the 3 β  +  2 α system in terms of aerosol microphysical parameters of interest. We use a retrieval-free methodology to determine the basic sensitivities of the measurements independent of retrieval assumptions and constraints. We calculate information content and uncertainty metrics using tools borrowed from the optimal estimation methodology based on Bayes' theorem, using a simplified forward model look-up table, with no explicit inversion. The forward model is simplified to represent spherical particles, monomodal log-normal size distributions, and wavelength-independent refractive indices. Since we only use the forward model with no retrieval, the given simplified aerosol scenario is applicable as a best case for all existing retrievals in the absence of additional constraints. Retrieval-dependent errors due to mismatch between retrieval assumptions and true atmospheric aerosols are not included in this sensitivity study, and neither are retrieval errors that may be introduced in the inversion process. The choice of a simplified model adds clarity to the understanding of the uncertainties in such retrievals, since it allows for separately assessing the sensitivities and uncertainties of the measurements alone that cannot be corrected by any potential or theoretical improvements to retrieval methodology but must instead be addressed by adding information content. The sensitivity metrics allow for identifying (1)  information content of the measurements vs. a priori information; (2)  error bars on the retrieved parameters; and (3)  potential sources of cross-talk or "compensating" errors wherein different retrieval parameters are not independently captured by the measurements. The results suggest that the 3 β  +  2 α measurement system is underdetermined with respect to the full suite of microphysical parameters considered in this study and that additional information is required, in the form of additional coincident measurements (e. g., sun-photometer <b>or</b> <b>polarimeter)</b> <b>or</b> a priori retrieval constraints. A specific recommendation is given for addressing cross-talk between effective radius and total number concentration...|$|R
