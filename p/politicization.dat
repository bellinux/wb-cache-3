5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later <b>politicization</b> of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|Lyons took on {{a number}} of causes in the 1910s and 1920s. He worked with Bishop David Greer and Rabbi Stephen Wise to expose {{conditions}} in New York's tenements, dissociated himself from Tammany Hall candidates, tried to secure a re-trial for Leo Frank, and opposed some of the views of Samuel Gompers. In 1912, Lyons was {{a founding member of the}} Eastern Council of Reform Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis from the Eastern United States that was created despite opposition from the Central Conference of Reform Rabbis. In 1919 he withdrew from the Brooklyn Victory Celebration Committee (celebrating the Allied victory in World War I) and asked that his contributed funds be donated instead to the Red Cross; many committee members eventually resigned in protest over the overt <b>politicization</b> of the event, and its control by William Randolph Hearst.|$|E

25|$|Two researchers, raising (1995) 'serious {{doubt whether}} sexual {{orientation}} {{is a valid}} concept at all,' warned against increasing <b>politicization</b> of this area.|$|E
25|$|<b>Politicization</b> of the German academia {{under the}} National Socialist regime had driven many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians out of Germany {{as early as}} 1933. Those of Jewish {{heritage}} who did not leave were quickly purged from German institutions, further thinning the ranks of academia. The <b>politicization</b> of the universities, along with the demands for manpower by the German armed forces (many scientists and technical personnel were conscripted, despite possessing useful skills), substantially {{reduced the number of}} able German physicists.|$|E
25|$|The <b>politicization</b> of the {{education}} system essentially replaced academic tradition and excellence with ideological adherence and trappings, such as membership in National Socialist organizations, such as the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP, National Socialist German Workers Party), the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League), and the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (NSDStB, National Socialist German Student League). The <b>politicization</b> can be illustrated with the conflict which evolved when a replacement for Arnold Sommerfeld was sought in view of his emeritus status. The conflict involved one of the prominent Uranverein participants, Werner Heisenberg.|$|E
25|$|In this period, he also {{published}} his first poetry collection, Fifty Years and Other Poems (1917). It showed his increasing <b>politicization</b> and {{adoption of the}} black vernacular influences that characterize his later work.|$|E
25|$|Some students' {{unions are}} politicized bodies, and often {{serve as a}} {{training}} ground for aspiring politicians. Students' unions generally have similar aims irrespective {{of the extent of}} <b>politicization,</b> usually focusing on providing students with facilities, support, and services.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 2008, Rove was subpoenaed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers {{to testify}} on the <b>politicization</b> of the Department of Justice. However, on July 10, Rove refused to {{acknowledge}} his congressional subpoena citing executive privilege as his reason.|$|E
25|$|Two {{factors which}} had {{deleterious}} {{effects on the}} nuclear weapon project were the <b>politicization</b> of the education system under National Socialism {{and the rise of}} the Deutsche Physik movement, which was anti-Semitic and had a bias against theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{statements}} of the President there were also allegations of excessive <b>politicization</b> of the judiciary system, and the stigmatization {{of the fact that}} young magistrates, who just came into service, were immediately destined for the Sicilian prosecutor to carry out mafia proceedings.|$|E
25|$|None {{of these}} measures, however, {{were able to}} make the Commission as {{effective}} as desired, mainly {{because of the presence of}} human rights violators and the <b>politicization</b> of the body. During the following years until its extinction, the UNCHR became increasingly discredited among activists and governments alike.|$|E
25|$|While the IPCC process {{tries to}} find and orchestrate the {{findings}} of global (climate) change research to shape a worldwide consensus on the matter it has been itself been object of a strong <b>politicization.</b> Anthropogenic climate change evolved from a mere science issue to a top global policy topic.|$|E
25|$|Increasing <b>politicization</b> of cricket, {{including}} selectorial policy, {{along with}} the declining situation in Zimbabwe itself resulted in a mass exodus of players from Zimbabwe, with Peacock joining the exodus. Peacock played a single List-A game for the Hampshire Cricket Board in England, during the 1st Round of the 2003 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy which was played in 2002.|$|E
25|$|He came to {{prominence}} {{in the world of}} international politics when he was nominated, on 25 April 2000, by then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan as an observer at the Pan Am Flight 103 (Lockerbie) bombing trial. His critical reports on the trial and appeal proceedings contributed to a global debate on the <b>politicization</b> of international criminal justice.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1942, as {{president}} of the DPG, Ramsauer, on Felix Klein's initiative and with the support of Ludwig Prandtl, submitted a petition to Reich Minister Bernhard Rust, at the Reichserziehungsministerium (Reich Education Ministry). The petition, a letter and six attachments, addressed the atrocious state of physics instruction in Germany, which Ramsauer concluded was the result of <b>politicization</b> of education.|$|E
25|$|Members of the Uranverein, Wolfgang Finkelnburg, Werner Heisenberg, Carl Ramsauer, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker were {{effective}} in countering the <b>politicization</b> of academia and effectively {{putting an end}} to the influence of the Deutsche Physik movement. However, in order to do this they were, as were many scientists, caught between autonomy and accommodation. Essentially, they would have to legitimize the National Socialist system by compromise and collaboration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Politicization</b> of the {{academic}} community, combined {{with the impact of}} the Deutsche Physik movement and other policies, such as drafting physicists to fight in the war (e.g., Paul O. Müller, a member of the Uranverein who died on the Russian front), had the net effect of bringing about a missing generation of physicists. At the close of the war, physicists born between 1915 and 1925 were almost nonexistent.|$|E
25|$|Reaction to U.S. {{involvement}} was mixed. It was well received by physicians and civilians at the scene. In {{stark contrast to}} this support, IRNA, the state-controlled radio in Iran, accused the United States of illegal interference in internal matters. Khatami, while not criticizing U.S. aid, was upset about the <b>politicization</b> of it. Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari supported U.S. assistance but not Israeli help, as he considered it an illegitimate government.|$|E

He is also the {{recipient}} of numerous other literary awards. My Name Is Red won the 2002 Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger, 2002 Premio Grinzane Cavour and 2003 International Dublin Literary Award.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, {{historian}} John Regan, in his paper, The Bandon Valley Massacre Revisited, {{argued that}} the killings might be best understood in light of purported IRA fears that the British were planning a reoccupation of the south of Ireland and was a preemptive move against people {{believed to have been}} informers. Regan {{argued that the}} selective use of evidence by Peter Hart to emphasize the sectarian dimension to the killings highlights a wider problem in the <b>politicization</b> of Irish history.|$|E
25|$|Miller was {{promoted}} from President to Chancellor in March 1969 {{in the midst}} of student and faculty protests. The post remained vacant for sixteen months until Robert Strotz, a member of the Economics faculty since 1947 and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences since 1966, was unanimously elected by the trustees to be President in July 1970. While Strotz's appointment was opposed by the Daily Northwestern and the Associated Student Government president owing to his positions opposing the closure of campus and <b>politicization</b> of university classes, he was supported by the faculty.|$|E
25|$|The <b>politicization</b> {{of science}} {{in the sense of}} a {{manipulation}} of science for political gains is a part of the political process. It is part of the controversies about intelligent design (compare the Wedge strategy) or Merchants of Doubt, scientists that are under suspicion to willingly obscure findings. e.g. about issues like tobacco smoke, ozone depletion, global warming or acid rain. However, e.g. in case of the Ozone depletion, global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in a climate of high uncertainty and against strong resistance while in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.|$|E
25|$|Casualty {{rates were}} the most vivid sign of this disaster. Already, {{by the end of}} 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained {{recruits}} had to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the <b>politicization</b> of the troops in 1917.|$|E
25|$|The term heterophobia is {{confusing}} {{for some people}} for several reasons. On the one hand, some {{look at it as}} just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and <b>politicization</b> of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Barber (born in New Zealand in 1950) is an artist, writer, curator, and {{educator}} {{based in}} Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he teaches at NSCAD University. His artwork {{has been shown}} at the Paris Biennale, the Sydney Biennial, the New Museum of Contemporary Art, the Walter Phillips Gallery, London Regional Gallery, and ArtSpace Auckland. Barber {{is the editor of}} Essays on Performance and Cultural <b>Politicization</b> and of Conceptual Art: the NSCAD Connection 1967–1973. He is co-editor, with Serge Guilbaut and John O'Brian of Voices of Fire: Art Rage, Power, and the State. His critical essays have appeared in numerous anthologies, journals and magazines. His art practice is documented in the publication Reading Rooms. He {{is best known for his}} early performance work, his Reading Rooms, Squat Projects and his writing and theory on Littoral Art.|$|E
25|$|He {{argues that}} the {{availability}} of federal research funds distorts “the natural market for scientific research” by inducing scientists to eschew pursuit of radical lines of potentially promising research that might not appeal to politicians and bureaucrats who hold influence over the allocation of grant monies. “Federal funding of medical research guarantees the <b>politicization</b> of decisions about what types of research for what diseases will be funded. Scarce tax resources are allocated according to who has the most effective lobby, {{rather than on the}} basis of need or even likely success. Federal funding also causes researchers to neglect potential treatments and cures that do not qualify for federal funds.” In his view, eliminating government sources of funds for medical research would probably improve the quality of research being performed.|$|E
25|$|The {{challenges}} include poor service quality, {{in particular}} intermittent water supply that persists despite {{the availability of}} relatively abundant water resources; the slow implementation of the water reform; the separation of responsibilities between various entities such as the Council for Development and Reconstruction, which are de facto in charge of investment, and the Regional Water Establishments, which {{are in charge of}} operation and maintenance; limited institutional capacity in the public sector, and in particular the Regional Water Establishments; <b>politicization</b> of decision-making; the absence of an autonomous regulatory agency; poor information about water resources, sector performance and assets; a very low share of metering and the absence of volumetric water tariffs; a high level of water distribution losses; limited cost recovery for water supply; and no cost recovery for sewerage and wastewater treatment. These challenges persist more than two decades {{after the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E

500|$|The Gendarmerie of Haiti ( [...] ), {{also known}} as the Haitian Constabulary, was a collaborationist {{gendarmerie}} raised by the United States during its occupation of Haiti in the early 20th century. Established in late 1915, the gendarmerie was operational from 1916 until 1928, during which time it was Haiti's only military force, earning a reputation for active interference in civilian government that may have {{set the stage for the}} future <b>politicization</b> of Haiti's armed forces.|$|E
500|$|Notwithstanding the uncompromising {{nature of}} his politics, Bush in his {{writings}} tended to express his views in restrained terms, [...] "much more like a reforming patrician Whig than a proletarian revolutionary" [...] according to Michael Oliver in a 1995 Gramophone article. [...] Bush's Grove Music Online biographers also [...] observe that in the <b>politicization</b> of his music, his folk idioms {{have more in common}} with the English traditions of Ralph Vaughan Williams than with the continental radicalism of [...] Kurt Weill.|$|E
500|$|Abu-Jamal {{was sentenced}} to death by the {{unanimous}} decision of the jury. Amnesty International has objected to the introduction by the prosecution of statements from his youth at the time of sentencing. It also protested the <b>politicization</b> of the trial, noting a documented recent history in Philadelphia of police abuse and corruption including fabricated evidence and use of excessive force. Amnesty Int'l concluded [...] "that the proceedings used to convict and sentence Mumia Abu-Jamal to death were in violation of minimum international standards that govern fair trial procedures {{and the use of the}} death penalty." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, {{several members of}} the United States Congress became {{involved}} in the ABC issue. In a 1998 hearing on cancer research, U.S. Representative Tom Coburn accused the National Cancer Institute of misleading the public by selectively releasing data. In 1999, shortly after the House debated FDA approval of the abortion drug mifepristone, U.S. Representative Dave Weldon wrote a [...] "Dear Colleague" [...] letter, enclosing an article from John Kindley. In it, Weldon expressed concern that the majority of studies indicated a possible ABC link and that <b>politicization</b> was [...] "preventing vital information from being given to women." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{domestic}} {{release of}} Not One Less {{was accompanied by}} a Chinese government campaign aimed at promoting the film and cracking down on piracy. Internationally, the film was generally well-received, but it also attracted criticism for its ostensibly political message; foreign critics are divided on whether the film should be read as praising or criticizing the Chinese government. When the film was excluded from the 1999Cannes Film Festival's competition section, Zhang withdrew it and another film from the festival, and published a letter rebuking Cannes for <b>politicization</b> of and [...] "discrimination" [...] against Chinese cinema. The film {{went on to win the}} Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion and several other awards, and Zhang won the award for best director at the Golden Rooster Awards.|$|E
500|$|Biographer John Watson {{notes that}} Innis's work was profoundly {{political}} while McLuhan's was not. He writes that [...] "the mechanization of knowledge, not the relative sensual bias of media, {{is the key}} to Innis's work. This also underlies the <b>politicization</b> of Innis's position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan." [...] Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. [...] "For Innis, the yellow press of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command." [...] Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the [...] "dialectic of power and knowledge" [...] in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan's.|$|E
500|$|Chávez {{strengthened}} {{his support}} among the poor {{with a series of}} social initiatives known as the Bolivarian Missions, and created a network of grass-roots workers' councils, the Bolivarian Circles. Nevertheless, by early 2002, Venezuela was [...] "embroiled... in a severe political crisis" [...] as Chávez sought to bring more of the country's vast oil wealth under state control. Although the state-owned radio and television stations remained staunch advocates of Chávez's stated policies—to redistribute the nation's wealth to the poorest—the private media was more hostile. The crisis reached a head when Chávez attempted to remove the management of the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), provoking a showdown. [...] "Oil managers, business leaders, and large segments of organized labor" [...] called a general strike. The strike was backed by {{a large segment of the}} population, [...] "particularly the country's increasingly impoverished middle class" [...] and army officers upset at the increasing <b>politicization</b> of the military.|$|E
