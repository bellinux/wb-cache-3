40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} {{a method for}} predicting thermal behavior in ICs. This information will be especially helpful for the PMICs (power-management ICs) used in automotive applications and other high-temperature environments. After characterizing thermal behavior, we formulate a mathematical model that simulates transient temperatures within the chip. We introduce physical laws governing thermal behavior and evaluate them {{for use in the}} thermal-body models defined for an IC. Based on that analysis, we then propose an <b>equivalent</b> <b>passive</b> RC <b>network</b> for modeling an IC's transient thermal behavior. To illustrate an application for the proposed analysis, we devise an RC network for an LED driver (the MAX 16828). We conclude with insights on the use and usefulness of this approach, and suggest ways to speed the creation of the RC models. This article was also featured in Maxim's Engineering Journal, vol. 68 (PDF, 2. 72 MB). A similar article appeared in EDN Magazine in January 2010. Designers often need to know the thermal behavior of an IC, especially for the PMICs (powermanagement ICs) used in automotive applications. When a particular IC operates at a high temperature (such as + 125 °C), does it trigger the thermal-shutdown circuitry or exceed the product's safe operating temperature? Without a definite method of analysis, we cannot offer a reliable answer. Therefore, whe...|$|R
