50|$|Assuming {{no option}} is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> itself i.e. the {{relation}} is irreflexive, a preference relation with a loop is not transitive. For if it is, each {{option in the}} loop is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> each option, including itself. This can be illustrated for this example of a loop among A, B, and C. Assume the relation is transitive. Then, since A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> B and B is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C, also A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C. But then, since C is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> A, also A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> A.|$|R

5|$|Beat 'em ups {{are related}} to—but {{distinct}} from—fighting games, {{which are based}} around one-on-one matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a game will feature both kinds of gameplay.|$|E

5000|$|If A is {{directly}} revealed <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> B, and B {{is directly}} revealed <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C, then we say A is indirectly revealed <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C. It {{is possible for}} A and C to be (directly or indirectly) revealed preferable to {{each other at the}} same time, creating a [...] "loop". In mathematical terminology, this says that transitivity is violated.|$|R

5|$|Children with high-functioning autism {{suffer from}} more intense and {{frequent}} loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief {{that children with}} autism <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E
