5|$|The {{most common}} fossils of megalodon are its teeth. Diagnostic {{characteristics}} include a triangular shape, robust structure, large size, fine serrations, {{a lack of}} lateral denticles, and a visible V-shaped neck (where the root meets the crown). The tooth met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. The tooth was anchored by connective tissue fibers, and the roughness of the base may have added to mechanical strength. The lingual side of the tooth, the part facing the tongue, was convex; and the labial side, {{the other side of}} the tooth, was slightly convex or flat. The anterior teeth were almost perpendicular to the jaw and symmetrical, whereas the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> were slanted and asymmetrical.|$|E

25|$|Mixed {{dentition}} starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years. Permanent teeth in the maxilla erupt in a different order from permanent teeth on the mandible. Maxillary teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars. If any primary teeth are lost before permanent teeth are ready to replace them, some <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> may drift forward and cause space to {{be lost in the}} mouth. This may cause crowding and/or misplacement once the permanent teeth erupt, which is usually referred to as malocclusion. Orthodontics may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight set of teeth.|$|E
25|$|Many {{publications}} list tooth wear as {{a consequence}} of bruxism, but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism. Tooth wear caused by tooth-to-tooth contact is termed attrition. This is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism, and affects the occlusal surface (the biting surface) of the teeth. The exact location and pattern of attrition depends on how the bruxism occurs, e.g., when the canines and incisors of the opposing arches are moved against each other laterally, by the action of the medial pterygoid muscles, this can lead to the wearing down of the incisal edges of the teeth. To grind the front teeth, most people need to posture their mandible forwards, unless there is an existing edge to edge, class III incisal relationship. People with bruxism may also grind their <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> (back teeth), which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface. Once tooth wear progresses through the enamel layer, the exposed dentin layer is softer and more vulnerable to wear and tooth decay. If enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed, the tooth will effectively be weakened, and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in bruxism.|$|E

500|$|The {{nursehound}} attains {{a length}} of , though most measure less than [...] This shark has a broad, rounded head and a stout body that tapers towards the tail. The eyes are oval in shape, with a thick fold of skin on the lower rim but no nictitating membrane. Unlike in the small-spotted catshark, the large flaps of skin beside the nares do not reach the mouth. In the upper jaw, there are 2227 tooth rows on either side and 02 teeth at the symphysis (center); in the lower jaw, there are 1821 tooth rows on either side and 24 teeth at the symphysis. The teeth are Y-shaped and smooth-edged; the anterior teeth have a single central cusp, while the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> have an additional pair of lateral cusplets. Towards {{the rear of the}} jaws, the teeth become progressively smaller and more angled, with proportionately larger lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the last two over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E
500|$|The {{moderately}} {{large and}} rounded pectoral fins are positioned fairly {{close to the}} pelvic fins.

500|$|A {{detailed}} {{computer analysis}} of the biomechanics of Stegosauruss feeding behavior was performed in 2010, using two different three-dimensional models of Stegosaurus teeth given realistic physics and properties. Bite force was also calculated using these models and the known skull proportions of the animal, as well as simulated tree branches of different size and hardness. The resultant bite forces calculated for Stegosaurus were 140.1 Newton (N), 183.7 N, and 275 N (for anterior, middle and <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> respectively), which means its bite force was {{less than half that}} of a Labrador Retriever. Stegosaurus could have easily bitten through smaller green branches, but would have had difficulty with anything over 12mm in diameter. Stegosaurus, therefore, probably browsed primarily among smaller twigs and foliage, and would have been unable to handle larger plant parts unless the animal was capable of biting much more efficiently than predicted in this study. However, A study published on May 20, 2016 by Stephen Lautenschlager et al. indicates Stegosaurus' bite strength was stronger than previously believed. Comparisons were made between it (represented by a specimen known as [...] "Sophie" [...] from the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum) and two other herbivorous dinosaurs; Erlikosaurus and Plateosaurus to determine if all three had similar bite forces and similar niches. Based on the results of the study, it was revealed that Stegosaurus had a bite similar in strength to that of modern herbivorous mammals, in particular, cattle and sheep. Based on this data, it is likely Stegosaurus also ate woodier, tougher plants such as cycads, perhaps even acting as a means of spreading cycad seeds. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.|$|E

2500|$|Physiologically, teeth {{provide for}} greater chewing ability. [...] They {{allow us to}} {{masticate}} food thoroughly, increasing the surface area necessary {{to allow for the}} enzymes present in the saliva, {{as well as in the}} stomach and intestines, to digest our food. [...] Chewing also allows food to be prepared into small boli that are more readily swallowed than haphazard chunks of considerable size. [...] For those who are even partially endentulous, it may become extremely difficult to chew food efficiently enough to swallow comfortably, although this is entirely dependent upon which teeth are lost. [...] When an individual loses enough <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> to make it difficult to chew, he or she may need to cut their food into very small pieces and learn how to make use of their anterior teeth to chew. [...] If enough <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> are missing, this will not only affect their chewing abilities, but also their occlusion; <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> in a mutually protected occlusion, help to protect the anterior teeth and the vertical dimension of occlusion and, when missing, the anterior teeth begin to bear a greater amount of force for which they are structurally prepared. [...] Thus, loss of <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> will cause the anterior teeth to splay. [...] This can be prevented by obtaining dental prostheses, such as removable partial dentures, bridges or implant-supported crowns. [...] In addition to reestablishing a protected occlusion, these prostheses can greatly improve one's chewing abilities.|$|E
2500|$|Another partial splint is the {{nociceptive}} trigeminal inhibition tension {{suppression system}} (NTI-TSS) dental guard. This splint snaps onto {{the upper front}} teeth only. It is theorized to prevent tissue damages primarily by reducing the bite force from attempts to close the jaw normally into a forward twisting of the lower front teeth. The intent is for the brain to interpret the nerve sensations as undesirable, automatically and subconsciously reducing clenching force. However, there may be potential for the NTI-TSS device {{to act as a}} Dahl appliance, holding the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> out of occlusion and leading to their over-eruption, deranging the occlusion (i.e. [...] it may cause the teeth to move position). Hence, ongoing follow-ups are recommended.|$|E
30|$|The {{association}} between the need for orthodontic treatment (DAI) and the child’s satisfaction with chewing was not significant, suggesting that malocclusion has no direct impact on the perception of masticatory function, as was as also observed by Tessarollo et al.
