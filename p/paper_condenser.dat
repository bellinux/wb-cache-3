50|$|The Sangamo Electric Company was {{organized}} on 11 January 1899 in Springfield, Illinois, by Jacob Bunn, Jr., Henry Bunn, Robert Carr Lanphier, and inventor Ludwig Gutmann. The corporation grew institutionally as {{a division of}} the Illinois Watch Company, and developed global presence in the electric metering industry and defense industries. By the middle of the 1920s, Sangamo Electric had manufactured more than 5,000,000 electric meters. Sangamo made many important contributions to national defense during World War II, and developed the mercury watthour meter (1905), the sulphur-impregnated cylindrical <b>paper</b> <b>condenser</b> meter, different types of magnetos, amperehour meters, and the Delco amperehour meter for the first electric starters used in automobiles. The company eventually had a presence in nearly every major country of the world by 1939. Sangamo Electric Company made many major contributions to the aircraft components industries of the United States, and Henry Bunn, the son of Jacob Bunn, Sr., was an aviator and entrepreneur whose vision for Sangamo Electric was crucial to the entrance of the company into the aviation industry. Furthermore, Sangamo Electric Company acquired Capitol Aviation, Inc., a general fixed-base operator (FBO) with offices throughout the United States.|$|E
40|$|High voltage (HV) {{transients}} {{in electrical}} power systems are {{mainly caused by}} lightning strikes and switching operations.   The high voltage transient from its point of origin can propagate in either direction in the electrical power transmission line, and if its magnitude would be below the Basic Insulation Level (BIL) of the equipment for impulse voltage, it can reach the terminals of the equipment without being dissipated by surge arresters.   The dielectric properties of a particular insulation at the instant of interaction with a high voltage transient would determine {{the level of the}} degradation of the electrical insulation caused by the high voltage transient. This thesis suggests on-line diagnostic techniques for monitoring the oil-impregnated <b>paper</b> <b>condenser</b> bushings by utilizing the naturally occurring HV transients in electrical power systems. The aim of the first experiment was to investigate the partial discharge (PD) characteristics of the PD defects which are likely to be found in oil-imregnated <b>paper</b> <b>condenser</b> bushings. In order to understand the condition at which the HV impulses would cause the change in phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns, four more experiments were performed. The second experiment was set {{in such a way that}} the effect of HV impulses alone could be investigated. On the other hand, the third experiment was set to examine the effect of PD-ageing at elevated AC voltage. The fourth experiment aimed in investigating the effect of combined PD-ageing at elevated AC voltage and the HV impulses. In order to investigate how different electrical stresses affect the dielectric properties of the oil-impreganted paper insulation, the fifth experiment about the dielectric spectroscopy (DS) in frequency domain was performed. The measurement results presented in this thesis show that high voltage impulses can have a large impact on the behavior of PRPD patterns if the test sample is aged by partial discharges, but a smaller impact when the test sample is unaged. The measurement results also show that the degradation of the oil-impregnated papers is much faster when the oil-impregnated papers are suffered from the combination of the HV impulses and the PD activity at elevated AC voltage than when they are suffered from the PD activity at elevated AC voltage alone.

The authors claim that given a specific experiment, {{in which the}} outcome of a measurement is known before the measurement takes place, there must exist something in the real world, an [...] "element of reality", that determines the measurement outcome. They postulate that these elements of reality are local, in the sense that each belongs to a certain point in spacetime. Each element may only be influenced by events which are located in the backward light cone of its point in spacetime (i.e., the past). These claims are founded on assumptions about nature that constitute what is now known as local realism.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{revolves}} around two argument points. As first, we have observed a certain {{parallel between the}} reliability of systems and the progressive disorder of thermodynamical systems; and we import the notion of reversibility/irreversibility into the reliability domain. As second, we note that the reliability theory is a very active area of research which although has not yet become a mature discipline. This {{is due to the}} majority of researchers who adopt the inductive logic instead of the deductive logic typical of mature scientific sectors. The deductive approach was inaugurated by Gnedenko in the reliability domain. We mean to continue Gnedenko’s work and we use the Boltzmann-like entropy to pursue this objective.

40|$|Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) produce state-of-art {{performance}} on many machine learning tasks but their demand on resources {{in terms of}} memory and computational power are often high. Therefore, {{there is a great}} interest in optimizing the computations performed with these models especially when considering development of specialized low-power hardware for deep networks. One way of reducing the computational needs is to limit the numerical precision of the network weights and biases, and this will be addressed for the case of RNNs. We present results from the use of different stochastic and deterministic reduced precision training methods applied to two major RNN types, which are then tested on three datasets. The results show that the stochastic and deterministic ternarization, pow 2 - ternarization, and exponential quantization methods gave rise to low-precision RNNs that produce similar and even higher accuracy on certain datasets, therefore providing a path towards training more efficient implementations of RNNs in specialized hardware.

30|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the ways in}} which the appraisal framework can be applied quantitatively with a corpus of institutional texts. Several authors have approached the subject of conducting quantitative appraisal analysis (e.g. Aloy and Taboada 2017, Fuoli 2015, Macken-Horarik and Isaac 2014, Carretero and Taboada 2014, Kaltenbacher 2006), and this <b>paper</b> <b>condenses</b> those ideas that are the most suitable for analysing institutional discourse and connects them to my own insights in order to model an operational hands-on analysis based on the scrutiny of a corpus of migration documents of the European Union (EU). With the help of the appraisal framework, it is possible to unearth the attitudes integrated into the EU’s migration texts that demonstrate both continuity and change in the ways the EU views migration. As a conclusion, I will present a checklist of the main factors that are needed for a systematic analysis of evaluation that takes into account the specific socio-cultural context of EU migration documents. These documents involve a mixed set of, sometimes conflicting, ideologies, which complicates the appraisal coding process as deciphering all the nuances in the evaluations requires customised annotation practices.|$|R

Drum brake groan is often very intense and can cause large numbers of customer complaints. During a groan noise event, vehicle structure and suspension components are excited by the brake system and result in a violent event that can be heard and felt during brake application. This <b>paper</b> <b>condenses</b> experimental studies on a low frequency drum brake groan problem that has caused high warranty costs.

A strategy to determine the root causes was planned and implemented systematically to eliminate the secondary and tertiary effects of brake groan problems. In order to ge to the root causes, vibration and groan measurements were executed and interpreted according to TVA and FMEA charts.
