40|$|Tensions between China and Japan over disputed {{maritime}} {{boundaries in}} the East China Sea have dramatically escalated {{in the past}} decade. This thesis examines how disputed delimitation in the East China Sea has impacted the development, interests, and policies of China s <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>Army</b> Navy. The key questions addressed in this paper are; how is China s interpretation of delimitation in the East China Sea unique? Why is maritime delimitation, particularly in the East China Sea, {{so important to the}} PLA Navy? And what policies is the PLA Navy promoting in support of China s East China Sea maritime delimitation claims and why? In brief, this paper will demonstrate and conclude that China has made a unique and controversially large maritime territory claim, based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea s 76 th article on natural prolongation of a nation s maritime shelf. The PLA Navy views maintaining and securing China s delimitated maritime territory as crucial to securing undersea natural resources and vital shipping lanes, thus securing China s economic power. The PLA Navy understands that a strong, blue-water navy is critical to a country s economic success and subsequent presence as an international political power. The key policies being promoted by the navy are the assertion and defense of maritime boundaries, especially rights to offshore resources with China s EEZ; securing sea lanes and freedom of navigation at sea; and being a presence in sovereignty disputes over offshore islands as well as Taiwan. All of these issues are critical to the PLA Navy s goals of preserving China s economic and political power...|$|E

Topics such as motivation for joining the PLA and interest in acquiring military expertise were investigated. The question of whether Chinese youths join the PLA because they are interested in pursuing military careers, or because they believe it is a stepping-stone to advancement outside the military is addressed.

To cope with a rising China, other powers will need a close understanding of Chinese strategic culture. This Lowy-MacArthur paper, by Professor Thomas Mahnken of the US Naval War College, presents an initial attempt to redress this gap.

The commentary then notes that the PLA Navy has long sought access to a north Borneo port to aid it in controlling the South China Sea. The piece concludes by examining recent visits regionally by senior PLA figures to discuss issues of Chinese access to regional ports, and suggesting that the PLA will certainly try to gain access to Darwin port now that a Chinese company has a century-long lease on the port...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to {{what the}} Chinese {{government}} said before the handover in 1977 - that Hong Kong would change only a governor and flag - Hong Kong has been undergoing tremendous institutional changes. Besides the stationing of the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>Army</b> and the Foreign Ministry Commission, {{one of the great}} changes is the replacement of the British governor by a local elected Chief Executive. The method of the election was more or less imposed by Beijing and subsequently he suffered from weak societal legitimacy. Facing pressures from groups of diverse political inclinations, he seemed to lose the authority to rule. The greatest intervention by the Beijing government in Hong Kong after the handover was the reinterpretation of the Basic Law clauses regarding the right of abode of Mainland Chinese in Hong Kong. By doing this, it practically ended the autonomy of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal...|$|R

Od 3. studenoga 1944. cjelokupni promet i prometne službe spadale su pod neposrednu upravu Povjereništva saobraćaja NKOJ-a. Vrhovnu upravu nad narodnim željeznicama u Hrvatskoj obavljalo je Povjereništvo prometa ZAVNOH-a.

Care for the railway issues inside the Supreme Headquarters was a task of the Technical Department, while a Traffic Department was responsible for them inside the General staff for Croatia. Scope of the Traffic Commission of NKOJ regarding railways included construction, maintaining and control of railway traffic, and organization and management of technical training i. e. of professional schools. According to that, Traffic Commission of NKOJ had responsilibities for the traffic in entirety. The first traffic commissioner was a general-lieutenant Sreten Žujović-Crni, being, at the same time, {{a member of the}} Supreme Headquarters of the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>Army</b> and Partisan Units of Yugoslavia. Supreme governement of the people 2 ̆ 7 s railway network in Croatia was a responsability of the Traffic Commission of ZAVNOH. A head of that Commission was a traffic commissioner according to whose orders and under whose ruling and supervision all traffic activities in Croatia were going on (people 2 ̆ 7 s railway, post, telegraph and telephone, radio, road and river traffic). Executive control and direct administration of the Croatian railway service was a task of the Directorate of People 2 ̆ 7 s Railways in Croatia.

40|$|Critical {{infrastructures}} remain {{vulnerable to}} cyber attack despite {{a raft of}} post- 9 /l] legislation focused on cyber security in critical infrastructures.

This paper argues that such a market could serve to predict and prevent cyber attacks through the operation of the efficient capital market hypothesis, but only after changes to the present regulatory environment. Specifically, I argue that a statutory safe harbor would allow the creation of a pilot market focused on vulnerabilities in Internet protocol version six, an emerging communications standard that China hopes to deploy throughout its national network before the 2008 Olympics. Indeed, such a safe harbor would align the interests of military and civilian policymakers on the common goal of protecting critical infrastructure from a computer network attack originating in China, whether instigating by the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>Army</b> or so-called 2 ̆ 2 black-hat 2 ̆ 2 hackers...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{researches}} on peace agreements {{conclude that}} powersharing arrangements included in these are {{mostly to the}} detriment of longterm democratic transformation. The basic argument of these studies is that peace deals consolidate mainly the power of the signatories {{to the detriment of}} other major political forces. This article illustrates that, in contrast to many cases, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which was signed in 2005 between the government of Sudan represented by the ruling party, the National Congress Party (NCP) and the Sudan <b>People.</b> <b>s</b> <b>Liberation</b> Movement/Army (SPLM/A), has led to an important political transformation in state structure as well as in power relations. Although the CPA enhanced the legitimacy of the SPLM and the NCP and consolidated their political domination, it, nevertheless, contributed to a significant political opening for other political forces in the North and in the South. The CPA {{put an end to the}} historically exclusive political hegemony of the North. This article focuses on the dynamics of relations between the SPLM and the NCP during the transitional period and illustrates how these dynamics have impacted upon the process of political transformation.

40|$|The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), {{concluded}} {{between the}} Government of Sudan {{and the leadership}} of the Sudan People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>Army</b> (SPLA) in January 2005, ended a 22 years lasting civil war. The core of the CPA document is the agreement on power and wealth sharing, tackling the main causes of the conflict: unfair distribution of power and marginalization {{of the majority of the}} population. The conclusion of the CPA is not only the merit of the two warring parties but also an outcome of the commitment of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the special envoy of the Kenyan government, General Lazaro Sumbeiywo, and the IGAD Partners 2 ̆ 7 Forum which includes the governments of the USA, Norway, Netherlands, Canada, Italy and the United Nations (UN). This success has been overshadowed by the war in Darfur in western Sudan which has been raging since 2003. Moreover, two years after signing the CPA, a speech of the South Sudanese President Salva Kiir on the occasion of the anniversary of the CPA brought some fundamental shortcomings in the implementation to public light. Has the peace process in Sudan come to a standstill? Is the war in Darfur related to the peace in South Sudan? How does the mixture of war and peace in Sudan affect the sub-region of the Greater Horn? What are the challenges for the institutions that had been involved in creating the CPA...|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{international}} peacebuilding, how does a rebel group seek to legitimate its rule once it is in power? This thesis is primarily concerned with this question. By applying legitimation theory (Beetham 1991; Chabal & Daloz 1999) in a descriptive, exploratory case study, the thesis analyzes how the Sudan <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Liberation</b> Movement (SPLM) seeks to consolidate its rule during the current peace process in southern Sudan. The process {{is assumed to be}} dependent on internal as well as external factors. With its multiethnic composition, complicated and war-torn history, as well as a generally low level of development, southern Sudan is considered a difficult case in terms of peacebuilding. SPLM emerged from Sudan s second civil war (1983 - 2005) as the South s main rebel group, but several local groups complicate the situation. Intergroup grievances in the region are considerable. The main findings indicate that SPLM has the willingness to address the issues at stake but lack the institutional capacity to do so. Also, maintaining and further legitimating their power are dependent on external parties, and the latter s interests diverge to a considerable extent. Of particular concern {{is the role of the}} National Congress Party (NCP), SPLM s Islamist senior partner in the national government, which seems to undermine or simply ignore the parts of the peace agreement that seriously challenge its power. The findings provide some nuances for existing theories about peacebuilding (Doyle & Sambanis 2000; Paris 2004) and civil war resolution (Walter 2002). Most importantly, though, they indicate that legitimation theory can fill a void in peace research concerning local actors. By encompassing other theories into one comprehensive framework, legitimation theory can provide a greater overview of the overall peacebuilding picture...|$|R
