40|$|The {{purposeful}} {{application of}} lignocellulosic waste in forestry may {{regarded as one}} of the perspective avenues of its utilization. The use of peat containers for planting pine seedlings or regeneration of pine forest is currently increasing rapidly. However, it has the essential drawback, which is connected with a possible drying out of the <b>peat</b> <b>container</b> surface in the hot summer time that may course a mortality of seedlings. The simultaneous application of a binder and wood mulch such as sawdust may be considered as one of the most efficient methods for regulating the temperature-moisture conditions in the <b>peat</b> <b>container.</b> The binder, forming porous sawdust composite layers at the container surface, can prevent washout and deflation of the mulch, and, such a manner, contributies in regulating the temperature-moisture regime...|$|E
40|$|The organic {{fraction}} of a potting mix is subject to decomposition and, therefore, is important in relation to nitrogen (N) immobilisation. Immobilisation of N is the reduction in plant available N (i. e., nitrate or ammonium) as a result ofmicroorganisms using this N as they decompose organic materials with a high carbon (C) content. The organic portion of potting mixes usually constitutes 50 % {{or more of their}} volume and in New Zealand Pinus radiata bark and sphagnum peat are the most commonly used materials. Pinus radiata sawdust, tree fern fibre, composted mixed vegetation, and other sources of bark or sawdust are also used on a limited scale. Spent mushroom compost has also been successfully used in bark and <b>peat</b> <b>container</b> media overseas although there have been reports ofproblems with its use in New Zealand. It has good physical properties and is a useful source of nutrients except for N. Spent mushroom compost may cause temporary N immobilisation, after which N is slowly mineralised from it. Spent mushroom compost also has a highsoluble salt content that can be ameliorated by leaching, and a pH of 6. 5 - 8. 1. This paper seeks to review the factors causing decomposition of these organic materials and the implications of these processes on N immobilisation...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} the growth performance of Ipil-Ipil (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de wit.) seedling was studied under different conditions in the nursery. In dry season, the growth is poor, but starting the wet season, there was sharp rise in growth. In height and diameter growth, Seedbed under peat with cowdung mixture showed the best result, then polybag and plastic tray in all the media. In all types of <b>containers,</b> <b>peat</b> with cowdung mixture showed the best result. Similarly seedling growth performances showed good relation with seasonal variations. Leaf production also showed the same trend with seasonal variations as well as growth performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} root growth on the {{hydraulic}} properties of peat substrate was investigated under optimal water retention, i. e., {{at a constant}} water potential of - 1 kPa. 'New Guinea' impatiens was grown in 1. 1 -L cylindrical containers for 196 d in a greenhouse under controlled climate and fertilization conditions. Water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves, root biomass and volume, and shoot weight were measured. Results indicated a maximal root volumetric content of 0. 065 m(3). m(- 3) that was {{as high as the}} <b>peat</b> content in <b>containers</b> (0. 068 m(3) -m(- 3)). From Day 0 to Day 196, the total porosity of the growing media decreased from 0. 931 m(3). m(- 3) to 0. 874 m(3). m(- 3). Moreover, considering the water-holding capacity at a water potential of- 1 kPa, it increased from 0. 58 to 0. 75 m(3). m(- 3) (i. e., by 29. 3 %) without changes in water availability but with a large decrease in air-filled porosity from 0. 35 to 0. 14 m(3). m(- 3). The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity K(theta) decreased as a result of root growth. Root growth also modified pore size distribution and pore structure. Hydraulic conductivity curves indicated a better pore connectivity reflected by a decrease in tortuosity...|$|R
