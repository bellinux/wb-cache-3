40|$|Abstract The pathomechanism of the {{shoulder}} impingement syndrome has been under debat. Two main theories of the pathogenesis of the disease exists; mechanical (extrinsic) and degenerative (intrinsic) theory. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the pathogenesis of impingement syndrome with five studies that consentrate to aspects related to ethiopathology as outcome and recovery after surgery, radiological diagnosis, immunohisto- and histopathology of subacromial bursa, and subacromial mechanical pressures. The good results of 14 shoulders of 96 operated with an open acromioplasty turned painful after an average of 5 (2 - 10) years postoperatively and had developed 6 full-thickness and 4 partial rotator cuff tears. Initially good result is not permanent in all cases, suggesting that a degenerative process {{is involved in the}} pathogenesis of impingement syndrome. Shoulder muscle strengths of 48 patients, who had undergone an open acromioplasty, restored to near normal within one year after open acromioplasty, suggesting that mechanical compression plays a role in the pathogenesis of impingement syndrome. Variation {{in the shape of the}} acromion, evaluated in 111 patients and their matched controls by a routine supraspinatus outlet view, is associated with impingement syndrome, but this association is weak. Validity of this radiograph in the diagnosis of impingement syndrome is therefore a minor adjunct to the other diagnostic methods. The role of subacromial bursa in impingement syndrome was studied in 62 patients (33 tendinitis, 11 partial and 18 full-thickness RC tear) suffering from a unilateral impingement syndrome and 24 controls.

A 10 [degree] half-angle conical convergence is mounted on the end of a pressure-driven, six-inch shock tube. Using argon at an initial pressure of 1. 5 torr, initial shock Mach numbers are varied from 6. 0 to 10. 2. During each run local shock velocities at several positions along the cone axis are measured using a small, multi-crystal, axial <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>probe</b> inserted from the cone vertex. The incident shock velocity profiles show that the shock behavior is dominated by multiple diffraction processes which originate at the cone entrance. Sudden increases in shock velocity at certain positions along the axis are observed, corresponding to the intersection of stemshocks formed by Mach reflection on the cone wall. These increases are separated by regions of deceleration and acceleration, corresponding to the growth and decline of a center shock formed by Mach reflection on the cone axis. Near the vertex the shock velocity has increased by as much as a factor of three, indicating that high temperatures and pressures are generated. By varying the initial Mach number and pressure, real gas effects are found to influence the diffraction process only in a region near the vertex. Reflected shock profiles show that the shock velocity is nearly constant for much of the convergence length, in contrast to the power-law decline predicted by the similarity solution. During this period the shock propagates into fluid originally set into steady, uniform motion outside the cone entrance. Small variations in the velocity result from weak interactions with localized nonuniformities and secondary waves. Beyond the cone entrance the shock decelerates towards the velocity corresponding to reflection from a plane end wall. A departure from ionization equilibrium is likely near the vertex during the rapid expansion which occurs behind the reflected shock...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic Testing (UT) {{is one of}} most {{important}} methods of Non-destructive Testing (NDT) and ultrasonic waves can be generated and detected by means of numeric methods. This thesis focuses on piezoelectric transducers and Electromagnetic Acoustical Transducer (EMAT). For testing with piezoelectric transducer (also called a probe), couplant has to be applied between the test material and the probe allowing for ultrasonic waves generated in the probe by an active piezoelectric crystal to propagate into the testing material. The couplant can be water, mineral oil, or gel, dependent on the applications concerned and material compatibility, for example, water for immersion tests or automatated inspections. No two piezoelectric transducer designs are identical {{in terms of their}} frequency range, beam propagation characteristics and directionality. The shape, dimensions, backing and matching of the transducer to the pulse generator together {{play a major role in}} the generation of the ultrasonic waves. Furthermore, the quantitative interpretation of pulse echo data obtained when such transducers are used in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) requires a complete knowledge of the ultrasonic field transmitted. Ultrasonic fields of circular probes have been studied experimentally using a miniature probe and theoretically with models developed to predict ultrasonic field of such a probe. Good agreement has been observed. In a fluid, the ultrasonic field generated by a circular piezoelectric transducer can be described in terms of a combination of locally plane waves that radiate in the geometric region straight ahead of the active transducer element and edge waves radiating from the rim of the element. When a piezoelectric transducer is directly mounted onto a solid material, the ultrasonic field includes locally plane longitudinal waves, edge longitudinal waves and mode-converted edge shear waves. Both cases can be studied using miniature piezoelectric probes. For electrically conductive materials, EMATs can be used for generation by means of Lorentz force or magnetostriction or both, and detection. EMAT technique is non-contact and couplant free and can work at high temperature. These attributes make it ideal for inspection in extreme conditions, such as high temperature, high speed, rough surface, etc. This thesis focuses on Lorentz force generation. The main disadvantages of an EMAT detector are its lower sensitivity compared to a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>probe</b> and it is not straightforward to miniaturise the device to operate as a point sensor for the range of wavelengths of interest here. Therefore, optimal EMAT design is extremely important for successful EMAT application. Ultrasound may be generated without presence of external magnetic field as excitation electric current provides magnetic field as it induces eddy currents in the material under test, which creates Lorentz forces for ultrasonic generation. Where external magnetic field is applied, EMATs have to be designed correctly to achieve enhanced efficiency. As an example, Rayleigh wave EMAT generation has been studied. It is found that where external magnetic field is applied, constructive or destructive effects have been observed, which is understood dependent on direction of the external magnetic fields applied relevant to electric current direction. Optical interferometer to measure the true normal displacement of the solid surface with a resolution in the order of nanometres, but it is much more complex than an EMAT and a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>probe</b> and requires an optically flat surface. The receiving EMAT detector measures particle velocity. By careful design, in-plane or out-of-plane (or both) velocities can be chosen for detection. This capability is very useful for the detection of longitudinal waves, shear waves, Rayleigh waves or Lamb waves efficiently. The ultrasonic pulse-echo technique has been widely used in ultrasonic NDT. Ultrasonic pulse-echo responses and ultrasonic field signals are not the same. Typically, edge waves are rarely seen in a pulse echo response because the plane waves that are normal to the major face of the active crystal of the same probe are nearly in phase to constructively result in a significant signal whilst edge waves arrive at the active crystal in different directions and different phases cancelling each other and destructively producing only a small signal that is barely observable. As an example of ultrasonic pulse-echo application, weak bond evaluation, has been performed. Weak bond evaluation has always been a challenge. As an example of practical applications, this study has evaluated Integrated Circuit packaging in electronic industry using scanning acoustical microscopy. The relationship among resulting ultrasonic C-scan images, destructive mechanical failure measurement, degradation cycles have been observed. The result is promising indicating the SAM is a very useful tool for weak bond evaluation. Ultrasonic field measurement using a miniature probe and specially design EMAT is very important to characterize and standardize a probe.

40|$|Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) {{techniques}} {{have achieved a}} great development during the last decades as a valuable tool for material characterization, manufacturing control and structural integrity tests. Among these tools, the guided wave technology has been rapidly extended because it reduces inspection time and costs compared to the ordinary point by point testing in large structures, as well as because {{of the possibility of}} inspecting under insulation and coating conditions. This fast development has motivated the creation of several inspection and material characterization systems including different technologies which can be combined with this technique. Different measurements systems based on laser {{techniques have}} been presented in order to inspect pipes, plates and diverse structures. Many of them are experimental systems of high cost and complexity which combine the employment of a laser for generation of waves in the structure and an interferometer for detection. Some of them employ air-coupled ultrasound generation transducers, with high losses in air and which demand high energy for exciting waves in materials of high stiffness. The combined employment of a commercial vibrometer system for Lamb wave sensing in plates has been successfully shown in the literature. In this paper we present a measurement system based on the combined employment of a piezoelectric wedge transducer and a laser vibrometer to sense guided acoustic waves in carbon steel pipes. The measurement system here presented is mainly compounded of an angular wedge transducer, employed to generate the guided wave and a commercial laser vibrometer used in the detection process. The wedge transducer is excited by means of a signal function generator whose output signal has been amplified with a power signal amplifier. A high precision positioning system is employed to place the laser beam at different points through the pipe surface. The signal detected by the laser vibrometer system is amplified with a signal amplifier and then it is displayed in a digital storage oscilloscope. This set-up offers the possibility of analyzing in a simpler way the wave propagation and the material evaluation in pipes of certain wall thickness.

ABSTRACT OF PART II: The thermodynamic conditions behind the incident and reflected shock wave close to the vertex of a convergent channel are investigated spectroscopically. The investigation was initiated in order to better determine the possible uses of such a geometrical device as a tool for high temperature plasma research. Using argon at an initial pressure of 1. 5 torr, the shock Mach number prior to the entrance of the cone is 10. 2. Two windows are mounted at x/ 1 = 0. 9 in the cone, where the Mach number has increased to 24, and the emitted radiation is monitored for both time-resolved (Monochromator - Photomultiplier) and time-integrated (Spectrograph) analysis. The relative line intensity method is used to measure the electron temperature. The Stark broadened profile of the 6965. 4 [ [...] . ] neutral argon line, and continuum intensity measurements are used to determine the electron number density. From initial values of [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ], both the electron temperature and number density profiles behind the incident shock are dominated by the previous shock diffraction processes. The general trend is a gradual increase, presumably due to the continuing compression of the gas shocked at successively earlier times. Superimposed upon this is the effect of hot slugs of gas from previous localized regions of very high Mach number. The reflected shock wave heats and compresses the gas even further. The subsequent expansion results in a series of rapid exponential decreases in temperature, density and pressure. Immediately after the reflected shock wave has passed, the gas appears to be in a nonequilibrium state with a population inversion among the upper excited atomic energy levels. There is an indication of the presence of a second reflected wave. The effects of self-absorption on Stark broadened lines is studied. An equation is derived, demonstrating the effect of individual corrections that are necessary before accurate interpretations of measured quantities can be made. Simple self-absorption correction schemes are demonstrated and shown to be self-consistent...|$|E

The dry coupling allows UT at elevated temperatures, in media which do not tolerate liquids (e. g. natural-gas pipelines) or on sensitive and coated surfaces of blanks used for car bodies in the automotive industry etc. Ultrasonic Testing (UT) is still concentrated on the 'classical' wave modes generated by pie zoelectric probes. Other wave modes as the Shear Horizontal (SH) waves and the wide class of guided waves offer new solutions for UT not yet widely used {{due to the lack}} of availability of appropriate probes and equipment. EMATs are the most far developed ultrasonic probes for UT using SH waves and guided waves. This contribution will present new solutions for UT of pipes using guided waves such as Shear Horizontal waves: for weld inspection, for long range inspection of pipes, for screening UT for hidden corrosion, for crack inspection in gas pipelines. The latest developments of the probe design are briefly reported. The equipment and their integration in production lines for in-service application are shown together with examples of inspection results during their practical applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{non-destructive}} testing of pipeline systems under maintenance {{is an important}} task. Improving the testing system sensitivity will improve the accuracy of residual lifetime predictions. This leads {{to the development of}} new inspection technique. Typically inspection of welding joints comes under purview of many standards and has become a common practice. When it comes to pipe body, non-availability of standards limits the usage of commonly used testing techniques. Testing of large areas require large amount of time using conventional bulk wave testing. The presence of the anti-corrosion coating makes the testing more complex. The solution for the above problem is to use guided waves, which improves the speed of testing. The ultrasonic long-range inspection using guided waves made significant progress in the last 10 - 15 years. Generating guided waves at one location can cover very long range. Using this technique, corrosion damage as well as cracks in the pipe section can be detected. In order to obtain a larger range capability low-frequency ultrasonic waves (20 - 250 kHz) are used. The ultrasonic testing over distances up to 100 meters and more is possible. The testing systems more commonly available in the market for the long-range inspection use <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>probes.</b> Low-frequency electromagnetic US-transducers were developed in Fraunhofer-IZFP, which allow transmitting and receiving of the ultrasonic mode SS 0 in thin-walled inspection objects like pipes, plates, tanks and containers. This technique has number of advantages in comparison to systems with piezoelectric excitation. A multi-channel mobile inspection system for testing of pipe systems using the above transducers was developed in Fraunhofer-IZFP. Technical aspects of probe and electronics design are considered. Field-testing results are presented in the current work...|$|R

The aim of this work was to determine optimal conditions for detection of the real fatigue cracks of nearly microns width and surface pores by moving depending on {{the position of the}} center of a laser beam laser beam spot. The objects of research were metal specimens with crack’s width of 8 m up to 0, 5 mm and depth ≈ 400 – 500 mm up to ≈ 200 mm. Cylindrical hole by ≈ 1 mm diameter used as a model pore. An experimental installation used consisted of the pulse laser light emission source with laser wavelength of 1. 06 m and laser pulse duration of ≈ 20 ns. An arrangement to adjust the laser beam spot geometry {{in the form of a}} long strip and a circle was applied. Surface waves were received by the 2. 7 MHz frequency probe, and processed with use of a «Spectronic» TDS 3052 B oscilloscope. The laws of acoustical signal amplitude and its form changes vs. the laser beam spot geometry and its position in regard to defect were determined. We discovered that optimal conditions for flaw detection took place when the laser beam spot moving trough the defect’s range – crack and pore. In the first case amplitude growth of the signal was up to 7 – 8 time – like as resonance conditions realized. And the ratio of the laser’s beam spot width (as long strip) to wave length were ≈ 1. 8 – 2. 2. The more informative parameter to find crack with small width (≈ 0. 5 mm) was the acoustical pulse spectrum or the pulse entrance part. Thus, the further increasing of the surface flaw detection may be realized by laser {{simulation of}} the surface waves controlling the form of the moving spot of laser beam. New possibilities to increase sensitivity and reliability of ultrasonic evaluation surfaces in objects with complicated profile and fare accessible places are to be arise...|$|R
