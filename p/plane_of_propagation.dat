This result confirms that the hallow banana shape is simply a result of the wrapping of the phase of the wavefield, in which Born nor Rytov approximations can properly deal with.

For example, it is convenient for some purposes to regard the problem of diffraction of a plane wave by a semi-infinite plane screen, with a straight edge, as a problem about an aperture distribution in the plane of the screen.

40|$|A set of {{cleavage}} {{experiments with}} strip-shaped single-crystal silicon specimens subjected to three-point bending will be presented. The experiments enabled {{examination of the}} relationships between crack velocity, the crystallographic orientation, and the cleavage <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> Dynamic crack propagation experiments show that when a [001] silicon single crystal is fractured under three-point bending at measured velocity of up to 1500 m/sec, it prefers to cleave along the vertical (110) plane, while when the specimen is fractured under the same conditions but at a velocity higher than 2900 m/sec, it cleaves along the inclined (111) plane. At intermediate velocities, the crack will deflect from the (110) plane to the (111) plane. The deflection phenomenon presents an excellent opportunity to examine the upper crack tip's velocity limit. Analysis of the experimental results showed that the normalized crack tip velocity in the (110) plane with the Rayleigh surface wave speed yields ratio of up to 0. 65 (in the [1 1 0] direction), which reduces to as low as 0. 01 (in the [001] direction). It is suggested that the cause of the deflection phenomenon and the reasoning for the low limiting crack tip velocity is the anisotropic, velocity dependent, irreversible cleavage energy, resulted phonon radiation caused by anisotropic, velocity dependent lattice vibrations. 1...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{a growing}} {{bandwidth}} problem within wireless communications, the terahertz (THz) spectrum is being investigated as a possible technology for short-range, high-bandwidth communications. For this reason, it is worth implementing known communications technologies within the radio frequency (RF) and microwave bands, such as antennas, in the terahertz band. One such technology is the leaky-wave antenna. Leaky-wave antennas have been in use within the RF and microwave bands since the 1940 ’s. The leaky-wave antenna is a travelling wave antenna in which a fast wave with a phase velocity greater {{than the speed of}} light, c, propagates through a waveguide. This fast wave is allowed to leak out of the waveguide via an opening {{along the length of the}} waveguide. A THz leaky-wave antenna is implemented using the TE 1 mode of a parallel-plate waveguide (PPWG). Various plate separations are used during this project in order to show the leaky-wave effect for different dispersion relations. Using a commercial THz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system, the input of the waveguide is a broadband THz signal. The expected output from such an input would be dispersed in the frequency domain. This is particularly interesting because it would allow the leaky-wave antenna to act as a THz demultiplexer by separating a broadband signal into individual frequency components that vary with angle. Our measured experimental results show that the waveguide indeed produces a dispersed output matching the analytical result. The propagation angle of lower frequencies is closer to perpendicular to the waveguide, with the cutoff frequency of the PPWG at the normal. Higher frequencies are transmitted closer to the axis of the waveguide. Since the phase-matching condition for a leaky-wave antenna can work in either direction, this THz leaky-wave antenna can also receive radiation. Our results show that when operating in this orientation, the receiving angle matches the angle of transmission from the transmitter setup for each frequency. This again shows agreement with the analytical result froe leaky-wave antennas. Using the leaky-wave antenna in this manner, we see the potential for THz frequency domain multiplexing. Varying the plate separation of a PPWG changes the dispersion relation. Since the angle of leaky-wave propagation depends on the dispersion, by varying the plate separation, one can vary the angle of the leaky-wave along the length of the waveguide. We implement such a waveguide in order to focus a chosen frequency to a point. Simulations of the field intensity show that this is possible. By mapping out the field intensity for each design frequency, our results validate this concept by showing that the field focuses within the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> To the best of our knowledge, this work shows for the first time that these types of antennas can be implemented within the THz spectrum in order to transmit and receive THz signals...|$|E
40|$|Geophysical {{exploration}} {{measurements are}} used to obtain {{an image of the}} geological structures of the subsurface, as detailed as possible. To this end, a wavefield is generated by a seismic source. This wavefield propagates through the subsurface, and will partly reflect on boundaries between layers with contrasting properties, and it will partly propagate further into the subsurface. De wavefields that have propagated back to the surface are measured with receivers. When this experiment is repeated several times on different locations, the measured data can be used to obtain the desired image. There are two kinds of seismic waves that can propagate through the subsurface. The ones that are generally used are the pressure waves, or P-waves, where the movement of the particles is parallel to the propagation direction of the wave. The other ones are the shear waves, or S-waves, where the movement of the particles is perpendicular to the propagation direction of the wave. When the particle movement is horizontally polarized (perpendicular to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation),</b> this wave type is often decoupled, or in other words, it propagates independently of other wave types. These waves are also called SH-waves. The surface of the Earth behaves as a perfect reflector for SH-waves. This means that all SH-waves that reach the surface will be completely reflected back into the subsurface. When the top layer of the subsurface is thin (smaller than the wavelength of the SH-wave), and when this top layer has a lower wave velocity than deeper layers, then the presence of the surface leads to a kind of surface waves, which were first described by A. E. H. Love, and are therefore called 'Love waves'. Love wave characteristics are: their group velocity is almost equal to the shear wave velocity; since they propagate solely along the surface, they attenuate slowly and are thus often stronger than reflected waves; and they are dispersive. The presence of Love waves deteriorates the quality of the final picture (or seismogram), because they obscure the desired reflections. Existing techniques to remove Love waves from seismic data often perform insufficient, or require certain knowledge about the subsurface. This knowledge is generally not available. Therefore, the ideal method should be one where the measured data alone is sufficient to separate the Love waves from the desired reflection information. The method we describe in this thesis uses the Betti-Rayleigh reciprocity theorem for elastic media. Reciprocity is a mathematical tool to relate two different states to each other. Here, one state is the actual situation, where the medium is bounded by a stress-free surface. The other state is an ideal situation, where there is no surface, and the top layer is extended to infinity. When there is no surface, there are also no surface waves. By applying the reciprocity theorem, we derive an integral equation, from which the Love wave free wavefield can be solved {{as a function of the}} data that do contain these surface waves. Other input parameters are the (shear-) wave velocity and the mass density of the top layer, and the source wavelet. When the data are discrete, the integral equation becomes a matrix equation. This can be solved using conventional numerical methods, such as matrix inversion. When the medium is horizontally layered (a so called 1 -D medium), the kernel of the matrix equation becomes diagonal in the wave-number domain. Then the matrix equation reduces to a scalar expression. We tested the method on several synthetic datasets. In all cases, the Love waves were completely removed. Even other noise in the form of scattered Love waves was removed, in the cases where it was present. The method also had no problems when the input parameters were chosen wrongly. And when distortions were introduced into the data (distortions like random noise, or the effects of anelastic attenuation), the method still performed well. To test the method on field data, we performed a seismic experiment on the site of the Sofia tunnel (before it was drilled) near Hendrik Ido Ambacht in the Netherlands. The dataset that was the result seemed all right at first. Strong Love waves were indeed present in the data. However, we could not succeed in removing these Love waves with the method. Even worse, the method added noise to the data, to such an extent, that it completely obscured the original data. Although we searched extensively for possible reasons, we were not able to find the exact cause of the bad results. In the final chapter, we made a start to remove the surface waves from coupled P- and SV-wave systems, using the same method as we did for SH-waves. Because P- and SV-waves are coupled, the resulting equations are also coupled. This means that we need all possible source and receiver combinations to remove the surface waves. But it appeared that the equations could be solved independently with regard to the source direction. We validated the theory with an example where we removed the Rayleigh wave from the response of a homogeneou...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- Array-based {{methods for}} {{exploiting}} ambient seismic noise are receiving increasing {{attention in the}} literature, particularly for use in providing shear wave velocity profiles to assist with simulation of site-specific earthquake responses. Many of these microtremor methods- such as the spatial autocorrelation technique (SPAC) - operate under the fundamental assumption <b>of</b> <b>plane</b> wave <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> surface waves. Although the SPAC technique has been successfully applied in urban areas, the effect of near-sources (and thus non-planar Rayleigh wave propagation) has received little attention.

The results suggest that near source effects are generally minimal provided that most of the sources are located at least two array radii from the centre of the array. Results of a field trial involving the deliberate use of a near-source in proximity to a hexagonal (7 -station) array support the findings of the theoretical model, and demonstrate that near source effects can result in significant distortions to SPAC spectra. In the presence of near-sources, the SPAC curve is generally offset to lower frequencies in the first J 0 cycle, resulting in underestimates of shear velocity values in the inverted profile...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{efficacy}} of fast/slow MHD mode conversion {{in the surface}} layers of sunspots has been demonstrated over recent years using a number of modelling techniques, including ray theory, perturbation theory, differential eigensystem analysis, and direct numerical simulation. These show that significant energy may be transferred between the fast and slow modes in the neighbourhood of the equipartition layer where the Alfvén and sound speeds coincide. However, most of the models {{so far have been}} two dimensional. In three dimensions the Alfvén wave may couple to the magnetoacoustic waves with important implications for energy loss from helioseismic modes and for oscillations in the atmosphere above the spot. In this paper, we carry out a numerical “scattering experiment”, placing an acoustic driver 4 Mm below the solar surface and monitoring the acoustic and Alfvénic wave energy flux high in an isothermal atmosphere placed above it. These calculations indeed show that energy conversion to upward travelling Alfvén waves can be substantial, in many cases exceeding loss to slow (acoustic) waves.
