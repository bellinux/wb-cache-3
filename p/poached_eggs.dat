60|$|Dick went on {{with his}} breakfast. He ate cold pastry, and <b>poached</b> <b>eggs,</b> and ham, and rolls, and {{raspberry}} jam, and hot cakes; and he drank two cups of coffee. Meanwhile the king had joined the tradesmen who attended by his orders. They were all met in the royal study, where the king made them a most splendid bow, and requested them to be seated.

60|$|When {{he reached}} his house he met three or four {{men and women on}} horse-back, very muddy indeed, coming down the drive. Feeling hungry himself, he asked them if they were hungry.

Rhoda took their {{battered}} hats, led the women upstairs for hairpins, and presently fed them all with tea-cakes, <b>poached</b> <b>eggs,</b> anchovy toast, and drinks from a coromandel-wood liqueur case which Midmore had never known that he possessed.|$|E

I've seen too many millionaires for that. If {{you want to be a}} millionaire you mustn't get up till ten in the morning. They never do. They daren't.
