5|$|Main pond, dug in 1986, with {{seasonally}} fluctuating water levels. Most vegetation has colonised naturally, with {{among others}} common reed, <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> yellow iris, water-plantain, water figwort, soft rush, gypsywort, water starwort, curled pondweed, common duckweed, water forget-me-not, water mint, brooklime.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Lamiaceae can spread {{unchecked}} and become invasive plants. Planting of P.atriplicifolia near wild lands has been discouraged by some gardening guides {{out of concern for}} its potential to spread, but it is not considered invasive, and has been suggested as a substitute for <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> for this reason.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of non-native plants into its habitat {{is a large}} threat to the bog turtles' survival. Although several plants disrupt its ecosystem, the three primary culprits are <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> reed canary grass, and reeds, which grow thick and tall and are believed to hinder {{the movement of the}} turtles. Such plants also out-compete the native species in the bog turtle's habitat, thus reducing the amount of food and protection available to the turtles.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{invasive}} plants live {{along the}} Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them. Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river, {{and it is}} slowly displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present along the river.|$|E
5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge {{as part of}} {{an effort}} to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> and Japanese knotweed.|$|E
5|$|The Tualatin Riverkeepers, {{a nonprofit}} {{watershed}} council based in Tigard; Clean Water Services, a public utility that protects water {{resources in the}} Tualatin River watershed, and the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD) have formed the Tualatin Basin Invasive Species Working Group to identify and eradicate invasive plants that displace native plants, cause erosion, and diminish water quality. The five plants considered most threatening are Japanese knotweed, meadow knapweed, giant hogweed, garlic mustard and <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife.</b> The Oregon Department of Agriculture {{and the city of}} Tigard are working to eradicate giant hogweed from lower Fanno Creek.|$|E
5|$|South-west of {{the town}} is the Friar's Oven SSSI which {{is the site of}} herb-rich {{calcareous}} grassland classified as the Upright Brome (Bromus erectus) type, and north-east is the Windsor Hill Quarry geological SSSI, and also the Windsor Hill Marsh biological SSSI, a marshy silted pond with adjacent damp, slightly acidic grassland of interest for its diverse flora, in large part down to the varied habitats present within the small area. Two species are present which are rare in Somerset: Flat-sedge (Blysmus compressus) and Slender Spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis). Other marshland plants found there include <b>Purple</b> <b>Loosestrife,</b> Yellow Flag (Iris pseudacorus), Hard Rush (Juncus inflexus), Soft Rush (J. effusus), Flowering Rush (Butomus umbellatus), Devil's-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), three species of Horsetail Equisetum spp. and seven sedges Carex spp.|$|E
25|$|The grasslands {{have also}} been {{inviting}} for several invasive species, most notably <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> mugwort and gray dogwood. FWS's mowing and other grassland-preservation efforts are aimed at removing or controlling those species.|$|E
25|$|Lake Minnetonka's {{environmental}} issues became a concern after curly-leaf pondweed {{was discovered in}} its waters in 1900. <b>Purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> was discovered in the lake in 1940, as was Eurasian water milfoil in 1987. Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Between 1861 and 1863, Darwin {{found the}} same kind of {{structure}} in other groups: flax (and other species of Linum); and in <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> and other species of Lythrum. Some of the Lythrum species are trimorphic, with one style and two stamens in each form.|$|E
25|$|British Columbian {{introduced}} species include: common dandelion, ring-necked pheasant, Pacific oyster, brown trout, black slug, European starling, cowbird, knapweed, bullfrog, <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> Scotch broom, Himalayan blackberry, European earwig, tent caterpillar, sowbug, grey squirrel, Asian longhorn beetle, English ivy, fallow deer, thistle, gorse, Norway rat, crested mynah, and Asian or European gypsy moth.|$|E
25|$|Invasive {{species have}} become a concern in some areas. Some of these include yellow starthistle and scotch broom. Starthistle has become {{a problem in the}} Siskiyous only in the last 20 years. It has little value to habitat and is able to outcompete many native plants. <b>Purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> is a plant that is {{invasive}} to waterways.|$|E
25|$|Colliery pond {{was created}} when the National Coal Board {{constructed}} a concrete road to facilitate tipping. The road is concealed beneath {{the grass and}} acts as a dam. Water plants include water forget-me-not, bogbean and <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife.</b> Large numbers of creatures are attracted to the pond, such as toads, moorhens, smooth newts, swan mussels plus varieties of damselfly and dragonfly.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} many {{invasive}} {{species that are}} primarily brought in the ballast water of foreign ships, usually from the ocean bordering Northeastern Asia. This water is dumped directly into the Great Lakes, depositing a variety of fresh and salt water fish and invertebrates, most notably the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha. There are also many plant species that have been transported to the Great Lakes, including <b>Purple</b> <b>Loosestrife</b> Lythrum salicaria and Phragmites australis, {{both of which are}} considered to be a threat to native hydrophyte wetland plants.|$|E
25|$|Five more {{designs were}} added on 12 April 2005, the 1c bloody crane's-bill, 2c Irish orchid, 7c fly orchid, 10c {{mountain}} avens and €10 spring gentian. Another five on 20 February 2006: 12c autumn gorse, 25c common knapweed, 75c navelwort, 90c viper's bugloss and €1 foxglove. With four more on 1 March 2007: 3c yellow flag, 55c large-flowered butterwort, 78c black bog-rush and the 95c <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife.</b> And a final 3 on 3 March 2008 a 20c thrift, 50c biting stonecrop and 82c sea aster.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, {{more than}} 185 bird {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in the refuge including herons, egrets, hawks, osprey, shorebirds, gulls, terns, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, grebes, falcons, vultures, waterfowl, and many others. Vegetation, which varies {{from one part of}} the refuge to another, includes Oregon white oak, Pacific madrone, ash, and black locust trees; ferns, Oregon-grape, Scotch broom, and poison oak, as well as rushes, sedges, and other plants. Invasive species, gradually being replaced by physical removal and burning, include reed canary grass, <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> Himalayan blackberry, and others.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the floods}} are less {{frequent}} the hardwoods themselves are absent, {{giving way to}} open country. The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog. The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by calamagrostides blanchâtres, by purple moor grass, bogbean, yellow loosestrife, swamp cinquefoil, lesser spearwort, common marsh-bedstraw, kingcup, <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> and violettes, the last being an endangered species in the country. In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly bog myrtle, bog-rosemary, common cottongrass and species of Carex. The soil is often covered in peat mosses and other mosses.|$|E
25|$|The {{island was}} {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its maritime communities; internationally rare lichens; bryophyte, vascular plant and bird species; and intertidal communities. Nationally important flowering plants include sharp rush, rock sea lavender, small adder's tongue and western clover, and the rare <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> {{is found in}} places. Two nationally rare heathland lichens are found {{on the slopes of}} Mynydd Enlli: the ciliate strap lichen and golden hair lichen; and there are over 350 lichen species in total. The leafcutter bee, named after its habit of cutting neat, rounded circles in rose leaves, used to seal the entrance to its nest, is native.|$|E
25|$|S. graminifolium {{is one of}} the few Stylidium species commercially {{available}} for sale as seed. This species, along with six other triggerplants, was tested for horticultural value and cold hardiness by Douglas Darnowski in the United States from 2000 to 2002. Dr. Darnowski's study concluded that S. graminifolium was able to survive cold temperatures down to -10°C, making it suitable for growing outside in as low as USDA hardiness zone 8. Darnowski also postulated that S. graminifoliums attractive floral spikes could be of use in floriculture and could be used to replace <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> in winter and spring arrangements. It has a relatively long flowering period and has somewhat specific conditions for germination, including smoke treatments and higher temperatures to simulate a bushfire, though germination can occur without these conditions. These germination requirements reduce the risk that it will become an invasive species. It is also able to grow on nutrient-poor soils and withstand significant drought. These attributes increase its potential for floricultural use.|$|E
500|$|The slough {{watershed}} {{lies in the}} Portland/Vancouver Basin ecoregion, part of the Willamette Valley ecoregion {{designated by}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Black cottonwood, red osier dogwood, willow, Oregon white oak, and Oregon ash grow in scattered locations throughout the watershed, while wapato and Columbia sedge thrive in a few places. In the slough itself, macrophytes and algae sometimes restrict water flow and reduce water quality. Golf courses and athletic fields near the slough consist mainly of non-native grasses. [...] Developed plots with houses or businesses often have deciduous street trees, grasses, occasional conifers, {{and a variety of}} native and non-native shrubs. Invasive plants include Himalayan blackberry, English ivy, reed canarygrass, <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> and Japanese knotweed.|$|E
2500|$|A list of {{the common}} {{invasive}} species in Lake Erie include: Zebra Mussels, Quagga Mussels, Round Gobies, Spiny European Water Fleas, Fishhook Water Fleas, the Sea Lamprey, and White Perch. The invasive plant species that fill Lake Erie consist mainly of Eurasian Milfoil, and <b>Purple</b> <b>Loosestrife,</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{plants have}} been {{introduced}} {{with the intent of}} aesthetically improving public recreation areas or private properties. [...] The introduced Norway maple for example occupies a prominent status in many of Canada's parks. The transport of ornamental plants for landscaping use has and continues {{to be a source of}} many introductions. [...] Some of these species have escaped horticultural control and become invasive. Notable examples include water hyacinth, salt cedar, and <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Invasive species {{continue}} to be a problem in the Kishwaukee River Basin. 21% of the area's plants have been introduced as foreign species to the area and have since become [...] "naturalized." [...] Some of these plants include garlic mustard, <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> and Canada thistle. Canada thistle has persisted in the region since as early as 1922 when McHenry County started showing concern. [...] "The county has its regular thistle commissioners and they in turn have been authorized to engage scores of assistants to aid in doing away with these pests ... If the land owner refuses to cut them down at the lawful time, the commissioner simply hires a man [...] to do the work and reports the transaction and makes a bill which is placed against the land at the coming tax paying season", McHenry County officials were recorded as saying at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{farmers are}} {{concerned}} about the disturbance of the land, tiling, soil erosion, and soil quality. Iowa fields contain a lot of drain tiles, which can be damaged. The pipeline company said they would repair any tile damaged during construction and place the pipeline 2 feet (.6 m) below drainage tiles. Some farmers were concerned about soil disturbance, but a Dakota Access spokesman noted that the soil had already been disturbed during the installation of drainage tile in all of the contested farms the pipeline planned to cross. During construction there is also concern for the spread of invasive weeds into the surrounding land. Both states list Russian knapweed (Rhaponticum repens), [...] Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense), Leafy Spurge (Euphorbia esula), <b>Purple</b> <b>Loosestrife</b> (Lythrum salicaria), and Saltceder (Tamarix chinensis) as invasive species of weed. However, under law the management of invasive weeds, once they are on private property, fall under the land owners responsibility. Farmers are also concerned about leaks in the pipeline caused by destabilization in certain areas prone to flooding, which could cause an environmental disaster.|$|E
2500|$|Soras {{may prefer}} some cover types. In Arizona, 65.3% of sora use was in {{southern}} cattail (Typha domingensis), although it comprised only 16.5% of the vegetation. Bulrushes and a mixed-shrub community {{were also used}} more than their availability, while saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) and arrowweed (Pluchea sericea) were avoided. A literature review notes sora avoidance of <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> (Lythrum salicaria)-dominated sites. In east and central Maine, wetlands used by soras had significantly (p=0.05) more ericaceous vegetation, such as leatherleaves (Chamaedaphne spp.), sweetgales (Myrica spp.), and laurels (Kalmia spp.). In marshes of northwestern Iowa, broadleaf arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia) occurred in sora territories significantly (p<0.01) more often than at random sites. Johnson and Dinsmore [...] imply that this likely results from both species preferring similar site conditions. In May and June in Wisconsin, soras were detected significantly (p<0.025) more often in cattail (Typha spp.) survey areas than in sedge areas. However, in southeastern Wisconsin during the breeding season, {{there was no significant}} (p=0.943) difference in sora densities between habitats comprised predominantly of cattail, sedge, or bulrush. In addition, soras' use of glaucous cattail (Typha × glauca), broadfruit bur-reed (Sparganium eurycarpum), sedge, river bulrush (Schoenoplectus fluviatilis), and hardstem bulrush (S. acutus var. acutus) habitats in marshes of northwestern Iowa generally reflected availability of these habitats.|$|E
2500|$|More {{recent efforts}} {{have focused on}} turning Kingman and Heritage islands into nature centers. The islands were {{closed to the public}} in 2004 as {{improvements}} were made and trash removed. In 2005, Mayor Williams proposed turning the two islands into a formal wildlife refuge and building a $9 million environmental education center on Kingman Island. Williams proposed building the center as part of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative, a multibillion-dollar plan to restore the river and economically develop the neighborhoods around it. Studios Architecture was chosen from among 10 firms to design the green building, which would extend out over the river, include a rooftop plant nursery, and use solar energy for heat. Local and national environmental groups also pledged their assistance. Williams proposed turning the two islands over to the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation, which was managing the Initiative at the time, and in May 2007 legislation to turn the islands over to the Corporation's successor was introduced in the City Council. The legislation passed and was signed into law. Just four months later, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development announced that proceeds from a $111.5 million PILOT bond would be used to improve Kingman Island and three other city parks. As of mid-2009, extensive improvements had been made. The two islands had about [...] of trails, and the wooden footbridge connecting Kingman Island to the shore had been rebuilt. A square pier was built {{in the center of the}} footbridge connecting Heritage and Kingman islands, providing a place for bird watching, fishing, and for pedestrians to rest and view the marshes. The islands were home to more than 100 species of birds as well as mimosa trees, <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> Queen Anne's lace, and turtles. The D.C. government turned over maintenance of the islands in 2009 to the nonprofit group Living Classrooms, and the city continued to plan for an environmental center and more trails.|$|E
60|$|<b>PURPLE</b> <b>LOOSESTRIFE</b> (Lythrum salicaria).--Ophelia's long purples {{adorn the}} water-courses in the Itchen mead.|$|E
6000|$|... is a {{familiar}} verse from Cymbeline; any {{one can see the}} resemblance to the pale blue of that admired and loved blossom in the blue veins of any person with a delicate skin. Purples and purplish reds in masses are mostly seen in young persons of delicate skins and high colour in frosty weather in winter, when the eyes sparkle and the face glows with the happy sensations natural to the young and healthy during and after outdoor exercise. The skin purples and purple-reds here described are beautiful, and may be matched to a nicety in many flowers; the human purple may be seen (to name a very common wild flower) in <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> and the large marsh mallow, and in dozens and scores of other familiar purple flowers; and the purple-red hue in many richly coloured skins has its exact shade in common hounds' tongue, and in other dark and purple-red flowers. But we always find, I fancy, that the expression due to human association in a purple flower is greatest when this colour (as in the human face) is placed side by side or fades into some shade of red or pink. I think we may see this even in a small flower like the fumitory, in which one portion is deep purple {{and all the rest of}} the blossoms a delicate pink. Even when the red is very intense, as in the common field poppy, the pleasing expression of purple on red is very evident.|$|E
6000|$|We will wander--for {{though the}} sun be bright, here are good fish {{to be picked}} out of sharps and stop-holes--into the water-tables, ridged up centuries since into furrows forty feet broad and five feet high, over which the crystal water sparkles among {{the roots of the}} rich grass, and hurries down innumerable drains to find its parent stream between tufts of great blue geranium, and spires of <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> and the {{delicate}} white and pink comfrey-bells, and the avens--fairest and most modest of all the waterside nymphs, who hangs her head all day long in pretty shame, with a soft blush upon her tawny check. But at the mouth of each of those drains, if we can get our flies in, and keep ourselves unseen, we will have one cast at least. For at each of them, in some sharp-rippling spot, lies a great trout or two, waiting for beetle, caterpillar, and whatsoever else may be washed from among the long grass above. Thence, and from brimming feeders, which slip along, weed-choked, under white hawthorn hedges, and beneath the great roots of oak and elm, shall we pick out full many a goodly trout. There, in yon stop-hole underneath that tree, not ten feet broad or twenty long, where just enough water trickles through the hatches to make a ripple, are a brace of noble fish, no doubt; and one of them you may be sure of, if you will go the proper way to work, and fish scientifically with the brace of flies I have put on for you--a governor and a black alder. In the first place, you must throw up into the little pool, not down. If you throw down, they will see you in an instant; and besides, you will never get your fly close under the shade of the brickwork, where alone you have a chance. What use in throwing into the still shallow tail, shining like oil in the full glare of the sun? ...|$|E
50|$|Galerucella calmariensis is {{a species}} of leaf beetle in the family Chrysomelidae. It is {{commonly}} known as the black-margined loosestrife beetle and is native to Europe and Asia where both adults and larvae feed on <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> (Lythrum salicaria). It has been introduced in North America as a biological control agent for <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before these beetles were {{introduced}} to North America, the susceptibility of approximately 50 native plants of North America to the beetles was tested in Europe. Among the plants were several close relatives of <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife.</b> Only winged loosestrife (Lythrum alatum) proved to be susceptible, and was not used by the beetles as a host when <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> was available.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} <b>purple</b> <b>loosestrife.</b> This is an {{invasive}} plant that takes over lake shores and marshes, replacing cattails and other native wetland plants. <b>Purple</b> <b>loosestrife</b> doesn't provide a sufficient food source, nesting area, or {{cover for the}} native animals.
