At a special <b>performance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> blind, Helen Keller sat on the jury. The practice of using celebrity jurors continued throughout the Broadway run and in other productions.|$|E
5|$|Caligari did not {{immediately}} receive a wide distribution in France due to fears over the import of German films, but film director Louis Delluc organized a single screening of it on 14 November 1921, at the Colisée cinema in Paris {{as part of a}} benefit <b>performance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Red Cross. Afterward, the Cosmograph company bought the film's distribution rights and premiered it at the Ciné-Opéra on 2 March 1922. Caligari played in one Paris theatre for seven consecutive years, a record that remained intact until the release of Emmanuelle (1974). According to Janowitz, Caligari was also shown in such European cities as London, Rome, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Bucharest, as well as other countries like China, Japan, India, Turkey and South American nations.|$|E

5|$|For {{her next}} project, Moore {{actively}} looked for another comedy. She had {{a supporting role}} in Crazy, Stupid, Love, playing the estranged wife of Steve Carell, which was favorably reviewed and earned $142.8 million worldwide. Moore was not seen on screens again until March 2012, with a performance that received considerable praise and recognition. She starred in the HBO television film Game Change, a dramatization of Sarah Palin's 2008 campaign to become Vice President. Portraying a well-known figure was something she found challenging; in preparation, she conducted extensive research and worked with a dialect coach for two months. Although {{the response to the}} film was mixed, critics were highly appreciative of Moore's <b>performance.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> first time in her career, she received a Golden Globe, a Primetime Emmy, and a SAG Award.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Vijender {{accompanied}} by Sushil and boxer Mary Kom were garlanded with the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award—India's highest sporting honour. It {{was the first}} time that three sportspeople were picked for the award; the award selection committee decided to grant the award to all of them, taking into consideration their <b>performance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cycle of 2008–09. Kom and Vijender were the first boxers to get the award which carried prize money of Rs 750,000 and a citation. Both Sushil and Vijender were recommended to the Padma Shri awards committee, by the Indian Sports and Home Ministries; however, they were denied the awards after recommendations were not fruitful by the Padma Awards Committee for 2009 winners. The denial of Padma Shri for them created a furore among masses with allegations of promoting only a few sports. Vijender later took up a job with the Haryana Police department which paid him Rs 14,000 per month.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888, Riley {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. {{where he had}} dinner at the White House {{with other members of}} the International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. Riley made a brief <b>performance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.|$|E

5|$|In The Girlie Show in 1993, {{the song}} was {{performed}} in an alternate version as the second to last song of the tour. It had a military theme to it. Halfway through the performance Madonna paused the song for a military drill with the dancers and the audience. The performance met with strong reaction in Puerto Rico, when Madonna rubbed the Puerto Rican national flag between her legs in between the <b>performance.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> Drowned World Tour in 2001 Madonna wore a fur coat, velvet fedora and a customised Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt which proclaimed 'Mother' {{in the front and}} 'F*cker' in the back painted in silver. This demonstrated her ghetto-girl appearance adopted for the song's performance.|$|E

5|$|St. Anger was {{released}} on June 5, 2003. It was originally scheduled for June 10, but due to Metallica's previous battle with Napster, and fear {{that it would be}} released illegally onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks, the band pushed the release date ahead by five days. A special edition of the album {{was released}} with a bonus DVD, featuring live, in-the-studio rehearsals of all of the St. Anger tracks. First week sales of the album were 417,000 copies, and it debuted at number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, as well as in 30 other countries around the world.

5|$|The general {{phases of}} Zappa's music have been {{variously}} categorized under experimental rock, jazz, classical, avant-pop, experimental pop, comedy rock, doo-wop, jazz fusion, progressive rock, electronic, proto-prog, avant-jazz, and psychedelic rock. He generally {{did not have}} discrete periods where he performed one style or another but blended them together and reverted back as it interested him but his last studio album—1986's Jazz from Hell—marked a shift toward live orchestral <b>performance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last several years of his life.|$|E
5|$|On January 24, he {{contributed a}} game-high 32-point effort against the Springfield Armor, surpassing both his {{professional}} career-high of 27 set on January 9, 2011 with Cleveland and his post-secondary career-high 30 set on November 11, 2008 with Michigan. He earned the NBA Development League Performer of the Week for games played from January 23–29 for his three-game performance {{in which he}} averaged 25.0 points, 7.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 2.0 steals in 34.3 minutes per contest. On February 3, Harris logged his professional career-high 14 rebounds along with 21 points {{on his way to}} his second D-League double-double against the Austin Toros. On February 16, Harris posted a new career high 46 points along with 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 4 steals against the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. This is a Charge record for the franchise since its move to Canton. In the rematch two nights later, he added 36 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 steals. He became the first player to earn two player of the week awards in the 201112 season when the league recognized him for his <b>performance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> week of February 1319. In 17 games for Canton, he had averages of 21.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.6 blocks per game, while shooting 47% from the field and 40.9% on three-point shots.

After the second 10-day contract expired on March 11 and with the trade deadline approaching on March 15, the Cavaliers opted not to sign Harris to a guaranteed contract {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Robert Zemeckis, the director, {{originally}} wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg {{the creator}} of Family Ties, which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming Back to the Future, but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of <b>performance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> humor involved. Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open {{with the return of}} Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in Once Bitten, but it eventually went to Jim Carrey. During filming, Fox would rehearse for Family Ties from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the Back to the Future set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. Back to the Future was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million. Variety applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990).|$|E

5|$|White {{was drafted}} by the Fremantle Dockers as the number 1pick, which Fremantle were granted by the AFL because 1995 was the club's first season in the competition. White made his debut in Round3 of Fremantle's inaugural season in a victory over Fitzroy. He played six matches in 1995, kicking three goals but {{averaging}} less than three hit-outs per game. The 1996 season saw him play 13matches and kick 13goals and greatly improve his average number of disposals. He was nominated for the AFL Rising Star award in Round19 in a 24-point win against Collingwood. He had 22disposals, 11marks, kicked a goal and received three Brownlow Medal votes for his stand-out <b>performance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> season. In his final season at Fremantle, White took on greater responsibility of the ruck-work, and averaged 10hit-outs per game for the season. He played the first 12matches of the season, but was then dropped for nine matches until the final match of the season—and of his Fremantle career. Fremantle's performances were largely consistent during White's three seasons with them, as they finished 13th in both 1995 and 1996, and 12th in 1997.|$|E
