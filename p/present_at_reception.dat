25|$|Only {{seventeen}} years old, Victoria had to perform many tedious official duties. Almost every evening, {{she had to}} appear at formal dinners, theatrical performances or public receptions. If foreign relatives of the Hohenzollerns were located in Berlin or Potsdam, her protocolary duties widened.

40|$|This is an {{electronic}} {{version of an}} article published in AIDS Care. 2007 Feb; 19 (2) : 149 - 51. AIDS Care is available online at informaworldTMIn order to cope with the increasing patient load, a study was performed to identify bottlenecks in patient flow at the Infectious Diseases out-patient clinic in Kampala, Uganda on 10 January 2005. On a standardised questionnaire we recorded for all patients: the time they <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> <b>reception,</b> waiting times for different services and in- and out times for nursing, counselling and doctor visits. 250 patients visited the clinic the study day: 36 (20 per cent) were asymptomatic; 133 (75 per cent) symptomatic but not critically ill and 8 (4. 5 per cent) severely ill; 63 (37. 5 per cent) were on antiretroviral treatment. The median time spend at the clinic was 157 minutes (range 22 - 426). The median time from reception to the triage/vital-signs measuring unit was 34 minutes (range 3 - 92), from triage nurse to doctor 51 minutes (range 1 - 205), from doctor to pharmacy 24 minutes (range 5 - 292). The median waiting time at the pharmacy was 30 minutes (range 10 - 175). Based on these results, organisational changes were proposed. A similar methodology could be used to evaluate and compare health service delivery systems for persons with HIV infection in Africa in order to identify the most efficient models of care...|$|R

50|$|Queen Maria Theresa is {{described}} as badly dressed and did not answer to the ideal of a regal person: she disliked her public role and life at court and preferred to confine herself to her private rooms dedicated to needlework and her children. She had a good relationship to both her spouse and her stepson Francis: her stepson respected her and she used to demonstratively call him her son. Maria Theresa was interested in politics: she {{is known to have}} acted as the king's advisor and to have influenced him to be strict, and when she could not be <b>present</b> <b>at</b> the <b>reception</b> of officials and wished to hear the conversation, she listened to the talk behind the door. She nursed Ferdinand on his death bed.|$|R

60|$|It {{was upon}} {{the morning of}} the fifth day that I {{received}} a message from Duroc, who {{was the head of the}} household, that I was to attend the Emperor at the headquarters in the camp, and that a seat in one of the Imperial carriages would be at my disposal that I might proceed with the Court to Pont de Briques, there to be <b>present</b> <b>at</b> the <b>reception</b> of the Empress. When I arrived I was shown at once through the large entrance tent, and admitted by Constant into the room beyond, where the Emperor stood with his back to the fire, kicking his heels against the grate. Talleyrand and Berthier were in attendance, and de Meneval, the secretary, sat at the writing-table.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{performance}} analysis of wireless communication over α−η−μ fading channels has been investigated. First, analysis {{has been carried}} out for the case when communication is subjected to the influence of co-channel interference. Closed-form expressions have been derived for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the received signal-to-interference ratio. Outage probability has been obtained for this case, in the function of various values of system parameters, and also for the case when selection diversity has been <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> the <b>reception.</b> Further, simultaneous multipath fading and shadowing occurrence has been analyzed, through deriving novel composite Gamma long-time faded α−η−μ fading distribution. First-order statistical parameters have been obtained in closed form, for this novel composite distribution, and capitalizing on them, standard performance measures have been efficiently evaluated, graphically presented and discussed in the function of system parameters.|$|R

She {{arrived in the}} Loire River on 27 June 1917, and was {{assigned}} to patrol the south coast of Ireland, operating out of Queenstown, Ireland. Burrows patrolled; escorted convoys; answered Allied distress calls; landed survivors; and fought enemy submarines that hunted in the English Channel. On one occasion, she was in trouble with a broken oil line, which caused a fire on board. Four other destroyers assisted her in putting it out, but two crew members lost their lives.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of giving patients a handout about tetanus immunisation on the rate of immunisation against tetanus among adults in a general practice. DESIGN [...] Monthly tetanus immunisation rates were audited {{before and after the}} handout was introduced. SETTING [...] A practice with six doctors and a list of 11, 000 patients in an urban area of Hertfordshire. INTERVENTIONS [...] In the first month reception staff were instructed to give a handout about tetanus immunisation to all adults <b>presenting</b> <b>at</b> the <b>reception</b> desk. In the next seven months the doctors used the handouts opportunistically during consultations. RESULTS [...] No significant change in immunisation rate was detected in the first month in which the handouts were used. During the next seven months the median monthly rate rose threefold. CONCLUSION [...] Handouts given to patients can increase the uptake of preventive services in general practice...|$|R

In 1538 Long was appointed Master of the Buckhounds and Master of the Hawks. By 1539, he was a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, and was <b>present</b> <b>at</b> the <b>reception</b> of Anne of Cleves, also in 1539. He was MP for Southwark the same year. Surviving the fall of his patron Cromwell, Long became a prominent servant of the government throughout the 1540s.

5000|$|Farley {{had been}} on {{intimate}} personal terms with Fuad and A'ali Pasha, but after their fall he severely condemned the misrule and oppression of their successors. In consequence of the breaking out of the Bulgarian massacres in 1876, Farley published his ‘Turks and Christians: a Solution of the Eastern Question,’ which attracted much attention. The author suggested reforms which would combine administrative autonomy for the Christian populations with {{the maintenance of the}} authority of the sultan. Some of his suggestions were pressed upon the Porte by the great powers, and ultimately adopted. In 1878 Farley published a descriptive and historical work, entitled ‘Egypt, Cyprus, and Asiatic Turkey.’ On the formation of the new principality of Bulgaria in 1880, he journeyed to Sofia in order to be <b>present</b> <b>at</b> the <b>reception</b> of the newly elected ruler, Prince Alexander I. On his return to England he published a monograph on the principality and its governor, under the title of ‘New Bulgaria.’ ...|$|R
50|$|The 1940s and 1950s brought {{controversy}} and change to Pushman's world. In 1940 he sued the New York Graphic Society for reproducing a painting without his permission. While initially the ruling {{went against the}} painter, it was eventually reversed; the decision now protects artists' creative works. He had often turned down buyers interested in his work, reportedly once refusing an offer of $6,000 for a small canvas; in 1942 became only the second painter in 117 years to refuse entry into the National Academy. In 1958 the Grand Central Art Galleries, which had been Pushman's home since they opened in 1923, were {{forced out of the}} Grand Central Terminal. Eighty-one-year-old Pushman was <b>present</b> <b>at</b> the final <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> the Galleries' Terminal location, which was attended by more than 400 people.|$|R

The {{goal of this}} {{workshop}} is {{to provide}} a forum for disseminating new and ongoing research in the development and practice of compositional theory and technology. Through CRTS, the community creates a compiled source on this topic, serving as a foundation for tackling the unprecedented increase in complexity of today’s real-time embedded systems. In this year’s workshop, we have extended the scope to include practical issues in composition, experimental compositional frameworks, and compositional multi-mode systems. For the first time, we also have a best paper award, which will be <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> the Welcome <b>Reception,</b> after the workshop.
