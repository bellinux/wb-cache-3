40|$|Mobile IPv 6 enables mobile {{clients to}} retain its network {{connections}} while roaming into foreign networks. However, in a multi-server environment whereby multiple mirror servers are located at different IP networks providing the same service, a mobile client consuming a service from a particular server continues consuming the service from the same server after roaming into foreign network, ignoring the existence of other mirror servers that may give higher throughput based on mobile client's latest network location. In this paper, we propose an active anycast-based server selection model that enables roaming mobile client to detect and access a mirror server that gives better performance based on the mobile client's latest network location. Two schemes are proposed for such performance enhancement, namely: Best <b>Performance</b> <b>Scheme</b> (BPS), and Acceptable <b>Performance</b> <b>Scheme</b> (APS). In BPS, mobile client re-initiates the server selection process whenever it roams into a foreign network. In APS, mobile client re-initiates the server selection process only if the throughput of the current server drops to a dissatisfactory level.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} a national primary care pay for <b>performance</b> <b>scheme,</b> the Quality and Outcomes Framework in England, on emergency hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs). DESIGN: Controlled longitudinal study. SETTING: English National Health Service between 1998 / 99 and 2010 / 11. PARTICIPANTS: Populations registered with each of 6975 family practices in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Year specific differences between trend adjusted emergency hospital admission rates for incentivised ACSCs before and after the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework scheme and two comparators: non-incentivised ACSCs and non-ACSCs. RESULTS: Incentivised ACSC admissions showed a relative reduction of 2. 7 % (95 % confidence interval 1. 6 % to 3. 8 %) {{in the first year of}} the Quality and Outcomes Framework compared with ACSCs that were not incentivised. This increased to a relative reduction of 8. 0 % (6. 9 % to 9. 1 %) in 2010 / 11. Compared with conditions that are not regarded as being influenced by the quality of ambulatory care (non-ACSCs), incentivised ACSCs also showed a relative reduction in rates of emergency admissions of 2. 8 % (2. 0 % to 3. 6 %) in the first year increasing to 10. 9 % (10. 1 % to 11. 7 %) by 2010 / 11. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of a major national pay for <b>performance</b> <b>scheme</b> for primary care in England was associated with a decrease in emergency admissions for incentivised conditions compared with conditions that were not incentivised. Contemporaneous health service changes seem unlikely to have caused the sharp change in the trajectory of incentivised ACSC admissions immediately after the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework. The decrease seems larger than would be expected from the changes in the process measures that were incentivised, suggesting that the pay for <b>performance</b> <b>scheme</b> may have had impacts on quality of care beyond the directly incentivised activities...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. This mini-dissertation {{investigates the}} {{influence}} that an outcome-based remuneration scheme can have on productivity in the financial sector. It focuses on four dimensions {{that were used to}} determine if productivity levels could be affected; all of these four dimensions could be linked back to the performance of the employee and employer. The four dimensions were units produced, overtime, absenteeism and till cash up which speaks to the quality of transactions that were processed. When these four dimensions were tested statistically the results tended to suggest that there is a positive association with productivity and an outcome-based remuneration scheme. This simply means that an outcome-based remuneration scheme increases productivity levels in the workplace, more specifically in the financial sector; the literature review also supports this statement. The study also deals briefly with {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} a pay for <b>performance</b> <b>scheme</b> as well as when designing a pay for <b>performance</b> <b>scheme</b> what are the key design elements. It also briefly touches on the implementation of such a scheme, whether pay for performance is sustainable over a period of time and what are the most common types of pay for performance schemes.
