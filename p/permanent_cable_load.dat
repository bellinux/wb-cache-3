40|$|This study {{evaluated}} spinal loads {{associated with}} lifting and hanging heavy mining cable {{in a variety}} of postures. This electrical cable can weigh up to 10 kg per metre and is often lifted in restricted spaces in underground coal mines. Seven male subjects performed eight cable lifting and hanging tasks, while trunk kinematic data and trunk muscle electromyograms (EMGs) were obtained. The eight tasks were combinations of four postures (standing, stooping kneeling on one knee, or kneeling on both knees) and two levels of <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> (0 N or 100 N load added to the existing cable weight). An EMG-assisted model was used to calculate forces and moments acting on the lumbar spine. A two-way split-plot ANOVA showed that increased load (p< 0. 05) and changes in lifting posture (p< 0. 05) independently affected trunk muscle recruitment and spinal loading. The increase in <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> resulted in higher EMG activity of all trunk muscles and increased axial and lateral bending moments on the spine (p < 0. 05). Changes in posture caused more selective adjustments in muscle recruitment and affected the sagittal plane moment (p < 0. 05). Despite the more selective nature of trunk EMG changes due to posture, the magnitude of changes in spinal loading was often quite dramatic. However, average compression values exceeded 3400 N for all cable lifting tasks...|$|R

40|$|Multi-wire cable {{structures}} {{are widely used}} in civil engineering applications such as stay cables in suspension bridges, elevators and overhead electric transmission lines. The loss of <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> and presence of cable breakage can be catastrophic for the entire structure. Various techniques have been applied to the non-destructive monitoring of structural health of multi-wire cable structures. However, few of them could fully characterize the early structural degradation or reliably determine the damage mechanism due to the limited access to structural components and other environmental factors. In this thesis, a guided wave-based structural health monitoring system {{that is capable of}} monitoring the <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> levels and detecting defect simultaneously is developed for multi-wire cable structures. A series of finite element analysis were conducted using Abaqus/Explicit to explore the feasibility of using ultrasonic guided waves to detect the notch in multi-wire cable structures, followed by the experimental verification on a seven wire strand. Both numerical studies and experimental works presented in this research have revealed that guided waves could be a promising technique for defect detection in multi-wire cable structures. On the other hand, finite element analyses were conducted in this study to investigate the nonlinear characteristics of ultrasonic guided waves in a multi-wire cable under different preloaded levels. The wave signals after a fast Fourier transform indicate that second harmonic peak together with the calculated nonlinear parameters decreased as the preload level increased. The corresponding wave energy was integrated to minimise the adverse influence caused by dispersion and multimodality during wave propagation. The results revealed a similar trend, which demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasonic guided waves to monitor the load level in multi-wire cable structures...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{interconnections}} among electronic devices are performed by means of randomly twisted bundle of wires, particularly for transport and industrial applications.

It also allows for a statistical analysis of crosstalk because it can simulate independent different realizations of the same interconnection.
