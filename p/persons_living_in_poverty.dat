5000|$|The {{poor health}} {{outcomes}} mentioned {{seem to be}} a product of the impact of social determinants of health in a rural setting for a <b>person</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty.</b> Social determinants of health are strong contributors of respective health outcomes education. Causes of <b>poverty</b> <b>in</b> rural areas includes low income, lack of employment, the high costs of new housing construction, poor quality of housing (leading to higher costs for heating), poor health and lack of healthcare within a reasonable traveling distance, and low levels of education. All of which are related to social determinants of health and impact health outcomes for those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty.</b> Specific social determinants of health that contribute to rural poverty and poor health outcomes include: income, employment and working conditions, economy, population demographics, housing, health, education, child and youth development, gender, and culture. Social determinants of health are extremely relevant to the cause and effect of rural poverty and health. For example, those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> lower-income households tend to live in older, poor quality housing units which are often inadequately insulated and have high heat and utility costs.

40|$|A {{study to}} assess {{attribution}} {{theory and the}} work done by social workers with wealthy and poor families was performed using two vignettes identical in information suggesting abuse, with one described as a wealthy family {{and the other a}} family <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty.</b> Attribution theory suggests that humans label and assume certain traits to be true of different persons based on their status in our society. A person with a wealthy status may be viewed by their social worker as less likely to be abusive to their children because of their status, while a <b>person</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty</b> would be assumed to be more likely because of their status. So, it was hypothesized that social workers reading the wealthy vignette would note less of a concern about the observed potentially abusive situation in comparison with the responses given to the social workers reading about the same situation occurring <b>in</b> a family <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty.</b> The vignettes were randomly distributed to 29 students and 14 professional social workers. Who were then asked to respond to the statements about the children in the family and the types of action the social worker should take, based on the suggested physical abuse in the vignettes. Findings do not show a statistically significant difference between responses given by social workers with the wealthy vignettes and social workers with the poor vignettes. However, differences in the mean responses of the wealthy and poor vignettes showed that the social workers who responded to the poor vignettes may have felt more urgency to follow up on the observed behavior because of potential abuse. This may be because of daily stressors that are typical of a family <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty.</b> Parents <b>living</b> lives <b>in</b> <b>poverty</b> experience daily stressors and the emotions that accompany them may result in abusive or neglectful behavior.

30|$|With poverty {{reduction}} {{being one of}} the five targets of the EU 2020 process, poverty is currently high on the agenda for the European Union and the 27 Member States. The applied methodology of measuring poverty and social exclusion (EU-SILC) calls for critical reflection, because it systematically overlooks absolute or extreme forms of poverty. Thus, the most vulnerable remain invisible. This fact poses a major challenge for future planning and the future of social policies. This article proposes an understanding of poverty as restricted access to relevant futures: a deprivation of access to possibilities and chances. Following this, we argue that “invisible” <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> conditions of severe poverty are forced into horizons of damaged futures. Furthermore, a failure to “see” these forms of poverty has an impact on the already limited future prospects of these groups on yet another level. The most vulnerable, such as homeless children, undocumented refugees and asylum seekers, migrant beggars and other homeless people, are excluded from both analysis and social policies. This can be regarded as a second-order methodological neglect of relevant futures. Overcoming such second-order neglect is a necessary and first step towards establishing choices about relevant futures for these persons. There is a moral as well as an epistemic responsibility vis-à-vis those “invisible” groups. This is the basis for alleviating conditions of access to relevant futures.

40|$|MSc (Med), (Bioethics and Health Law), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandAccess {{to health}} care is a constitutionally {{recognized}} right, under section 27 of the South African Constitution. Fifteen years post the first democratic election in South Africa the realization of this right is the focus of this research report. In 1997 the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), a statutory body assigned to evaluate the realization of access {{to health care}}, held a public enquiry into the matter. The report was released in early 2009. The public health care system was found to be in a „lamentable state‟. South Africa faces a number of challenges that complicate the progressive realization of access to health care. For example, the country is currently in recession; the HIV / AIDS statistics is {{among the highest in the}} world placing a huge burden on public health; South Africa has the highest income inequality globally and the gap between public and private health care, with regards to affordability and quality of service remains a great concern. A way of addressing this problem is to engage ethical principles such as beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and (distributive) justice. Each of these in application can argue a case for the moral obligation to initiate a more effective national health care system. Rawls 1 (1999) emphasized the centrality of justice in consideration of the bio-medical principles. 1 Rawls, J. 1999. A Theory of Justice. Revised edition. Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press., 1971. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972. The principle of justice and its derivative, distributive justice, is of importance when making a moral argument for equal access to health care for all. Farmer and Campos (2004 : 28) rightly asks 2 : “What does it mean, for both bioethics and human rights, when a <b>person</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty</b> is able to vote, is protected from torture or from imprisonment without due process, but dies of untreated AIDS? What does it mean when a person with renal failure experiences no abuse of his or her civil and political rights, but dies without ever having been offered access to dialysis, to say nothing of transplant?” There is a need for ethicists to become more involved in arguments pertaining to the inequalities in distribution of social goods. Legislation and case law in South Africa also affirm the right to access health care services and have as their grounding normative ethical tenets. The recommendations made by the SAHRC, together with the planned national health insurance aimed at addressing the gap between public and private health care, can only become a reality through successful implementation of a monitored process based on ethical principles. There is a need for a practical implementation of current ethico-legal and human rights principles through every phase of the health care system to serve as monitors to ensure the success of this guaranteed right that so few people have genuinely seen realized. The findings of the SAHRC, together with the response from the Department of Health, serve as a basis for planning towards successful 2 Farmer, P. and Campos, N. G. 2004.

To aid in this process an ethical framework could be of use to assess the policies formed along the way as well as the practical implementation thereof. This research report is an analysis of current literature and data available on access to health care in South Africa in light of human rights and ethical arguments for its provision. The aim is to reflect on the realization of greater access to health care since 1994, identifying current hampering factors in achieving this and proposing a broad set of guidelines that can be applied to the reform process already underway in South African health care...|$|R
40|$|This Part {{addresses}} the dual, interrelated themes of socio-economic rights {{and access to}} justice. Both themes {{raise questions about the}} capacity of human rights law to effect positive social change in practice. The indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights is a core feature of the contemporary human rights regime, yet the inadequacy of mechanisms for redressing socio-economic rights violations in particular continues to feature in debates about the potential of transnational and domestic legal systems to combat social exclusion. The four chapters in this section, which are introduced below, tease out how well the Convention and the ECHR Act serve the interests of people living in poverty and other vulnerable populations. Significantly, they interrogate substantive and procedural aspects of European human rights law {{from the vantage point of}} such groups. As the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights observes access to justice does not simply correlate with the ability to invoke one 2 ̆ 7 s rights, it also encompasses the substance of those rights: Many laws are inherently biased against <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty,</b> do not recognize or prioritize the abuses they regularly suffer, or have a disproportionately harsh impact on them. For example, in many legal systems, economic, social and cultural rights are not sufficiently protected, and discrimination on the grounds of socioeconomic situation is not recognized. Similarly, issues such as abuses in the informal employment sector or the exploitation of tenants by landlords, all of which disproportionately affect <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty,</b> are often not legislated against in an effective manner. Meanwhile, actions which are undertaken by <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty</b> out of necessity, such as sleeping in public spaces or street vending, are criminalized. Hence, reforms aimed at improving access to justice by the poor must not neglect the need to modify or repeal certain laws or strengthen others...|$|E

40|$|Urban {{inequality}} {{has emerged}} as one of the dominant themes of modern life and globalization. More than three million people experienced homelessness in the United States last year; in Miami-Dade, more than 15, 000 individuals were homeless. Surviving extreme poverty, and exiting or avoiding homelessness, involves negotiating a complex mix of public and private assistance. However, a range of factors influence what types of help are available and how they can be accessed. Frequently, larger social structures determine which resource are available, leaving many choices entirely out of the individual 2 ̆ 7 s control. For single men, who are ineligible for many benefits, homelessness can be difficult to avoid and even harder to exit. My study seeks to better understand how adult, minority men <b>living</b> <b>in</b> extreme <b>poverty</b> <b>in</b> Miami-Dade negotiate their daily survival. Specific research questions address: Do black and Hispanic men who are homeless or at risk of homelessness have different personal characteristics and different experiences in avoiding or exiting homelessness? How does Miami 2 ̆ 7 s response to extreme poverty/homelessness, including availability of public benefits and public and private service organizations, either maximize or constrain the choices available to this population? And, what is the actual experience of single, adult men who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, in negotiating their daily survival? A mixed methods approach combines quantitative survey data from 7, 605 homeless men, with qualitative data from 54 semi-structured interviews incorporating the visual ethnography techniques of Photo Elicitation Interviewing. Results show the differences experienced by black and Hispanic men who are poor and homeless in Miami. Findings also highlight how the community 2 ̆ 7 s official and unofficial responses to homelessness intersect with the actual experiences of the persons targeted by the policies and programs, challenging preconceived notions regarding the lives of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> extreme <b>poverty.</b> It adds to the existing body of literature by focusing on the urban Miami context, emphasizing disparities amongst racial and ethnic groups. Findings are intended to provide an empirically grounded thesis that humanizes the subjects and illuminates their personal experiences, helping to inform public policy around the needs of extremely poor populations. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} section, we {{elaborate}} {{the argument that}} poverty can {{be understood in terms}} of neglected futures. According to a widely shared concept initially proposed by Amartya Sen, poverty can be conceptualized as a deprivation of capabilities. The term “deprivation” indicates a culpable omission, or even an explicit act robbing someone of the possibility of being someone or doing something. There is a moment of “agency” involved in this analysis. Deprivations of capabilities lead to a limitation of “freedoms to choose”, and hence to limitations on the freedoms to plan a life or to build a life in a step-by-step manner. Poor people cannot develop what John Rawls called a “life plan”, an architecture of goals and strategies to reach those goals in order to realize their potential. <b>Poverty</b> kills futures. <b>In</b> her well known diary of her life in a favela in São Paulo in the 1950 s, Carolina Maria de Jesus talks about the loss of peace of mind resulting from the uncontrollable risks and uncertainties about the future. This is a burden with regard to the “big future” {{as well as for the}} “little future” of the day ahead: “In the morning I’m always nervous. I’m afraid of not getting money to buy food to eat” [1]. Poverty kills futures (of adults) and “future futures” (of children). We can read in the diary that there is no future for a child <b>living</b> <b>in</b> severe <b>poverty</b> <b>in</b> a favela: “A child died here in the favela. He was 2  months old. If he had lived he would have gone hungry” [1]. Carolina Maria de Jesus was lucky in the sense that her diary was published and she could move out of the favela. But again, her future was damaged. Robert Levine observed: “By the time she was liberated from the favela by a stroke of fate, it was too late. She was exhausted, too beaten down to learn middle-class manners, to censor her thoughts, to remove the layers of suffering from her psyche” [2]. For a <b>person</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> conditions of <b>poverty,</b> a number of relevant future scenarios have been rendered impossible. “Relevant” futures are personally desirable scenarios that can be justified on the grounds of human rights. Poverty limits both conceptions of and access to relevant futures.|$|R

For long-term nutritional status, the analysis employs arm span as a proxy for the quality of nutrition acquired in childhood, which positively affects the development of cognitive ability (Case and Paxson 2008; Guven and Lee 2013, 2015). Therefore, our paper follows a large body of recent research documenting the importance of accounting for parental input and schooling at early ages in the formation of cognitive skills (Todd and Wolpin 2003; Cunha et al. 2006; Cunha et al. 2010; Cunha and Heckman 2007, 2008). For short-term nutritional status, the analysis utilizes individuals’ haemoglobin levels.
