40|$|Determination of the {{peroxides}} formed during blowing {{with air}} or oxygen {{at room temperature}} has been regarded as the best method for testing the stability of fat oils, and especially for determination of their induction periods. The present investigations are chiefly dealing with airblowing of medicinal cod liver oils, to find if a more rapid stability test can be obtained for these oils by elevation of the reaction temperature. The results can be summarized as follows: 1. The oils were treated with air in an apparatus permitting controlled temperature and airstream conditions (fig. 1). 2. No reaction products with prooxidativ effect were blown off the oils with the airstream at a temperature of 40 ° C. Diffuse daylight, the humidity of the air, or filtering of the oils, were all factors of minor importance. 3. Increase in the airstream increased the rate of peroxidation considerably, but to a very different degree in different cod liver oils. In relation to calculated zero <b>peroxide</b> <b>numbers</b> (airstream->O), the blowing with 50 l-air per hour at 40 ° C through 30 g oil, increased the rate of peroxidation from 50, 5 to 113, 5 °/o. The stability test therefore {{must be carried out}} with minimum airstream. 5 l air per hour through 30 g oil was found to give relatively small errors, {{and at the same time}} sufficient stirring of the oils. 4. For resistent oils the absorbtion of oxygen per hour increased with the time. Destearinized oils, on the other hand, showed no induction period, and a slight decrease in the rate of peroxidation with the time took place. 5. The temperature coefficients of the resistant oils showed no relation to the temperature or the blowing time, but changed extremely irregular. For the destearinized oils these coefficients showed considerable constancy, averaging 1, 71 from 19 ° C and upwards to 70 ° C. 6. The reliable stability relations of the steam rendered cod liver oils, expressed as quotients of the increase in their <b>peroxide</b> <b>numbers</b> after airblowing at 20 ° C for 72 hours, equalled the stability relations found by blowing at 60 ° C for 3 hours. This was especially true for the destearinized oils. No other blowing time at any elevated temperatures up to 70 ° C gave these stability relations. 7. By destearination of the oils the antioxidants were filtered off with the stearin - this -was also the case with the bulk of the oil components containing phosphorus. This indicates that the antioxidants in unstearinized cod liver oils are mainly phosphatides. 8. The antioxidants in unstearinized oils were destroyed in about 1 / 2 hour by 100 ° C. 9. Washing with destilled water increased the stability. 10. In a liver oil, stored airtight for half a year, the decomposition of peroxides and the formation of epihydrinaldehyd (Kreistest) approximately paralleled each other. 11. Unstearinized oils, produced by centrifugal methods from the fresh residues of steamheated cod livers, had much lower resistance to oxidation than the corresponding steam rendered oils...|$|R

Analysis of the kinetic data as a function of DeltaG(ET) (0) correlates well with theories of ET modified for the non-adiabatic nature of the ET to <b>peroxides.</b> A <b>number</b> of thermochemical parameters are estimated from the analysis, in particular the intrinsic barrier (DeltaG(0) (not equal)) that is comprised of the solvent reorganization energy (lambda) and the bond dissociation enthalpy of the O-O bond.

By HPLC-UV the AA evaluated tocopherols and squalene concentrations, of an extravirgin olive oil subjected to domestic frying. Results {{show that the}} squalene is more resistant to thermal degradation than α-tocopherol. The bi-dimensional fluorescence characterization (excitation-emission matrix EEM analysis) allowed to detect, among degradation products, tetraconjugated double bond compounds as parinaric acid isomers. From evolution of UV spectroscopy data, viscosity, infrared spectroscopy, free fatty acids, <b>peroxide</b> <b>number,</b> a reaction mechanism has been proposed to clarify formation of conjugated double bond compounds...|$|E

The aim of {{the study}} was {{evaluation}} of ef-fect of fried dishes assortment on quality of obtained post-frying soy bean oil, with regard to its utilization as a substrate for production of engine biofuel. For the purpose of analy sis of <b>peroxide</b> <b>number,</b> acid number and fatty acids com position, samples of oil after each of fi ve heating cycles from each of three batches of oil differentiated by me thod of processing pre-ceding oil sampling (frying pota to chips, frying breadcrumbs coated fi sh fi ngers and he ating without fried product) were taken. Purchased soy bean oil and post-frying oil prepared dur-ing processing of each of above mentioned batches were sub-jected to esterifi cation with methanol. Fuel obtained this way was used in engine tests. Heating of soybean oil caused changes in the values of peroxide and acid number and fatty acid composition. These changes were depended on the method of heating oil. Utiliza-tion of esters as biocomponent of diesel fu el did not cause sig-nifi cant changes of investigated engi ne work parameters, when compared to conventional fu el. However, reduction of torque value, decrease of po wer and increase of specifi c and hourly fuel consumption were noticeable.

Gaseous compositions used were: MAP 1 (75 % O 2 : 25 % CO 2); MAP 2 (70 % O 2 : 30 %CO 2) and MAP 3 (80 % O 2 : 20 % CO 2). Sensory evaluations of meat color and chemical properties (acid <b>number,</b> <b>peroxide</b> value, aw, pH, TVB-N and TBARs), were carried on the 1 st, 5 th, 7 th, 9 th and 12 th day of storage. The sensory evaluations of chop color in different MAP compositions are analyzed in relation to storage period, measured chemical properties and instrumental determination of meat color using linear and multivariate linear regression analysis...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} hydrogen peroxide exposure on the survival and proliferation of cultured lens epithelial cells.  METHODS—TOTL- 86 cells, a line of rabbit lens epithelial cells, were used. The survival and proliferation of TOTL- 86 cells were quantified by a rapid colorimetric assay (MTT assay). To {{determine the effects of}} hydrogen peroxide, TOTL- 86 cells were exposed to different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. To determine the effect of cell numbers on the survival and proliferation of TOTL- 86 cells at a fixed concentration of hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> different <b>numbers</b> of cells were plated and exposed to hydrogen peroxide. To determine whether there is a synergistic effect between hydrogen peroxide and EGF, bFGF, PDGF-AA, and insulin, TOTL- 86 cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide combined with one of these growth factors.  RESULTS—High levels (1  mM) of hydrogen peroxide killed TOTL- 86 cells and sublethal levels (100  µM) suppressed their proliferation. From 1  nM to 1  µM of hydrogen peroxide, there was a dose dependent increase in the cell numbers. The initial seeded cell number dramatically affected the response to hydrogen peroxide. Although growth factors showed no synergistic effects with hydrogen peroxide on proliferation, both EGF and insulin, but not bFGF or PDGF, rescued TOTL- 86 cells from the sublethal effect.  CONCLUSION—Hydrogen peroxide in cooperation with some growth factors {{plays an important role in}} the proliferation of lens epithelial cell. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicromolar {{concentrations}} of l-histidine increase the cytotoxicity of hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> in a <b>number</b> of cell lines including CHO(hamster), EAHY, McCoy's, U 937 and CCRF-CEM (human), Vero (monkey) and SC- 1 (mouse). Importantly, these cell lines displayed differentt degrees of sensitivity to H 2 O 2 alone {{and the extent}} of enhancement elicited by the amino acid was more pronounced in resistant cell lines. The increased cytotoxicity was invariably associated with the formation of DNA DSBs and a remarkable correlation was found by plotting the level of DNA DSBs against the cytotoxic response. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the mechanism whereby l-histidine increases the toxicity elicited by H 2 O 2 involves the formation of DNA DSBs and are consistent with the possibility that the amino acid might participate in the regulation of the physio-pathological response to oxidative stress in mammals...|$|R
