According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which are not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the padmasana posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by a sage, who saw Vishnu's consort Lakshmi massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana.|$|E

5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals.

Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of <b>people</b> <b>during</b> Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E
