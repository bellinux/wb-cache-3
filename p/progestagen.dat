In the present study, faecal samples from three black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis michaeli) were collected at about weekly intervals during oestrous cycles and pregnancy. Daily samples were taken during the week after parturition. Total immunoreactive <b>progestagens</b> in faecal extracts were analysed with three different enzymeimmunoassays (EIA) that had considerable specificity for <b>progestagens</b> containing either a 20 =ahydroxylor a 20 -keto group. With each EIA {{it was possible to}} distinguish between the follicular and luteal phases of the oestrous cycle. Mating corresponded with low concentrations of faecal <b>progestagens.</b> Samples from five and six consecutive cycles were available from two rhinoceroses and cycle lengths of 24 and 26. 5 days were calculated. All three animals became pregnant and the duration of gestation ranged from 440 to 470 days. After fertilization, the concentration of <b>progestagens</b> increased continuously, as in the luteal phase, reaching values 5 =n- 0 times higher between days 60 and 250. During the two weeks before parturition faecal <b>progestagens</b> declined and within 3 =n- days post partum had reached follicular phase values.

40|$|Progestagenic {{compounds}} {{are emerging}} contaminants found in surface and ground water around the world. Information {{on the effects}} and potency of <b>progestagens</b> is {{needed in order to}} understand the environmental risks posed by these compounds. Using the Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis test system, developmental and reproductive toxicity after exposure to selected <b>progestagens</b> were determined. Larval exposure to levonorgestrel (LNG) severely impaired oviduct and ovary development causing sterility. No effects on testicular development, spermcount or male fertility were observed. Hepatic mRNA expression of the androgen receptor was increased in the females indicating that the receptor is involved in LNG-induced developmental reproductive toxicity. Exposure of adult females to LNG, norethindrone (NET) or progesterone (P) increased the proportions of previtellogenic oocytes and reduced the proportions of vitellogenic oocytes compared with the controls, indicating an inhibited vitellogenesis. The effects on oocyte development were ascertained at environmentally relevant concentrations of LNG, NET and P (1. 3, 1 and 10 ng/L respectively). Since unintentional co-exposure of <b>progestagens</b> and ethinylestradiol (EE 2) occurs in wildlife and also in human infants, data on mixture effects of combined exposures to these hormones during development are needed. Co-exposure during development showed antagonistic effects of EE 2 and LNG. EE 2 caused a female biased sex ratio which showed a tendency to be antagonized by LNG. Moreover, the hepatic AR induction by LNG was counteracted by co-exposure to EE 2. In conclusion, the results show that female amphibians are susceptible to reproductive toxicity of <b>progestagens</b> after developmental exposure as well as after adult exposure during the breeding period. The differentiating Müllerianduct and ovary, and the egg development are sensitive targets for <b>progestagens.</b> Finally, the findings reported in this thesis show that environmental <b>progestagens</b> impairs reproductive function in amphibians and may present a threat to reproduction in wild populations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Gestation {{length in}} swine has a {{considerable}} amplitude and both early and delayed parturition are common. This variation increases {{the occurrence of}} unassisted farrowing and {{could lead to a}} wide-ranging age at weaning for piglets born from one batch. Supervision of sow parturition is crucial to reduce mortality of neonate piglets. To facilitate assistance, induction of farrowing using prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) has been widely used in batch farrowing systems, whereby synchronization would concentrate the time of farrowing, allowing for better organization of employees. However, a viable alternative method that can be implemented to manage farrowing is to sustain high <b>progestagen</b> levels {{in the final days of}} gestation and, consequently, prevent early parturition. Efficient techniques to delay farrowing such as using oral <b>progestagen</b> supplementation have been previously described, but are only recently being considered for commercial use. The present manuscript reviews publications regarding delaying parturition and discusses the use of intravaginal devices (IVDs) containing <b>progestagen.</b> There is limited data addressing the effect of <b>progestagen</b> treatment during gestation on productive and reproductive performance. Therefore, future studies should focus on improving synchronization protocols following <b>progestagen</b> supplementation and evaluating piglet viability and sow fertility, before widely using <b>progestagen</b> supplementation to manipulate parturition...|$|E

40|$|The {{utility and}} safety of {{postmenopausal}} hormone replacement therapy has recently been put into question by large clinical trials. Their outcome has been extensively commented upon, but discussions have mainly been limited {{to the effects of}} estrogens. In fact, <b>progestagens</b> are generally only considered with respect to their usefulness in preventing estrogen stimulation of uterine hyperplasia and malignancy. In addition, various risks have been attributed to <b>progestagens</b> and their omission from hormone replacement therapy has been considered, but this may underestimate their potential benefits and therapeutic promises. A major reason for the controversial reputation of <b>progestagens</b> is that they are generally considered as a single class. Moreover, the term progesterone is often used as a generic one for the different types of both natural and synthetic <b>progestagens.</b> This is not appropriate because natural progesterone has properties very distinct from the synthetic progestins. Within the nervous system, the neuroprotective and promyelinating effects of progesterone are promising, not only for preventing but also for reversing age-dependent changes and dysfunctions. There is indeed strong evidence that the aging nervous system remains at least to some extent sensitive to these beneficial effects of progesterone. The actions of progesterone in peripheral target tissues including breast, blood vessels, and bones are less well understood, but there is evidence for the beneficial effects of progesterone. The variety of signaling mechanisms of progesterone offers exciting possibilities for the development of more selective, efficient, and safe <b>progestagens.</b> The recognition that progesterone is synthesized by neurons and glial cells requires a reevaluation of hormonal aging...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{overpopulation}} of African {{elephants in}} South Africa {{and the consequent}} threat to biodiversity, {{the need for a}} method of population control has become evident. The potential use of the porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccine as a safe and effective means for population control is explored. While potential effects of pZP treatment on social behaviour of African elephants have been investigated, no examination of the influence of pZP vaccination on the endocrine correlates in treated females has been undertaken. The ovarian activity of freeranging, pZP-treated African elephant females was monitored non-invasively for one year duration by measuring faecal <b>progestagen</b> concentrations via enzyme immunoassay. Behavioural observations were recorded for comparison with <b>progestagen</b> concentrations and to determine any behavioural changes surrounding the pZP vaccine darting event. Each elephant under study showed <b>progestagen</b> concentrations rising above baseline at some period during the study indicating luteal functionality. Average <b>progestagen</b> concentrations were 1. 61 ± 0. 46 ìg/g. Within sampled females, 42. 9 % exhibited oestrous cycles within the range reported for African elephants, 14. 3 % had irregular cycles, and 42. 9 % {{did not appear to be}} cycling. Average oestrous cycle duration was 14. 72 ± 0. 85 weeks. Behavioural oestrous coincided with the onset of the luteal phase and a subsequent rise in <b>progestagen</b> concentrations. Focal sampling to determine activity budgets before and after the darting event revealed no significant change in behavioural activities. In the week following immunization, individual <b>progestagen</b> concentrations decreased significantly from overall average concentrations. Average <b>progestagen</b> concentrations positively correlated with rainfall and with herd dominance. No association between average individual <b>progestagen</b> concentrations or cyclicity status with age, lactation, or parity were detected. Earlier determination of efficacy was made indicating reproductive control was established 22 months post-treatment. Results indicate the presence of ovarian activity amongst pZP-treated female African elephants in two years following initial immunization. Further study should be aimed toward studying the long term effects of pZP vaccination on the reproductive function of female African elephants. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{extensive}} epidemiological {{evidence that}} menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) increases breast cancer risk, particularly combinations of estrogen and <b>progestagen</b> (EP). We investigated {{the effects of}} the specific formulations and types of therapies used by French women. <b>Progestagen</b> constituents, regimen (continuous or sequential treatment by the <b>progestagen),</b> and time interval between onset of menopause and start of MHT were examined. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study in France in 1555 menopausal women (739 cases and 816 controls). Detailed information on MHT use was obtained during in-person interviews. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence interval adjusted for breast cancer risk factors were calculated. RESULTS: We found that breast cancer risk differed by type of <b>progestagen</b> among current users of EP therapies. No increased risk was apparent among EP therapy users treated with natural micronized progesterone. Among users of EP therapy containing a synthetic progestin, the odds ratio was 1. 57 (0. 99 - 2. 49) for progesterone-derived and 3. 35 (1. 07 - 10. 4) for testosterone-derived <b>progestagen.</b> Women with continuous regimen were at greater risk than women treated sequentially, but regimen and type of <b>progestagen</b> could not be investigated independently, as almost all EP combinations containing a testosterone-derivative were administered continuously and vice-versa. Tibolone was also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Early users of MHT after onset of menopause were at greater risk than users who delayed treatment. CONCLUSION: This study confirms differential effects on breast cancer risk of progestagens and regimens specifically used in France. Formulation of EP therapies containing natural progesterone, frequently prescribed in France, was not associated with increased risk of breast cancer but may poorly protect against endometrial cancer...|$|E

Animals in LT-FGA (long-term <b>progestagen</b> treatment), ST-FGA (short-term <b>progestagen</b> treatment) and Gn-ST-FGA (GnRH-short-term <b>progestagen</b> treatment) groups received an intravaginal sponge (day 0) containing 30 mg fluorogestone acetate (FGA) for 14, 8 and 8 days, respectively, plus 75 μg cloprostenol i. m. 24 h before sponge removal and 400 I. U. equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) i. m. at the time of sponge removal. In addition, the goats in the Gn-ST-FGA group received 10. 5 μg busereline acetate i. m. at the time of sponge insertion (day 0). Oestrus response for all treatment groups was 100 %. The mean interval from sponge removal and the onset of oestrus for the LT-FGA, ST-FGA and Gn-ST-FGA groups was 28. 0 ± 1. 0 h, 28. 83 ± 1. 1 h and 33. 1 ± 2. 0 h, respectively. No significant difference in onset of oestrus among groups was recorded. The pregnancy rate, kidding rate, multiple kidding rates and litter size were 72. 0, 61. 1, 45. 5 % and 1. 6 in the LT-FGA, 70. 8, 76. 5, 69. 2 % and 1. 8 in the ST-FGA and 58. 3, 78. 6, 63. 6 % and 1. 6 in the Gn-ST-FGA groups, respectively. The pregnancy rates were similar in the LT-FGA (72. 0 %) and ST-FGA (70. 8 %). However, the kidding rate, multiple kidding rates and litter size were numerically higher in the ST-FGA (76. 5 %, 69. 2 % and 1. 8, respectively) group than in the LT-FGA (61. 1 %, 45. 5 % and 1. 6, respectively) group. Although not statistically different, pregnancy rate and litter size was lower in the Gn-ST-FGA group (58. 3 % and 1. 6, respectively) compared with the ST-FGA (70. 8 % and 1. 8, respectively). In conclusion, it can be said that oestrus synhcronization with long-term <b>progestagen</b> treatment (14 d-FGA- PGF 2 α- eCG) could be replaced with short-term <b>progestagen</b> treatment (8 d-FGA-PGF 2 α- eCG) without a reduction in oestrus rate and fertility parameters in lactating goats at the beginning of breeding season. However, the use of GnRH prior to short-term <b>progestagen</b> treatment (8 d-FGAPGF 2 α- eCG) do not have a positive effect on fertility parameters in goats...|$|E
40|$|Preclinical {{studies show}} that estrogens can act as tumour promotors as well as tumour initiators. The role of <b>progestagens</b> is less clear. Tibolone does not stimulate the breast tissue in {{preclinical}} studies. In clinical studies, tibolone shows less breast stimulation than combined HRT does, as judged from breast density and mastalgia studies...|$|R
40|$|The effects {{exerted by}} ovarian steroids on the {{modulation}} of opioid activity were investigated in post-menopausal migraine sufferers and in healthy controls. In order to evaluate central opioid tonus, plasma LH rise after naloxone injection was measured, {{bearing in mind}} the tonic inhibition of endogenous opioid on hypothalamic LH-RH. There was no response of plasma LH to naloxone in post-menopausal women or in patients submitted to ovariectomy in fertile life. When the subjects underwent a sequential estrogens + <b>progestagens</b> therapy, such a response was noted from {{the first month of}} treatment; <b>progestagens</b> alone were ineffective. The same phenomena were also evident in post-menopausal migraine sufferers. These data indicate that ovarian steroids modulate the activity of opiate receptors in both healthy women and migraine sufferers. Interestingly, replacement therapies through ovarian steroids restored the activity of central opioid tonus in patients affected by migraine...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Steroid hormones {{regulate}} {{rates of}} transcription of certain genes by binding as a hormone=n- to specific DNA sequences termed steroid=n- elements. These elements consist of inverted repeats {{of the sequence}} TGTTCT for glucocorticoids, <b>progestagens</b> and androgens and TGACC for oestrogens. Domains for steroid binding, DNA binding and transcriptional activation have been defined in the mouse oestrogen receptor...|$|R
