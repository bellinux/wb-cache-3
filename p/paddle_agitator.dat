40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics is used {{to solve}} 3 D hydrodynamics of a mixing vessel for paddle {{agitators}} and two-blade impellers with different blade heights operating in laminar regime. These results are compared with available experimental data: good agreement is observed. The tangential velocities calculation was carried out for <b>paddle</b> <b>agitator</b> with height W = 1. 5 T. Early studies confirmed {{that this type of}} geometry generates essentially a tangential flow. The results obtained show good agreement with those obtained by many authors. The second agitator height was W = 0. 25 T which behaves, generally, like a turbine and generates more important axial and radial velocities which are at the origin of secondary flows {{on both sides of the}} blade. The axial velocities calculation for blades of various heights confirmed the observations of many authors; especially, a maximum velocity for the lowest height considered. The position of the impeller in the tank was analysed and the axial velocity change with the positions of the impeller...|$|E

A numerical model is presented here that captures such a vortex. The volume of fluid model, a multiphase flow model was employed in conjunction with a multiple reference frame model and the shear stress turbulence model. The dimensions of the tank considered here, were 0. 585 m for the liquid depth and tank diameter with a 0. 2925 m diameter impeller at a height of 0. 2925 m. The impeller considered was an eight-bladed <b>paddle</b> type <b>agitator</b> that was rotating with an angular velocity of 7. 54 rad s (72 rpm) giving a Reynolds number of 10 and Froude number of 0. 043. Preliminary results of a second investigation into the effect of liquid phase properties on the vortex formed are also presented...|$|R

Bioethanol is an energy source with good prospects {{as a substitute for}} liquid fuels renewable raw materials, friendly to the environment and the very favorable economic terms. One of the materials that can be used as raw material for bioethanol is pineapple. The fermentation process is influenced by several factors, among which the fermentation time and stirring in a liquid medium. Flow pattern and degree of turbulence is an important aspect which affects the quality of mixing that depends on several factors such as tank geometry, physical properties of fluids and type of impeller. Fermentation time very big influence on the activity of yeast because the longer the fermentation, the more number of increasingly active yeast or yeast to proliferate. The process of fermentation using yeast Sacharomyces cereviceae. Preparation starter made with yeast inoculum process Sacharomyces cereviceae at 10 % glucose so that the yeast to multiply. Fermentation takes place in batch, variations in the type of <b>agitator</b> <b>Paddle,</b> pitched Blade Turbine, Turbine Disk and variations in the fermentation time 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours. Stirring speed of 200 rpm and the temperature of fermentation in temperature. Ethanol concentration was analyzed using Alkoholmeter.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of in vitro {{parameters}} on the theophylline release from the hydrogel system of atactic -PVA/NaCl/H 2 O, in vitro parameters such as agitators, rotation speed, release medium and release temperature were evaluated. Theophylline release was studied {{for a period of}} 750 min using <b>paddle</b> and propeller <b>agitator,</b> rotation speed (25, 50, 100 and 150 rpm), release medium (simulated fluids pH 1. 2, 7. 5 and phosphate buffer pH 8. 5 with 0. 05 M at 37 °C) and release temperatures (27, 37 and 47 °C). SEM and DSC studies were performed to evaluate the surface morphology and heat capacity as well as melting temperatures of the hydrogels affected by various simulated fluids and phosphate buffer. A regular Fickian diffusion was found (Higuchi Model) for first 60 to 70 % release. A faster release rate was found in paddle rotation than that of propeller one. Among the release medium comparatively high release rate in extremely low pH (1. 2) and near about same release rate in distilled water, pH 7. 5 and pH 8. 5 were found. DSC thermogram of these treated xerogels showed low melting temperature as well as high heat capacity of pH 1. 2 sample than that of others. Rotation speed had a little effect on release rate but the diffusion exponent. It decreased linearly with increasing rotation speed. On the other hand release rate increased proportionally to temperature where diffusion exponent decreased with increasing temperature in a parabolic fashion. Theophylline release behavior was regular Fickian diffusion (Higuchi Model) irrespective of in vitro conditions studied here. However release rate, diffusion exponent, kinetic constant and diffusion co-efficient vary with rotator type, rotation speed, release medium and temperature...|$|R
40|$|The International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) {{scientists}} monitored butter-making on five Ethiopian farms for a nine-month {{period in}} 1989 {{to see if}} traditional butter-making practices could be accelerated whilst leaving the basic technique unchanged. Traditionally, milk for churning is collected in a clay Dot for several days, soured naturally, and then churned by shaking the pot until butter granules form. This takes up to four hours of churning. The ILCA team developed a simple internal wooden <b>paddle</b> <b>agitator</b> to improve {{the efficiency of the}} simple clay pot churn. The temperature and acidity of the milk are not changed. Fifty-nine churnings were observed, of which the shortest was 50 minutes and the longest 65. This significant shortening of the process not only eases women's work load but also boosts the butter yield, thereby increasing income, because the amount of fat left in the buttermilk is reduced.
