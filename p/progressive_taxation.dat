40|$|Over recent decades, Australia's highly <b>progressive,</b> individual-based <b>taxation</b> of {{families}} {{has been replaced}} by a system that tends towards joint taxation with an inverted U-shaped rate scale. The reform has been implemented by introducing family-income-targeted child payments (now Family Tax Benefit Part A) and by lowering tax rates on higher incomes. The new system has shifted the burden of taxation to two-earner families on low and average wages and, in particular, to working married mothers as second earners.

30|$|One very {{important}} difficulty which arises when studying these issues is that usually {{the existence of}} a majority winner (i.e., Condorcet winner) is not guaranteed. Voting games over redistributive tax schedules lack in general {{the existence of a}} static equilibrium (see Marhuenda and Ortuño-Ortin [1], Hindriks [2], De Donder and Hindriks [3]). The seminal papers of Romer [4, 5] and Roberts [6] consider only flat rate taxes in order {{to make use of the}} median voter theorem, after imposing some natural additional restrictions. However, the overrestrictive assumption of linear tax schemes does not provide the framework to investigate important issues like the high prevalence of marginal-rate <b>progressive</b> <b>taxations</b> in democracies. Therefore, many authors study the basic problem of voting on income taxations in terms of larger classes of tax functions.|$|R

25|$|In France, social liberal {{theory was}} {{developed}} in the Third Republic by solidarist thinkers, including Alfred Fouillée and Émile Durkheim, who were inspired by sociology and influenced radical politicians like Léon Bourgeois. They explained that a greater division of labor caused greater opportunity and individualism, but it also inspired a more complex interdependence. They argued that the individual had a debt to society, promoting <b>progressive</b> <b>taxation</b> to support public works and welfare schemes. However, they wanted the state to coordinate rather than to manage and they encouraged cooperative insurance schemes among individuals. Their main objective was to remove barriers to social mobility rather than create a welfare state.|$|E
25|$|Deadweight loss {{does not}} account for the effect taxes have in {{leveling}} the business playing field. Businesses that have more money are better suited to fend off competition. It is common that an industry {{with a small amount of}} very large corporations has a very high barrier of entry for new entrants coming into the marketplace. This is due to the fact that the larger the corporation, the better its position to negotiate with suppliers. Also, larger companies may be able to operate at low or even negative profits for extended periods of time, thus pushing out competition. More <b>progressive</b> <b>taxation</b> of profits, however, would reduce such barriers for new entrants, thereby increasing competition and ultimately benefiting consumers.|$|E
25|$|Apart from <b>progressive</b> <b>taxation</b> on each household's harvest, {{the state}} {{introduced}} {{a system of}} compulsory state purchases of grain at fixed prices to build up stockpiles for famine-relief and meet the terms of its trade agreements with the Soviet Union. Together, taxation and compulsory purchases accounted for 30 percent of the harvest by 1957, leaving very little surplus. Rationing was also introduced in the cities to curb 'wasteful consumption' and encourage savings (which were deposited in state-owned banks and thus became available for investment), and although food could be purchased from state-owned retailers the market price was higher than that for which it had been purchased. This too {{was done in the}} name of discouraging excessive consumption.|$|E

40|$|Why do both {{left and}} right {{political}} parties typically propose <b>progressive</b> income <b>taxation</b> schemes in political competition? Analysis of this problem has been hindered by the two-dimensionality of the issue space. To give parties a choice over a domain which contains both progressive and regressive income tax policies requires an issue space that is at least two-dimensional. Nash equilibrium in pure strategies of the standard two-party game, whose players have complete preferences over a two-dimensional policy space, generically fails to exist. I introduce a new equilibrium concept for political games, {{based on the fact}} of factional conflict within parties. Each party is supposed to consist of reformists, militants, and opportunists: each faction has a complete preference order on policy space, but together they can only agree on a partial order. Nash equilibria of the two party game, where the policy space consists of all quadratic income tax functions, and each party is represented by its partial order, exist, and it is shown that, in such equilibria, both parties propose <b>progressive</b> income <b>taxation.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|The first notable {{implementation}} of social liberal policies occurred under the Liberal Party in Britain from 1906 until 1914. These initiatives {{became known as}} the Liberal reforms. The main elements included pensions for poor elderly people, health, sickness and unemployment insurance based on earlier programs in Germany and the establishment of labour exchanges. These changes were accompanied by <b>progressive</b> <b>taxation,</b> particularly in the People's Budget of 1909. The old system of charity—relying on the Poor laws and supplemented by private charity, public co-operatives and private insurance companies—was in crisis, giving the state added impetus for reform. The Liberal Party caucus elected in 1906 also contained more professionals, including academics and journalists, sympathetic to social liberalism. The large business owners had mostly deserted the Liberals for the Conservatives, the latter becoming the favorite party for commercial interests. The reforms were regularly opposed by both business interests and trade unions. Liberals most identified with these reforms were Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, John Maynard Keynes, David Lloyd George (especially as Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Winston Churchill (as President of the Board of Trade) in addition to the civil servant William Beveridge.|$|E
500|$|... m. Drastic {{cuts were}} {{implemented}} in <b>progressive</b> <b>taxation</b> and public spending, including on welfare. Income and wealth were massively redistributed toward {{a small number}} of people at the top at the price of impoverishment of a large number at the bottom. The unemployment had reached an all-time high of 20% by the end of 2003, just before the European Union membership came to the rescue. As a result of high unemployment, it took at least a decade for the average real pay to reach the level from before 1989 and joining the Union triggered the greatest peacetime wave of permanent economic migration out of the country. The reforms undertaken by the Polish elites were of an overwhelmingly economic character. Their socially detrimental consequences included the lasting political polarization over the practically limited range of choices: economic liberalism lacking any communal concerns on the one hand, and the conservative, patriarchal and parochial backwaters of Polish nationalism on the other.|$|E
500|$|R.A., {{writing on}} The Economists Free Exchange blog, {{concluded}} that Cowen's analysis of education {{suggested that the}} rich world would do better by aiding mass education programs in developing countries rather than pursuing the diminishing returns in domestic education and research, in contrary [...] to President Obama's State of the Union speech in 2011.

40|$|We analyse the {{question}} of optimal taxation in a dual economy, when the government {{is concerned about the}} distribution of labour income. Income inequality is caused by the presence of sunk capital investments, which creates a `good jobs` sector due to the capture of quasi-rents by the trade unions.
