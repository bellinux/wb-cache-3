40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} writing and {{adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Independent State <b>of</b> Papua New Guinea. It argues that <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> its adoption fulfilled {{the requirements for}} constitutional autochthony: being "constitutionally rooted in its own native soil". This result was due to a combination <b>of</b> three influences, <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> which is <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> nationalism among <b>the</b> country's first politicians. <b>The</b> ambitions <b>of</b> these politicians for early independence were aided and guided by the commitment and expertise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small group <b>of</b> expatriates associated with the university and administration: two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most influential <b>of</b> these were C. J. Lynch and J. W. Davidson. <b>The</b> acquiescent attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian Government towards {{the manner in which}} Papua New Guinea achieved its independence was the third factor influencing <b>the</b> unusual nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution's adoption. The thesis explores <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> nationalism in <b>the</b> preindependent Territory <b>of</b> Papua New Guinea, culminating in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a National Coalition Government in 1972. It details the stages in which <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> was planned, written and adopted between 1972 and 1975 and considers the evidence for <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> Lynch and Davidson in <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> <b>The</b> thesis is based on a study of a range of official and personal documents. These include Papua New Guinea's House <b>of</b> Assembly Debates, <b>the</b> Final Report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitutional <b>Planning</b> Committee, drafts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> held by <b>the</b> family <b>of</b> C.

60|$|It becomes {{manifest}} to us, as we read <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, that <b>the</b> Dictator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{future was}} gradually entertaining {{the idea that}} <b>the</b> old forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic were rotten, and that any man who intended to exercise power in Rome or within the Roman Empire must obtain it and keep it by illegal means. He had probably adhered to Catiline's first conspiracy, but only with such moderate adhesion as enabled him to withdraw when he found that his companions were not fit for the work. It is manifest that he sympathized with the later conspiracy, {{though it may be}} doubted whether he himself had ever been a party to it. When the conspiracy had been crushed by Cicero, he had given his full assent to <b>the</b> crushing <b>of</b> it. We have seen how loudly he condemned <b>the</b> wickedness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspirators in his endeavor to save their lives. But, through it all, there was a well-grounded conviction in his mind that Cicero, with all his virtues, was not practical. Not that Cicero was to him the same as Cato, who with his Stoic grandiloquence must, to his thinking, have been altogether useless. Cicero, though too virtuous for supreme rule, too virtuous to seize power and hold it, too virtuous to despise as effete <b>the</b> institutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic, was still a man so gifted, and capable in so many things, as to be very great as an assistant, if he would only condescend to assist. It is in this light that Cæsar seems to have regarded Cicero as time went on; admiring him, liking him, willing to act with him if it might be possible, but not the less determined to put down all the attempts at patriotic republican virtue in which the orator delighted to indulge. Mr. Forsyth expresses an opinion that Cæsar, till he crossed the Rubicon after his ten years' fighting in Gaul, had entertained no settled <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> overthrowing <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> Probably not; nor even then. It may be doubted whether Cæsar ever spoke to himself <b>of</b> overthrowing <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> He came gradually to see that power and wealth were to be obtained by violent action, and only by violent action. He had before him <b>the</b> examples <b>of</b> Marius and Sulla, both of whom had enjoyed power and had died in their beds. There was <b>the</b> example, also, <b>of</b> others who, walking unwarily in those perilous times, had been banished as was Verres, or killed as was Catiline. We can easily understand that he, with his great genius, should have acknowledged <b>the</b> need both <b>of</b> courage and caution. Both were exercised when he consented to be absent from Rome, and almost from Italy, during <b>the</b> ten years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gallic wars. But this, I think, is certain, that from the time in which his name appears prominent--from <b>the</b> period, namely, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catiline conspiracy--he had determined not to overthrow <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> but so to carry himself, amid <b>the</b> great affairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, as not to be overthrown himself.|$|R
