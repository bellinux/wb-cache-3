5|$|The F-16A/B was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar. Its slotted <b>planar</b> <b>array</b> antenna {{was designed to be}} compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful signal processing, higher output power, improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.|$|E
25|$|Central Acquisition Radar, a {{state of}} the art <b>planar</b> <b>array</b> S-Band radar {{operating}} on the stacked beam principle. With a range of 180km, it can track while scan 200 fighter sized targets. Its systems are integrated on high mobility, locally built TATRA trucks for the Army and Air Force; however it is meant to be used by all three services. Initially developed for the long-running Akash SAM system, seven were ordered by the Indian Air Force for their radar modernisation programme and two of another variant were ordered by the Indian Navy for their P-28 Corvettes. The CAR has been a significant success for radar development in India, with its state of the art signal processing hardware. The ROHINI is the IAF specific variant while the REVATHI is the Indian Navy specific variant. The ROHINI has a more advanced Indian developed antenna in terms of power handling and beamforming technology while the REVATHI adds two axis stabilisation for operation in naval conditions, as well as extra naval modes.|$|E

40|$|At L-band (1 - 2 GHz) due to {{significantly}} large freespace wavelengths, compact antenna arrays with small interelement separation i. e., d < λ/ 2, are a suitable choice for overall size reduction.

40|$|The millimeter-wave (mmWave) full-dimensional (FD) MIMO system employs <b>planar</b> <b>arrays</b> at {{both the}} base station and user {{equipment}} and can simultaneously support both azimuth and elevation beamforming. In this paper, we propose atomic-norm-based methods for mmWave FD-MIMO channel estimation under both uniform <b>planar</b> <b>arrays</b> (UPA) and non-uniform <b>planar</b> <b>arrays</b> (NUPA). Unlike existing algorithms such as compressive sensing (CS) or subspace methods, the atomic-norm-based algorithms do not require to discretize the angle spaces of the angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) into grids, thus provide much better accuracy in estimation. In the UPA case, to reduce the computational complexity, the original large-scale 4 D atomic norm minimization problem is approximately reformulated as a semi-definite program (SDP) containing two decoupled two-level Toeplitz matrices. The SDP is then solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) where each iteration involves only closed-form computations. In the NUPA case, the atomic-norm-based formulation for channel estimation becomes nonconvex and a gradient-decent-based algorithm is proposed to solve the problem.
