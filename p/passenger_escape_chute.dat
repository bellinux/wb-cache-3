50|$|A Korean Airlines (KAL) Airbus A300 skidded off {{the runway}} and {{exploded}} {{after trying to}} land on the island of Cheju, but all 160 aboard escaped without serious injury. The crew pushed the <b>passengers</b> down the <b>escape</b> <b>chutes</b> through the smoke and into the rain. The crash occurred shortly after 11 am when the pilot of flight 2033 from Seoul to Cheju, made a second attempt {{to land on the}} seaside runway in extremely powerful winds of up to 64 mph and heavy rains. The Cheju medical clinic treated seven passengers and one crew member for minor injuries.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Safe escape in {{the fire}} {{disaster}} of high-rise buildings is a world-wide unsolved problem because of the complicated structure {{of the building and}} the huge amounts of resident. Nowadays the <b>chute</b> devices for <b>escaping</b> in high-rise building become important for collective escape, which is easy to use and runs at high speed without extra power. Rigid <b>escape</b> <b>chutes</b> and flexible <b>escape</b> <b>chutes</b> are introduced in this paper. The assembly of <b>escape</b> <b>chutes</b> and their disadvantages are discussed. For more function and more effective, a flexible multi-entrance <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> with its store box is designed. This device offers a fire-proof, high temperature-proof and multi-entrance passage for collective escapes at the same time. Experiments of its prototype shows that this equipment can release <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> in time, and bring evacuee more safety and escape efficiency...|$|R

5000|$|Pinball (Par 3): The level {{begins as}} a game of pinball, where the player can hit the ball with the {{flippers}} after shooting it. Two drop targets must be hit before the top left corner <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> is activated. Although enough failures to hit the drop targets will release {{the ball to the}} bottom part of the course with the hole, hitting the targets and <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> leads directly to the hole and activates a 1 stroke bonus.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} that the larger sea turtles, primarily large loggerheads and leatherbacks are too large to fit through the escape hatches installed in most TEDs.

50|$|The same {{reaction}} occurs upon {{heating the}} salt to approximately 300 °C. The sodium that is formed {{is a potential}} hazard alone and, in automobile airbags, it is converted by reaction with other ingredients, such as potassium nitrate and silica. In the latter case, innocuous sodium silicates are generated. Sodium azide is also used in airplane <b>escape</b> <b>chutes.</b> Newer generation air bags contain nitroguanidine or similar less sensitive explosives.|$|R
50|$|Although {{some early}} escape tubes were made entirely of metal, most current designs {{are made of}} {{high-strength}} fabrics, such as Kevlar. Their flexibility allows for compact storage, rapid deployment, and a gentler braking and controlled descent of users, as compared to traditional metal designs. Fabric tubes may also incorporate inflatable elements to lend some degree of structural rigidity and stability to the <b>escape</b> <b>chute.</b> The fabrics chosen must have fire retardant properties as well.|$|R

The remainder of the aircraft is essentially identical with the long-legged version. Seventeen of the new flying crane were produced as the Mi-10K, including two conversions from Mi-10s from 23 March 1974 to 1977.|$|R

50|$|An <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> is {{a special}} kind of {{emergency}} exit, used where conventional fire escape stairways are impractical. The chute is a fabric (or occasionally metal) tube installed near a special exit on an upper floor or roof of a building, or a tall structure. During use, the chute is deployed, and may be secured at the bottom by a fire fighting crew some distance out from the building. Once the tube is ready, escapees enter the tube and slide down to a lower level or the ground level.|$|R

As development progressed the main undercarriage legs were replaced with vertical units carrying twin wheels, twin nose undercarriage wheels after a period retaining the single wheels, an Auxiliary power unit (APU) installed behind the cockpit on the starboard side and emergency escape slide cables for use when the pallet is carried.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} fire escapes of any type was invented in 18th-century England. In 1784, Daniel Maseres, of England, invented a machine called a fire escape, which, being {{fastened}} to the window, would enable a person to descend to the street without injury. Abraham Wivell created an improved design, including an <b>escape</b> <b>chute,</b> after becoming superintendent of the [...] "Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire." [...] Henry Vieregg patented the first US fire escape in Grand Island, NE in November 8, 1898 , serial number 681,672, which was designed for traveling businessmen.|$|R

50|$|Troposphere 5 {{carrying}} a rat named Kavira on board, {{was designed to}} reach an altitude of 36 km and a speed of Mach 3. The rocket was launched at Menkao launch site.

Despite Troposphere 5 being equipped with an <b>escape</b> <b>chute,</b> Kavira was never found and was officially reported to have died in the name of science. According to Keka the experiment provided valuable data for future tests by the DTA.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{evacuation slide}} {{was developed and}} produced by Air Cruisers, founded by James F. Boyle, inventor of the World War II life vest, the [...] "Mae West". [...] The patent for the inflatable <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> assembly was submitted by Boyle in 1954 and the designs was patented in 1956 under patent number 2,765,131. Today Air Cruisers provides slides for over 65% of the aircraft slide market. Prior to inflatables, some passenger aircraft utilized canvas type slides which required the crew to undertake an extensive rigging procedure. Canvas type slides are still found on some Russian aircraft.|$|R
