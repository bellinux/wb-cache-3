40|$|The {{present study}} was {{experimentally}} investigated on suppression and characteristics of flow induced vibrations of rectangular prisms with various width-to-height ratios. In the previous report, the response characteristics and generation mechanism of flow-induced vibrations of rotary oscillating rectangular prisms were examined. The present report was made on the suppression of flow-induced vibrations of the rectangular prisms with rotary oscillation. As a result of previous paper, it can be seemed that the prevention of rolling up the shear layer separating from {{the leading edge of}} the rectangular prism is the most effective for suppressing flow-induced vibrations of it. In this study, we therefore attempted to prevent the rolling up of the shear layer by the following three method : placement of a small normal plate at upstream of the <b>prism,</b> <b>attachment</b> of four perforated normal plates on upper and lower side surface, and attachment of triangle fairings on front and rear surface. 　Important results from the present study were that （i） the generation of low-speed and high-speed torsion flutter were completely suppressed by a normal plate placed at upstream of the prisms, (ii) the generation of vortex excitation was completely suppressed by four perforated plates attached to upper and lower side surface, （iii） the generation of low-speed and high-speed torsion flutter were completely suppressed by triangle fairing attached to front and rear surface, and（iv）vortex excitation newly generated at the different reduced velocity U_r when a normal plate orfairings was set up was completely suppressed by increasing from the threshold value of the reducedmass-damping factor C_n...|$|E
40|$|The map of {{auditory}} {{space in the}} external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICX) of the barn owl is calibrated by visual experience during development. ICX neurons are tuned for interaural time difference (ITD), the owl’s primary cue for sound source azimuth, and are arranged into a map of ITD. When vision is altered by rearing owls with prismatic spectacles that shift the visual field in azimuth, ITD tuning in the ICX shifts adaptively. In contrast, ITD tuning remains unchanged in the lateral shell of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICCls), which provides the principal auditory input to the ICX, suggesting that the projection from the ICCls to the ICX is altered by prism-rearing. In this study, the topography of the ICCls–ICX projection was assessed in normal and prism-reared owls by retrograde labeling using biotinylated dextran amine. In juvenile owls at the age before <b>prism</b> <b>attachment,</b> and in normal adults, labeling patterns were consistent with a topographic projection, with each ICX site receiving input from a restricted region of the ICCls with similar ITD tuning. In prism-reared owls, labeling patterns were systematically altered: each ICX site received additional, abnormal input from a region of the ICCls where ITD tuning matched the shifted ITD tuning of the ICX neurons. These results indicate that anatomical reorganization of the ICCls–ICX projection contributes to the visual calibration of the ICX {{auditory space}} map.

Neuronal stimulus selectivity can be altered dramatically when animals are reared with altered visual (Wiesel and Hubel, 1963; Udin an...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{shows that}} {{functional}} limitation of zenith devices and introduction of modern high-accuracy electronic tacheometers {{should lead to}} substitution of the mentioned devices for tacheometers in geodesic works concerning vertical projection of pivot points of the constructed buildings and structures. However the electronic tacheometer has not been considered in the function of a zenith device in ТКП 45 - 1. 03 - 26 - 2006. Special experiemnts and practical works executed by UE “Geokart” has proved that in accordance with its design the electronic tacheometer equipped with a compensator for small inclinations and zenith <b>prism</b> <b>attachment</b> for ocular can be applied as a vertical projection device while setting sighting line of a telescope in a fixed vertical position. Corresponding experiments {{have been carried out}} for multi-storied building of business centre located in the M. Tank Street in Minsk in order to obtain comparative characteristics of vertical projection accuracy with the help of tacheometer TOPCON GPT 7501 and zenith device PZL- 100. An initial point of the staked grid has been situated at the elevation ± 0, 0 м, standard graph elevation has been equal to + 49, 5 м (concrete slab of the 14 th floor), projection height referred to the device has been equal to Н = 47, 8 м. Both devices have been set on the same stand using a purpose made adaptive device in order to exclude centering errors. Deviation in position of final projection points on the standard graph which were obtained with the help of two devices has been equal to 1. 2 mm, that testifies practical equal accuracy of the zenith device and tacheometer for vertical projection function. Additional advantage of the electronic tacheometer in comparison with special vertical projection devi ces {{lies in the fact that}} in the case of a certain misalignment of geodesic openings in intermediate floors ta- cheometer deviating from the vertical makes it possible to carry out initial point transfer to mounting horizon using inclined projection in the point with plane coordinates which differ from initial point coordinates within the limits of apparent standard graph area. Such point can be indicated with the help of dot L. E. D. located on standard graph. Its spatial polar and rectangular coordinates on horizontal plane are determined by angular measurements with readings along both bearing circles of the electronic tacheometer and projection height. Production practice and executed experiments have permitted to make the following conclusions: a modern electronic tacheometer equipped with ocular attachment for telescope sighting in the zenith direction can be and must be efficiently applied for vertical point projection of internal geodetic base of a constructed building or a structure. The mentioned device ensures transfer of geodetic base points to mounting horizon not only vertically but also with inclination of a projected beam within sequential visibility of openings in intermediate floors that allows to adapt projection trajectory to specific conditions of its passing...|$|E
30|$|Although {{beyond the}} scope of the present study, further {{detailed}} research is needed considering humanitarian relationships through the <b>prism</b> of <b>attachment</b> theory, the framework for understanding the psychodynamics of interpersonal relationships pioneered by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth (Holmes 2014). They and their successors sought to understand how early experiences in life shape the way people experience stress and develop relational strategies in order to cope (Holmes 2014). These strategies become entrenched as attachment styles Ainsworth et al. (1978) or particular patterns of relating that people carry into adulthood. A number of different attachment style classifications have been developed, but they can be summarised as secure, anxious, avoidant or disorganised (Bifulco and Thomas 2013).|$|R
