6000|$|A kindred wonder in my {{eyes was}} the nature of his courage. There was never a braver man: he went out to welcome danger; an {{emergency}} (came it never so sudden) strung him like a tonic. And yet, upon the other hand, I have known none so nervous, so oppressed with possibilities, looking upon the world at large, and the life of a sailor in particular, with so constant and haggard a consideration of the ugly chances. All his courage was in blood, not merely cold, but icy with reasoned apprehension. He would lay our little craft rail under, and [...] "hang on" [...] in a squall, until I gave myself up for lost, and the men were rushing to their stations of their own accord. [...] "There," [...] he would say, [...] "I guess there's not a man on board would have hung on as long as I did that time: they'll have to give up thinking me no schooner sailor. I guess I can shave just as near capsizing as any other captain of this vessel, drunk or sober." [...] And then he would fall to repining and wishing himself well out of the enterprise, and dilate on the <b>peril</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas,</b> the particular dangers of the schooner rig, which he abhorred, the various ways in which we might go to the bottom, and the prodigious fleet of ships that have sailed out in the course of history, dwindled from the eyes of watchers, and returned no more. [...] "Well," [...] he would wind up, [...] "I guess it don't much matter. I can't see what any one wants to live for, anyway. If I could get into some one else's apple-tree, and be about twelve years old, and just stick the way I was, eating stolen apples, I won't say. But there's no sense in this grown-up business--sailorising, politics, the piety mill, {{and all the rest of}} it. Good clean drowning is good enough for me." [...] It is hard to imagine any more depressing talk for a poor landsman on a dirty night; it is hard to imagine anything less sailor-like (as sailors are supposed to be, and generally are) than this persistent harping on the minor.|$|E
