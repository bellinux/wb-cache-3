5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
50|$|When possible, {{multiple}} <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> {{may be used}} — {{if there}} is more than one disease test that is known to be effective, more than one might be tested. Multiple <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> also allow finer comparisons of the results (calibration, or standardization) if the expected results from the <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> have different sizes. For example, in the enzyme assay discussed above, a standard curve may be produced by making many different samples with different quantities of the enzyme.|$|R
40|$|Design of {{stabilizing}} and time-optimal controllers for discrete-time linear {{systems with}} <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> is revisited. Necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilizability of {{this class of}} systems are given. A class of stabilizing controllers is designed. We show that a stabilizing time-optimal controller exists if the system is dead-beat controllable. We show by an example that there may also exist time-optimal controllers which are not stabilizing. Keywords: linear systems, <b>positive</b> <b>controls,</b> stabilizing controllers, time-optimal controllers 1. INTRODUCTION Linear systems with <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> arise in modelling of biological processes (Zaslavsky, 1990), in economics (Heemels, et al., 1997) and may also be obtained from black-box identification of nonlinear systems, where they {{are referred to as}} simple Hammerstein models.

These recommendations included: installing recorders for radar displays, installing audio conversation recorders at air traffic control facilities; establishing climb and descent corridors under ATC <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> in the vicinity of air terminals; and establishing more definitive procedures for receiving and handling the emergency transponder code 7700. Additionally, the NTSB strongly recommended that the FAA and the Department of Defense cooperate to develop a program, in areas where a large intermix of civil and military traffic exists, to ensure that appropriate graphical depictions of airspace utilization and typical flow patterns are prominently displayed at all airports and operational bases for the benefit of all airspace users.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{analytic}} QC methods {{serve as}} a gatekeeper for excellent quality assays. In a typical HTS experiment, {{a clear distinction between}} a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and a negative reference such as a negative control is an index for good quality. Many quality-assessment measures have been proposed to measure the degree of differentiation between a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and a negative reference. Signal-to-background ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, signal window, assay variability ratio, and Z-factor have been adopted to evaluate data quality.|$|E

40|$|Polymerase chain {{reactions}} (PCR) {{may fail}} to react because the substrate DNA is absent (true negative) or because of inhibition of specific amplification (false negative). The use of <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> can increase confidence in negative PCR results by ruling out failure due to inhibition {{as a cause of}} the lack of amplification products. This report describes the construction and application of coamplified <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> for herpes simplex virus and human herpesvirus 6 amplifications. Herpes simplex virus and human herpesvirus 6 PCR products were modified to generate control PCR products in which the original probe sequences were replaced by a Drosophila probe sequence. Implementation of the coamplified controls increased our specimen throughput in comparison with the parallel control amplifications used previously. Clinical laboratories using PCR for diagnosis of infectious diseases may find <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> particularly helpful for increasing confidence that negative amplifications represent truly negative specimens...|$|R

25|$|Al-Qaeda, for example, uses a {{different}} form of swarming than those of advanced militaries, in which the general objectives of operational cells are agreed in a manner coordinated, but not continuously controlled by the core organization. Once the {{decision has been made}} on the general targets, the operational cells cut <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> links from the core, although they may still receive financial and other support. A signature of al-Qaeda operations has been multiple, near-simultaneous attacks, such as the several hijacked airliners in the 9/11 attacks, the closely spaced bombings aimed at US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and attacks on buses and trains in London. The attacks on trains in Spain had an additional dimension: not all the swarms were associated with al-Qaeda.|$|E
25|$|Early on, IAI {{decided to}} adopt a delta wing configuration, of which the company was already {{familiar}} with through its work on the earlier Kfir, which was paired with large, steerable canards situated forward of the wing. The delta wing arrangement was relatively low-weight, provided space for considerable fuel capacity, a smooth low-altitude fight attitude, {{and high levels of}} directional stability while flown at high angles of attack (AOA). The canard generated additional lift and <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> when at high AOAs. While this configuration afforded excellent maneuverability, it also exhibited natural instability during flight. To compensate, the Lavi was fitted with a sophisticated digital fly-by-wire system which allowed the aircraft {{to take advantage of this}} particular wing design while eliminating this shortcoming. The Lavi was one of the first aircraft to feature this type of configuration, which has since become more commonplace amongst fighter aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the ERs, an in vitro study found that DES also possesses activity, albeit relatively weak, {{at a variety of}} other steroid hormone receptors. Whereas the study found EC50 values of 0.18nM and 0.06nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, the drug showed significant glucocorticoid activity at a concentration of 1μm that surpassed that of 0.1nM dexamethasone as well as significant antagonism of the androgen, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors (75%, 85%, and 50% inhibition of <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> stimulation, respectively, at a concentration of 1μm). It also showed approximately 25% inhibition of the activation of PPARγ and LXRα at a concentration of 10μm. The researchers stated that, {{to the best of their}} knowledge, they were the first to report such actions of DES, and hypothesized that these actions could be involved in the clinical effects of DES, for instance, in prostate cancer (notably in which particularly high dosages of DES are employed). However, they also noted that the importance of the activities requires further study in animal models at pharmacologically relevant doses.|$|E
500|$|On April 22, 1958, the {{day after}} United Airlines Flight 736 crashed, the CAB {{proposed}} an experiment in which it would set aside part of the air space from which would be barred all aircraft lacking specific clearance to enter it. All aircraft operating in the designated space {{would have to be}} equipped for instrument flight operations. According to the CAB there had been 159 mid-air collisions in the years 1947-1957, and that in 1957 alone there were 971 near-misses. The increased speed of aircraft and higher air traffic density made it harder to give pilots enough time to spot each other during flights. [...] Therefore, the CAB said, [...] "it is essential that <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> be extended to altitudes at 35,000feet and on additional routes as rapidly as practical." [...] At the time such control only existed between 17,000 and 22,000feet on certain transcontinental airways.|$|E

[...] Close (or <b>positive)</b> <b>control</b> occurred when the controller provided specific altitudes, courses, and speeds to the pilot. [...] Personnel providing <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> are called Air Intercept Controllers (AIC).

2500|$|Ships on PIRAZ station {{mounted the}} air search radar closest to enemy airfields and were best {{positioned}} to offer radar information to Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps fighters.

[...] PIRAZ shipboard air controllers would also provide <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> for aircraft requiring in-flight refueling. [...] Gulf of Tonkin barrier CAP (BARCAP) routinely refueled; and CAP {{involved in an}} engagement usually returned with a low fuel state requiring emergency refueling. [...] Three Chicago AICs assisted 52 declared emergency refueling situations for Air Force aircraft in a single day.

2500|$|If {{operational}} cells routinely are [...] "released" [...] curved {{dotted lines}} on link to military cells to select their final operational parameters, {{they use a}} different paradigm than governmental clandestine or covert operations. On a number of cases, US special operations forces {{had to wait for}} Presidential authorization to make an attack, or even move to staging areas. Admittedly, a country would have to face the consequences of an inappropriate attack, so it may tend to be overcautious, where a terror network would merely shrug at the world being upset. Assuming that the al-Qaeda operational technique is not to use <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> their operations may be more random, but also more unpredictable for counterterror forces. If their cells truly need constant control, there are communications links that might be detected by SIGINT, and if their command can be disrupted, the field units could not function. Since there is fairly little downside for terrorists to attack out of synchronization with other activities, the lack of <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> becomes a strength of their approach to cell organization.|$|E
