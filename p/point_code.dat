2500|$|The PPE is the Power Architecture based, dual issue in-order two-way multithreaded core with 23-stages {{pipeline}} {{acting as}} the controller for the eight SPEs, which handle most of the computational workload. PPE has limited out of order execution capabilities, it can perform loads out of order and has delayed execution pipelines. [...] The PPE will work with conventional operating systems due to its similarity to other 64-bit PowerPC processors, while the SPEs are designed for vectorized floating <b>point</b> <b>code</b> execution. The PPE contains a 64 KiB level 1 cache (32 KiB instruction and a 32 KiB data) and a 512 KiB Level 2 cache. The size of a cache line is 128 bytes. Additionally, IBM has included an AltiVec(VMX) unit which is fully pipelined for single precision floating point (Altivec 1 does not support double precision floating-point vectors.), 32-bit Fixed Point Unit (FXU) with 64-bit register file per thread, Load and Store Unit (LSU), 64-bit Floating-Point Unit (FPU) , Branch Unit (BRU) and Branch Execution Unit(BXU).|$|E

50|$|Technology used is LD-CELP, low-delay code excited linear {{prediction}}. Delay of the codec is only 5 samples (0.625 ms).

The standard was finished in 1992 {{in the form of}} algorithm exact floating <b>point</b> <b>code.</b> In 1994 a bit exact fixed point codec was released. G.728 passes low bit rate modem signals up to 2400 bit/s. Also network signaling goes through. The complexity of the codec is 30 MIPS. 2 kilobytes of RAM is needed for codebooks. Mean opinion score for G.728 is 3.61.|$|E
50|$|MTP3 {{provides}} routing functionality {{to transport}} signaling messages through the SS7 network to the requested endpoint. Each network {{element in the}} SS7 network has a unique address, the <b>Point</b> <b>Code</b> (PC). Message routing is performed according to this address. A distinction is made between a Signaling Transfer Point (STP) which only performs MTP message routing functionalities and a Signaling End Point (SEP) which uses MTP to communicate with other SEPs (that is, telecom switches). MTP3 is also responsible for network management; when the availability of MTP2 data links changes. MTP3 establishes alternative links and re-routes traffic away from failed links and signaling points and propagates information about route availability through the network. Also controls traffic when congestion occurs.|$|E
5000|$|Both CMT and SMT are at peak {{effectiveness}} {{while running}} integer and floating <b>point</b> <b>code</b> {{on a pair}} of threads. CMT stays at peak effectiveness while working on a pair threads consisting both of integer code, while under SMT, one or both threads will underperform due to competition for integer execution units. The disadvantage for CMT is a greater number of idle integer execution units in a single threaded case. In the single threaded case, CMT is limited to use at most half of the integer execution units in its module, while SMT imposes no such limit. A large SMT core with integer circuitry as wide and fast as two CMT cores could in theory have momentarily up to twice an integer performance in a single thread case. (More realistically for general code as a whole, Pollacks Rule estimates a speedup factor of , or approximately 40% increase in performance.) ...|$|E
