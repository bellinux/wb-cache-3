40|$|We {{present a}} method of {{predicting}} pedestrian route choice behavior and <b>physical</b> <b>congestion</b> during the evacuation of indoor areas with internal obstacles. Under the proposed method, a network is first constructed by discretizing the space into regular hexagonal cells and giving these cells potentials before a modified cell transmission model is employed to predict the evolution of pedestrian flow in the network over time and space. Several properties of this cell transmission model are explored. The method {{can be used to}} predict the evolution of pedestrian flow over time and space in indoor areas with internal obstacles and to investigate the collection, spillback, and dissipation behavior of pedestrians passing through a bottleneck. The cell transmission model is further extended to imitate the movements of multiple flows of pedestrians with different destinations.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{wireless}} network with multihop transmissions and interference-limited link rates, can we balance power {{control in the}} <b>physical</b> layer and <b>congestion</b> control in the transport layer to enhance the overall network performance while maintaining the architectural modularity between the layers? We answer this question by presenting a distributed power control algorithm that couples with existing transmission control protocols (TCPs) to increase end-to-end throughput and energy efficiency of the network. Under the rigorous framework of nonlinearly constrained utility maximization, we prove the convergence of this coupled algorithm to the global optimum of joint power control and congestion control, for both synchronized and asynchronous implementations. The rate of convergence is geometric and a desirable modularity between the transport and physical layers is maintained. In particular, when congestion control uses TCP Vegas, a simple utilization in the physical layer of the queueing delay information suffices to achieve the joint optimum. Analytic results and simulations illustrate other desirable properties of the proposed algorithm, including robustness to channel outage and to path loss estimation errors, and flexibility in trading off performance optimality for implementation simplicity. This paper presents a step toward a systematic understanding of “layering ” as “optimization decomposition, ” where the overall communication network is modeled by a generalized network utility maximization problem, each layer corresponds to a decomposed subproblem, and the interfaces among layers are quantified as the optimization variables coordinating the subproblems.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a new global}} router, BoxRouter, powered by the concept of box expansion, {{progressive}} integer linear programming (ILP), and adaptive maze routing. BoxRouter first uses a simple PreRouting strategy to predict and capture the most congested region with high fidelity, compared to the final routing. Based on progressive box expansion initiated from the most congested region, BoxRouting is performed with progressive ILP and adaptive maze routing. Our progressive ILP is shown {{to be much more}} efficient than traditional ILP in terms of speed and quality, and the adaptive maze routing based on multi-source multi-target with bridge model is effective in minimizing the congestion and wirelength. It is followed by an effective PostRouting step which reroutes without rip-up to enhance the routing solution further and obtain smooth trade-off between wirelength and routability. Our experimental results show that BoxRouter significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art published global routers, e. g., 91 % better routability than [1] (with 14 % less wirelength and 3. 3 x speedup), 79 % better routability than [2] (with similar wirelength and 2 x speedup), 4. 2 % less wirelength and 16 x speedup than [3] (with simi-lar routability). Additional enhancement in box expansion and PostRouting further improves the result with similar wirelength, but much better routability than the latest work in global routing [4], [5].

40|$|The {{performance}} {{improvement of}} the network with small buffers needs to be focused.

Existing approaches improving the performance of the transport layer requires either much delay or bandwidth. So, Queue Length Based Pacing (QLBP) is presented, which is a novel pacing algorithm that decreases the burstiness of network traffic by delaying packets based on the length of the local packet buffer. Stability control mechanism is applied as contribution which further reduces the packet loss.

However, available bandwidth estimation for a specific remote link has not been addressed in detail yet. We propose a new scheme to estimate the available bandwidth of remote path segments without deploying our tool at the remote nodes. We send two streams of ICMP timestamp packets to the both end nodes of the target path segment according to a Poisson process and estimate the available bandwidth for that path segment based on the measured packet delay and PASTA theory. Since 80 % of routers respond to ICMP timestamp packets according to our measurement results, our scheme can monitor a much broader range of network path segments than conventional available bandwidth estimation schemes which usually require deployment of probing tools at remote nodes.

40|$|Abstract — In this brief, {{we propose}} {{congestion}} refinement of placement (CROP) {{for improving the}} congestion of mixed-size placement solutions. CROP consists of a congestion-driven module shifting technique and a congestion-driven detailed placement (CDDP) technique. The shifting technique is proposed for better allocation of routing resources. We shift modules based on the shifting of G-cell boundaries. Shifting in each direction can be formulated as a linear program (LP) for resizing each cell in the global routing grid (i. e., G-cell). We degenerate and solve the LP by a very efficient longest path computation. Then the CDDP technique is proposed for distributing the routing demands better. Congestion reduction is realized by weighting the half-perimeter wirelength with the congestion factor during detailed placement. Theoretically, our tool is capable of handling most mixed-size placement benchmarks with movable and/or fixed macro (FM) blocks. In order to better analyze its performance, the ISPD-GR benchmark suite (ISPD 05 / 06 derived global routing benchmarks) with FM modes is developed. The experimental results show that CROP effectively alleviates congestion for unroutable placement solutions in short runtimes for different placers.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} of a dynamic pedestrian model integrated with a strategic route choice model and multi-directional flow propagation. Despite {{a vast number of}} proposed pedestrian models especially in the last decade, very few of these considered both pedestrian’s route choice behavior and physical movement in a single integrated framework. In an open space, even after the discretization of the space, a massive number of possible paths for pedestrians can possibly be defined. However, psychologically we obviously do not consider all these paths as distinct options. Thus, pedestrians in this model are assumed to choose a series of consecutive sub-areas to traverse along at first instance. Then, the model allocates the actual flows on each detailed path based up on an assumption of dynamic user optimum (DUO). Combining these two stages of flow allocation, the model thus assumes a hierarchical decision of pedestrian’s route choice. In this paper, a modified celltransmission model (CTM) is adopted to represent the <b>physical</b> phenomena of <b>congestion</b> and dynamical propagation of pedestrian flows. A key difference to the original CTM is that the pedestrian flow is multi-directional by its nature. Thus, the paper proposes an approach to extend the analysis i...|$|R

In order to provide high capacity wireless access and support new multimedia network, the various OSI layers and network functions should be considered together while designing the network.

Ad hoc wireless networks were implemented by using Network Simulator NS- 2 and the wireless physical, data link, dynamic source routing (DSR) routing protocol models {{have been included in}} the simulation.

40|$|In this paper, we are {{interested}} in identifying algorithmically efficient networks. That is, determine minimal structural properties of a network that are sufficient to design simple, distributed algorithms to operate a communication network efficiently. The key algorithmic tasks in a communication network pertain scheduling (<b>physical</b> layer) and <b>congestion</b> control (network layer). Recent exciting progress has led to the understanding that good algorithmic solution for joint scheduling and congestion control can be obtained via combination of the “maximum weight scheduling ” of Tassiulas and Ephremides (1992) along with a rate controller inspired by flow-level resource allocation model (e. g. Kelly, Maullo and Tan (1998)). Since the rate controller, by design, is simple and distributed, the key algorithmic challenge lies in designing efficient implementation of “maximum weight scheduling” in the network. In general, this involves solving a network-wide hard combinatorial optimization problem (maximum weight independent set) every time. And this problem, in general is known to be computationally hard. Motivated to find algorithmically efficient networks, we characterize a large class of network structure that allow for simple, distributed algorithm design for finding approximate maximum weight independent set (or schedule). Specifically, we establish that for any network structure with geometry (i. e. polynomial growth of network neighborhood), an algorithm, that determines schedule of each node based information obtained from constant-depth local neighborhood, achieves essentially optimal performance. Our algorithm allows for a smooth trade-off between overhead for computing schedule versus the performance. The key technical innovation is based on a novel graph decomposition algorithm, which we believe should be of interest in its own right. It should be noted that our results immediately apply to wireless network deployed in a geographic area as they naturally posses geometry. In general, a network designer may engineer the network so as to induce geometry and therefore allow for efficient algorithm design...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposition}} that poor housing and congested living conditions have a detrimental impact on health has been promulgated {{for at least}} 150 years. At a minimum, two major causal mechanisms {{are thought to be}} involved in the relationship between crowding and physical health. First, high levels of household crowding can produce stress that leads to illness. Second, through shared <b>physical</b> proximity, household <b>congestion</b> contributes to the spread of communicable disease. The outcomes can be exacerbated by poor quality housing. A significant body of research, conducted primarily in affluent countries, has documented the detrimental effects of housing conditions on a variety of illnesses, including various contagious diseases. Poor housing has even been linked to high infant and adult mortality rates. The view that poor housing conditions and household crowding inevitably leads to poor health is challenged, however, by several observers, who question the role played by both crowding and housing quality. Most existing research has been conducted in affluent countries. Little is known, however, about the nature of these relationships within the context of less developed countries, where health status and housing quality are generally much poorer and where levels of household crowding are generally higher. Determination of the effects, if any, of housing quality [...] including household crowding [...] on physical health in developing countries is particularly important given the rapid growth of their urban populations and the difficulty of increasing the physical infrastructure fast enough to keep pace with this growth. This paper reports on an investigation of the impact of housing conditions and household crowding in the context of one developing country, Thailand. Using data from a representative sample of households in Bangkok (N= 2017), our results provide reason for some skepticism regarding the influence on housing on health, at least in its objective dimensions. While the skepticism of some is based on a reading of the evidence in Western countries, we likewise find that, in Bangkok, objective indicators of housing quality and household crowding are little related to health. We do find, however, that subjective aspects of housing and of crowding, especially housing satisfaction and a felt lack of privacy, have detrimental effects on health. Furthermore, psychological distress is shown to have a potent influence on the physical health of Bangkokians. Our analyses suggest that all three factors have independent effects on health outcomes bearing on both men and women. housing quality household crowding physical well-being stress Thailand...|$|R

This paper analyzes the effects of moderate and drastic driving restrictions of the program Pico y Placa on air pollution and car use in Bogota. Because the program was implemented in phases, it was possible not only to study the impact of the program, but also to distinguish between the short- and long-run effects for each phase of restriction. Using hourly carbon monoxide data, monthly information on gasoline consumption, and vehicle registration and vehicle sales data, this paper shows differentiated effects of Pico y Placa on air quality and car use in the short- and long-run and between phases of the program. Although there was an initial improvement in air quality in both phases of the program, carbon monoxide concentrations, vehicle ownership, and total driving actually increased when drastic restrictions were implemented. Gasoline taxes, on the other hand, have tended to reduce gasoline usage in Bogota, suggesting that a price-based mechanism would be more effective in reducing driving. Chapter 2 :	Air pollution dynamics and the need for temporally differentiated road pricing Nowadays, road traffic is a major source of urban air pollution. In this paper we investigate the effects of the temporal variation of pollution dispersion, traffic flows and vehicular emissions on pollution concentration and illustrate the need for temporally differentiated road pricing through an application to the case of the congestion charge in Stockholm, Sweden. By accounting explicitly for the role of pollution dispersion on optimal road pricing, we allow for a more comprehensive view of the economy-ecology interactions at stake, showing that price differentiation is an optimal response to the <b>physical</b> environment. Most <b>congestion</b> charges in place incorporate price bans to mitigate congestion. Our analysis indicates that, to ensure compliance with air quality standards, such price variations should also be a response to limited pollution dispersion. Chapter 3 :	Synergies and trade-offs between climate and local air pollution policies in Sweden In this paper, we explore the synergies and tradeoffs between abatement of global and local pollution. We build a unique dataset of Swedish combined heat and power plants with detailed boiler-level data 2001 - 2009 on not only production and inputs but also on emissions of CO 2 and NOx. Both pollutants are regulated by strict policies in Sweden. CO 2 is subject to the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and Swedish carbon taxes; NOx - as a precursor of acid rain and eutrophication - is regulated by a heavy fee. Using a quadratic directional output distance function, we characterize changes in technical efficiency as well as patterns of substitutability in response to the policies mentioned. Chapter 4 :	Diffusion of NOx abatement technologies in Sweden Though economists argue for the use of single instruments, we often observe the use of multiple instruments in actual regulations. These may include permit schemes, taxes, fees, subsidies and emission standards. In order to evaluate these combinations and to better understand their effects, we need more empirical analysis of how they interact. They might, for example, be either complements or substitutes; this might even vary between different types of instrument. As a case study we look at detailed data of NOx emissions from large combustion plants in Sweden. These are regulated both by a refunded charge {{and at the same time}} plant level emission standards. We study the adoption of abatement technologies under the combined effect of these charges and standards. The results indicate that the net charge has an effect and one that is complementary to the standards, but only for end-of-pipe post-combustion technologies.

They might, for example, be either complements or substitutes; this might even vary between different types of instrument. As a case study we look at detailed data of NOx emissions from large combustion plants in Sweden. These are regulated both by a refunded charge {{and at the same time}} plant level emission standards. We study the adoption of abatement technologies under the combined effect of these charges and standards. The results indicate that the net charge has an effect and one that is complementary to the standards, but only for end-of-pipe post-combustion technologies. Chapter 5 : Air quality combination forecasting with an application to Bogota The bulk of existing work on the statistical forecasting of air quality is based on either neural networks or linear regressions. The present paper shows how forecast combination can be used to produce more accurate results. This is accomplished using both Monte Carlo simulation and an extensive application to air quality in Bogota, one of the largest and most polluted cities in Latin America...|$|R
