The depth is there in Satan is Real. This album transcends the immediate kitsch appeal of its cover. There is a reason why songs from this album have been performed by the more commonly accepted genius of artists such as Gram Parsons, Johnny Cash, and Emmylou Harris." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{controlled}} creation of single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers via ion implantation {{at the center}} of a photonic crystal cavity which is fabricated in an ultrapure, single crystal diamond membrane. High-resolution placement of NV centers is achieved using collimation of a 5 keV-nitrogen ion beam through a <b>pierced</b> <b>tip</b> of an atomic force microscope (AFM). We demonstrate coupling of the implanted NV centers' broad band fluorescence to a cavity mode and observe Purcell enhancement of the spontaneous emission. The results are in good agreement with a master equation model for the cavity coupling. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond is nowadays well controlled using nitrogen implantation and annealing. Although the high-resolution placement of NV centres {{has been demonstrated}} using either collimation through <b>pierced</b> AFM <b>tips</b> or masks with apertures made by electron beam lithography, a targeted implantation into pre-defined structures in diamond may not be achieved using these techniques. We show that a beam of nitrogen ions can be focused to approximately 100 nm using focused ion beam (FIB) technology. The nitrogen ion beam is produced using an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma source. Combined with a scanning electron microscope, the nitrogen-FIB offers new possibilities for the targeted {{creation of}} single defects in diamond. This maskless technology is suitable for example {{for the creation of}} optical centres in the cavities of photonic crystals or in diamond tips for scanning magnetometry. Finally, we further show that by changing the gas source from nitrogen to xenon, standard FIB milling capabilities are also available within the same tool...|$|R
40|$|Flat and <b>piercing</b> <b>tips</b> made of {{polished}} rock and bone {{are typical of}} the Late Neolithic in the Western Alps. Most of them, realised in tenaceous rocks (serpentinite and amphibolite), come from the internal valleys of the Alps in Switzerland (Valais), Italy (Val D’Aosta, Western Piedmont) and France (Savoy). Production sites have been identified at Bessans (Savoie) and Roreto (Piedmont), whereas unfinished tips are known on several sites of the Western Alps. Contextual examination allows it to be demonstrated that production occurred on the outcrops, or in their immediate neighbourhood. According to the archaeological facts, the operative process is simple: flat blanks (thin plates) were shaped out by retouching, then polished. The obtaining of the blanks and the manufacturing process are difficult to understand on the archaeological artefacts, so an experimental approach was necessary; this was done in 2003. The results allow us to argue that only one «chaîne opératoire» was used. In summary: the blanks are obtained from small massive blocks; these blocks offer a small but discernible schistosity; the use of heat is not required; obtaining blanks is the decisive step of the «chaîne opératoire»: their regular thinness conditions the regularity of the tip and the working time required for shaping; shaping is quite quick (half an hour to one hour), executed by retouching with a stone hammer, followed by more or less covering polishing. All the shapes and the dimensions known in archaeological contexts can be reproduced with no real variation in the difficulties. The levels of know-how appear in the symmetry of the tip and the straightness of the lateral edges. Manufacturing of the tips in polished rock does not require highly developed know-how {{for people who are}} familiar with working tenaceous rocks for axeheads. However, obtaining the best results calls obligatorily for the use of rocks from autochthonous or sub-autochthonous outcrops. Thirault Eric. Les pointes polies alpines des IVe et IIIe millénaires av.

2500|$|Following {{traumatic}} insemination, sperm can migrate {{through the}} hemolymph [...] to the female's ovaries, resulting in fertilization. The exact mechanics vary from taxon to taxon. In some orders of insects, the male genitalia (paramere) enters the female's genital tract, and a spine at its <b>tip</b> <b>pierces</b> {{the wall of}} the female's bursa copulatrix. In others, the male penetrates the outer body wall. In either case, following penetration, the male ejaculates into the female. The sperm and ejaculatory fluids diffuse through the female's hemolymph. The insemination is successful if the sperm reach the ovaries and fertilize an ovum.|$|R
50|$|The tie off {{or fishing}} line method {{is done by}} the person themselves. Fishing line is tied through an {{existing}} tongue <b>piercing</b> to the <b>tip</b> of the tongue and tightened. When the line has cinched through the tissue and become loose, it is cut out and a new tighter line is placed in to continue the cut. This slower process allows the tongue to heal as it is being split, negating the need for stitches or cauterization to control bleeding as blood loss is limited. It can take anywhere from a few days to a few months to split the tongue this way depending on the individual's pain tolerance and determination.|$|R
40|$|Gauge-theory {{approach}} to describe Dirac fermions on a disclinated flexible membrane beyond the inextensional limit is formulated. The elastic membrane is considered as an embedding of 2 D surface into R^ 3. The disclination is incorporated through an SO(2) gauge vortex {{located at the}} origin, which results in a metric with a conical singularity. A smoothing of the conical singularity is accounted for by replacing a disclinated rigid plane membrane with a hyperboloid of near-zero curvature <b>pierced</b> at the <b>tip</b> by the SO(2) vortex. The embedding parameters are chosen to match {{the solution to the}} von Karman equations. A homogeneous part of that solution is shown to stabilize the theory. The modification of the Landau states and density of electronic states of the graphene membrane due to elasticity is discussed. Comment: 15 pages, Journal of Physics:Condensed Matter in pres...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the characteristics and mechanical properties of five different guidewires principally used in urology {{to provide a}} guide to the best choice in every situation. This objective was achieved by performing mechanical tests on each guidewire and on the same guidewire in relationship to a real human ureter. Finally, the mechanical properties of a real human ureter were evaluated experimentally. METHODS: Five different guidewires with a 0. 035 -in. external diameter were studied to determine their mechanical properties of interest: tip buckling, shaft permanent deformation, guide friction on the human ureter, and the force at which the tip perforated a real human ureter. RESULTS: Nitinol guidewires with hydrophilic coating had the least dangerous tip in the tip buckling and <b>tip</b> <b>piercing</b> force tests and the lowest friction values on the friction guide test. The shaft of the polytetrafluoroethylene-coated guidewires was stiffer on the bending resistance and plastic de...|$|R

The assistants point out a young man (Krishna) who came there to meet his girl friend and chases him and also inform Vasu. Vasu doubts him to be X and follows him to a movie theatre, but before he tried to catch him, he sees the ‘X’ dashing himself in a mirror and dies in the theatre rest room. Vasu could also see human foot prints walking on the water.|$|R
50|$|There were no intact skeletons, {{indicating}} {{the site was}} not used as a burial place {{in the sense that}} bodies were placed there immediately after or even close to the time of death. Bones were found in the original strata, but jumbled chronologically, so they were not buried sequentially. Only one of the adults seems to have lived past 40 and many of the bones showed signs of arthritis in the upper body. The children had teeth showing signs of illness and malnutrition. Two of the bodies displayed injuries: A skull and rib cage with depressed fractures, healed before death and an adult male hip bone, <b>pierced</b> by the <b>tip</b> of a stone projectile and not healed, which means the injury occurred not much before the time of death. Those selected for deposit at this site were apparently the members of some sort of elite. Their bodies were left elsewhere to decompose, in a protected location, as none of the bones show any signs of teeth marks. Only the bare bones were then taken here and deposited. As some of them show scorch marks, they may have been ritually purified by fire beforehand.|$|R

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{scaling laws}} and {{extensive}} experimental {{data for the}} performance of fully submerged propellers have existed and have been used to advantage since the 1950 s and earlier. Modern high performance boats require surface piercing propellers. I present three new hydrodynamic scale-free predictions for the relative performance of both submerged and surface-piercing propellers and boats. For the surface piercing case I compare my scaling predictions with official APBA OPC kilo records, using a single class record in each case as a baseline for my predictions. One scaling law allows propeller diameter to be predicted from an established baseline where shaft hp and shaft RPM are the variables. The second scaling law accurately predicts the speed loss when the gear ratio is lowered. The third scale-free prediction is inferred from Froude nr. scaling and allows boat speed to be predicted based on shaft hp and weight, given a known baseline in the same class of drag coefficient and submerged depth of boat. I also discuss the existing available data on surface piercing propellers and compare the data with both typical competition data and speed records. I state a basic requirement for setting the leading edge camber of surface piercing propellers for optimal acceleration and top speed. I end by using the ideas of circulation conservation and vortex stretching to provide a qualitative picture of the physics of blade ventilation in surface <b>piercing</b> via the <b>tip</b> vortices.

40|$|A {{thorough}} {{analysis of}} the cuticular parts of tardigrade feeding apparatuses was performed {{in order to provide}} a more complete understanding of their evolution and their potential homologies with other animal phyla (e. g. Cycloneuralia and Arthropoda). The buccal- pharyngeal apparatuses of eight species belonging to both Eutardigrada and Heterotardigrada were studied using light and scanning electron microscopy. This study supports and completes a previous study on the relationships between form and function in the buccalpharyngeal apparatus of eutardigrades. The common sclerified structures of the tardigrade buccal-pharyngeal apparatus are: a buccal ring connected to a straight buccal tube, a buccal crown, longitudinal thickenings within the pharynx, and a stylet system composed of piercing stylets within stylet coats, and stylet supports. Specifically, heterotardigrades (Echiniscoidea) have a narrow buccal tube; long piercing stylets, each with a longitudinal groove, that cross one another before exiting the mouth; pharyngeal bars and secondary longitudinal thickenings within the pharynx. In contrast, eutardigrades have stylets which are shorter than the buccal tube; Parachela have pharyngeal apophyses and placoids within the pharynx, while Apochela lack a buccal crown and cuticular thickenings within the pharynx, the buccal tube is very wide, and the short stylets are associated with triangular-shaped stylet supports. In both classes, when the <b>piercing</b> stylet <b>tips</b> emerge from the mouth to pierce food, the buccal tube opening is almost completely obstructed, which may hinder food uptake. In heterotardigrades, the crossing of the piercing stylets may further decrease food uptake, however this disadvantage may have been reduced in echiniscids by the evolution of a long buccal tube and long stylets able to run more parallel to the buccal tube. In contrast, eutardigrades evolved different strategies. In the order Apochela and in several Itaquasconinae (Parachela), the buccal tube is wide, the stylets are short and run parallel to the tube without crossing. In other Parachela, the piercing stylets do not cross one another because they are curved. Further, the development of an anterior bend in the buccal tube (e. g. in Doryphoribius and Macrobiotoidea) may allow the shift of the stylet sheaths to a more ventral position so that a wide portion of the mouth is free during the piercing stylet movements. The possible convergent evolution of several structures of the buccal-pharyngeal apparatus (e. g. ventral lamina, pharyngeal tube, wide buccal tube without buccal crown, buccal lamellae) was analysed and discussed...|$|R
