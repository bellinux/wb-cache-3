5|$|After her {{engagement}} to Day ended, Sabrina {{spent eight years}} at boarding houses around Birmingham. Day met {{and went on to}} marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sabrina met an apothecary, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an acrostic poem. She contacted Day for advice, and he told her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens. He had not <b>paid</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Sabrina since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately.|$|E

According to Syed Farid Alatas, the Jami'ah had faculties in Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, Islamic philosophy, and logic. The Fatimids gave {{attention}} to the philosophical studies at the time when rulers in other countries declared those who were engaged in philosophical pursuits as apostates and heretics. The Greek thought found a warm reception with the Fatimids who expanded the boundaries of such studies. They <b>paid</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> philosophy and gave support to everyone who was known for being engaged in the study of any branch of philosophy. The Fatimid Caliph invited many scholars from nearby countries and <b>paid</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> college books on various branches of knowledge and in gathering the finest writing on various subjects and this in order to encourage scholars and to uphold the cause of knowledge.

25|$|Since {{the twelfth}} century the counts of Holland made claims on {{a large part of}} the Frisian territories.

The case is complicated, because contemporary writers hardly <b>paid</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> such a side-issue, while later sources are filled with anti-Frisian propaganda.|$|E
25|$|Karl Popper {{tried to}} {{establish}} a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned {{with the question of}} the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to our senses. Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has <b>paid</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and of the limits of the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes {{the best we can do}} is to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, and use it as a model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedic dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.|$|E

Groening, who had not <b>paid</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed.|$|E
500|$|The 2007–2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent Great Recession challenged macroeconomic theory. [...] Few economists predicted the crisis, and, even afterwards, {{there was great}} disagreement on how to address it. The new synthesis consensus broke down as economists debated policy responses {{to deal with the}} deep recession. The new synthesis formed during the Great Moderation and had not been tested in a severe economic environment. Many economists agree that the crisis stemmed from an economic bubble, but neither of the major macroeconomic schools had <b>paid</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> finance or a theory of asset bubbles: how they form, how they can be recognized, and how they can be prevented. The failures of current economic theory to deal with the crisis spurred economists to reevaluate their thinking. Commentary ridiculed the mainstream and proposed a major reassessment.|$|E

500|$|Groening {{developed}} a lengthy opening sequence {{to cut down}} on the animation necessary for each episode, but devised two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. In the first gag, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing a message on the chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the [...] "chalkboard gag". The other gag is known as a [...] "couch gag", in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television. Groening, who had not <b>paid</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> television since childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. The theme, which plays over the sequence, was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a [...] "retro-style" [...] theme. The piece, which took two days to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.|$|E
500|$|When {{the plane}} reached Los Angeles, Nixon secluded {{himself in a}} suite in The Ambassador Hotel, letting no one except his wife, Chotiner, and {{attorney}} and adviser William P.

They called back with two suggestions, one of which he used. Unwilling to have his message filtered, the candidate adamantly refused to provide the media with any advance text of his speech, convinced that it would {{reduce the size of}} his audience. Without any hard information on what would be said during the speech, rumors flew through the media. UPI reported that Nixon would resign from the ticket well before the scheduled time for the speech. On the evening of the 22nd, the media broke the story that Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson had a similar fund, as Chotiner had predicted. The Stevenson information had been leaked by Bob Humphreys at the RNC, but as he later ruefully noted, [...] "Nobody <b>paid</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> it." ...|$|E
