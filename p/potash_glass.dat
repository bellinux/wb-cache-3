From the glassmaker’s perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in enamelling, and second, clear vessels may be made free from trapped air bubbles with considerably less difficulty than with ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects. When tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a soda-lime glass, the former when struck absorbs more energy. This causes the lead crystal to oscillate, thereby producing its characteristic sound. Lead also increases the solubility of tin, copper, and antimony, leading to its use in colored enamels and glazes. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead oxide content in the glass solders.|$|E

50|$|Glass {{shows up}} in Northern India {{at the end of}} the 2nd {{millennium}} BC becoming more common throughout South East Asia during the following millennium. Glass beads in particular become extremely popular and together with bangles form the largest group of glass finds. From its Indian origins, glass beads spread to an area from Africa to Japan, sailing with the monsoon winds and leading to their christening as 'Trade wind beads'. The most common compositional type, representing 40% of the glass finds for the region, is known as mineral soda-alumina glass and is found from the 4th century BC to the 16th century AD. As the name indicates this it is typically characterized by a high alumina content and was made by the probably melting of reh with local, alumina rich, sands. Through LA-ICP-MS analysis, however, Carter found that Cambodia had a large amount of glass beads made of <b>potash</b> <b>glass</b> and predominantly high alumina soda glass. <b>Potash</b> <b>glass</b> is a glass that uses potash or K2O as a flux in order to decrease the melting point of the glass and is the most common type of glass found in SE Asia.|$|E

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine when Quentovic was completely abandoned. The town was raided by the Vikings in 842, and only remained Frankish because of the tribute paid by Charles the Bald. Subsequent raids would follow, but still the emporium seems to have recovered later in the century despite a possible decline in Carolingian authority during this time. The continued raiding must have hurt Quentovic’s economy, and slowly merchants left to seek places with better protection. In the 10th century, Quentovic seems to have been replaced by ports that were accessible to England and better fortified. Places that possibly took on this role include Montreuil-sur-Mer and Saint-Omer. A lack of evidence remains on the actual demise of Quentovic. Archaeological digs have found pottery dated as late as the 10th century. There has also been fragments of <b>potash</b> <b>glass,</b> which is usually dated {{near the end of the}} first millennium AD. Another possible contributor to its decline could be flooding or a rise in sea level. It also may have been difficult for the increasing size of ships to dock at its port. Quentovic’s fall remains a mystery, although it is widely believed that it was a gradual abandonment, which finally concluded in the early 11th century.|$|E
40|$|Three sets {{of glass}} samples from 18 th century leaded windows from the Girona Cathedral, Reus Priory Church and the Vitoria Cathedral (Spain) have been studied. Chemical {{analyses}} and archaeometry of these glasses are {{of special interest}} due to both the scarcity of 18 th century stained glass window production and to the particular orange colour of several glass pieces. Chemical degradation of glasses has been deduced from their composition and conservation state, directly observed using optical and electron microscopy. The chemical species responsible for colouring (chromophores) and other chromatic parameters have been investigated from optical spectroscopic data. The results indicated that glasses from Girona Cathedral are potash–lime–silica glasses, whereas those of the Reus Priory Church and Vitoria Cathedral are soda–lime–silica glasses. The durability of the glasses studied {{is directly related to}} their respective chemical composition: <b>potash</b> <b>glasses</b> from Girona show advanced chemical degradation, compared with the other sets of glasses analysed. In addition to the assignment of chromophores for blue, violet, green and red ruby glasses, the chromophores responsible for the orange colour of glasses from stained windows have been characterised for the first time.

50|$|Joshua Shaw, an English-born American, is {{sometimes}} {{credited with the}} development of the first metallic percussion cap in 1814, but his claim remains clouded with controversy as he did not patent the idea until 1822. Furthermore, according to Lewis Winant, the US government's decision to award Shaw $25,000 as compensation for his invention was actually a mistake. Congress believed Shaw's patent was the earliest and awarded him a large sum of money based on this belief. However, a claim for the percussion cap was filed in 1819 and granted in 1820 as an addition to an 1818 patent by Francois Prelat, two years before Shaw's patent. This doesn't necessarily make Prelat the inventor however, as he made a habit of copying English patents and inventions at the time and the mode of operation he describes is flawed. According to historian Sidney James Gooding, the most likely inventor of the percussion cap is Joseph Egg, around 1817.

30|$|A similar {{build-up}} {{is described}} by the Dutch golden age painter and art theorist Gerard de Lairesse: ‘To paint a festoon, one shall first assign its course and determine how thick or thin it has to be: subsequently the greenery is added, painting the leaves and the foliage, rendering the day side and the shadows according to the light. When dry, one shall arrange the flowers, beginning with the most important, each on their assigned position, and laid-in with a single color, red, blue or yellow, with such a hue that it is proficient to render the day side and shadows from life or from models.’ [12]. For the other three paintings, the underpainting closely follows {{the outlines of the}} final greenery and was applied after the position of the most prominent fruits and flowers were indicated. Cross-section and microscopic examinations substantiate these findings. Subsequently, De Heem proceeded from this preliminary composition and worked up the individual depicted flowers, fruits, and other objects in a complicated stratigraphy of paint layers and glazes conforming to the appropriate lighting conditions, ultimately obtaining a balanced depiction of light and shadow. Here, De Heem made use of a systematic approach where each fruit or flower is painted with a specific and identical layer build-up and pigment choice. This was observed by studying the build-up of reoccurring fruits and flowers in the five still life paintings. The main signals observed for the foliage are Cu (copper based green/blue pigment), Ca (yellow lake substrate) and Pb, Sn (lead–tin yellow) for the garland paintings and an addition of Ni, Co, K signals, elements associated with smalt, a blue cobalt <b>potash</b> <b>glass</b> pigment [22], for the other paintings (see Additional file 1). Examinations under the stereomicroscope learn that the dark background paint mostly overlaps the outlines of subjects. This finding establishes that the background was applied in the final stage of the painting process, around the main composition. To finish the painting, smaller fruits, little insects and wheat stalks were then painted on the dark background. In the next few paragraphs, we discuss the build-up of these compositional elements in more detail.|$|E
30|$|Smalt is a {{synthetic}} cobalt-doped <b>potash</b> <b>glass.</b> More details on smalt fabrication and (early) occurrences are given elsewhere [1, 20, 86 – 88]. It {{was not only}} used as a pigment, but as an additive to improve oil curing as well [34, 47, 86]. Coarse grinding of the blue glass was {{required in order to}} obtain a satisfactory colour, which seems to have affected the degree of alteration [34, 89]. The discolouration of smalt can be observed in 25 – 50  years, and it can be related to various phenomena: on one hand, the similarity of optical properties (refraction index) of the glass and of the oil, on the other the instability of potassium glass, Co and K ions being the two species considered as responsible [1, 20, 34, 90]. In fact, smalt use is recommended in wall paintings (secco technique) and in aqueous media only [86]. Environmental moisture proved harmful to oil paint layers, to potash glasses [89], and to wall paintings [91]. The first theories on the cause of smalt discolouration in oil assume the role of Co as a catalyst in the binder’s oxidation, with the formation of an organometallic compound at the grain boundary [34, 92]. Moreover, a change in cobalt coordination occurs and it is attributed to the oxidation of cobalt [92]. Later studies [89, 93, 94], however, demonstrated that the distribution of potassium in degraded particles of smalt is not homogeneous, while cobalt is confined to the particles, and that K ions are leached out of the glass affecting its K:Co ratio, the pH, and the Co(II) coordination, which result in colour change. As a consequence of K+ leaching, the coordination of Co 2 + changes from tetrahedral to octahedral (X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies (XAS) [90, 94], vibrational spectroscopies and elemental analysis [95]), causing the colour loss; simultaneously, the glass network is modified as the Q 3 component related to alkali content decreases, and hydration is observed [95]. The change in pH might additionally damage the glass network. The leached K+ ions interact with the aged oil, increasing its water sensitivity, forming soaps and causing blanching [35, 47, 89, 95, 96]. The paint composition might affect the discolouration, by providing chemical species to buffer the potassium leaching. If calcium is present in the glass network, the pigment appears to be less sensitive [47, 89, 90, 96]. When smalt is mixed with leadwhite in oil, lower degrees of alterations are observed, probably because lead soaps are favoured compared to the potassium ones, so that leaching of alkali is not as relevant as in pure smalt paint layers [34, 90, 96, 97]. The discolouration of smalt and the rough surface of degraded particles significantly alter the appearance of oil paintings where it was used for the sky, or other parts intended to be bright blue [34, 89, 94, 96, 98 – 101]. Smalt egg tempera samples proved sensitive to environmental conditions in museums, so that such a paint layer might be successfully used as a dosimeter to evaluate the air quality in terms of conservation issues [102]. In glue binder, the role of humidity and airborne pollutants in accelerating glassy pigments degradation was demonstrated, where leaching of both potassium and cobalt ions occurred. No evident effect of SO 2 and NOx synergy was observed though [87]. In fresco wall paintings, smalt is expected to deteriorate due to the very alkaline conditions, to the presence of liquid water (including condensation, capillary rise and infiltrations), to the small particle size increasing the surface reaction, and to the possible contamination by pollutants. Again, leaching of alkali is observed, and in some strongly degraded smalt particles showing cracks, cobalt and other divalent ions are leached as well, probably due to aggressive environmental conditions (humidity, basic pH) [88, 91, 96]. On top of ions lixiviation and weathering of the glass, examples of heat degraded smalt are reported in wall paintings affected by fire [103].|$|E
