40|$|An {{inquiry and}} a field study was made among {{protected}} cultivation growers to chart how rehabilitation in greenhouses {{is carried out}} in protected cultivation in Sweden today. The inquiry was replied by 108 growers of which 31 was vegetable growers, 68 ornamental plant growers and 10 growers of both vegetables and ornamentals. Plant deliveries to the cultivations {{were found to have}} a major responsibility for the spread of plant diseases and insects to the greenhouse cultivations, especially for ornamental growers. Ornamental growers had larger problems with insects than vegetable growers (82 % and 61 % respectively) in the inquiry. As regards fungi, the situation was the opposite. More vegetable growers (84 %) had fungi problems compared with those who grew ornamentals (47 %). Both the inquiry and the field study showed that an accurate rehabilitation, with emptying of the house of all plants and materials (so called total rehabilitation), gives a good result in lowering the pressure of pathogens which helps the new plants to get a good start. In total rehabilitation it is important to clean the house carefully to remove organic matter. The {{reason for this is that}} the organic matter is a good growing media for all kind of damaging insects and fungi, bacteria and virus diseases. All surfaces should be cleaned carefully with water, either with a high <b>pressure</b> <b>sprayer</b> or with a brush or a sponge, preferably with some washing agent in it. Even the outside shell of the house should be washed with water under high pressure. After the washing, the house could be treated with some kind of chemical. The most effective chemical today for combating fungi in the greenhouse is formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is unhealthy and unpleasant to work with and it is a good idea to let a contractor perform the chemical treatment. Other aldehyde preparations, like Korsolin, Glucid or Lysovet-PA, could also be used. Quaternary ammonium compounds like Menno-ter-forte or Groen-ex can be used, but are less effective. The advantage of the latter compounds is that they are less unhealthy and unpleasant to work with. Before with chemical treatment the temperature and the relative humidity must be kept high and the house must be sufficiently air-tight to permit an even spray distribution. When performing the treatment the weather should be calm, that is especially important if the treatment is performed with small particles / droplets as when fogging or using aerosol. In windy weather, the spraying distribution will be uneven and some of the liquid will be lost out of the greenhouse. If the treatment is done under "bad" conditions, for example low temperature, chemicals may remain in the house afterwards and have negative effects on plants and biological control. When used under adequate conditions fogging is suitable for chemical application in the empty greenhouse thanks to the droplets that cover all surfaces. The investigations made in this study do not prove that chemical treatment garantees a good rehabilitation result, but it indicates that a careful washing is the most important measure in rehabilitation. After the rehabilitation has been done, hygienic measures must be taken in all parts during the growing season to ensure a low pest and insect pressure. Otherwise the rehabilitation might just as well not have been made at all...|$|E
40|$|The {{spotlight}} should soon {{shine on}} organic agriculture, {{according to its}} backers. They believe {{that the future of}} food consumption and agricultural practices is organic. True, consumers in industrialised countries have learned to their cost that for years they have been eating veal from calves stuffed full of hormones, beef and beef products from 'mad cows' and chickens that had fed on dioxin; the current craze for organic food is driven in part by a desire to eat safely, and well. But there is also a belief, is there not, that organic practices will save the planet for future generations to feed themselves? Will, and should, ACP farmers and consumers be swept along by the organic wave? In the beginning, all agriculture was organic. Then came the <b>pressure</b> <b>sprayer,</b> the sack of fertiliser and the Green Revolution. And agriculture became intensive, to meet the challenge of feeding mankind. In the end, the ecological pyramid got skewed and pushed off-balance. Any farmer in the world who knows her or his land can tell you that, as Joël de Rosnay 1 put it, 'an ecosystem which is off-balance will spontaneously seek to become more complex, increasing its load of insects and weeds, which farmers in turn will seek to control by increasing their use of pesticides and weed-killers'. Not all farmers do it though. Four out of five farmers in the world, mainly in the South, are subsistence farmers and only have the means to plant their crops and hope that their harvest will feed their family. And one farmer in a hundred, mainly in the North, has deliberately chosen not to use chemical inputs and to sell their organic output to a few well-to-do and well-informed consumers. A question of definition Organic agriculture means that the use of chemically-produced fertilisers and of pesticides against weeds, insects, fungi and bacteria is strictly controlled, if not entirely forbidden. Going organic means going along with the recent guidelines issued by the Codex Alimentarius commission of the FAO: 'organic agriculture which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. In this regard, the greatest possible use of cultivation methods, whether biological or mechanical, is preferred to the application of synthetic products, in order for the overall system to function fully. ' Could it be that many ACP farmers are farming organically anyway, given their lack of resources or information? Could they indeed, naturally, have access to an interesting market opportunity? It is not as clear-cut as that there are several paradoxes and obstacles on the way. Eat more soundly, when you can afford it Eating organically, or put another way, more soundly, is an important concern of consumers in the West. But where do things stand in ACP countries? There are signs of a shift towards organic. The opening of an organic produce market in Dakar, Senegal (see Spore 83) points to a promising niche for some. But such initiatives are very local. The reality is elsewhere : the domestic and regional ACP food market is driven relentlessly by a basic need : people need to eat soundly, but above all in sufficient quantities and cheaply. The export market for organic products is in practice really for the big guys who can invest in the certification process {{that will allow them to}} sell well, and well labelled. You cannot just sell a crop of maize as organic simply because it was grown without chemical fertilisers! To be able to sell organic, you need to have the entire production certified, by an independent body. Such procedures are almost always carried out by organisations in the North, and are costly. Produce more soundly, when you can But the costs of certification are not the only problem to be overcome. A survey by FAO showed that 63 % of farmers in sub-Saharan Africa mentioned the lack of information as the greatest obstacle to adopting organic production. In some cases the techniques are known, but they are too expensive. In 1998, the banana producers of Santo Antão, a small island in the Cape Verde archipelago, met to see how they could increase their production of organic bananas (see Spore 74). They left their meeting disappointed: they would have to invest heavily in importing germplasm which was resistant to viruses, and they could not find any scientific body which had developed a method to biologically control the mil pès, a local insect which attacks the pseudo-stem of the banana plant. Similarly, organic methods are not always compatible with socio-economic aspects of production. In Ghana, coconut production has been significantly increased with the application of mineral fertilisers, at relatively low cost. The same result could be obtained, and in a much more sustainable way, by placing wads of coir around the foot of the coconut trees, instead of selling the coir to mat-makers as is the tradition. Another method which has literally borne fruit is to place animal hornmeal at the foot of young fruit trees. However, there are few farmers who can go without the immediate income they get from selling coir or buffalo horns. The long-term is a luxury indeed Organic agriculture is a long-term affair, but few farmers can wait the two to three years needed for removing chemical residues from their land, for recycling vegetable and animal wastes and for setting up crop rotation systems. Furthermore, tenant farmers are not keen to switch over to organic methods if they are unsure of having access to the land in years to come, when the advantages of organic production will have become tangible. These problems were raised during the fifteenth meeting of the Agricultural Committee of the FAO in January 1999. That body proposed setting up networks for researchers to communicate, promoting regional certification bodies and starting farm schools which could undertake field trials to assess the contribution of organic agriculture to food security. Overtly organic, or simply sound ? In any event, many of the best cultivation methods practised in organic farming (mixed cropping, crop rotation, mulching with organic waste, and combining crops and animal production) are routinely recommended by most agricultural scientists as ways to maximise the sustainability of crop yields. In the north of Côte d Ivoire, for example, the GEPRENAF project for the participatory management of natural resources and fauna has encouraged the local community to build and use compost pits, without explicitly going organic. In the same vein, it makes sense to try to minimise and improve the use of synthetic fertilisers and chemical insecticides. This makes for an agriculture and a range of products which is sound. It is an attractive approach, based simply on a set of best farming practices, and one which appeals to more and more farmers, and to consumers. In many cases, the quality of the products is guaranteed by a system of labelling that states that they have been produced in an area where farmers have committed themselves to certain practices which enhance the hygiene quality, and the taste, of the product. Whether the talk is of organic or of sound, what matters is that there is a clear movement towards an agriculture which is more respectful of all living species, and towards real food. The best news would be to receive confirmation that these methods can indeed feed six billion people on the planet today, with more to come. What has to be permanently kept in mind is the message of André Lwoff, winner of the Nobel prize for medicine in 1965 : 'Something is good when it helps to maintain the entirety, stability and beauty of the biotic community (i. e. the living part of the ecosystem), and when it helps something other than that, it is not good. ' [summary points] Put simply The market for organic produce is a promising one, but it is limited. Organic farming methods carry no miracles, but they do, by and large, help sustainability. Sound agriculture is a way of applying these methods pragmatically, and profitably, for the benefit of the largest possibe number of farmers [...] For further information: Codex Alimentarius Secretariat of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme Food and Agriculture Organization Viale delle Terme di Caracalla 00100 Rome, Italy Fax : + 39 06 5705 4593 Website : www. fao. org IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) c/o Ökozentrum Imsbach 66636 Tholey-Theley, Germany Fax : + 49 6853 - 30110 E-mail : IFOAM@t-online. de Website : [URL] Director of Development at the Centre for Science and Industry of La Villette, France 2 Based on the draft guidelines for the production, processing, labelling and marketing of organically produced foods, 23 rd session of Codex Alimentarius of the FAO, June 1999 The spotlight should soon shine on organic agriculture, according to its backers.

Light falls of rain, of approximately 2 mm, coincided with increased spore densities in the air. Pesticide sprays using high pressure equipment generated high wind speeds at the canopy level.

O oxadiazil apresentou excelente controle de B. plantaginea, I. grandifolia e G. parviflora, não sendo eficiente para controle de B. pilosa, embora proporcionasse controle superior ao observado pelo oxadiazon. O oxadiazon foi eficiente até 45 dias após o tratamento para B. plantaginea, G. parviflora e até 90 dias para I. grandifolia. Tanto o oxyfluorfen quanto o imazapyr apresentaram excelente controle das plantas daninhas. De todos os herbicidas avaliados, apenas o imazapyr não deve ser recomendado para aplicação sobre o dossel de Pinus caribaea var. Hondurensis, em face da toxicidade provocada. The selectivity of some herbicides {{were evaluated}} on Pinus caribaea var. Hondurensis seedlings {{as well as}} these herbicide efficiencies in the weed control. When the tubule-produced seedlings were 20 cm height they were transplanted at 2, 0 m x 2, 0 m spacings in fourrows plots with 10, 0 m length. The treatments with oxadiazil (600; 800 and 1000 g ha- 1), oxadiazon (1140; 1520 and 1900 g ha- 1), oxyfluorfen (720 g ha- 1), imazpyr (250 g ha- 1) and controls (weeded and without weeding) were disposed in a randomized block design with four replications. Seven days after transplantation, the herbicides were applied using a CO 2 <b>pressured</b> costal <b>sprayer</b> which was calibrated to provide a 200 L ha- 1 solution. The main weeds causing a larger infestation were Brachiaria plantaginea and Ipomoea grandifolia while Galinsoga parviflora and Bidens pilosa were responsible for a minor one. The oxadiazil showed an excellent control on B. plantaginea, I. grandifolia and G. parviflora; although not being efficient to control Bidens pilosa, it provided a superior control to the one observed in oxadiazon. Oxadiazon showed efficiency until 45 days after the treatment for B. plantaginea, G. parviflora and until 90 days for I. grandifolia as well. Either oxyfluorfen or imazapyr showed an excellent weed control. Among the herbicides evaluated, only imazapyr must not be recommended for "on the top" application for Pinus caribeae var. Hondurensis, due to the toxicity provoked...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de tecnologias de aplicação de pulverização na qualidade da deposição da calda na cultura da cana-de-açúcar e a eficiência relativa e econômica de moléculas de fungicidas no controle e redução de perdas causadas pela ferrugem alaranjada. Para as três tecnologias, utilizou-se primeiro de um pulverizador costal pressurizado por CO 2, com barra de aplicação dotada de pontas de pulverização XR 110. 015, com uma taxa de aplicação de 200 L ha- 1. Um experimento utilizando trator, dois com aplicação aérea e dois com autopropelido. As imagens dos papéis hidrossensíveis foram digitalizadas para avaliação da qualidade da deposição da calda e, posteriormente, avaliar as coberturas através dos programas Conta-Gotas® e CIR 1. 5. Na aplicação terrestre foi delineado o experimento fatorial 2 x 2 x 2, duas pontas de pulverização, XR 110. 02 e TTJ 60 110. 02, duas taxas de aplicação, 120 e 160 L ha- 1 e duas posições dos papéis hidrosensíveis no dossel da planta, 0, 8 e 0, 5 m do solo, seis repetições com dez papéis cada. No dossel {{superior}} da planta observou-se maior cobertura, quando comparado ao dossel inferior, sendo que não se observaram diferenças entre as taxas de aplicação de 120 e 160 L ha- 1. A ponta TTJ 60 110. 02 promoveu cobertura superior à ponta XR 110. 02 quando se utilizou 160 L ha- 1 (40, 34 e 36, 50 %, respectivamente). Para a aplicação aérea em cana-de-açúcar verificou-se nas três variáveis avaliadas, (diâmetro mediano volumétrico, porcentagem de cobertura e número de gotas por cm 2) que houve semelhança estatística entre as pontas de pulverização testados, bem como entre as técnicas de aplicação (taxas e ângulos) estudadas. Não foram encontradas diferenças em relação às posições das folhas na planta. Os resultados denotam a possibilidade de usar taxas de aplicação reduzidas e aplicabilidade dos bicos rotativos para este tipo de pulverizacão. Em outro experimento de distribuição da calda de pulverização aérea com bicos difusores hidráulico, porém com simulação na cultura do milho, com taxas de aplicação de 15, 20 e 30 L ha- 1, a que proporcionou melhor nível de cobertura foi 20 L ha- 1, independente dos difusores utilizados nos bicos hidráulicos, houve maior penetração da calda no dossel superior e mediano da cultura com uma maior cobertura de gotas por cm 2. Finalizando, delineou-se um fatorial com autopropelido, com três pontas (TTI 110. 03, AI 110. 05 e TFW 20), duas taxas de aplicação (100 e 200 L ha- 1) em duas posições dos papéis hidrossensíveis nas folhas + 3 e + 5. Denotamos que o pingente não favoreceu uma maior cobertura percentual nas folhas + 3; o aumento da taxa de aplicação possibilitou uma maior cobertura e que experimentos devem ser conduzidos para a avaliar a relevância do uso ou não desta taxa de aplicação com fungicidas. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the effect of spraying application technologies on the quality of the spray deposition in the culture of sugarcane and the relative and economic efficiency of using molecules of fungicides to control and reduce losses caused by orange rust. For the three technologies, we firstly used a CO 2 <b>pressured</b> <b>sprayer</b> with application bar equipped with spray nozzles XR 110. 015 and application rate of 200 L ha- 1. One experiment using tractor, two with aerial application and two self-propelled. Images of water sensitive paper were scanned to assess the quality of the deposition of the spray and to evaluate its coverage through computer programs Eyedropper® and CIR 1. 5. In terrestrial application, it was designed a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment, two spray nozzles, XR 110. 02 and TTJ 60 110. 02, two application rates, 120 and 160 L ha- 1, and two positions for the water sensitive papers in the plant canopy, 0. 8 and 0, 5 m from the ground, six iterations with tenpapers each. The upper canopy of the plant showed higher coverage, when compared to the lower canopy, whereas no differences were observed between the application rates of 120 and 160 L ha- 1. The noozle TTJ 60 110. 02 promoted higher coverage than the noozle XR 110. 02 when using 160 L ha- 1 (40. 34 and 36. 50 %, respectively). For aerial application on sugarcane, it was observed, for the three variables researched (median volumetric diameter, percentage of coverage, and number of drops per cm 2), statistical similaritiy between the spray nozzles tested, as well as between the application techniques (rates and angles) studied. No differences were found in relation to the positions of the leaves on the plant. The results show the possibility of using reduced application rates and applicability of rotating nozzles for this type of spraying. In another experiment of aerial distribution of spraying with hydraulic nozzle diffusers, but with simulation in the corn crop, with application rates of 15, 20 and 30 L ha- 1, the one which provided the best level of coverage was 20 L ha- 1, regardless of the diffusers used in the hydraulic nozzles, there was greater penetration of the deposition in the upper and medium canopy of the culture with greater coverage drops per cm 2. Finally, we outlined a self-propelled factorial design with three tips (TTI 110. 03, 110. 05 and AI TFW 20), two application rates (100 and 200 L ha- 1), at two positions of the water sensitive paper, in the leaves + 3 and + 5. We denoted that the pendant did not favor a higher coverage percentage in the leaves + 3; that increasing application rate allowed greater coverage and that experiments should be conducted to assess the relevance of using or not this application rate with fungicides...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the mode of {{exposure}} of second instar Colorado potato beetles to Beauveria bassiana on conidia acquisition and resulting mortality were investigated in laboratory studies. Larvae sprayed directly with a B, bassiana condial suspension, larvae exposed to B, bassiana-treated foliage, and larvae both sprayed and exposed to treated foliage experienced 76, 34, and 77 % mortality, respectively. The total number of conidia {{and the proportion of}} germinating conidia were measured over time for four sections of the insect body: the ventral surface of the head (consisting mostly of ventral mouth parts), the ventral abdominal surface, the dorsal abdominal surface, and the legs. From observations at 24 and 36 h posttreatment, mean totals of 161. 1 conidia per insect were found on sprayed larvae, 256. 1 conidia on larvae exposed only to treated foliage, and 408. 3 conidia on larvae both sprayed and exposed to treated foliage, On sprayed larvae, the majority of conidia were found on the dorsal abdominal surface, whereas conidia were predominantly found in the ventral abdominal surface and mouth parts on larvae exposed to treated foliage, Between 24 and 36 h postinoculation the percentage of conidia germinating on sprayed larvae increased slightly from 80 to 84 %), On the treated foliage, the percentage of germinated conidia on larvae increased from 35 % at 24 h to 50 % at 36 h posttreatment, Conidia germination on sprayed larvae on treated foliage was 65 % at 24 h and 75 % at 36 h posttreatment, It is likely that the gradual acquisition of conidia derived from the continuous exposure to B. bassiana inoculum on the foliar surface was responsible for the increase in germination over time on larvae exposed to treated foliage, The density and germination of conidia were observed 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h after being sprayed with or dipped in conidia suspensions or exposing insects to contaminated foliage, Conidia germinated twice as fast on sprayed insects as with any other treatment within the first 12 h, This faster germination {{may be due to the}} <b>pressure</b> of the <b>sprayer</b> enhancing conidial lodging on cuticular surfaces.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.) {{is a major}} pest of {{crucifer}} crops worldwide. It is {{a particularly}} important problem in Southeast Asia where climatic conditions favor a short generation time and rapid proliferation. In countries such as Thailand, the diamondback moth has apparently become resistant to all classes of insecticides, even the newest ones. The {{first part of this}} thesis is the development of a computer database of all the available information on diamondback moth toxicology. About 1, 550 records were extracted from more than 235 published or unpublished documents. These records include information on the geographical location of experiments, the insecticide evaluated, the testing method and the results observed. Most records in the database are from the last decade, and are predominantly from Taiwan, Thailand, the USA and Japan. Trends in the use of various classes of insecticides can easily be followed. Thirty three records have been found of insecticide resistance of more than a thousandfold. An the known mechanisms of resistance are found, and the diamondback moth has become resistant to all the classes of insecticides, including Bacillus thuringiensis but excluding abamectin. Case studies made possible by the use of the database showed a rapid succession in the use of 29 insecticides in the last 26 years in a single country (Thailand). Although this rapid succession is usually ascribed to the development of resistance, a case study on the regional differences in resistance to five insecticides showed marked variations in the level of resistance over distances of 20 miles or more. The possibility of managing insecticide resistance at the local level, already suggested by studies in Hawaii, is thus supported by this analysis. In the second part of this thesis, the toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis var. aizawai and of the bacterial toxin abamectin was tested by two bioassay techniques on populations of the diamondback moth from two Chinese kale fields at locations in Thailand at which the highest levels of resistance to most insecticides have been reported. The leaf-dip bioassay was found to be superior to a residue-vial assay or to the FAO-recommended assay. More than 70 -fold resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis var. aizawai was observed in the populations of DBM collected from these two fields, suporting the theory that resistance resulted in the control failures reported by growers. Resistance did not explain control failures with abamectin as no resistance to this compound could be detected. The third part of this thesis analyzes the intraplant distribution of the diamondback moth larvae in an effort to explain the control failures with abamectin on Chinese kale. Extensive sampling of the various larval instars of the diamondback moth revealed that a majority of second instar larvae were sheltered on the young folded leaves of Chinese kale. The majority of fourth instar larvae and pupae were found on mature (lower) leaves. Inefficient spraying practices observed in the field with high volume, low <b>pressure</b> hydraulic pump <b>sprayers</b> may allow the young larvae to escape pesticide exposure possibly explaining control failures in the absence of physiological resistance. This study shows that resistance in the diamondback moth is a worldwide problem of major proportions. The rapid development of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis in the field is of practical concern. Resistance management programs in developing countries should include mechanisms to optimize insecticide delivery to the protected habitats of diamondback moth on Chinese kale...|$|R
