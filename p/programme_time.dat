There is also evidence of iron workings in the Romano-British period, at Dunkeswell, which radiocarbon dating has placed in the 2nd century. It has been suggested that these and other iron-based technologies gave the hills a fairly industrial landscape during the Romano-British period, providing a source of the name Blackdown Hills. Local iron ores were smelted at Hemyock in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce pure iron until the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|Broadly {{there have}} been three {{distinct}} levels of archaeological research into the site. The first of these is evaluation excavations conducted by Philip Rahtz (1956), Trent & Peak Archaeology (1991) and archaeological television <b>programme</b> <b>Time</b> Team (2011). The second of these were geophysical surveys, which took place under Masters (2004) and Gaunt (2010). Masters surveyed limited sections of the site using both magnetometry and resistivity; Gaunt surveyed the entirety of Castlefield using resistivity.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} archaeological {{features}} visible within the woods, including medieval wood banks, small quarry pits, signs of Roman industrial use and a Roman dwelling place. The first archaeological excavations {{were carried out}} by Edmund Tyrell Artis (1789–1847), the Steward of the nearby FitzWilliam estate, {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. He suggested a Roman villa site, and the presence of iron working and furnaces within the wood, and in 1965 the Peterborough Museum Society found and excavated furnaces within the woods. Little was then investigated until the 2011 series of archaeological television <b>programme</b> <b>Time</b> Team, which included a LIDAR survey and an archaeological dig within these woods. They confirmed that iron extraction from pits within the woodland, Roman iron smelting sites, and other evidence of Roman industry implied an industrial centre that was significant for Roman British iron supplies. A Roman bath-house, with surviving painted wall plaster may indicate an overseer's residence.|$|E

2500|$|Around [...] of the vicus were mapped with a {{geophysical}} survey in 2004. Along with previous surveys, a picture {{began to emerge}} of a quite extensive civilian settlement lying under the fields {{to the east of}} the fort, where Hooppell had done his early test trenches. This led to David Mason, the County Archaeologist, suggesting to the Channel 4 archaeological television <b>programme</b> <b>Time</b> Team that Binchester could provide a fertile ground for investigation. In April 2007, the production company came and spent three days excavating and extending the area surveyed by geophysical means. Apart from discovering more remains of the larger, earlier fort, the programme also found a row of three military mausolea, [...] "the first to have been found in Britain for 150 years." [...] Time Team also identified that the vicus also extended {{to the north of the}} fort. The Binchester programme was broadcast on Channel 4 on 13 January 2008, ending Time Teams involvement with the site.|$|E
2500|$|Doctor Who first {{appeared}} on BBC TV at 17:16:20 GMT on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled <b>programme</b> <b>time,</b> due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy the previous day. It {{was to be a}} regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama Sydney Newman was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along {{with the head of the}} script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode [...] "Human Nature", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity. The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any [...] "bug-eyed monsters". According to producer Verity Lambert; [...] "We didn't have a lot of choice— we only had the Dalek serial to go... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [...] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that." [...] Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial– The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.|$|E
