50|$|The {{degree of}} {{availability}} of comparison information influenced {{the visibility of}} BFLPEs in different school system structures. The BFLPE was most pronounced in school systems in which students of different ability levels were separated into different school tracks. The German school system is an example. In school systems in which students were grouped by ability within one school, the BFLPE was still present, but increased positive assimilation effects counterbalanced negative contrast effects. In sports psychology, physical self-concept is considered both a valued outcome variable and a mediating variable that facilitates the attainment of other valued outcomes like physical skills, health-related physical fitness, <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> <b>exercise</b> adherence in non-elite settings, and improved performance in elite sports. Marsh, Morin, and Parker (2015) demonstrated that the BFLPE exists with regard to physical concept. The study showed that class-average physical ability in physical fitness was negatively associated with physical self-concept.|$|E
50|$|An addiction, by definition, {{includes}} repeated compulsive {{behaviors that}} negatively affect daily living. There {{are two ways}} to classify addictive behaviors: substance addiction and process addiction. An exercise addiction is a type of process addiction, in which an individual's mood toward a certain event becomes dependent on addictive behaviors. Many educational, occupational, and social activities are stopped due to excessive exercising. Depression may develop if exercise is neglected or may result from reoccurring physical injuries that limit exercise. Exercise addiction is often related to obsessive-compulsive disorder as exercise addicts may have obsessions or compulsions toward <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> <b>Exercise</b> addiction is also commonly associated with eating disorders as a secondary symptom of bulimia or anorexia nervosa. Approximately 39-48% of people that have an eating disorder are also addicted to exercise. When diagnosing bulimia, exercise addiction is referred to as a compensatory behavior and indicator of the underlying disorder. Research also shows exercise addiction influences not only the development of eating disorders but also their maintenance.|$|E

This indicates that people with RA might experience additional or more severe barriers to <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> or <b>exercise</b> than the general population. This narrative review {{provides an overview of}} perceived barriers, benefits and facilitators of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in RA. Databases were searched for articles published until September 2014 using the terms ‘rheumatoid arthritis’, ‘physical activity’, ‘exercise’, ‘barriers’, ‘facilitators’, ‘benefits’, ‘motivation’, ‘motivators’ and ‘enablers’. Similarities were found between disease-specific barriers and benefits of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise,</b> e. g. pain and fatigue are frequently mentioned as barriers, but reductions in pain and fatigue are perceived benefits of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise.</b> Even though exercise does not influence the existence of barriers, physically active patients appear to be more capable of overcoming them.

40|$|Background: People with {{advanced}} multiple sclerosis (MS) are less physically active {{than those with}} milder forms of the disease, and wheelchair use has a negative association with <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> participation. Thus, wheelchair users with MS are doubly disadvantaged for accruing the benefits of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise.</b> Appropriate <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> interventions are needed for this population. Methods: We undertook a qualitative study to explore the meanings, motivations, and outcomes of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> in wheelchair users with MS. We sought to understand daily opportunities to accumulate <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise,</b> and to identify perceived barriers, facilitators, and benefits that might inform the design of future interventions. Results: We interviewed 15 wheelchair users (mean age, 52 ± 8. 8 years; n = 12 women). Data were transcribed and analyzed to identify and explore common themes. Our first theme was the reduced {{opportunity to participate in}} <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> due to participants' dependence on mobility devices, environmental adaptations, and tangible support. Our second theme was the importance of incorporating <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> into the everyday environment, highlighting the need for adaptive exercise and accessible environments. This indicated the need to incorporate behavior change modulators into <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> interventions for those {{with advanced}} MS. Health-care professionals {{played an important role in}} promoting increased <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> participation in those with advanced MS.

40|$|Purpose: This {{systematic}} review {{was conducted to}} provide rich and deep evidence of the perceived determinants and consequences of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> based on qualitative research in multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: Electronic databases and article reference lists were searched to identify qualitative studies of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in MS. Studies were included if they were written in English and examined consequences/determinants of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> in persons with MS. Content analysis of perceived determinants and consequences of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> was undertaken using an inductive analysis guided by the <b>Physical</b> <b>Activity</b> for people with Disabilities framework and Social Cognitive Theory, respectively. Results: Nineteen articles were reviewed. The most commonly identified perceived barriers of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> {{were related to the}} environmental (i. e. minimal or no disabled facilities, and minimal or conflicting advice from healthcare professionals) and related to personal barriers (i. e. fatigue, and fear and apprehension). The most commonly identified perceived facilitators of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> were related to the environment (i. e. the type of exercise modality and peer support) and related to personal facilitators (i. e. appropriate exercise and feelings of accomplishment). The most commonly identified perceived beneficial consequences of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> were maintaining physical functions, increased social participation and feelings of self-management and control. The most commonly identified perceived adverse consequences were increased fatigue and feelings of frustration and lost control. Conclusions: Results will inform future research on the perceived determinants and consequences of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in those with MS and can be adopted for developing professional education and interventions for <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in MS. Implications for Rehabilitation <b>Physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> behaviour in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is subject to a number of modifiable determinants.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> is {{associated}} with a lower risk of a range of morbidities and all-cause mortality. Further, it appears that risk reductions are greater when <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and/or <b>exercise</b> is performed at a higher intensity of effort. Why this may be the case is perhaps explained by the accumulating evidence linking physical fitness and performance outcomes (e. g. cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and muscle mass) also to morbidity and mortality risk. Current guidelines about the performance of moderate/vigorous <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> using aerobic <b>exercise</b> modes focuses upon the accumulation of a minimum volume of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and/or <b>exercise,</b> and have thus far produced disappointing outcomes. As such there has been increased interest in the use of higher effort <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> as being potentially more efficacious. Though there is currently debate as to the effectiveness of public health prescription based around higher effort <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise,</b> most discussion around this has focused upon modes considered to be traditionally ‘aerobic’ (e. g. running, cycling, rowing, swimming etc.). A mode customarily performed to a relatively high intensity of effort that we believe has been overlooked is resistance training.

To {{determine}} the effects of Rheumates@Work, an internet-based program supplemented with 4 group sessions, aimed at improving <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> <b>exercise</b> capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and participation in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Methods. Patients were recruited from 3 pediatric rheumatology centers in The Netherlands for an observer-blinded, randomized controlled multicenter trial. Physical activity level, time spent in rest, light, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were recorded in a diary and with an accelerometer, before intervention, after intervention, and at followup after 3 and 12 months (intervention group only). Exercise capacity was assessed using the Bruce treadmill protocol, HRQoL was assessed with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory generic core scale, and participation in school and in physical education classes were assessed by questionnaire. Results. The intervention group consisted of 28 children, and there were 21 children in the control group.
