50|$|From 1945 onwards, Plauen {{fell into}} the Soviet {{occupation}} zone of Germany, which later became the German Democratic Republic (1949-1990). Plauen hosted a large Red Army occupation garrison and, {{in the last years}} of the <b>GDR</b> (<b>DDR),</b> an officer school of the Border Guards ("Grenztruppen der DDR"). The first mass demonstration against the communist regime in the GDR began in Plauen on 7 October 1989; this was the beginning of a series of mass demonstrations across the country and ultimately led to the re-unification of Germany in 1990.|$|R
25|$|LOT Polish Airlines Flight 165 {{hijacking}} was the hijacking of a LOT Polish Airlines {{that occurred}} on 30 August 1978. The hijackers from East Germany (<b>GDR</b> / <b>DDR)</b> were seeking political asylum in West Germany (FRG / BRD). The plane landed safely, {{and the primary}} hijacker was tried and convicted by a German jury in the specially convened United States Court for Berlin and sentenced to time served, the nine months he had already served during pretrial detention.|$|R
50|$|East Germany started DFF2 in 1969, and {{introduced}} colour programming on both channels. In 1972, the DFF was renamed, dropping {{the pretense of}} being an all-Germany service and becoming Fernsehen der <b>DDR</b> (<b>GDR</b> Television) or DDR-FS. Its two channels became known as DDR1 and DDR2.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the German reunification that {{followed}} a year later, many of the symbols of the German Democratic Republic were swept away. Almost all <b>GDR</b> brands (<b>DDR</b> in German) of products disappeared from the stores and were replaced by Western products. However, after some time most of the Eastern Germans began to miss more or less aspects of their former lives (like culture or the known brand marks). Ostalgie particularly refers to the nostalgia for aspects of regular daily life and culture in the former GDR, which disappeared after reunification.|$|R
50|$|The medal {{was awarded}} {{to members of the}} Border Troops of the <b>GDR</b> (Grenztruppen der <b>DDR)</b> as well as civilians for {{exemplary}} performance and personal commitment in securing the state border of the GDR. It recognized outstanding contributions in enhancing the combat readiness and training in the performance of border guard tasks. It could be awarded more than one time.|$|R
50|$|The Tower (Der Turm) is a 2012 German TV drama film {{based on}} the eponymous novel by Uwe Tellkamp. It is about life and history in Dresden between 1982 and 1989 in Eastern Germany, the German Democratic Republic, <b>DDR</b> (<b>GDR)</b> and its last years before demonstrations, the time of Die Wende (the turning from former socialistic {{government}} with Stasi-elements to democracy), the tearing down of the wall and before German reunification.|$|R
50|$|The Cultural Association of the <b>GDR</b> (Kulturbund der <b>DDR,</b> KB) was a {{federation}} of local {{clubs in the}} German Democratic Republic (GDR). It formed part of the Socialist Unity Party-led National Front, and sent representatives to the Volkskammer. The association had numerous writers as its member, including Willi Bredel, Fritz Erpenbeck, Bernhard Kellermann, Victor Klemperer, Anna Seghers, Bodo Uhse, Arnold Zweig. Its first chairman was Johannes Robert Becher.|$|R
50|$|From 1954 to 1964, Maetzig was {{the first}} {{president}} of the German University of Cinema in Potsdam-Babelsberg, where he also held the post of Professor of Stage Direction. From 1967 to 1988 he was an executive member of the Verband der Film- und Fernsehschaffenden der <b>DDR</b> (<b>GDR</b> Federation of Film and Television Producers). He then became the vice-president of the Fédération Internationale des Ciné-Clubs (International Federation of Cinema Clubs) (FICC) in 1974.|$|R
50|$|The former Prussian state {{parliament}} (Preußischer Landtag) {{served as}} {{the seat of the}} Council from 1950 to 1953. From 1961 to 1990 the Council's offices were located in the former Old City Hall of Berlin at No. 47 Klosterstraße. The Law Gazette of the <b>GDR</b> (Gesetzblatt der <b>DDR)</b> was also published by the Council. In addition, the Council’s Press Office made official government announcements and was responsible for the accreditation of foreign journalists in the GDR.|$|R
50|$|The Deutsche Post (DP), also Deutsche Post of the GDR (German: Deutsche Post der DDR) was the {{state-owned}} postal and telecommunications monopoly of the German Democratic Republic (GDR - East Germany). The DP was {{placed under the}} control of the Ministry for Postal and Telecommunication Services of the GDR (Ministerium für Post- und Fernmeldewesen der DDR -(MPF)) - a member of the Council of Ministers of the <b>GDR</b> (Ministerrat der <b>DDR)</b> - and was in operation from 1949 until the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has seen}} military {{use with the}} air force of East Germany (<b>DDR</b> <b>GDR)</b> and later the united Germany (one Il-62MK and two Il-62Ms) and {{is believed to have}} been operated by the air forces of other countries including Cuba, Gambia, Georgia, Libya, North Korea, Russia, Romania and Ukraine. It is used as an emergency response aircraft by the Russian government (RA-86570 and RA-86495). In addition to military use, it has been used as a personnel or head-of-state transport by Russia (at least eight examples), Ukraine, East Germany, Georgia (2748552), Uzbekistan (UK-86569), Gambia (C5-RTG), Mozambique, Sudan (ST-PRA), Cuba, North Korea, and Czechoslovakia, the government of which used an Il-62 (OK-BYV) and three Il-62Ms between 1974 and 1996. Some head-of-state examples were produced in VIP interior configuration whilst others were standard civilian versions.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, the East German side of {{the border}} was guarded {{initially}} by the Border Troops (Pogranichnyie Voiska) of the Soviet NKVD (later the KGB). They were supplemented from 1946 by a locally recruited paramilitary force, the German Border Police (Deutsche Grenzpolizei or DGP), before the Soviets handed over full control of the border to the East Germans in 1955/56. In 1961, the DGP was converted into a military force within the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA). The newly renamed Border Troops of the <b>GDR</b> (Grenztruppen der <b>DDR,</b> commonly nicknamed the Grenzer) came under the NVA's Border Command or Grenzkommando. They were responsible for securing and defending the borders with West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic Sea and West Berlin. At their peak, the Grenztruppen had up to 50,000personnel.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, Germany {{was divided}} into what became {{eventually}} a Western and an Eastern Zone. By 1949, Germany had a parliamentary democracy in the West, called the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG - natively BRD, commonly [...] "West Germany"), and a communist state in the East, called the German Democratic Republic (<b>GDR</b> - natively <b>DDR,</b> commonly [...] "East Germany"). Opportunities for reunification of these two halves appeared unlikely from the Western standpoint because Stalin and the East German communists did not want to allow any free elections in the GDR. The SED feared losing power if free elections were held. At that point in history, Germany had not yet signed a peace treaty for World War II because of the animosity between the three Western Powers and the Soviet Union. It would not sign one until the Two Plus Four Agreement in 1990.|$|R
5000|$|The {{predecessor}} of the NVR, the Security Commission of the CC Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), met for {{the first}} time on 6 July 1954. With the enactment of the [...] "Law on the Formation of the National Defense Council of the GDR" [...] on 13 February 1960, the Security Commission was transformed into the NVR. [...] When the Council of State of the <b>GDR</b> (Staatsrat der <b>DDR)</b> was created on 12 September 1960 to replace the office of President of the GDR, the law creating the Staatsrat (which amended the 1949 GDR Constitution) also acknowledged the role of the NVR in GDR defense policy. [...] On 9 April 1968, when the 1968 GDR Constitution became effective, the NVR was designated as the supreme leadership body of the state in time of war or national emergency, with full legislative and executive authority. The first session of the NVR convened on 16 March 1960; the 78th, and last, session convened on 16 June 1989.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1974, GDR {{citizens}} {{were not allowed}} to hold foreign currency. By decree of the Council of Ministers of the <b>GDR</b> (Ministerrat der <b>DDR),</b> this ban was relaxed in that year, and East Germans were then allowed to shop in most Intershops. The Intershops at Autobahn rest stops (so-called [...] "Transitshops"), which were sometimes self-service, were still only for travellers from non-socialist countries and required travel documents for entry. Additionally, certain duty-free items such as tobacco, spirits, coffee, perfume, brand name clothing, watches, and jewellery required a foreign passport. The prices for these goods were significantly less than in West Germany or West Berlin, while the other goods that would have interested East Germans were relatively expensive. East Germans could not legally exchange East German marks for hard currency. The only legal ways for East Germans to acquire hard currency were either as gifts from relatives living in the West or wages earned for work in Western countries. In 1974, there were 271 Intershops.|$|R
40|$|This essay explores {{aspects of}} the tension between art and {{politics}} in the German Democratic Republic in the 1960 s {{by means of a}} case study of Willi Sitte’s Rufer II (Caller II) of 1964 [fig. 1]. By the time he produced this work, Sitte was already a controversial figure in the GDR and on his way to prominence as a painter of complex, monumental, often multi-panelled works allegorising themes of war, class struggle, and life under socialism. 1964, the year in which he painted Rufer II, was a crucial turning point for Sitte, marked by both public statements from the artist pledging his allegiance to the socialist way of the GDR, and by public recognition: he received the Kunstpreis der <b>DDR</b> (<b>GDR</b> Art Prize), and was elected to the central committee of the Republic’s Verein Bildender Künstler (Union of Visual Artists). He became the Union’s president in 1974 and held the post until 1988, during which time he was justifiably described as the most powerful artist of the GDR...|$|R
50|$|However, Inge Müller's {{dream of}} working {{together}} with Heiner as equals soon began to fade. She stood {{in the shadow of}} Heiner, who considered her more a coworker rather than as an equal partner. She began an affair with Heiner's 16 year - old brother Wolfgang Müller in 1956 which failed and relations with her husband worsened noticeably. The awarding of the Heinrich Mann Prize to the both of them in 1959 did nothing to improve the situation. In addition, the expulsion of Heiner from the authors union of the <b>GDR</b> (Schriftstellerverband der <b>DDR)</b> compounded these problems. Plagued by depressions and psychosomatic troubles she attempted suicide several times. She was finally successful after an attempt on June 1, 1966. Only 41 years old, the writer died in her apartment on Kissingenplatz 12 of medication overdose and poisonous gas. The Aufbau Verlag made a futile endeavour to publish a volume with her poetry shortly after her death. Her works quickly passed into oblivion because a suicide did not fit in the literary picture of East German politics and, also, Heiner reclaimed the sole authorship of the collaboration. The first posthumous publication of her works was carried out by Bernd Jentzsch in 1976 in his first seriesPoesiealbum, first appeared in 1985, 20 years after her death, a book, which made accessible Inge Müller's literary work of broad public nature, with Richard Pietraß' Wenn ich schon sterben muß.|$|R
40|$|The {{progress}} of European {{history in the}} latter centuries witnessed {{the emergence of a}} number of state powers. Some of these states became colonial powers and remained so {{until the end of the}} twentieth-century's two World Wars. After the end of the Second World War, the world, but particularly Europe, became divided into two conflicting ideological spheres, East and West. Western Europe, particularly a divided and occupied Germany came under an Anglo-American influence on the one hand, while East Germany (<b>GDR</b> or <b>DDR)</b> and other Eastern Bloc countries came under the control of a communist Soviet Union. It is safe to say that there existed homogenising influences on both sides. In broad terms, while borders were redefined and new states emerged, for the first time ever, a Slavonic minority group in the region of Lusatia known as the Sorbs saw the possibility of their fate being determined by fellow Slays. Although the circumstances seemed to be favourable to claim a separate Sorbian state, the Sorbs found themselves under the control of the Marxist-Leninist GDR. However, on the surface at least, the Sorbs of Lusatia were constitutionally protected under this regime. In other words, they were protected under a nationalities policy, which claimed to protect and promote the Sorbian language and culture. Such measures raise certain questions concerning the ulterior motive for what would seem a reversal in attitude towards a previously considered inferior (racial) group. Was it a way of rehabilitating the past, or were the Sorbs used for ideological reasons during the years 1949 to 1989 ? After the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989, German re-unification followed, which changed the political circumstances for the Germans and the Sorbs. This study examines the changes in the ethnic status of the Sorbs, which in turn changed the status of their language and culture. At the same time however, it is considered that it was among the first Slavonic nations to become a member of the European Union. Moreover, Europe instituted a number of measures to maintain its cultural diversity and heterogeneity, which includes ethnic or national minorities. By using a predominantly comparative approach to analyse the ethno-linguistic status of the Sorbs, past and present, this study incorporates a wide-ranging examination in the contexts of other minorities in Germany, federal and state constitutions, European law and global influences. The study concludes that the ethno-linguistic status of the Sorbs has qualitatively changed from that of a more or less protected minority in Germany to that of just another European minority, subject to the same assimilatory pressures of globalisation, and therefore the same challenge of survival...|$|R
