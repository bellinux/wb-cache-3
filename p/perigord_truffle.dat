The first truffle vodka, Black Moth Vodka, is a natural vodka infused with black <b>Périgord</b> <b>truffles</b> (Tuber melanosporum). Although primarily used as a spirit in its own right and mixed in a range of cocktails, truffle vodka is also used by various chefs to flavour dishes by evaporating the alcohol through cooking whilst retaining the truffle aroma.|$|R
50|$|The first U.S. truffle orchard to {{successfully}} produce commercial quantities of culinary-quality black <b>Périgord</b> <b>truffles</b> {{is located in}} Chuckey. Tom Michaels, who had written a Ph.D thesis on truffle cultivation, started cultivating truffles {{in the area in}} 2000 after observing that the area's limestone soil was similar to the soil of the Périgord region of France, where black truffles are native. In 2007, the first year that truffles were harvested from the orchard, it included 2,500 hazelnut trees growing on 20 acres (8 hectares) of land. Thirty pounds (14 kilograms) of truffles were produced in the first year.|$|R

30|$|True truffles, {{belonging}} to the genus Tuber (Tuberaceae, Pezizales, Pezizomycetes), produce hypogeous ascocarps, which are formed in soil or sometimes within layers of leaf litter.

They are symbiotic fungi that develop association with fine roots of specific host trees (T. oregonense Trappe, Bonito and P. Rawl. with Douglas fir) or broad host ranges (T. aestivum (Wulfen:Fr.) Spreng. with some plant species in Betulaceae, Corylaceae, Fagaceae, Tiliaceae, Pinaceae and Cistaceae) (Hall et al. 2007).

The aim of the method is to recover areas of time which influences the most the outcome. A Bayes estimator of the support is built with a specific loss function, as well as two Bayes estimators of the coefficient function, a first one which is smooth and a second one which is a step function.

Pressurization of truffles at 300 MPa/ 4 °C reduced the bacterial count of Pseudomonas by 5. 3 log cycles. Higher pressures of 400 or 500 MPa, at 4 °C or 20 °C, allowed us to slightly increase the level of destruction to the value of ca. 6. 5 log cycles but did not permit us to completely inactivate Pseudomonas. The results showed a residual charge of about 10 CFU/g. Pressure-shift freezing of truffles, which consists in applying a pressure of 200 MPa/- 18 °C for 10 min and then quickly releasing this pressure to induce freezing, reduced the population of Pseudomonas by 3. 3 log cycles.

40|$|Truffles are ascomycete fungi {{belonging}} to genus Tuber, and they form ectomycorrhizal associations with trees and shrubs. Transposable elements constitute more than 50  % {{of the black}} <b>Périgord</b> <b>truffle</b> (Tuber melanosporum) genome, which are mainly class 1 gypsy retrotransposons, but their impact on its genome is unknown. The aims {{of this study are}} to investigate the diversity of gypsy retrotransposons in this species and their evolutionary history by analysing the reference genome and six resequenced genomes of different geographic accessions. Using the reverse transcriptase sequences, six different gypsy retrotransposon clades were identified. Tmt 1 and Tmt 6 are the most abundant transposable elements, representing 14 and 13  % of the T. melanosporum genome, respectively. Tmt 6 showed a major burst of proliferation between 1 and 4 million years ago, but evidence of more recent transposition was observed. Except for Tmt 2, the other clades tend to aggregate, and their mode of transposition excluded the master copy model. This suggests that each new copy has the same probability of transposing as other copies. This study provides a better view of the diversity and dynamic nature of gypsy retrotransposons in T. melanosporum. Even if the major gypsy retrotransposon bursts are old, some elements seem to have transposed recently, suggesting that they may continue to model the truffle genomes...|$|E
40|$|Although {{truffles}} are cultivated since decades, {{their life}} cycle {{and the conditions}} stimulating ascocarp formation still remain mysterious.

A polyphasic approach combining 454 -pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA gene, TTGE, in situ hybridization and functional GeoChip 3. 0 revealed that Black truffle ascocarps provide a habitat to complex bacterial communities that are clearly differentiated from those of the surrounding soil and the ectomycorrhizosphere. The composition of these communities is dynamic and evolves during the maturation of the ascocarps with an enrichment of specific taxa and a differentiation of the gleba and peridium-associated bacterial communities.

In this study, our aim was to characterize the small-scale genetic structure of both male and female genotypes over five years in an orchard to better understand the T. melanosporum sexual reproduction strategy, male genotype dynamics, and origins. Two-hundred forty-one ascocarps, 475 ectomycorrhizas, and 20 soil cores were harvested and genotyped using microsatellites and mating type genes. Isolation by distance analysis revealed pronounced small-scale genetic structures for both female and male genotypes. The genotypic diversity was higher for male than female genotypes with numerous small size genotypes suggesting an important turnover due to ascospore recruitment. Larger and perennial female and male genotypes were also detected. Only three genotypes (1. 5 %) were found as both female and male genotypes (hermaphrodites) while most were detected only as female or male genotype (dioecy). Our results suggest that germinating ascospores act as male genotypes, but we also proposed that soil mycelium could be a reservoir of male genotypes...|$|R

40|$|Ulf Büntgen [...] . [et. al. ]The <b>Périgord</b> black <b>truffle</b> is an {{exclusive}} culinary delicacy, but its Mediterranean harvests have declined, despite cultivation efforts since the 1970 s. The role of long-term irrigation, symbiotic fungus-host interaction, and microbial belowground progression remain poorly understood, because generally too short experimental settings miss the necessary degree of real world complexity and reliable information from truffle orchards is limited. Here, we conduct the first dendrochronological and wood anatomical assessment of 295 holm oaks, {{which have been}} growing under different irrigation intensities in the world's largest truffle orchard in Spain. The relationships between different climatic variables (monthly temperature means and precipitation totals) and dendro-parameters (ring width, vessel count and vessel size) of the oak hosts are utilized to disentangle direct and indirect drivers of truffle fruit body production. Irrigation at medium - instead of high - intensity is most beneficial for oak growth. Non-irrigated trees reveal overall lower stem increments. Warmer temperatures from February to April and wetter conditions from May to July enhance host vitality and possibly also its interplay with fungi symbionts via increased fine root production and mycorrhizal colonization. Adequately irrigated Mediterranean orchards may counteract some of the drought-induced natural truffle decline, and help stabilizing rural tourism, regional agriculture and global markets. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Hazel (Corylus avellana L.) {{seedlings}} inoculated {{with the}} <b>Perigord</b> black <b>truffle</b> fungus (Tuber melanosporum Vitt.) are being planted in Tasmania {{in an attempt}} to culture truffles. Competition from other ectomycorrhizal fungi has a significant impact on truffle production in Europe and can be expected to have some effect on the Tasmanian industry. This thesis examines ectomycorrhizal fungi occurring in Tasmania with respect to their ability to form mycorrhizas with hazel and compete with T melanosporum under various soil treatments. Stands of hazel previously established for nut production or as ornaments were surveyed for the sporocarps of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Several species were found; including species that are new either to Australia or Tasmania. The endemic species Descomyces albus (Klotzsch) Bougher & Castellano and Podohydnangium sp., previously thought to. be Eucalyptus specific were. fruiting under hazel. T melanosporum occurs naturally on calcareous soils in Europe. Truffieres in Tasmania are heavily limed to create a calcareous soil environment. The response of selected introduced and endemic ectomycorrhizal fungi to applied lime was studied in a glasshouse experiment. Some of the endemic species, which would normally inhabit acidic soils, were unable to survive high rates of lime application and therefore should not pose a threat to the truffle industry. The introduced species were generally more tolerant to lime application. A subsequent glasshouse experiment sought to separate the effects of pH and calcium on colonisation by T melanosporum. Seedling hazels were inoculated with T melanosporum. After twelve months, they were transplanted using soil amended with fourteen rates of either CaCO 3, CaSO 4, or MgCO 3. The seedlings were then exposed to spores of two endemic fungal species. Applied CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 increased level of colonisation by T melanosporum, whereas CaSO 4 had little or no effect. Soil pH appears to have a stronger influence on colonisation by T melanosporum than the level of applied or exchangeable calcium. Colonisation by endemic species was low and sporadic across all treatments. Another glasshouse experiment of similar design to that above was established to observe the effect of lime and phosphorus interaction. Applied lime significantly increased the level of colonisation of T melanosporum, but phosphorus had no effect, even at very high rates of application (150 mg P / Kg soil). A commercial truffiere was surveyed for the level of colonisation by T melanosporum and other ectomycorrhizal fungi. Descriptions were compiled of the mycorrhizas of fungal species found in the glasshouse and field experiments to assist in their future identification. The morphological identification of Tuber mycorrhizas was confirmed using PCR and RFLP of DNA extracted from single mycorrhizal tips...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} an objective {{view on the}} viability of growing the truffle Tuber melanosporum in the Willamette Valley. Included {{in this study are}} the history of the truffle, biological cycle, habitat description, method of cultivation and an enterprise budget for commercial production in the Willamette Valley. The truffle, a fungus that grows naturally underground, has long been a delicacy in European culture and it continues to appear in expensive restaurants around the world. The cultivation of T melanosporum was established first in Europe, but is gaining popularity {{in other parts of the}} world. Farms are appearing in Israel, Australia, The United States, New Zealand, and other nations. North Carolina and California also have operating truffle farms. Several species are currently cultivated in Europe, but the most prevalent and the only species cultivated outside of Europe is the <b>Perigord</b> (Black) <b>truffle,</b> Tuber melanosporum. Truffles are the fruiting bodies of various fungi. Spores produced within fruiting body germinate into tiny hair-like filaments (mycelia) that eventually attach themselves to the root tips of a host species and form mycorrhiza. After about six years, secondary mycelia emanating from the mycorrhizae grow together into a knot and form the fruiting body or carpophore. Host trees vary according to the location and species of truffle, however oak and hazelnut trees are most commonly used. Host trees that have been mycorrhized with truffles can be purchased from reputable growers for about 15 each. The climatic characteristics of the Willamette Valley are similar to those of major truffle growing regions in Europe. In addition, soils in the Willamette Valley may have an advantage because potentially competitive ectomycorrhizal fungi are adapted to acidic soils. T. melanosporum is grown in soils with high pH. Raising the soil pH for T. melanosporum could reduce the competition from native fungi adapted to acidic soils. Although few attempts have been made to cultivate truffles in Oregon, the Willamette Valley could be an ideal habitat for growing Tuber melanosporum. Establishment of a truffle farm takes 7 to 12 years depending on the species and the condition of the plot. Land must be free of plants that support ectomycorrhizal fungi, have evenly mixed sand, silt and clay (or well drained soils) and have an alkaline pH. An irrigation system should be installed in case of drought. After the trees are planted, maintenance of the truffle plot involves tilling the soil once a year, liming to maintain pH and pruning the host trees. Production typically begins after about six years and full production after about 10 years. Yields are difficult to estimate because truffle production is heavily influenced by weather conditions. In Europe, typical yields range from 50 - 150 kg per hectare (50 - 150 pounds per acre) in different plantations. The enterprise budget for a truffle farm in the Willamette Valley considers the costs and returns for a newly established farm. The budget is, by design, only a guide and does not consider individual differences among farmers. For example, it is expected that truffle cultivation will be an enterprise added to an existing farm, however the included budget includes costs of renting machinery for tilling. For a farmer that already owns his/her machinery, the budget must be altered accordingly. Truffles are expensive to produce. Profit and loss depend greatly on yield and price per pound. Also, commercial cultivation of truffles has not been achieved in Oregon and results are unpredictable. In good years, however some farms yield more than 100 kg per hectare (100 pounds per acre). Market prices fluctuate and may depend heavily on reputation as well as quality of truffles. In 2001, fresh truffles of the variety Tuber melanosporum were available on the Internet for about 225 /kg (500 /pound). Other truffle species such as T. magnatum sell for about 765 /kg (1700 /pound). The truffle industry is virtually unexplored in Oregon and there is potential to grow T. melanosporum in the Willamette Valley. This is a high risk crop due to the initial investment, a 10 year establishment period and fluctuations in yield and market values. Still, truffles are a low maintenance crop, can be sold worldwide and are highly acclaimed among gourmets. Also, truffle supply is limited, resulting in extreme high price. Socially and economically it appears that Tuber melanosporum could be a viable enterprise in the Willamette Valley...|$|R
