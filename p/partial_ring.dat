The A44 runs south-east to Evesham and west to Leominster and Aberystwyth and crosses Worcester Bridge. The A38 trunk road runs south to Tewkesbury and Gloucester and north-north-east to Droitwich and Bromsgrove and Birmingham. The A4103 goes west-south-west to Hereford. The A422 heads east to Alcester, branching from the A44 a mile east of the M5. The city is encompassed by a <b>partial</b> <b>ring</b> road (A4440) which is formed, rather inconsistently, by single and dual carriageways. The A4440 road provides a second road bridge across the Severn (Carrington Bridge) {{just west of the}} A4440-A38 junction.

25|$|Beersheba is {{the central}} {{transport}} hub of southern Israel, served by roads, railways and air. Beersheba is connected to Tel Aviv via Highway 40, the second longest highway in Israel, which passes {{to the east of}} the city and is called the Beersheba bypass because it allows travellers from the north to go to southern locations, avoiding the more congested city center. From west to east, the city is divided by Highway 25, which connects to Ashkelon and the Gaza Strip to the northwest, and Dimona to the east. Finally, Highway 60 connects Beersheba with Jerusalem and the Shoket Junction, and goes through the West Bank. On the local level, a <b>partial</b> <b>ring</b> road surrounds the city from the north and east, and Road 406 (Rager Blvd.) goes through the city center from north to south.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} 17 tram routes, totalling , and serving {{most parts of}} the city, {{including}} three <b>partial</b> <b>ring</b> routes (7, 81 and 94). The routes have a very varied feel, including street running through narrow streets in working-class districts (line 81), cobbled central reservation, reserved track through parkland and woods (line 44), signal-controlled running in tunnels (the premetro lines 3 and 4 in the North–South Axis, and 7), and short stretches in cutting (the old route 18, closed in 2007). Almost all trams are double-ended and all are double-sided, and while some stub termini remain (4, 51, 97), most have loops. The route pattern shows some notable gaps, particularly along major radial routes, because these were originally served by the national network of buurtspoorwegen/tramways vicinaux. These had a gauge of one metre, rather than the Brussels standard gauge, and so the tracks could not easily be taken over when the lines were progressively closed from the 1960s onwards.|$|E

40|$|Effects of <b>partial</b> and {{complete}} <b>ringing</b> {{in the trunk}} on overall nutrient status of peach (Prunus persica Batsch. cv. `Hikawahakuho`) trees were examined by using one-year-old trees. The <b>partial</b> <b>ringing</b> comprised removal of 2 cm length bark and remaining 2 mm strip whereas complete ringing no remaining strip. Organic (sugar and starch) and inorganic nutrient content in leaves, stems and roots were monitored for eight weeks after ringing. The treatment reduced overall reduction in sugar and starch content in all plant parts. Each sugar component also showed similar trends. The N and Ca content in the above ground parts were lower in the ringed plants than control but the reverse was true in the roots. On the other hand, P, K and Mg content in all plant parts were declined by the treatment. <b>Partial</b> <b>ringing</b> prevented the translocation of 13 C-photosynthates from the above ground parts to roots although entire inhibition was apparent in the complete ringing.

40|$|Helical {{parameters}} {{displayed on}} a Ramachandran plot allow peptide structures with successive residues having identical main chain conformations to be studied. We investigate repeating dipeptide main chain conformations and present Ramachandran plots encompassing the range of possible structures. Repeating dipeptides fall into the categories: rings, ribbons, and helices. <b>Partial</b> <b>rings</b> occur {{in the form of}} “nests” and “catgrips”; many nests are bridged by an oxygen atom hydrogen bonding to the main chain NH groups of alternate residues, an interaction optimized by the ring structure of the nest. A novel recurring feature is identified that we name unpleated β, often situated at the ends of a β-sheet strand. Some are <b>partial</b> <b>rings</b> causing the polypeptide to curve gently away from the sheet; some are straight. They lack β-pleat and almost all incorporate a glycine. An example is the first glycine in the GxxxxGK motif of P-loop proteins. Ribbons in repeating dipeptides can be either flat, as seen in repeated type II and type II′ β-turns, or twisted, as in multiple type I and type I′ β-turns. Hexa- and octa-peptides in such twisted ribbons occur frequently in proteins, predominantly with type I β-turns, and are the same as the “β-bend ribbons” hitherto identified only in short peptides. One is seen in the GTPase-activating protein for Rho in the active, but not the inactive, form of the enzyme. It forms a β-bend ribbon, which incorporates the catalytic arginine, allowing its side chain guanidino group to approach the active site and enhance enzyme activit...|$|R
