[...] "Deduct this Kur-Sachsen from the Austrian side," [...] calculates Belleisle; [...] "add him to ours, it is almost an equality of votes. Kur-Baiern, our own Imperial Candidate; Kur-Koln, his Brother; Kur-Pfalz, by genealogy his Cousin (not to mention Berg-Julich matters); here are three Wittelsbachers, knit together; three sure votes; King Friedrich, Kur-Brandenburg, there is a fourth; and if Kur-Sachsen would join?" [...] But who knows if Kur-Sachsen will! The poor soul has himself thoughts of being Kaiser; then no thoughts, and again some: thoughts which Belleisle knows how to handle. [...] "Yes, Kaiser you, your Majesty; excellent!" [...] And sets to consider the methods: [...] "Hm, ha, hm! Think, your Majesty: ought not that Bohemian Vote to be excluded, for one thing? Kur-Bohmen is fallen into the distaff, Maria Theresa herself cannot vote. Surely question will rise, Whether distaff can, validly, hand it over to distaff's husband, as they are about doing? Whether, in fact, Kur-Bohmen is not in abeyance for this time?" [...] "So!" [...] answered Kur-Sachsen, Reichs-Vicarius. And thereupon meetings were summoned; Nightmare Committees sat on this matter under the Reichs-Vicar, slowly hatching it; and at length brought out, [...] "Kur-Bohmen NOT transferable by the distaff; Kur-Bohmen in abeyance for this time." [...] Greatly to the joy of Belleisle; infinitely to the chagrin of her Hungarian Majesty,--who declared it a crying injustice (though I believe legally done in every point); and by and by, even made it a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nullity,</b> destructive to the Election altogether, when her Hungarian Majesty's affairs looked up again, and the world would listen to Austrian sophistries and obstinacies. This was an essential service from Kur-Sachsen.

40|$|The <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the {{juridical}} {{person is a}} notion without correspondence in the old civil law theory. In fact the regulation of the {{juridical person}} is a matter that enters relatively recent civil law because in traditional approach civil law dealt with natural persons and associations of natural persons only. The difference between the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the agreement of association and the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person itself, born by such association, is clearly revealed by the law. The two notions are still linked. One cannot imagine a <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the agreement without the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the legal person born by such agreement. Nevertheless the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person is laid down independently, comprising limited cases of occurrences. The regulation <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person finds out its correspondence in the Company Law. The <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> {{the company has a}} distinct regulation, in Company Law, in line with the regulation <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person. In this case the civil law imported the notion from commercial law in order to limit the incidences <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> aiming the security of the civil circuit and the interest of the third persons. In a general accepted way, nullity represents a civil sanction which impedes the effects of an act concluded in a way that breach the law.

Started {{from the fact that the}} nullity is not considered by the legislator a simple sanction applicable to the juridical acts but it affects directly the existence of the company and becomes a means to sanction the creation of a legal person by disregarding the imperative legal provisions, we analyzed firstly the Romanian (II) and the EU legal provisions regarding the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies. The elements of this analyze helped us to qualify the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies and its effect (III).
