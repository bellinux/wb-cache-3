The rotary actuator is connected to an actuator member which is rotatably connected to a thruster attachment member connected to a body of the thruster. A stabilizer member is rotatably mounted to the frame and to the thruster attachment member. The thruster is selectively movable in the pitch and yaw directions responsive to movement of the actuator members by the actuators on the thruster <b>support</b> <b>assemblies.</b> A failure of any one actuator on a thruster <b>support</b> <b>assembly</b> will generally still enable limited thruster positioning capability in two directions.

40|$|Abstract: Static {{synchronous}} compensation (STATCOM) is {{an application}} that utilizes a voltage source converter (VSC) to provide instantaneous reactive <b>power</b> <b>support</b> to the connected power system. Conventionally, STATCOMs are employed for reactive <b>power</b> <b>support</b> only. However, with {{the integration of}} energy storage (ES) into a STATCOM, it can provide active <b>power</b> <b>support</b> {{in addition to the}} reactive <b>power</b> <b>support.</b> The control method of a STATCOM with an energy storage device is discussed in this paper. To determine the switching level control, SPWM (Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation) methods is used. This paper will introduce an integrated STATCOM/BESS for the improvement of dynamic and transient stability and transmission capability. This work suggests a simple and easy to implement PI controller to control the operation of ESTATCOM placed at the weak point of Mosul city 132 kV ring system. The whole system including the ESTATCOM and its controller has been simulated after some kinds of disturbances and the results show improvements in the dynamic active and reactive power capabilities of the system...|$|R

40|$|Longwall face {{recovery}} {{is almost certainly}} the most involved recurring geotechnical problem faced by operators, with major loss potential should problems occur. The outcomes of an industry sponsored (ACARP) research project on the geotechnical issues associated with conventional longwall recoveries is presented with updates the experiences gained. A number of critical features of the geotechnical environment, support design and mining geometry have a pronounced impact on ground control during take-off. A model of roof behaviour at the take-off point has been developed and validated. Key geotechnical issues include low roof competency (ie weak roof), an adverse weighting environment, geological structure and horizontal stress concentrations at the gate ends (generally the maingate). All of these are identifiable either at the support design stage or, at worst, {{prior to the start}} of <b>powered</b> <b>support</b> removal, which is the critical stage of the take-off process. Key aspects of the geometry and process are the ability to maintain <b>powered</b> <b>support</b> resistance during bolt-up and take-off, the direction in which the <b>powered</b> <b>supports</b> are removed, the impact of take-off chutes and the speed of the <b>powered</b> <b>support</b> removal process.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the factors}} to {{maintain}} system survivability is the adequate reactive <b>power</b> <b>support</b> to the system. Lack of reactive <b>power</b> <b>support</b> may cause undesirable voltage decay leading to total system instability. Thus, appropriate reactive <b>power</b> <b>support</b> scheme should be arranged {{in order to maintain}} system stability. The strength of a system capacity is normally denoted as system loadability. This paper presents the enhancement of system loadability through optimal reactive power planning technique using a newly developed optimization technique, termed as Multiagent Immune Evolutionary Programming (MAIEP). The concept of MAIEP is developed based on the combination of Multiagent System (MAS), Artificial Immune System (AIS) and Evolutionary Programming (EP). In realizing the effectiveness of the proposed technique, validation is conducted on the IEEE- 26 -Bus Reliability Test System. The results obtained from pre-optimization and post-optimization process were compared which eventually revealed the merit of MAIEP. Keywords—Load margin, MAIEP, Maximum loading point, ORPP...|$|R
