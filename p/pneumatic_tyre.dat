Hooley drummed up support by offering financial journalists cheap shares and appointing aristocrats to the board, and quickly sold the business again {{this time as the}} Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company for £5million providing a gross profit to Hooley's syndicate including du Cros of £1.7million.|$|E
25|$|In 1893 home {{manufacture}} was relocated from Belfast and Dublin to Coventry, {{the centre}} of the British cycle industry. The Dublin Corporation had launched a case against <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> claiming nuisance from the smell of rubber and naphtha. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> soon spread developing interests in Birmingham. The following year a major interest was taken in their component supplier Byrne Bros India Rubber of Lichfield Road, Aston Birmingham. The same year du Cros started Cycle Components Manufacturing in Selly Oak to supply inner tubes.|$|E
25|$|The late 1880s was {{a period}} of great demand for John Kemp Starley's new safety bicycles. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> began cycle tyre {{production}} in Belfast in late 1890, and quickly expanded to fill consumer demand. However, in 1890, J B Dunlop's patent was withdrawn. It had been discovered that Robert William Thomson had first patented the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> in 1845. J B Dunlop and Harvey du Cros together worked through the ensuing considerable difficulties. They employed inventor Charles Kingston Welch and also acquired other rights and patents which allowed them to protect their business's position to some extent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> {{established}} divisions in Europe and North America sending there four of du Cros's six sons. Factories were established overseas because foreign patents rights {{would only be}} maintained if the company was engaged in active manufacture where its tyres were sold. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> partnered with local cycle firms such as Clement Cycles in France and Adler in Germany in order to limit the necessary capital expenditure. An American business {{was established in the}} USA in 1893 with a factory in Buffalo, New York after Harvey du Cros junior was old enough (21) to sign the necessary deeds.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, John Boyd Dunlop, a Scottish {{veterinary}} surgeon living in Ireland discovered the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> principle. Willie Hume created publicity for J B Dunlop's discovery by winning {{seven out of}} eight races with his pneumatic tyres. To own the rights and exploit the discovery, the <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> and Booth's Cycle Agency Co. Ltd was incorporated in 1889 and floated by Harvey du Cros who was, amongst other things, president of the Irish Cyclists' Association. The invitation to du Cros to participate was made by William Bowden, a Dublin cycle agent. J B Dunlop who could see no prosperous future in his discovery, had informally made over his rights to Bowden. Initially J B Dunlop held a 20 {{percent stake in the}} venture. The company and manufactory was first founded in Stephens Street in Dublin.|$|E

25|$|In August 1912 Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> {{went out}} of {{business}} though retaining certain financial commitments. It passed its activities to Dunlop Rubber in exchange for shares. Then it changed its name to The Parent Tyre Company Limited. Dunlop Rubber purchased certain of its assets including goodwill and trading rights and in exchange the tyre company shareholders now owned three-quarters of Dunlop Rubber. The amalgamation was intended to bring about a substantial reduction in overhead and clarify what had been seen as a confusing relationship between the two enterprises when they shared most shareholders.|$|E

This factory remained the only tyre manufacturer in the South Island.On 23 October 2009, it was announced that Bridgestone's Australia and New Zealand manufacturing operations were to close.

25|$|It {{was during}} this period that {{advances}} {{were made in the}} development of buses that improved their reliability and introduced innovations such as the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre.</b> The Board, which by this time had come to the realisation {{that it would not be}} able to afford to significantly extend the tramway network, purchased some additional buses to provide services in areas not served by the trams. These developments also led to the rise of the private bus operators, which were able to provide services in areas not covered by the Board, and later to directly challenge the Board itself. After introducing a number of measures to directly combat the private operators, legislative means were employed to deal with them.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} 200 years, {{judicial}} decisions differed {{as to whether}} or not a third party could enforce a contract that benefited them. The issue was settled in 1861 by [...] Tweddle v Atkinson [...] 121 ER 762, that confirmed that a third party could not enforce a contract that benefited him. This decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> v Selfridge and Co Ltd [...] AC 847 in 1915, where Lord Haldane stated that only a person who was party to a contract could sue on it. This version of the doctrine is commonly known as the original or basic doctrine.|$|E
500|$|Privity is a {{doctrine}} in English contract law {{that covers the}} relationship between parties to a contract and other parties or agents. At its most basic level, the rule is that a contract can neither give rights to, nor impose obligations on, anyone {{who is not a}} party to the original agreement, i.e. a [...] "third party". Historically, third parties could enforce the terms of a contract, as evidenced in Provender v Wood, but the law changed in a series of cases in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the most well known of which are Tweddle v Atkinson in 1861 and Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> v Selfridge and Co Ltd in 1915.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of saying the same thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract can sue on it".|$|E

500|$|Following {{discussions between}} the Office of Fair Trading, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Financial Services Authority {{and the major}} banks, {{proceedings}} were issued on 27 July 2007 in a test case against the banks to determine the legality and enforceability of certain charges relating to unauthorised overdrafts. It is argued that these are contrary to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999; Schedule 2(e) of which gives a non-exhaustive list of terms which may be regarded as unfair, such as a term requiring a consumer who fails in his obligation to pay a disproportionately high sum in compensation. Penalty charges are irrecoverable at common law. The precedent for this was Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Co. Ltd. v New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd. [...] AC 79 along with Murray v Leisure Play [...] EWCA Civ 963, where it was held that a contractual party can only recover damages for an actual loss or liquidated losses. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group maintained that its charges were fair and enforceable and stated it intended to defend its position vigorously. On 24 April 2008, the High Court found that although these charges could not constitute penalties, they are challengeable under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. On 26 February 2009, the Court of Appeal ruled that fees for unauthorised overdrafts and bounced cheques are subject to regulation by the OFT under these rules.|$|E

The spoon brake consists of a pad (often leather) or metal shoe (possibly rubber faced), which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre. [...] These were almost always rod-operated by a right-hand lever. [...] In developing countries, a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters.
