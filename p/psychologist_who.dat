5|$|Salant later {{pulled the}} episode from the {{schedule}} and assigned producer Harry Morgan to re-edit it. According to Wallace, Salant found the piece sensationalistic; however, C. A. Tripp, a <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> had put CBS {{in touch with}} his patient Larson, claimed that Salant felt the piece was pro-homosexuality. Morgan scrapped all but about 10 minutes of Peters' final cut. CBS felt that the self-accepting gay men made too favorable of an impression, so Morgan edited two of the interviews to make the men seem unhappier. According to Wallace, no sponsor would buy time during the episode because of the taboo nature of the subject matter. Commercial spots were filled by public service announcements for the Peace Corps and the Internal Revenue Service.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} season, Nikita gains some allies {{to aid in}} her fight against Division, {{including}} Owen Elliot (Devon Sawa), a guardian to one of Division's several black boxes; hard drives contain files of Division's missions, until Percy tried to have him killed, CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean) who was investigating black operations invisible to the United States government, and eventually her trainer Michael, after he learns Percy {{was responsible for the}} deaths of his wife and daughter. The two would be in a relationship for the rest of the series' run. By the first-season finale, Alex learns that Nikita killed her father and leaves her to become a free agent for Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> overthrew Percy to lead Division with the help of Oversight, a group of American politicians who ensure that Division's existence remains secret from the public (Alex would later return to fight alongside with Nikita again midway through season two). Michael is discovered to be working with Nikita and the two end up on the run together with a black box.|$|E

5|$|George Malcolm Stratton (September 26, 1865– October 8, 1957) was a <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> {{pioneered the}} study of {{perception}} in vision by wearing special glasses which inverted images {{up and down and}} left and right. He studied under {{one of the founders of}} modern psychology, Wilhelm Wundt, and started one of the first experimental psychology labs in America, at the University of California, Berkeley. Stratton's studies on binocular vision inspired many later studies on the subject. He was one of the initial members of the philosophy department at Berkeley, and the first chair of its psychology department. He also worked on sociology, focusing on international relations and peace. Stratton presided over the American Psychological Association in 1908, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He wrote a book on experimental psychology and its methods and scope; published articles on the studies at his labs on perception, and on reviews of studies in the field; served on several psychological committees during and after World War I; and served as advisor to doctoral students who would go on to head psychology departments.|$|E
5|$|Ashley Smith (born 29 January 1988, New Brunswick, Canada) {{was adopted}} {{when she was}} 5 days old, and {{according}} to her adoptive parents, Coralee Smith and Herbert Gober, had a normal childhood in Moncton, New Brunswick. Between the ages of 13-14, her parents noted distinct behavioural changes in the child; by age 15 she had been before juvenile court 14 times for various minor offences such as throwing crabapples at a mailman, trespassing, and causing a disturbance. In March 2002, Smith was assessed by a <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> {{found no evidence of}} mental illness. However, her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002. In March 2003, after multiple court appearances, Smith was admitted to the Pierre Caissie Centre for assessment. She was diagnosed with ADHD, learning disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly and disruptive behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre (NBYC). Smith was remanded to the NBYC multiple times over the next 3 years; during this time she was involved in more than 800 reported incidents and at least 150 attempts to physically harm herself.|$|E

40|$|Secondary {{traumatic}} stress {{is a kind}} of job stress that affects professionals dedicated to help victims of traumatic events. This disorder is common in those professionals who work with victims of violence, and especially in those who work with children and adolescents, although there are few studies about it. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the secondary {{traumatic stress}} levels between <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> work in centers for victims of child maltreatment and sexual abuse and <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> work in other contexts. Method: The sample consisted of 259 professionals (M= 33. 3 years, SD= 8. 0 years), 190 women and 69 men. 56. 4 % worked in specialized centers for victims of child maltreatment and sexual abuse, while the other 43. 6 % worked with other kinds of patients. All respondents answered the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (Bride, Robinson, Yegidis y Figley, 2004). Results: <b>Psychologists</b> <b>who</b> treat victims of child maltreatment and sexual abuse had significantly higher levels of all secondary traumatic stress symptoms. In addition, psychologists working with child trauma exceed the cutoff point more frequently than psychologists working in other contexts. Conclusion: Given the serious implications that these results may have for therapists and their patients, it is necessary to create strategies for care and self-care for <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> work with child victims. More research is required in this area to clarify the course of the disorder, and the most appropriate strategies to cope with it...|$|R
