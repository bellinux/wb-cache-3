40|$|Attention {{has focused}} on forest {{management}} practices and the interactions between birds and their habitat, {{as a result of}} apparent declines in populations of many forest birds. Although avian diversity and abundance have been studied in various forest habitats, avian foraging behavior is less well known. Although there are published descriptions of avian foraging behaviors in the western United States descriptions from the southeastern United States are less common. This article reports on the foraging behavior of the White-eyed Vireo, Northern <b>Parula,</b> and Hooded <b>Warbler</b> in mature bottomland hardwood forests in South Carolina...|$|R
50|$|United States Fish and Wildlife Service {{conducted}} a breeding land bird survey in 2003. A total of 75 {{species of birds}} were sighted on the property during the 2003 survey. An initial scouting survey conducted in May 2003 revealed that a great diversity of migratory songbirds use Mt. Tom for stopover habitat. Species sighted during that time include Blackburnian warbler, black-throated blue warbler, blue-winged <b>warbler,</b> northern <b>parula,</b> and yellow-rumped <b>warbler.</b> None of these species were counted during the landbird breeding survey. Early migratory stopover studies will be conducted by USFWS in subsequent years to further assess the use of Mt. Tom by neo-tropical migrants for stopover habitat.|$|R

The northern <b>parula</b> <b>warbler</b> (Parula americana) {{and the eastern}} bluebird (Sialia sialis) are also found here. The Bachman sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) and red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), both uncommon, also live in this ecoregion.|$|E

Silence, and a sharp eye, might be rewarded with a glimpse of an osprey, a broad-winged hawk, blue heron, Canada goose, spotted sandpiper, pine warbler, colorful <b>parula</b> <b>warbler,</b> or a red-eyed vireo. The Greenway is also home to several types of duck. The dense, and often wet, underbrush and the banks of the river provide a safe haven for deer, wild turkey, flying squirrels, groundhogs, mink, muskrats, foxes, and maybe the occasional skunk. There have also been reports of bobcats roaming the area.Some of the Greenway's most beautiful treasures are its wildflowers. Rhododendron, mountain laurel, trillium, wild azalea, jack-in-the-pulpit, dwarf flowered heartleaf, and many more paint the landscape.|$|E

40|$|On August 9, 1944, near Columbus, Ohio, Breiding {{collected}} an immature male {{black and}} white warbler (Mniotilta varia). Upon preparing it as a study skin, the bird {{was found to be}} heavily infected with Sarcocystis. This experience was repeated with an adult male Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), taken near Cheat Bridge, Randolph County, West Virginia, June 14, 1945. Both birds appeared to be in healthy condition. Two species of wood warbler, the olive-backed <b>warbler</b> (<b>Parula</b> pitiayumi) and the American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) have previously been recorded as hosts for this organism (Erickson, Auk, 57 : 114 - 119, 1940). As far as {{we have been able to}} determine, Sarcocystis has not previously been recorded from the species mentioned above. Spindler and Zimmerman (Journal of Parasitology suppl. to Vol. 31 : 13, December 1945) reported the species infecting swine to be a fungus (Aspergillus sp.), rather than a protozoan. It is possible that the avian species will be found to have a similar life cycle...|$|R
40|$|A habitat {{specific}} bird {{monitoring program}} was established on the Chequamegon, Chippewa, and Superior National Forests in 1991 and 1992 (Chequamegon National Forest). The program {{was designed to}} assess annual differences in bird relative abundances and to eventually distinguish between larger-scale trends and small-scale shifts in abundance. Data collected from 1991 to 1995 or 1992 to 1995 have provided information on annual variation and trends over time for individual species and community parameters and relative abundance within representative cover types on the Forests. A total of 16 species (all Forests total) had significant linear trends during the monitoring period. The Great-crested Flycatcher, Blue Jay, Red and White-breasted Nuthatches, Veery, Brown Thrasher, Northern <b>Parula,</b> Chestnut-sided <b>Warbler,</b> Yellow-rumped Warbler, Canada Warbler, Swamp Sparrow, and Evening Grosbeak increased in abundance over all years; while the Hairy Woodpecker, Winter Wren, Red-eyed Vireo, and Indigo Bunting decreased in abundance over all years. The Red-eyed Vireo also had a decreasing trend in the Ottawa National Forest and decreased consistently in the Apostle Island National Lakeshore. No single explanation can be offered for a particular trend in annual variation; however; {{it is important to}} note that the monitoring activity has reached a state of longevity where trends can be detected. Trends or lack thereof of trends will be useful in resolving potential problems within a National Forest or to support conclusions that a problem does not exist. Results from the monitoring can be used to aid forest managers by providing information on bird/habitat associations within forest cover types. Based on power analysis, a sufficient sampling regime is in place to detect reasonable changes in abundance for many forest birds, including many neotropical migrants...|$|R
40|$|I {{estimate}} that 215 bird species currently breed or have previously bred in Nebraska. This number compares {{with a total}} of 330 spe¬cies that breed or have bred in the Great Plains region south of Canada, as I defined that region in my book on the breeding birds of the Great Plains (Johnsgard, 1979). An analysis of the relative species diversity of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s breeding avifauna establishes several areas of unusual species richness and endemicity, these most important being the Missouri Valley and associated middle to lower Niobrara Valley, the Pine Ridge area of the northwestern Panhandle, and the entire Platte Valley.

40|$|This {{fall season}} was amazing, or as Stephen Dinsmore put it: 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 The birding was simply {{spectacular}} in western Nebraska this fall, 2 ̆ 2 There was something for everyone, whether rarity-chasers, taxonomists, listers, or whatever. There were {{no fewer than}} four new species for the state list (pending NOURC approval, of course!), a total of 315 species reported, and fascinating information on western subspecies in the Panhandle. Numbers of western migrants reached record levels, exemplified by fall totals of 53 Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, 25 MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, and 28 Western Tanagers. By contrast, eastern migrant warblers in the east were almost non-existent. At L McConaughy, the exposed flats at {{the west end of}} the reservoir attracted myriads of shorebirds and waterbirds, including record fall counts of Western Grebe (44, 000 !), Green-winged Teal, and a near-record count of Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sandpipers. Several species also had new fall high counts, notably Cliff Swallow (30, 000 !) and Blue-winged Teal (14, 500 !). Stephen Dinsmore 2 ̆ 7 s diligent coverage of the Panhandle yielded no fewer than four first state records: Reddish Egret, Arctic Tern, Dusky Flycatcher (using mist-nettting, photography, and measurements!), and Black Rosy-Finch. The state total now stands at a healthy 445 species. There was also a host of significant distributional or seasonal reports, notably a first western White-eyed Vireo, first Panhandle documented Eastern Wood-Pewee, a first August-September Pacific Loon, a first August Red-breasted Merganser, a first fall record for Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, and a second fall Hudsonian Godwit for the state. Not to mention all three jaegers! Sparrows were in mediocre numbers, with not much of interest in that group. Of concern are the few reports of Black-billed Cuckoo in recent years; only two were reported this fall. Despite the total of 315 species reported, no fewer than 17 species of regular, though generally rare, occurrence were not found. Most surprising among these were American Black Duck, American Woodcock, Broad-tailed Hummingbird, Veery, Wood Thrush, Northern <b>Parula,</b> Magnolia <b>Warbler,</b> Yellow-throated Warbler, Prothonotary Warbler, and Summer Tanager. Many of the missed species either depart early in fall or become inconspicuous. Were their breeding seasons unsuccessful...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the Mississippi Coastal Plain of {{the southeastern}} United States, we {{explored}} relationships among bird spe-cies and vegetation types and landscape characteristics at four different scales. We modeled abundance of priority avian species from Breeding Bird Surveys using land class metrics at 0. 24, 1, 3, and 5 -km extents. Our modeling method was logistic regression and model selection was based on Akaike’s Information Criteria and validation with reserved data. Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), northern parula (<b>Parula</b> americana), Swainson’s <b>warbler</b> (Limnothlypis swainsonii), prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), hooded warbler (Wil-sonia citrina), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) had models containing positive area or core area variables. White-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) and gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) had models {{with a combination of}} area and edge associations at different scales. Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) had positive edge density mod-els. Modeling at different scales produced more complete habitat associations for most species and landscape variables were more influential at larger extents than the smallest extent. Although Mississippi is heavily forested, the landscape is unexpectedly fragmented, with small areal extents of vegetation types. Managers should seek to provide large extents of a variety of habitats, including historically representative vegetation types such as low density pine, to support persistence of a complete suite of avian species.
