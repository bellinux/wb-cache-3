The authors concluded that this law is fully harmonized with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, therefore, the parties involved in the litigation proceedings may invoke as means of defense both the <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality,</b> regarding the individual administrative acts, and the plea of unenforceability, concerning the regulatory administrative acts. </p...|$|E

All questions concerning the action for annulment have their significance in the theory and practice of the field, but a consistent case-law is offered by the grounds for annulment, the <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> and correlatively by the effects of the decision ruled within the action in for annulment, and these are some issues to which we shall refer further...|$|E
40|$|Locus standi of non-privileged {{applicants}} {{to bring an}} action for annulment Abstract Every developed legal system is bound to have a mechanism for checking the procedural and substantive legality of measures adopted by its institutions. In the European Union it was of significant importance to create a system of control over the acts of the EU institutions given the democratic deficit within the Union and the limited supervisory role of the European Parliament. Binding acts of the EU institutions are subject to review through a number of routes provided by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), namely action for annulment (Art. 263 TFEU), the <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> (Art. 277 TFEU), the preliminary reference (Art. 267 TFEU) and the action for damages (Arts. 268 and 340 TFEU). The Court has consistently endeavoured to treat the several strands as a complex and coherent system of judicial review within the Union based on the rule of law. The action for annulment under Art. 263 TFEU plays a crucial role for individuals as it is in practice the only direct way open to individuals to challenge the acts of EU institutions. The main purpose of my thesis is to examine whether the current wording of Art. 263 (4) TFEU provides for individuals a sufficiently [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to assess}} {{one of the}} many {{contributions}} of 'Economics and the Interpretation and Application of U. S. and E. U. Antitrust Law' by Richard Markovits to our understanding of U. S. and EU antitrust laws. That specific contribution is the tests <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> adopted in Markovits’s study to interpret Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This article also examines the claim that none of these tests is an economic-inefficiency test <b>of</b> <b>illegality.</b> In order to achieve its aim, the article first comments on the “specific-anticompetitive-intent test” that is proposed to be the test <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> under the object branch of the prohibition of Article 101 TFEU and under the abuse prohibition of Article 102 TFEU, before moving on to separate discussions of the tests <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> in the specific contexts of Article 101 TFEU and subsequently of Article 102 TFEU. The article finds that there is still considerable ambiguity concerning some of the most fundamental concepts of antitrust law such as “competition on the merits” at least in the EU but perhaps also in the U. S. The article reaches the conclusion that there is significant scope for discussion and disagreement on what makes a conduct anticompetitive, irrespective of whether such conduct is of the type prohibited under Article 101 TFEU or of the type prohibited under Article 102 TFEU...|$|R
