2500|$|In September 2006, {{emergency}} contraception expert Anna Glasier wrote a BMJ editorial entitled [...] "Emergency Contraception. Is it worth all the fuss?" [...] that said in closing: [...] "So is {{emergency contraception}} worth the fuss? If {{you are a}} woman who has had unprotected sex then of course it is, because emergency contraception will prevent pregnancy in some women some of the time—and if you don’t want to get pregnant anything is better than nothing. If you are the CMAJ’s editor or FDA commissioner then yes, because scientific freedom is worth the fight. If you are looking for an intervention that will reduce abortion rates, emergency contraception may not be the solution, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> concentrate most on encouraging people to use contraception before or during sex, not after it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Elijah {{of legend}} {{did not lose}} any {{of his ability to}} afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai is illustrative. Once, when walking a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man—the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, [...] "Peace be with thee, Rabbi." [...] Instead of {{returning}} the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, [...] "How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?" [...] Elijah responded with, [...] "I don’t know. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction." [...] The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{since you}} ask me," [...] Ralph answered, hesitating a little, [...] "it seems odd, not, <b>perhaps,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> marry the rector, but that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> marry anybody. <b>You</b> appear to me {{too young to}} marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] he said. [...] "It {{would be}} as well, <b>perhaps,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> say {{as much in the}} hearing of one of the drawers; so that, if questioned, I shall have a witness who can bear me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've done {{good service}} for the Master, John; <b>perhaps</b> He thinks <b>you</b> <b>should</b> rest now," [...] {{answered}} his wife. [...] "You've got plenty able helpers to take the heavy work off your hands." ...|$|R

I will never allude to the place again,--unless, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> come and stay with me too long when I am particularly anxious {{to get rid of}} you. Now you had better go and settle about the time and all that with Lady Tringle, and tell her that you mean to come and dine to-morrow or next day, or whenever it suits. Come and dine as often as you please, only do not bring your wife to live with me pertinaciously when you're not asked." [...] All this Captain Batsby did not understand, but, as he left Lombard Street, he made up his mind that of all the men he had ever met, Sir Thomas Tringle, his future father-in-law, was the most singular. [...] "He's a better fellow than Traffick," [...] said Sir Thomas to himself when he was alone, [...] "and as he has trusted me so far I'll not throw him over." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was {{extremely}} {{interested in your}} Fiji legend, and perhaps even more so in your capital account of the CURACOA'S misadventure. [...] Alas! we have nothing so thrilling to relate. All hangs and fools on in this isle of misgovernment, without change, though not without novelty, but wholly without hope, unless <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> consider it hopeful that I am still more immediately threatened with arrest. The confounded thing is, that if it comes off, I shall be sent away in the Ringarooma instead of the CURACOA. The former ship burst upon by the run - she had been sent off by despatch and without orders - and to make me a little more easy in my mind she brought newspapers clamouring for my incarceration. [...] Since then I have {{had a conversation with}} the German Consul. He said he had read a review of my Samoa book, and if the review were fair, must regard it as an insult, and one {{that would have to be}} resented. At the same time, I learn that letters addressed to the German squadron lie for them here in the Post Office. Reports are current of other English ships being on the way - I hope to goodness yours will be among the number. And I gather from one thing and another that there must be a holy row going on between the powers at home, and that the issue (like all else connected with Samoa) is on the knees of the gods. One thing, however, is pretty sure - if that issue prove to be a German Protectorate, I shall have to tramp. Can you give us any advice as to a fresh field of energy? We have been searching the atlas, and it seems difficult to fill the bill. How would Rarotonga do? I forget if you have been there. The best of it is that my new house is going up like winking, and I am dictating this letter to the accompaniment of saws and hammers. A hundred black boys and about a score draught-oxen perished, or at least barely escaped with their lives, from the mud-holes on our road, bringing up the materials. It will be a fine legacy to H.I.G.M.'s Protectorate, and doubtless the Governor will take it for his country-house. The Ringarooma people, by the way, seem very nice. I liked Stansfield particularly.|$|E

Gorski immediately recognized Ezi, because in the interbellum period, Wilimowski was one of his idols. Whenever Ruch Chorzow came to play in Lwów (now Lviv), Gorski always attended the games, watching Wilimowski. However, being observed by an agent of the Polish secret police SB, the Polish coach greeted his idol very coldly: Mr Wilimowski, if you had not done anything wrong, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have come back to Poland, and explain your behavior, cleanse yourself of all charges - said Górski.
