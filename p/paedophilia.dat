25|$|He was heckled by the {{audience}} on live television during a broadcast of The Late Late Show {{on the topic}} of <b>paedophilia</b> in the 1990s. Upon his retirement in 1996 he made no further public statement until his death. A photograph of him at the ceremony initiating Seán Brady as a Cardinal in 2007 was entered by the Irish Independent for a national award (judged by an international panel).|$|E
25|$|Certain US evangelists who {{are active}} in Africa {{have been accused of}} being {{responsible}} for inspiring the bill by inciting hatred by comparing homosexuality to <b>paedophilia</b> and influencing public policy with donations from US religious organisations. Among the critics were The Times, Jeffrey Gettleman in The New York Times, Time, The Guardian, a pan-African internet news journal for social justice named Pambazuka News, and an international organisation with a similar objective named Inter Press Service.|$|E
25|$|A November 2009 {{television}} {{survey showed}} that 70% favoured reinstating {{the death penalty for}} {{at least one of the}} following crimes: armed robbery, rape, crimes related to <b>paedophilia,</b> terrorism, adult murder, child murder, child rape, treason, child abuse or kidnapping. However, respondents only favoured capital punishment for adult murder, the polling question asked by other organisations such as Gallup, by small majorities or pluralities: overall, 51% favoured the death penalty for adult murder, while 56% in Wales did, 55% in Scotland, and only 49% in England.|$|E
25|$|Since {{at least}} 2001, Cohn-Bendit {{has been accused}} of {{defending}} <b>paedophilia</b> during the 1970s. This controversy re-surfaced in 2013: as Cohn-Bendit received the Theodor Heuss Prize, there was a rally by anti-paedophilia activists. The president of Germany's Federal Constitutional Court cited the book as grounds for his refusal to give the speech at the awards ceremony. The affair triggered wider research into the pro-pedophilia activism which prevailed in the German Green Party (without direct involvement on the part of Cohn-Bendit) well into the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Pedophilia or <b>paedophilia</b> is a {{psychiatric}} disorder {{in which an}} adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children. Although girls typically {{begin the process of}} puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12, criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13. A person who is diagnosed with pedophilia must be at least 16 years old, and at least five years older than the prepubescent child, for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilia.|$|E
25|$|The photographer, Hugo McGuiness, and {{the sleeve}} designer, Steve Averill (a friend of bassist Adam Clayton), {{went on to}} work on several more U2 album covers. The image was changed to a {{distorted}} picture of the band for the American and Canadian release, due to the record company's fears that the band would be accused of encouraging <b>paedophilia.</b> Sandy Porter is credited as the photographer for the American cover. However, the photo of Rowen appeared on the inner sleeve of the album in the US and Canada. In 2008, the artwork of the remastered editions was standardised worldwide {{to that of the}} 1980 UK release.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2003, a stage {{adaptation}} of Nabokov's unused screenplay {{was performed in}} Dublin adapted by Michael West. It was described by Karina Buckley (in the Sunday Times of London) as playing more like Italian commedia dell'arte than a dark drama about <b>paedophilia.</b> Hiroko Mikami notes that the initial sexual encounter between Lolita and Humbert was staged {{in a way that}} left this adaptation particularly open to the charge of placing the blame for initiating the relationship on Lolita and normalizing child sexual abuse; however, Mikami challenged this reading of the production, noting that the ultimate devastation of events on Lolita's life is duly noted in the play.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigating}} teams seized erotic literature {{along with}} a laptop computer connected to a webcam, which immediately raised the apprehensions {{of the presence of}} an international child pornography racket. The police also recovered some photographs of Pandher with nude children and foreigners during his four international visits, which was later discovered to be untrue. It was alleged that Pandher supplied such pictures abroad and could link him to <b>paedophilia.</b> Later during the investigation it was found the nude children in the pictures were Pandher's grandchildren. There was no link found to child pornography. The laptop and the webcam were later returned to the family, and the story was classified as a media created rumour.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the sheer}} savagery {{of the murders}} and the {{precision}} of the eviscerations upon the victims' bodies, police theorized that the killings had been conducted by either a group harvesting organs to sell for transplant, {{the work of a}} Satanic cult, or a mentally ill individual. Much of the police effort concentrated upon the theory that the killer must be either mentally ill, homosexual, or a paedophile, and the alibis of all individuals who had either spent time in psychiatric wards or had been convicted of homosexuality or <b>paedophilia</b> were checked and logged in a card filing system. Registered sex offenders were also investigated and, if their alibi was corroborated, eliminated from the inquiry.|$|E
25|$|The film's {{production}} process was particularly difficult for Russell, who {{was taking a}} variety of risks with what was a $42 million studio film. At {{the time it was}} made, Warner Bros. had not financed an auteur film in many years and executives were hesitant to put such money in the hands of filmmakers who were used to working independently. The film's political overtones also worried the studio, especially with conflict still apparent in the Middle East. As a result, Warner Bros. gave Russell a number of limitations. The shooting schedule was reduced to only 68 days instead of the 80 Russell had initially asked for. The studio wanted the budget to be lowered to $35 million. Executives were also asking for the removal of more violent scenes, such as the exploding cow and the shooting of an Iraqi woman. Russell was also forced to sign a legal document requiring that scenes containing <b>paedophilia</b> accusations against Michael Jackson be removed from the film.|$|E
25|$|In the 2002 election, Labor won 23 seats, the Liberals 20, Nationals 1, and {{conservative}} Independents won three. As 24 seats {{are required to}} govern, the Liberal Party was expected to retain government {{with the support of}} all four independents. However, in a surprise decision, one of the conservative independents, Peter Lewis, decided to support Labor in exchange for holding a constitutional convention, making him speaker of the House of Assembly, and concessions for his electorate including the phasing out of commercial fishing in the River Murray, prioritising the eradication of the branched broomrape weed, changing water rates for irrigation, fast-tracking a feasibility study for a weir and lock at Wellington, and improving rural roads. Lewis resigned as speaker in April 2005 after controversy over allegations of <b>paedophilia</b> he had made about a serving MP. However, by this time, Labor had already gained the support of independents Bob Such and Rory McEwen in 2002, as well as Nationals SA member Karlene Maywald in 2004. Such was given the position of speaker {{for the remainder of the}} government's term.|$|E
500|$|In August 1986, Jones {{presented}} the film at the Sydney Opera House in Australia {{as part of}} the sixth International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect, the largest conference in the world on child abuse. The 56-year-old Harris, who was chosen to be master of ceremonies for the three-day conference's opening event because of his celebrity and involvement with the film, told the audience that <b>paedophilia</b> was finally [...] "coming out from under its veil of secrecy".|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, The Sunday Mirror {{revealed}} {{that in a}} UKIP members' online forum Gasper had condemned LGBT rights as a [...] "lunatic's charter", while claiming that some homosexuals prefer sex with animals over that with other humans, and reiterating her belief in a link between homosexuality and <b>paedophilia.</b> The newspaper characterised the comments as [...] "extremist and offensive" [...] and noted that the forum contained many homophobic and racist statements from UKIP members. When The Sunday Mirror asked for comment, Gasper stated that [...] "I'm {{not going to talk}} about them. It's none of your business." [...] Political commentator Nick Cohen, commenting in The Observer, described Gasper as an advocate of [...] "dumb prejudice".|$|E
500|$|According to Richard Guilliatt and Jacquelin Magnay in {{an article}} in The Australian, Harris' {{campaign}} against <b>paedophilia</b> in Kids Can Say No! can [...] "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt". NSPCC chief executive officer Peter Wanless appeared on Good Morning Britain saying that Harris' appearance in the film was hypocritical. In an Irish Daily Mail article, Paul Bracchi writes that Harris' work on Kids Can Say No! {{at the same time that}} he was abusing girls was [...] "one of the most sickening examples [...] hiding in plain sight". In 2014, theme composer Peter Alsop said that Harris may have used the film to groom children because it encouraged trust by parents.|$|E
500|$|Martin {{is widely}} {{credited}} with broadening the fantasy fiction genre for adult content, including incest, <b>paedophilia,</b> and adultery. For The Washington Post Writing for The Atlantic, Amber Taylor assessed the novels as hard fantasy with vulnerable characters to which readers become emotionally attached. CNN found in 2000 that Martin's mature descriptions were [...] "far more frank than {{those found in}} the works of other fantasy authors", although Martin assessed the fantasy genre to have become rougher-edged a decade later and that some writers' work was going beyond the mature themes of his novels. Adam Roberts called Martin's series the most successful and popular example of the emerging subgenre of grimdark fantasy, influencing other writers associated with that style, such as Joe Abercrombie.|$|E
500|$|Gasper later lambasted UKIP {{as being}} [...] "plagued with transsexuals", a {{reference}} to the transwomen Nikki Sinclaire and Kellie Maloney, both of whom have served as candidates for the party. Asserting that she refused to recognise transwomen as women, she declared Maloney to be [...] "absolutely grotesque" [...] and added that her transition was [...] "totally barmy – and how pathetic that he [...] can do nothing better with his life." [...] In May, a former UKIP activist, Colin Cortbus, also publicly revealed to Cherwell that in emails Gasper had sent to him she had again emphasised a connection between homosexuality and <b>paedophilia,</b> and had described the Quran as a [...] "fascist" [...] book, comparing it to Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf and describing Islam as [...] "a severely oppressive ideology".|$|E
500|$|Kids Can Say No! resurfaced in 2014, when Harris was {{prosecuted for}} twelve counts of indecently assaulting young girls. The {{prosecutors}} found Kids Can Say No! on YouTube {{and wanted to}} show it at trial to illustrate its unintentional irony, but the film was not admitted as evidence. Harris {{was found guilty of}} all counts. During the trial, it was learned that, while Harris was filming Kids Can Say No!, he {{was in the midst of}} a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend and, by its release, he had committed nine of the twelve assaults. According to Richard Guilliatt and Jacquelin Magnay in an article in The Australian, Harris' campaign against <b>paedophilia</b> in Kids Can Say No! can [...] "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".|$|E
500|$|The Times {{obtained}} opinions {{from four}} sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! {{or any other}} film to teach children about the subject. Northampton social worker Helen Kenward {{said that she would}} not show the film to children. Psychiatrist Brendan McCarthy called it simplistic. According to teacher Clare Rankin, children under five would not understand the film. Physician Paula Drummond was concerned that it might inspire children to falsely accuse adults they disliked, although McCarthy said that children were unlikely to make false abuse accusations. McCarthy was especially critical of the film, calling it [...] "no clearer to a child than the Gorbachev-Reagan talks". Moorehead summarised the experts' comments as suggesting that Kids Can Say No! is [...] "muddling, evasive and pussy-footed, best not for children at all, but as... aids for parents and professional workers to alert them to <b>paedophilia</b> and incest".|$|E
500|$|During her campaign, a {{resident}} in the Oxford area discovered a blog post which Gasper had authored in 2010; concerned about its contents, they contacted the LGBT-themed news service Pink News, which then reported on it. Stating that homosexuality {{was not a}} sexual orientation but a [...] "form of behaviour", in her post Gasper suggested that same-sex attraction was a choice, before criticising gay people for [...] "complaining constantly of persecution" [...] and being insufficiently grateful to heterosexuals for creating them. Asserting that legal support for LGBT rights had [...] "gone too far", she condemned same-sex marriage and the adoption of children by same-sex couples as [...] "wholly unacceptable", and claimed that there were strong links between male homosexuality and <b>paedophilia.</b> Her claims generated outrage, with a UKIP spokesperson commenting that while the party did not endorse Gasper's views on this issue, it did uphold her right to hold and express them.|$|E
500|$|The bridge section has {{the girls}} laying in water while snow starts to fall. At the last {{portion of the}} chorus, t.A.T.u. are portrayed {{pointing}} in different directions, until they both walk around corner and see a vast field, where the sun is breaking out of the clouds; they clasp hands and walk off into the distance. The {{people on the other}} side of the fence are left in an eerie green light with rain falling steadily; it is also revealed that they are the ones isolated behind the fence. The video's final scene shows the girls walking further in the distance. Several frames from [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] did not appear in the visual for [...] "All the Things She Said" [...] due to lip-syncing issues. Like [...] "All the Things She Said", the video generated controversy for having the duo kissing, with critics particularly believing that it prompted <b>paedophilia</b> and lesbianism. An editor from The Age commented that the impact of the video for [...] "Ya Soshla s Uma" [...] was generally lukewarm.|$|E
500|$|Later {{that month}} Gasper complained that readers of Pink News had {{threatened}} her, declaring {{that they should}} be forcibly institutionalised under the Mental Health Act. In doing so, she compared her situation to that of Salman Rushdie during The Satanic Verses controversy. She then claimed that she had received email death threats and was under police protection, assertions that local police refused to either confirm or deny. Commenting to Cherwell, she claimed her views on LGBT issues were [...] "very, very middle ground" [...] and that she had not said anything homophobic, but been the victim of [...] "a malicious witch hunt". Roweena Russell, former chair of the International Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Youth and Student Organisation, emailed Gasper to discuss the latter's comments, to which Gasper responded that Russell too should be institutionalised. Russell proceeded to condemn Gasper, stating that [...] "as a long-term political activist I'm disgusted she used this kind of language. Using mental health as a slur {{on top of everything else}} she's doing is just unacceptable." [...] Rafe Jeune, chair of Oxford's Pride parade, characterised Gasper's comments as [...] "abhorrent" [...] and [...] "disgusting", noting that there was no evidence to link <b>paedophilia</b> and homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{a special}} episode of Brass Eye {{on the moral}} panic that {{surrounds}} <b>paedophilia</b> led to a record-breaking number of complaints – it still remains the third highest on UK television after Celebrity Big Brother 2007 and [...] – as well as heated discussion in the press. Many complainants, some of whom later admitted to not having seen the programme (notably Beverley Hughes, a government minister), felt the satire was directed at the victims of <b>paedophilia,</b> which Morris denies. Channel 4 defended the show, insisting the target was the media and its hysterical treatment of <b>paedophilia,</b> and not victims of crime.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{media outlets}} claimed her Dolly shoot (including {{images of a}} 14-year-old Kerr in bathing suits) {{constituted}} a form of <b>paedophilia.</b> Of the press, Kerr said: [...] "In the media {{at the time they}} were trying to cling on to anything remotely to do with <b>paedophilia.</b> Dolly is a magazine for teenage girls, not for old men. And I was fully clothed! Doing a winter shoot! They just made something out of nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Morrissey {{stated that}} he {{believed}} there is [...] "no difference between eating animals and <b>paedophilia.</b> They are both rape, violence, murder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Krafft-Ebing {{mentioned}} <b>paedophilia</b> erotica in a {{typology of}} [...] "psycho-sexual perversion". He {{wrote that he}} had only encountered it four times in his career and gave brief descriptions of each case, listing three common traits: ...|$|E
2500|$|Lovesong, {{her third}} last novel, is, Riemer suggests, [...] "the riskiest book she wrote". It {{deals with the}} subject of <b>paedophilia</b> and {{demonstrates}} [...] "an admirable refusal to be deflected from what she must have seen as the demands of her art and vocation".|$|E
2500|$|The band soon {{generated}} controversy when Gary Bushell of The Sun tabloid {{alleged that}} their B-side [...] "Handsome Devil" [...] was {{an endorsement of}} <b>paedophilia.</b> The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song [...] "has {{nothing to do with}} children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting".|$|E
2500|$|After {{high-profile}} cases in provincial England, allegations of religiously motivated <b>paedophilia</b> by Muslims {{has been described}} as the [...] "most significant right-wing propaganda technique". An ITV investigation in 2013 found that of 56 mosques surveyed (pre-dominantly South Asian), 18 were willing to perform a forced marriage of a minor, whilst around 66% [...] "refused outright".|$|E
2500|$|Broadcaster and {{journalist}} Orla Barry, on the Irish radio station Newstalk in 2007, {{asked him about}} allegations aired during the Theroux documentary. When asked about the <b>paedophilia</b> rumours, Savile responded, [...] "What rumours?". In 2012, Barry expressed surprise that other journalists had not pursued the matter, saying [...] "Maybe in the UK they were slightly closer to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1984, {{the group}} {{released}} their debut album The Smiths, which reached number {{two on the}} UK Albums Chart. Both [...] "Reel Around the Fountain" [...] and [...] "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" [...] met with controversy, with some tabloid newspapers alleging the songs were suggestive of <b>paedophilia,</b> a claim strongly denied by the group.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 January 2013, {{an episode}} of QI ending with Fry reading a limerick about <b>paedophilia</b> was criticised by viewers, {{especially}} as it was broadcast directly before a Newsnight report on Jimmy Savile. The BBC Trust described the incident as [...] "unfortunate and regrettable" [...] and the limerick as [...] "capable of causing offence", but ruled {{it was not in}} breach of BBC guidelines.|$|E
2500|$|Elton John {{controversially}} {{performed with}} male strippers dressed as Cub Scouts at a gay rights {{concert at the}} Royal Albert Hall in London in 1999. He later apologised after The Scout Association in the UK objected. The UK Scout Association, which has a policy not to discriminate against homosexuals, said that the performers had done themselves and gay rights [...] "no favours" [...] by suggesting a link between homosexuality and <b>paedophilia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The band soon {{generated}} controversy when Garry Bushell of tabloid newspaper The Sun {{alleged that}} their B-side [...] "Handsome Devil" [...] was {{an endorsement of}} <b>paedophilia.</b> The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song [...] "has {{nothing to do with}} children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting". In the wake of their single, the band performed their first significant London gig, gained radio airplay with a John Peel session, and obtained their first interviews in music magazines NME and Sounds.|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's {{most notable}} initial storyline upon her return was a <b>paedophilia</b> plot {{revolving}} around Bianca's partner Tony King (Chris Coghill), and her 15 year old step daughter, Whitney. According to the Daily Mail, the storyline {{has been dubbed}} as the [...] "most controversial story-line on the show ever". The idea for the storyline was conceptualised by writer Simon Ashdown and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to EastEnders. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by {{an image of a}} woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering [...] "What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family". They pitched the idea to John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, who said that [...] "It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] However, <b>paedophilia</b> as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk. Diederick Santer commented, [...] "We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show." [...] It has been noted in the media that <b>paedophilia</b> is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although EastEnders had broached it in 2001 with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her abusive uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.|$|E
2500|$|After several release postponements, {{the film}} {{had a number}} of special {{screenings}} and eventually premiered on 28 September 2014; its premiere which was tagged [...] "'60s", required guests to dress in native costumes and hairstyles from the 1960s. The premiere also provided tours of sets, and also displayed the props and costumes used in the film. The film was met with positive critical reception, mostly praised for its production design, cinematography and its exploration of themes including tribalism, western imperialism, <b>paedophilia,</b> homosexuality, Nigeria's unification, and also establishing a strong connection between western culture and the cause of present-day Boko Haram insurgency.|$|E
2500|$|Deirdre Grusovin, {{a member}} of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, {{speaking}} under parliamentary privilege in 1994, accused Marsden of having sex with minors. In 1995 and 1996, the Seven Network's shows Today Tonight and Witness also aired allegations of having sex with minors against Marsden. In response, Marsden described himself as a [...] "promiscuous homosexual" [...] but denied allegations of <b>paedophilia.</b> Channel Seven produced witnesses who claimed to have sex with Marsden while underage, but many were discredited by errors on points of fact, such as the type of house Marsden lived in and, in one case, whether he was circumcised.|$|E
