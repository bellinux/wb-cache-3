50|$|The XB-46 was {{a graceful}} design {{and had a}} long {{streamlined}} oval torpedo-shaped fuselage, long narrow straight shoulder-mounted wings with four Chevrolet-built J35-C3 axial-flow eleven stage turbojets of 3,820 lbf kN static thrust paired in an integral nacelle under each wing. The fuselage {{turned out to be}} a problem, as it distorted under flight loads. The pilots sat in tandem in a pressurized fighter-style cockpit under a single Plexiglas teardrop canopy with the bombardier-navigator-radio operator in a transparent Plexiglas nose section. The straight wing had an aspect ratio of 11.6, and was equipped with Fowler flaps which extended over 90 percent of the span, in four sections. The flaps extended via electrical actuators, and had very small ailerons. Each wing had five spoilers made of perforated magnesium alloy. The engine air intakes were flat oval inlets, with a duct curving downward in a flat “S” to the engines, which were mounted behind the leading edge of the wing. The unusual flight control system utilized a system of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>piping</b> to transmit the pilots control inputs and actuate various systems, rather than the more typical hydraulic, manual or electrical control lines and systems of most aircraft of the era.|$|E
40|$|Evaluations of five {{types of}} steel for use in high {{pressure}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>piping</b> systems include tests for impact strength, tensile and yield strengths, elongation and reduction in area, field weldability, and cost. One type, AISI 4615, was selected as most advantageous for extensive use in future flight vehicles...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to the understanding of unsteady flow of branch pipes in pneumatic systems. Branch pipes are used in pneumatic pipe systems in various industrial fields. To predict the unsteady pressure changes in the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>piping</b> systems, it is necessary that the dynamic characteristics of branch pipes are at hand, in addition to the dynamic characteristic of single pipe. However, while so many studies are accumulated for a single pipe dynamics, few studies have reported the pressure changes in branch pipes due to oscillatory flow. This paper reports an experimental study on the dynamic characteristics of the pressure change in a pneumatic branch pipe under given oscillatory flow. The paper also proposes a simulation method to predict the pressure changes in a pneumatic branch pipe under oscillatory flow. The validity of simulation is verified for oscillatory flows up to 5 Hz, comparing with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Five test {{arrangements}} {{have been designed}} to support the Granular Bed Filter Development Program as defined in the Test Plan. The first arrangement is a 3. 6 ft. diameter half filter, with a glass covering along the cross section to allow visual examination of the granular alumina material passing through the filter. The second test arrangement is a 3. 6 ft diameter full size filter having refractory lining to simulate actual surface roughness conditions. The third test arrangement will examine filter geometry scale up by testing a 6. 0 ft. diameter full size filter. The fourth Test Arrangement consists of a small 12 inch diameter fluidizer to measure the minimum fluidization velocity of the 7 m (approx. size) alumina material {{to be used in the}} filter assemblies. The last Test Unit is used to evaluation relative abrasion characteristics of potential refractory and ceramic materials to be installed in high abrasion areas in the <b>pneumatic</b> transport <b>piping...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} for cleaning depositions of particulate matter {{from the inside}} of tubular piping while the piping is in use. The apparatus is remotely controlled in order to operate in hazardous environments. A housing containing brush and shaft assemblies is mounted on top of the tubular <b>piping.</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> cylinders provide linear motion. A roller nut bearing provides rotary motion. The combined motion causes the brush assembly to rotate as it travels along the tube dislodging particulate matter. The main application for this invention is to clean the off gas cooler of a radioactive waste vitrification unit...|$|R
