Includes bibliographical references (page 74 - 76). Twenty 1 st century, the world is obsessed with the myth of development; busy in building urban cities by extracting natural resources and constructing landfill sites. Its not million tons of waste rather million tons of resources that are being buried in these graveyards. Today 1 / 3 of our total natural resources have already been gone. How can we further continue the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> <b>things</b> without exhausting our nature? For hundred of years we designed cities to generate waste. Now it is time that we begin to design waste to regenerate our cities. Certainly, we can create a future where we can turn our biggest problems into the biggest possibilities. What are the possibilities for urban environments when our aged infrastructure has been recalibrated? How might urban intensification and waste mix? In that case, the question against waste should be “ what can we make out of it?” instead of “How can {{we get rid of}} it?”Tamanna TabassumB. Architectur...|$|E
