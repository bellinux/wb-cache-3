It would <b>probably</b> <b>still</b> have been visible until it reached a height of 110km above the southern Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, at {{a psychic}} event in California, Ruth was {{introduced}} to Ernest Norman, who told her that in a past life {{she had been the}} daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh and had protected Moses. Members of the organization they later established, the Unarius Academy of Science, affirm that Ernest and Ruth married on the day they met, and the group celebrates their anniversary as February14, 1954. However, Diana Tumminia of California State University, Sacramento, notes in her 2005 study of the group that Ruth was <b>probably</b> <b>still</b> married to George Marian in early 1954 and speculates that their divorce was a lengthy process; Tumminia posits that Ernest and Ruth married in 1956.|$|E

5|$|It {{was never}} {{attacked}} again. The windmill was rebuilt in 1700, and was <b>probably</b> <b>still</b> in use until the 1780s. In 1703, Jacques Le Ber de Senneville constructed a large stone house and fort {{in order to}} improve and protect his fur trading operations, and the local seigneural manor house was built in 1706. However, after the fall of New France in 1763, it was not used by the British as a military post. In 1776, Fort Senneville was destroyed during the American Revolutionary War by Continental Army troops under Benedict Arnold, in military manoeuvres associated with the Battle of the Cedars.|$|E
5|$|It {{was still}} garrisoned in the mid-1620s and was <b>probably</b> <b>still</b> in active {{service at the}} start of the English Civil War between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament in 1642. Captain Swaley, a Parliamentary naval commander, seized Netley at the end of that year and decommissioned it as a fortification. During the Interregnum, the castle was restored to use, due to concerns about a potential Royalist invasion, but was abandoned as obsolete after the restoration of Charles II to the throne. By the time that Alexander Pope visited in 1734, the castle was overgrown and in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Trafford has two medieval castles. Dunham Castle is {{an early}} medieval castle in Dunham Massey. It belonged to Hamon de Massey, and was <b>probably</b> <b>still</b> {{standing}} in the early 14th century. The bailey was landscaped into the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall and its moat turned into an ornamental pond. Watch Hill Castle {{is an early}} medieval motte-and-bailey castle {{on the border of}} Dunham Massey and Bowdon. It is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The motte and surrounding ditch still survives, although it had fallen out of use by the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|There are few {{surviving}} {{records of}} Blackstone's undergraduate term at Oxford, but the curriculum of Pembroke College {{had been set}} out in 1624, and Prest notes that it was <b>probably</b> <b>still</b> followed in 1738, so Blackstone would have studied Greek, science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography and poetry. Blackstone was particularly good at Greek, mathematics and poetry, with his notes on William Shakespeare being included in George Steevens' 1781 edition of Shakespeare's plays. Many of Blackstone's undergraduate texts survive, and they include few legal texts, instead being wide-ranging; politics, current affairs, poetry, geometry and controversial theological texts. The last element is understandable, given his family's theological interests, but the more surprising element is {{the sheer number of}} texts he owned given his relative poverty as a student.|$|E
5|$|Upon hearing this, the Combined Fleet commanders relented and {{accepted}} the proposed plan. The ship's crews were briefed {{on the nature of}} the mission and given the opportunity to stay behind if desired — none did. However, approximately 80 crew members who were new, sick, or infirm, were ordered off the ships, including sixty-seven naval cadets of Etajima Naval Academy Class No. 74 who had arrived on the battleship three days earlier. The ships' crews now engaged in some last-minute intense drills to prepare for the mission, mostly practicing damage-control procedures. At midnight, the ships were fueled. Reportedly, in secret defiance of orders to provide the ships with only just enough fuel to reach Okinawa, the Tokuyama personnel actually gave Yamato and the other ships almost all of the remaining fuel in the port, although this <b>probably</b> <b>still</b> was not enough to allow the force to return to Japan from Okinawa. In a ceremonial farewell, officers and enlisted men drank sake together.|$|E
5|$|Abu Firas further {{reports that}} Husayn {{was offered the}} {{governorship}} of Fars, but refused, and returned to Baghdad. Ibn al-Furat, who <b>probably</b> <b>still</b> mistrusted his intentions, promptly dispatched him to the governorship of the Diyar Rabi'a, the province encompassing the eastern Jazira, including Mosul. From this post, Husayn led a raiding campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 913/4. Soon after, however, an open rift developed between Husayn and the vizier Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah. The reason is unclear, but revolved around the finances of Husayn's province. In 914/5 he rose in open rebellion, assembling a force of 30,000 Arabs and Kurds in the Jazira, a testament to his influence there. He managed to defeat a caliphal army sent against him, but when confronted by the redoubtable Mu'nis al-Khadim, recalled from Egypt, he was defeated and captured in February 916 while trying to flee north into Armenia. He was brought to Baghdad, where he was publicly paraded across the city in ritual humiliation, riding a camel and wearing a cap of shame. He was put into prison, and executed in October/November 918 on the caliph's orders.|$|E

5|$|Limited toleration and the {{influence}} of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries, led to the expansion of Protestantism, with a group of lairds declaring themselves Lords of the Congregation in 1557 and representing their interests politically. The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small, but highly influential, group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church. A confession of faith, rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass, was adopted by Parliament in 1560, while the young Mary, Queen of Scots was still in France. Knox, having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva, where he became a follower of Calvin, emerged as the most significant figure. The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a Presbyterian system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the Medieval church. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy, and resulting in widespread, but generally orderly, iconoclasm. At this point {{the majority of the population}} was <b>probably</b> <b>still</b> Catholic in persuasion and the kirk would find it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution.|$|E
