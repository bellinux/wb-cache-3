This paper especially studies the issue of identifying synonymous translation equivalent pairs of technical terms. First, we collect candidates of synonymous translation equivalent pairs from <b>parallel</b> <b>patent</b> sentences. Then, we analyze features for identifying synonymous translation equivalent pairs. Finally, we apply the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to {{the task of}} identifying bilingual synonymous technical terms, and achieve the performance of almost 98 % precision and over 40 % F-measure...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{the construction of a}} <b>parallel</b> Chinese-English <b>patent</b> sentence corpus which is created from noisy <b>parallel</b> <b>patents.</b> First, we use a publicly available sentence aligner to find parallel sentence candidates in the noisy parallel data. Then we compare and evaluate three individual measures and different ensemble techniques to sort the parallel sentence candidates according to the confidence score and filter out those with low scores as the noisy data. The experiment shows that the combination of measures outperforms the individual measures, and that filtering out low-quality sentence pairs is readily justified as it can improve SMT performance. Finally, we arrive at the final corpus consisting of 160 K sentence pairs in which about 90 % are correct or partially correct alignments. ...|$|R

40|$|Patent {{translation}} {{is a complex}} problem due to the highly specialized technical vocabulary and the peculiar textual structure of patent documents. In this paper we analyze patents along the orthogonal dimensions of topic and textual structure. We view different patent classes and different patent text sections such as title, abstract, and claims, as separate translation tasks, and investigate the influence of such tasks on machine translation performance. We study multitask learning techniques that exploit commonalities between tasks by mixtures of translation models or by multi-task metaparameter tuning. We find small but significant gains over task-specific training by techniques that model commonalities through shared parameters. A by-product of our work is a <b>parallel</b> <b>patent</b> corpus of 23 million German-English sentence pairs. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an attempt at}} develop-ing a technique of acquiring translation pairs of technical terms with sufficiently high pre-cision from <b>parallel</b> <b>patent</b> documents. The approach taken in the proposed technique is based on integrating the phrase translation table of a state-of-the-art statistical phrase-based machine translation model, and compo-sitional translation generation based on an ex-isting bilingual lexicon for human use. Our evaluation results clearly show that the agree-ment between the two individual techniques definitely contribute to improving precision of translation candidates. We then apply the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) {{to the task of}} automatically validating translation candi-dates in the phrase translation table. Experi-mental evaluation results again show that the SVMs based approach to translation candi-dates validation can contribute to improving the precision of translation candidates in the phrase translation table. ...|$|E
40|$|Analyzing a {{new data}} set of 39, 343 high-value patents, the authors find ample {{evidence}} that interindustry knowledge spillover between technologically, economically, and geographically related industries were {{a major source of}} innovative activities during German industrialization.

The authors then show that these industries were often also geographically clustered. Nearly all German regions that maintained or improved their above-average innovativeness over time had at least one innovative cluster in the fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, or chemicals. The existence and success of these innovative clusters suggest that knowledge spillover between firms of different industries occurred frequently and increased the innovative output of the firms involved...|$|E

40|$|In today’s globalized economy, many inventors, {{investors and}} {{businesses}} want their inventions {{to be protected}} in many, if not most, countries. However, there currently exists no single patent that will protect an invention globally, and despite the attempts in international treaties to simplify patenting, the process remains complicated, lengthy, and expensive. Furthermore, the necessity of enforcing patents in multiple countries exists without any possibility of concentrating in one location any parallel proceedings that concern the same invention and the same parties, thus making the maintenance of <b>parallel</b> <b>patents</b> infeasible. Global Patents: Limits of Transnational Enforcement explains why {{the absence of a}} “global patent” persists, and discusses the events in the 140 -year history of patent law internationalization that have shaped the solutions. The author analyzes the ways in which patent holders attempt to mitigate the problems that arise from the lack of global patent protection. One way is to concentrate enforcement in one court of patents granted in multiple countries, which makes the enforcement of the patents less costly and more consistent. Another way is to attempt to use the litigation of a single country patent to reach acts that occur outside the country, which can mitigate the lack of patent protection outside the country. However, both the concentration of proceedings and extraterritorial enforcement suffer from significant limitations. Global Patents explains these limitations and presents the solutions that have been proposed to address them. The book includes a thorough comparative analysis of the extraterritorial features of U. S. and German patent laws, and original statistics on U. S. patent litigation. Based on a comprehensive treatment of the various facets of transnational enforcement challenges, the author proposes the next stage of patent law internationalization. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In other disease areas, generic {{drugs are}} {{normally}} used after patent expiry. Patents on zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine and efavirenz have already expired. Patents will expire for abacavir in late 2014, lopinavir/r in 2016, and tenofovir, darunavir and atazanavir in 2017. However, patents on single-tablet regimens do not expire until after 2026. Methods: The {{number of people}} taking each antiretroviral in the UK was estimated from 23, 655 individuals in the UK CHIC cohort (2012 database). Costs of patented drugs {{were taken from the}} British National Formulary database, assuming a 30 % discount. Costs of generic antiretrovirals were estimated using an 80 % discount from patented prices, or actual costs where available. Two options were analysed: 1 – all patients use single-tablet regimens and patented versions of drugs; prices remain stable over time; 2 – all people switch from patented to generic drugs when available, after patent expiry (dates shown above). Results: There were an estimated 67, 000 people taking antiretrovirals in the UK in 2014, estimated to rise by 8 % per year until 2018 (in line with previous rises). The most widely used antiretrovirals in the CHIC cohort were tenofovir (TDF) (75 %), emtricitabine (FTC) (69 %), efavirenz (EFV) (39 %), lamivudine (3 TC) (23 %), abacavir (ABC) (18 %), darunavir (DRV) (21 %) and atazanavir (ATV) (16 %). The predicted annual UK cost of generic ABC/ 3 TC/EFV (three generic tablets once daily) was £ 1018 per person-year. Costs of patented single-tablet regimens ranged from £ 5000 to £ 7500 per person-year. Assuming continued use of patented antiretrovirals in the UK, the predicted total national costs of antiretroviral treatment were predicted to rise from £ 425 million in 2014 to £ 459 m in 2015, £ 495 m in 2016, £ 536 m in 2017 and £ 578 m in 2018. With a 100 % switch to generics, total predicted costs were £ 337 m in 2014, £ 364 m in 2015, £ 382 m in 2016, £ 144 m in 2017 and £ 169 m in 2018. The total predicted saving over five years from a switch to generics was £ 1. 1 billion. Conclusions: Systematic switching from patented to generic antiretrovirals could potentially save approximately £ 1. 1 billion in the UK over the next five years, compared with continued use of patented versions: this money could be spent on urgently needed HIV prevention programmes. Similar savings are feasible for other European countries, given <b>parallel</b> <b>patent</b> expiry dates. More detailed economic evaluation is required to show when patented single-tablet regimens provide value for money, compared to bioequivalent generic versions of 3 – 4 pills once daily...|$|E

40|$|The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit {{currently}} reverses from one-third {{to nearly}} one-half of all U. S. district court patent claim construction decisions. Because claim construction often determines {{the outcome of}} patent litigation, the high appellate claim construction reversal rate contributes to significant uncertainty among inventors and investors. Congress is currently considering legislation, H. R. 628, which will designate specialist district court patent judges to reduce this unacceptably high reversal rate. This Article concludes that designation of specialist patent trial judges among the federal district court judiciary is likely to reduce the high appellate claim construction reversal rate, based upon an empirical analysis of the appellate claim construction reversal rate in England, which has specialized patent tribunals. Part I of the Article examines proposed U. S. legislation that would designate specialized patent trial judges. Part II analyzes the patent claim construction process in the United States, enumerating the challenges faced by generalist U. S. district court judges charged with deciding highly complex patent litigation actions. Part III then examines the English patent claim construction process, drawing numerous <b>parallels</b> between <b>patent</b> litigation in the United States and England that render the English system a valid comparator when considering the respective appellate claim construction reversal rates in the two jurisdictions. Part IV presents empirical results that strongly {{support the notion that}} designation of specialist patent trial judges in the United States could indeed decrease the appellate claim construction reversal rate, thereby affording certainty to patent litigants and investors.

40|$|Statistical machine {{translation}} (SMT) requires a large parallel corpus, {{which is available}} only for restricted language pairs and domains. To expand the language pairs and domains to which SMT is applicable, we created a method for estimating translation pseudo-probabilities from bilingual comparable corpora. The essence of our method is to calculate pairwise correlations between the words associated with a source-language word, presently restricted to a noun, and its translations; word translation pseudo-probabilities are calculated {{based on the assumption}} that the more associated words a translation is correlated with, the higher its translation probability. We also describe a method we created for calculating noun-sequence translation pseudo-probabilities based on occurrence frequencies of noun sequences and constituent-word translation pseudo-probabilities. Then, we present a framework for merging the translation pseudo-probabilities estimated from in-domain comparable corpora with a translation model learned from an out-of-domain parallel corpus. Experiments using Japanese and English comparable corpora of scientific paper abstracts and a Japanese-English <b>parallel</b> corpus of <b>patent</b> abstracts showed promising results; the BLEU score was improved to some degree by incorporating the pseudo-probabilities estimated from the in-domain comparable corpora. Future work includes an optimization of the parameters and an extension to estimate translation pseudo-probabilities for verbs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} use of {{parallel}} grafts to extend the proximal landing zone for stentgraft repair of aortic transection involving an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA). Case Report: A 28 -year-old patient was referred for treatment of traumatic aortic transection with contained rupture {{at the level of}} an ARSA. Immediate thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was planned because of hemodynamic instability. To achieve rapid sealing and maintain perfusion to both subclavian arteries, a chimney stent to the left subclavian artery (LSA) and a periscope stent-graft to the ARSA were deployed successfully. After surgical repair of all fractures, the patient was discharged 1 month after the initial injury in good condition. Imaging follow-up at 10 months showed a stable repair, <b>patent</b> <b>parallel</b> grafts, and no complications. Conclusion: TEVAR with chimney and periscope grafts proved to be a safe and quick treatment for a patient requiring ARSA repair in acute aortic transection. This technique maintained blood flow to the ARSA and LSA in a totally endovascular approach, which could be very valuable in transection cases where bypass surgery to supra-aortic branches is compromised or deemed challenging due to thoracic wall and/or neck trauma. Parallel grafting can be a valuable tool to address any acute aortic pathology as it can be performed with off-the-shelf devices...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{increasing}} recalls, contamination events, and shortages, {{drug companies}} continue {{to rely on}} outdated manufacturing plants and processes. Drug manufacturing’s inefficiency and lack of innovation stand {{in stark contrast to}} drug discovery, which is the focus of a calibrated innovation policy that combines patents and FDA regulation. Pharmaceutical manufacturing lags far behind the innovative techniques found in other industries due to high regulatory barriers and ineffective intellectual property incentives. Among other challenges, although manufacturers tend to rely on trade secrecy because of the difficulty in enforcing patents on manufacturing processes, trade secrecy provides limited incentives for innovation. To increase those incentives, this Article suggests several direct regulatory reforms and proposes novel ways to use those reforms to improve innovation policy in drug manufacturing and beyond. For example, the FDA could operate a system of temporary market exclusivity for manufacturing innovation <b>parallel</b> to the <b>patent</b> system. Alternatively, the FDA could require disclosure of manufacturing methods to drive the industry from opacity and trade secrecy towards transparency and patent protection for innovation. Overall, the potentially immense economic and health benefits from more innovative manufacturing in the drug industry suggest that manufacturing may be a profitable target of innovation policy in other highly regulated industries and that manufacturing in general deserves a more prominent place in innovation policy and theory...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{detailed}} empirical and doctrinal {{study of}} copyright trolling presents new data showing the astonishing {{rate of growth}} of multi-defendant John Doe litigation in United States district courts over the past decade. It also presents new evidence of the association between this form of litigation and allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films. Multi-defendant John Doe lawsuits have become {{the most common form of}} copyright litigation in several U. S. districts, and in districts such as the Northern District of Illinois, copyright litigation involving pornography accounts for more than half of new cases. This Article highlights a fundamental oversight in the literature on copyright trolls. <b>Paralleling</b> discussions in <b>patent</b> law, scholars addressing the troll issue in copyright have applied status-based definitions to determine who is, and is not, a troll. This Article argues that the definition should be conduct based. Multi-defendant John Doe litigation should be considered copyright trolling whenever it is motivated by a desire to turn litigation into an independent revenue stream. Such litigation, when initiated with the aim of turning a profit in the courthouse as opposed to seeking compensation or deterring illegal activity, reflects a kind of systematic opportunism that fits squarely within the concept of litigation trolling. This Article shows that existing status-based definitions of copyright trolls do not account for what is now arguably the most prevalent form of trolling. In addition to these empirical and theoretical contributions, this Article shows how statutory damages and permissive joinder make multi-defendant John Doe litigation possible and why allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films are particularly well-suited to this model...|$|R
40|$|Outsourcing {{has been}} {{touted as the}} ideal way for organisations to reduce cost, focus on core {{business}} processes, improve services, enhance skills, reduce time-to-market and increase overall competitive advantage,” (Power, Bonifazi and Desouza, 2004). A pertinent question is therefore ‘Can South African companies in the pharmaceutical industry remain competitive by outsourcing, what is driving these companies to outsource and how effective has the initiative been?’ The {{purpose of the study}} is to identify the extent to which various key factors play an influential role in motivating pharmaceutical companies in SA to outsource. South African pharmaceutical companies as part of the global arena, have to continually assess the feasibility of manufacturing their products in-house or allowing contract manufacturers to manufacturer and or pack on their behalf. The research questions posed in this research were: why are companies outsourcing, what is outsourcing and what is happening amongst the South African pharmaceutical companies? The results of this qualitative rich study have shown that outsourcing in SA is not just about cost savings or reduction in product costs but that this process is able to afford the contract giver the ability to tap into additional capabilities (facilities, technology and skill) of their outsourcing partner. Outsourcing has enabled the contract manufacturers in SA to assist the contract givers in numerous areas such as cost reduction, cost saving, reduction in capital investment, increased flexibility and allowed the contract givers to focus on their core competencies. The implementation of off shoring may result in South African contract givers incurring additional ‘hidden costs’ which may be attributed to quality problems, reduced flexibility of transport, product write-offs (due to large volumes ordered), currency fluctuations and additional resources that may required (technology transfer, documentation review, and validation). The responses from the research questionnaires indicate that the key drivers of outsourcing in South African are aligned with those identified in global ii marketplace by Jiang and Qureshi; Copestake and Lau and Zhang (2006). The main drivers being profitability increase (cost reduction, cost saving and capital reduction), strategic considerations (focus on core competence, increased flexibility and to facilitate market penetration) and access to knowledge and skills. The key for the South African outsourcing service providers lies in ensuring that their clients are kept satisfied so that they can minimise the threat of offshore providers. The results of the study are line with Momme and Hvolby (2001) suggestions in which they advocate that organisations only outsource when suppliers have a comparative advantage and that an organisation proactively have a stronger focus on its internal core business areas. In SA governmental changes in regulations/ laws such as those addressing <b>parallel</b> importation, <b>patents,</b> foreign investors and trade would impact on the countries national competitive advantage. However although outsourcing is highly beneficial, organisations need to carefully manage the process, identify hidden costs, risks and initiate preventative measures to ensure success. This study was the first step towards conceptualising the impact of the key drivers, decision making and strategic issues on the South African pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} protection (IPP) attained its importance {{in recent years}} because of the steady increase of intellectual property-endowed goods and technology in global trade. Technology producers, among them multilateral pharmaceutical companies (MPCs) felt that the Paris Convention (the Convention) was not adequate in dealing with trade related issues, and that an agreement was needed to integrate the subject of IPP; especially patent protection for pharmaceuticals, into the broader context of global trade law. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) concluded in the Uruguay Round in 1994 brought IPP into the global trading system. The patent system contained in the Agreement reflects {{to a large extent}} MPCs' proposal for a strengthened patent system which paves the way to ensure market access and equal competition opportunity in their endeavour to expand global operation. The objective of the global trading system is to liberalise trade, achieved by securing commitments of market access and equal competition opportunity through the application of the principles of most-favoured-nation treatment, national treatment and reciprocity, reinforced by domestic competition policy to ensure efficient functioning of markets. However, in regard to patent protection for pharmaceuticals, the exercise of the exclusive marketing rights conferred by patent protection has trade restricting effect because competition is excluded during the patent term. This trade restricting effect does not compliment the objective of the global trading system nor promote competition. But the TRIPS Agreement does not cover a negotiated result on securing the recognition in domestic competition policy of the exclusive marketing rights conferred by patent protection, especially when domestic competition policy is designed to compliment microeconomic policy such as health care cost control. The implementation of international exhaustion to allow <b>parallel</b> importation of <b>patented</b> products during the term of patent is an example in point. It is an issue the TRIPS Agreement does not address and is excluded from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism. It is a legal issue because the disparity among national competition policy will cause trade distortions. It is political because the issue touches upon nations' regulatory autonomy in designing their competition policy to compliment other government policies. It also has economic implications in that countries might wish to rely on parallel importation as a mechanism to bring down prices of patent products. A complex issue as such requires- a multilateral solution enshrined in a legally binding agreement. In the absence of such an agreement, patent system under the TRIPS Agreement will be inadequate and ineffective because it will become inoperable and nations will incline to retrieve to unilateral actions for the resolution of grievances...|$|R
