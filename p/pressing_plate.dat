The manufacturing have been processing by sheet type of products with ninety-six pieces of flexible printed circuit boards. Causes of the problem include the before and internal hot pressing process. In process beginning times, the most right row of products between the cooling plate and the hot pressing machine has temperature 71. 2 ◦C that is higher than glass transition temperature (Tg) 60 ◦C. Those products’ temperature lead to evaporate a polyimide adhesive before hot pressing process beginning. The internal hot pressing process include the preheat times and the pressure time. In the preheat time the problem is a gap between lower and upper plate, was under specification (Under 1 mm) and leaded to adhesive polyimide stain. In the actuality this time requires temperature and low pressure that mean a gap within 1 – 2 mm (between lower and upper plate). In pressure times the hot <b>pressing</b> <b>plate</b> surface is not flat and products are pressed by insufficient force that it lead to generate an adhesive stain on flexible printed circuit boards.

50|$|A {{common cause}} of {{brinelling}} {{is the use of}} improper installation procedures. Brinelling often occurs when pressing bearings into holes or onto shafts. Care must usually be taken to ensure that pressure is applied to the proper bearing race to avoid transferring the pressure from one race to the other through the balls or rollers. If pressing force is applied to the wrong race, brinelling can occur to either or both of the races. The act of pressing or clamping can also leave brinell marks, especially if the vise or press has serrated jaws or roughened surfaces. Flat <b>pressing</b> <b>plates</b> are often used in the pressing of bearings, while soft copper, brass, or aluminum jaw covers are often used in vises to help avoid brinell marks from being forced into the workpiece.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to research, design and build a shoe press for a local company called Soft Star Shoes. Soft Star Shoes were looking for {{different}} ways to replace their barging process, which {{is the process of}} attaching the rubber sole of the shoe to the upper leather. To perform this process, Soft Star Shoes used hammering, which was physically straining, caused operators to get frustrated, as well as, slowed the production process. After receiving the problem description and customer requirements, a decision to go with an automated press was made. The team researched existing shoe presses to use as benchmarks in the design process. The team then performed ergonomic analysis to understand the severity of the problem, and stress-strain and reliability analyses to find maximum loads, and fracturing points. In addition, the team interviewed Soft Star Shoes barge employees to determine the requirements that needed to be met for the press to be considered a good replacement for the hammering process. Using this information, the team designed and built a shoe press that meets the customer’s needs. The new device is a 17 ” by 17 ” by 12 ” press that is held by five vertical columns. These columns are attached to two 0. 5 ” thick steel plates (one on the top and one on the bottom). The press is powered using a 115 V ball screw device, which is inserted {{through a hole in the}} top steel plate, and carries a 14 ” x 14 ” x 0. 5 ” <b>pressing</b> <b>plate.</b> The device travels a vertical distance of 10 ” to perform the pressing process. Tests were started upon finishing the design process. The tests were conducted based on the engineering requirements generated. The press passed all these tests, which meant that the team has achieved the sponsor’s needs. However, the project was not done at that point. The press was dirty and the steel was rusted. So cosmetic operations were performed. Cleaning, Painting and adding lights to the press were a critical factor in delivering a good-looking press. After completing the cosmetics, the press was delivered to the sponsoring company. Furthermore, the press had a big impact on Soft Star Shoes’ production floor. It allowed the company to replace the existing barging process, which improved their ergonomic rating, as well as, their shoe output. Operators did not need to apply any physical force to barge the shoes, which reduced the chances of musculoskeletal disorders within the company’s walls.

40|$|What are {{corrugated}} bamboo roofing sheets? Corrugated bamboo roofing sheets (CBRS) are {{an excellent}} alternative to corrugated asbestos, iron, plastic or zinc roofing sheets. They are produced from natural materials and are attractive, durable and resilient to adverse weather conditions and pest attack. They can be produced {{in a range of}} standard sizes and can be used to roof dwellings, stores, animal pens and other buildings. How are they produced? CBRS are produced by pressing firmly together woven bamboo mats that have been impregnated with an adhesive resin. The corrugations are formed by pressing them between corrugated <b>pressing</b> <b>plates</b> in the <b>pressing</b> machine. What is the market for corrugated bamboo roofing sheets? The market for CBRS is somewhat variable in different regions of the world but depends to a large extent on successful marketing strategies. CBRS is popular in rural areas where the low prices are attractive. The potential to increase the use of CBRS in more affluent areas is enormous, and there is considerable export potential in the markets of the more affluent countries where their eco-friendly nature could be a major selling point. What is the role of a corrugated bamboo roofing sheets unit in rural development? The unit itself will provide employment to a range of people and there will be extra employment generation in its forward and backward linkages, such as cultivation and harvesting of bamboos, primary processing, mat weaving, marketing and retailing. A unit producing 500, 000 m 2 of sheets per year will require a total workforce of over 200 people. The need for a sustainable supply of raw materials will encourage the proper management of bamboo stands, and the establishment of new plantations, with their associated environmental benefits.

Nor is it necessary, that this laminated and ting'd body should be of a fluid substance, any other substance, provided it be thin enough and transparent, doing the same thing: this the Laminæ of our Muscovy-glass hint; but it may be confirm'd by multitudes of other Instances.|$|R
