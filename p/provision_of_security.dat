40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{substantiate}} the methodical approach to determining the level <b>of</b> formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> enterprise personnel <b>security.</b> By analyzing, systematizing and generalizing scientific achievements of many scientists, approaches to the evaluation <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> at the enterprise were considered, a set of indices for evaluation <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> was defined. There justified the urgency of creating a comprehensive approach to evaluation <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> that includes implementation of the following stages: defining a list of indices corresponding to the level <b>of</b> formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> {{with the help of}} the expert evaluation method; calculating integral indices <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> for each component and the corresponding level by means of the taxonomic analysis; grouping enterprises by the level <b>of</b> formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> with the use of the cluster and discriminant analysis. It is found that the implementation of this approach will allow not only determining the level <b>of</b> formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> at the enterprise, but also developing appropriate recommendations on improving its state. Prospects for further research in this direction are evaluation of conditions for formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> at the enterprise, which will enable revealing negative destabilizing factors that influence personnel securit...|$|R

2500|$|Critics of Hooker's actions believe that, in {{the words}} of Craig E. Colton and Peter N. Skinner, [...] "Hooker {{assigned}} the board with a continuing duty to protect property buyers from chemicals when the company itself accepted no such 'moral obligation'." [...] Moreover, the transfer effectively ended what <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and maintenance for the hazardous waste had existed before and placed all responsibility in clearly unqualified hands. It was this attempt to evade their responsibility, Colten and Skinner contend, that would [...] "ultimately come back to haunt not only Hooker but all other chemical producers in the United States through the strict liability provisions of Superfund legislation." [...] On the other hand, Eric Zeusse writes that Hooker's decision to sell the property rather than allowing the school board to condemn it stemmed from a desire to document its warnings. [...] "Had the land been condemned and seized, says Hooker, the company would have been unable to air its concerns to all future owners of the property. It is difficult to see any other reason for what it did." ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> {{employment}} <b>security</b> and career advancement opportunities in firms of diverse institutional ownership {{and the impact of}} such practices on employee and firm outcomes. The sample included 478 state-owned and non-state-owned firms (i. e., domestic private firms, Sino-foreign joint ventures, and wholly-foreign-owned firms) in the People's Republic of China. We found that the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> employment <b>security</b> was greater in state-owned than in non-state-owned firms. The <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> career advancement opportunities in domestic private firms and Sino-foreign joint ventures was similar to that in wholly foreign-owned firms, but greater than that in state-owned firms. The <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> career advancement opportunities was positively related to employee organizational commitment, citizenship behaviors, and firm performance.
