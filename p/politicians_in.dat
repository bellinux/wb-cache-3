5|$|A {{major focus}} for Kenyatta {{during the first}} {{three and a half years}} of Kenya's {{independence}} were the divisions within KANU itself.

5|$|As {{the wars}} in Gaul come to an end, Julius Caesar (Ciarán Hinds) is faced with both triumph and tribulation. On {{the heels of his}} victory comes news of his daughter's death.
