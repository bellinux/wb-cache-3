5000|$|Thus the {{financial}} regulations of the Basel II Accord {{have been criticized}} for their possible <b>procyclicality.</b> The accord requires banks to increase their capital ratios when they face greater risks.

[...] The effect of the single Eurozone interest rate on the relatively high-inflation countries in the Eurozone periphery is also pro-cyclical, leading to very low or even negative real interest rates during an upturn which magnifies the boom (e.g. 'Celtic Tiger' upturn in Ireland) and property and asset price bubbles whose subsequent bust magnifies the downturns.|$|E

40|$|Assets {{of banks}} located in France are mainly {{denominated}} in euro and in US dollar. Currency diversification, which measures {{how much of}} assets are denominated in US dollar, implies a credit risk diversification and a valuation effect on assets.

Thereby, currency diversification of assets should affect leverage responsiveness {{to the value of}} assets, namely the leverage <b>procyclicality.</b> Using innovative data on credit institutions located in France between 1999 and 2014, we examine whether US dollar diversification of assets is pertinent for the analysis of leverage <b>procyclicality.</b> Focusing on investment banks, our results suggest that the net effect of US dollar diversification is dominated by the valuation effect. After extracting the valuation effect of diversification, it also posits the importance of two opposite effects in leverage <b>procyclicality.</b> Additionally, our results confirms the theoretical prediction where currency mismatch does not affect leverage <b>procyclicality.</b> Implicitly it supports the idea that leverage <b>procyclicality</b> is only driven by assets.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis has lead to heated debates on {{the pros and}} cons of fair value accounting from the perspectives of illiquidity and <b>procyclicality.</b> Previous research investigates the relationship between fair value accounting and <b>procyclicality</b> and finds mixed evidence of this relationship during economic recessions.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether fair value accounting promotes <b>procyclicality</b> by focusing on securitization transactions during economic booms. We examine the relationship between securitization accounting and <b>procyclicality</b> by using a parsimonious model. The findings are as follows. When a gain on sale is recognized under certain conditions, sale accounting decreases the leverage ratio compared with that before the securitization transaction. Banks increase assets to maintain the target leverage ratio. Furthermore, if banks conduct securitization transactions and adopt sale accounting, the leverage ratio decreases; therefore, bank...|$|E

40|$|It {{is a great}} {{pleasure}} and privilege to be in Madrid for this conference hosted by the Bank of Spain and the Financial Stability Institute. I would like to present a few remarks on <b>procyclicality,</b> what it means, what role it played in the current crisis and which policy options are available to mitigate its amplitude and impact on financial systems. What is <b>procyclicality?</b> Strictly speaking, <b>procyclicality</b> refers to the tendency of financial variables to fluctuate around a trend during the economic cycle. Increased <b>procyclicality</b> thus simply means fluctuations with broader amplitude. Such a simple description seldom fits the behaviour of financial systems in real life. More likely, following a shock, the path of asset prices and evolution of financial aggregates will display various and highly irregular forms of volatility, with possible non linearities and discontinuities (a good example being liquidity freezes). These are characteristic features of complex systems.

40|$|Some {{evidence}} {{points to}} the <b>procyclicality</b> of leverage among financial institutions leading to aggregate volatility. This <b>procyclicality</b> occurs when financial institutions finance their assets with non-equity funding (i. e., debt financed asset expansions). Wholesale funding is {{an important source of}} market-based funding that allows some institutions to quickly adjust their leverage. As such, financial institutions that rely on wholesale funding are expected to have higher degrees of leverage <b>procyclicality.</b> Using high frequency balance sheet data for the universe of banks, this study tries to identify (i) if such a positive link exists between the assets and leverage in Canada, (ii) how wholesale funding plays a role for this link, and (iii) market and macroeconomic factors associated with this link. The findings of the empirical analysis suggest that a strong positive link exists between asset growth and leverage growth, and the use to wholesale funding is an important determinant of this relationship. Furthermore, liquidity of several short-term funding markets matters for <b>procyclicality</b> of leverage.

We develop a dynamic political-economy model to explain this phenomenon. In the model, public expenditures provide insurance to uninsured households, and optimal fiscal policy is countercyclical. The introduction of a political friction, in which successive governments disagree on the desired distribution of public spending, can lead to procyclical fiscal policies. Numerical simulations of the model allow us to compare quantitatively the relative role of common explanations for fiscal <b>procyclicality.</b> We conclude that political distortions in the fiscal process can explain fiscal <b>procyclicality</b> better than other common explanations, such as borrowing constraints and macroeconomic volatility.

40|$|Financial {{sector is}} prone to {{cyclical}} movements and <b>procyclicality</b> of the financial system may endanger financial stability, which depends on asset prices and loan losses {{due to the fact}} that the deterioration of bank assets through non-performing loans is characteristics of banking distress. This was the case during Japan's lost decade and the Nordic banking crises. Even the classic banking panics of the Great Depression are being revised in the light of new evidence on the fundamental deterioration of bank assets. Much empirical evidence supports the view that balance sheet variables, such as net worth affect investment and produce business cycle dynamics. In an upswing, the greater availability of credit leads to higher asset prices, which then serve as collateral for more borrowing. Relatively unstable development of share prices on the capital market increases equity risk. This paper is based on the presumption that the stability of macro economic environment, less pronounced cyclical movements and insignificant <b>procyclicality</b> between GDP and equity (used as collaterals for credit insurance) lower equity risk. There was proved no significant <b>procyclicality</b> between collaterals and GDP according to low stock market capitalization.

40|$|A countercyclical {{fiscal policy}} {{combined}} with sustainable fiscal finances {{is considered to}} be one of the most important objectives in modern economic policy. However, procyclical fiscal policy is widely observed in practice, especially in emerging market countries. The main purposes of this thesis are to examine the determinants of fiscal <b>procyclicality</b> and sustainability with special reference to the role of fiscal rules, and to assess the impact of both fiscal <b>procyclicality</b> and sustainability on economic growth. This thesis deals with several new issues on fiscal <b>procyclicality</b> and sustainability which have been ignored in the existing literature. We explore the role of the time coverage of fiscal rules in determining fiscal <b>procyclicality</b> and assess the effect of fiscal <b>procyclicality</b> on economic growth across spending categories and country groups. We also attempt to answer the determinants of fiscal sustainability and the effect of fiscal sustainability on economic growth for the first time. Our empirical analyses yield a number of novel and interesting findings. First, we find that government consumption and investment appear to be procyclical while current transfers appear to be countercyclical in a large number of OECD countries. Second, we find that most OECD countries seem to maintain sustainable fiscal finances and several factors such as the growth rate, the level of development, and aging populations could play a role in determining fiscal sustainability. Third, we find that procyclical current expenditure, especially government consumption and current transfers, could have a negative effect on economic growth, and this negative effect is prominent in emerging market countries. We also find that fiscal sustainability does not seem to play any role in economic growth in tranquil times. Finally, we find that the introduction of fiscal rules not only help achieve both countercyclical and sustainable fiscal policy, but also boost economic growth indirectly by stimulating countercyclical fiscal policy. Multi-year fiscal rules contribute more toward mitigating the level of fiscal <b>procyclicality</b> than annual fiscal rules, and fiscal rules with enforceability, such as the Stability and Growth Pact rules, appear to help maintain sustainable fiscal finances. ...|$|E
40|$|The term <b>procyclicality</b> {{refers to}} the ability of a system to amplify {{business}} cycles. The recent financial crisis has revealed that the current regulatory framework, Basel II, affects the business cycle in exactly that manner. The newly published Basel III therefore sought to include tools that would mitigate the procyclical nature of regulatory framework. The aim of the thesis is to analyze whether such tools are effective and whether the <b>procyclicality</b> under Basel III has been mitigated when compared to Basel II. In order to conduct such analysis we employ a simple model with the households and firms sector. Using the OLS estimation method we estimate the sensitivity of Basel risk weights to the business cycle under both Basel II and Basel III conditions. As the Basel III framework has been published only recently, there are few studies that would analyze its effect on <b>procyclicality.</b> The main contribution of this thesis consists of implementation of Basel III countercyclical tools and the comparison between both frameworks. The thesis further contributes to the existing literature by conducting the analysis on the data for the Visegrád Group, that is for the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{globalization}} on productivity growth and the <b>procyclicality</b> of productivity growth in manufacturing industries in the United States and Germany. For U. S. industries, the analysis suggests that changes in international demand affect productivity growth differently from changes in exposure to international competition. An increase in foreign demand for U. S. exports raises trend productivity growth, but {{to a lesser degree}} than does a similar demand shock from domestic buyers. On the other hand, whereas an increase in U. S. imports reduces trend productivity growth of U. S. industries, a loss of market share to imports is associated with gains to productivity growth. For Germany, neither international demand shocks nor exposure to international competition seem to be associated with productivity growth rates, perhaps because German industries experienced a smaller increase in exposure to international competition over the time period. Comparing the U. S. and German results suggests that "going global" may affect productivity growth rates more than simply "being global. " As for the procyclical characteristics of productivity growth, the U. S. and German measures evidence different procyclical behavior. For many industries, both U. S. and German labor productivity growth rates exhibit some degree of <b>procyclicality.</b> For German industries, this <b>procyclicality</b> of productivity growth disappears with broader measures of productivity growth that include utilization of capital and intermediate inputs. For U. S. industries, the degree of <b>procyclicality</b> increases when productivity growth is measured on these broader bases. Moreover, in the United States, <b>procyclicality</b> appears to be accentuated by export demand growth and dampened by import demand growth. Capital movements; Econometric models...|$|E

40|$|Credit <b>procyclicality</b> has {{recently}} {{been the focus of}} considerable attention, but what fuels the often excessive credit growth is rarely questioned. We investigate the relationship between the composition of banks' liabilities and their credit <b>procyclicality.</b> After examining the macroeconomic context where banks rely increasingly on wholesale funding (WSF), we estimate the effect of WSF on the banks’ credit growth using panel data for the commercial banks of Korea between 2000 : 1 and 2011 : 2. We find that a higher sensitivity of banks' WSF to the business cycle leads to an excessive response of credit growth to the business cycle, even with a low share of WSF on bank liabilities. This finding suggests that the regulation of banks’ WSF mechanism may contribute to financial stability through a bank credit channel of monetary policy. On the other hand, we find that overseas WSF has a more marked effect on credit <b>procyclicality,</b> which may additionally exacerbate the financial fragility of export-led emerging economies. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the role of {{information}} sharing and borrower legal rights in affecting the procyclical effect of bank loan loss provisions. Based on a sample of Asian banks, our empirical results highlight that higher non-discretionary provisions reduce loan growth and hence, non-discretionary provisions are procyclical. A closer investigation suggests that better information sharing through public credit registries managed by central banks, but not private credit bureaus managed by the private sector, might substitute {{the role of a}} dynamic provisioning system in mitigating the <b>procyclicality</b> of non-discretionary provisions. We also document that higher discretionary provisions in countries with stronger legal rights of borrowers may temper the procyclical effect of non-discretionary provisions. However, these findings only hold for small banks. This suggests that the implementation of a dynamic provisioning system to mitigate the <b>procyclicality</b> of non-discretionary provisions is more crucial for large banks, because such <b>procyclicality</b> cannot be offset by strengthening credit market environments through better information sharing and legal rights of borrowers...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{industrial}} countries {{have tended to}} pursue countercyclical or, at worst, acyclical fiscal policy.

In line with existing literature, we confirm the role of increased financial integration and lower output volatility in reducing overall <b>procyclicality.</b> In this paper, however, we focus on the role played by the quality of institutions. Indeed, the quality of institutions seems to be a key determinant of a country’s ability to graduate. We provide a formal analysis, controlling for the endogeneity of institutions and other determinants of fiscal <b>procyclicality,</b> that strongly suggests that there is a causal link running from stronger institutions to less procyclical or more countercyclical fiscal policy.
