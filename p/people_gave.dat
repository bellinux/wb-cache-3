5|$|Jones had {{previously}} developed a gruesome game called Go to Hell. In an interview Jones {{stated that he}} developed the game for his own amusement; he enjoyed the reactions <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> to the game. The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics. Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and akin to a horror movie by others.|$|E
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> her milk to help her recover.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposals}} {{provoked a}} large negative response following a campaign {{led by the}} British Association for Shooting and Conservation and backed by numerous shooting-related websites and organisations. A total of 1,458 <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> their views in emails and letters sent to Royal Mail. An online petition opposing the proposals was signed by 2,236 people, 1,742 of whom added comments. In {{the face of such}} opposition, Royal Mail dropped the proposals in December 2012.|$|E
25|$|Zemí {{was also}} the name the <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> to their {{physical}} representations of the gods, whether objects or drawings. They were made in many forms and materials and {{have been found in}} a variety of settings. The majority of zemís were crafted from wood but stone, bone, shell, pottery, and cotton were also used. Zemí petroglyphs were carved on rocks in streams, ball courts, and on stalagmites in caves. Cemí pictographs were found on secular objects such as pottery, and on tattoos. Yucahú, the god of cassava, was represented with a three-pointed zemí, which could be found in conucos to increase the yield of cassava. Wood and stone zemís have been found in caves in Hispaniola and Jamaica. Cemís are sometimes represented by toads, turtles, fishes, snakes, and various abstract and human-like faces.|$|E
25|$|Latané and Darley {{performed}} three {{experiments to}} test bystander behavior in non-emergency situations Their {{results indicated that}} {{the way in which the}} subjects were asked for help mattered. In one condition, subjects asked a bystander for his or her name. More <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> an answer when the students gave their name first. In another condition, the students asked bystanders for a dime. When the student gave an explanation, such as saying that their wallet had been stolen, the percentage of people giving assistance was higher (72%) than when the student just asked for a dime (34%). Additional research by Faul, Mark, et al., using data collected by EMS officials when responding to an emergency, indicated that the response of bystanders was correlated with the health severity of the situation.|$|E

25|$|It {{was largely}} as a result of these {{maneuvers}} that Sa'ed ultimately resigned on 9 November 1944, being replaced by Morteza Gholi Bayat. In December, despite Tudeh opposition, Mohammed Mosaddeq successfully advanced legislation preventing any government official from granting Iranian fields to any foreign investor without explicit approval from the Majlis. Kavtaradze protested the change, claiming that it was aimed against the Soviet Union, but the Bayet cabinet refused to renegotiate and he returned to Moscow without having registered any gain. In June 1945, Molotov, Kavtaradze and Azerbaijan SSR leader Mir Jafar Baghirov were instructed by the Soviet Central Committee to secretly prepare a separatist insurrection in the Iranian Azerbaijan. This resulted in Ja'far Pishevari's Azerbaijan People's Government, while agitation among the Kurdish <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> way to Qazi Muhammad's Republic of Mahabad (both regimes were crushed within months by Iranian interventions).|$|E

500|$|Islam is {{the second}} largest {{religion}} in the country. In the 2011 census, 1.9% of the census population (1.52 million <b>people)</b> <b>gave</b> their religion as Islam, but this figure is stated as being unreliable because {{a disproportionate number of}} adherents of this religion (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question. Figures from Religionswissenschaftlicher Medien- und Informationsdienst suggest a figure of [...] 4.4 to 4.7 million (around 5.5% of the population) in 2015. A study conducted by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees found that between 2011 and 2015 the Muslim population rose by 1.2 million people, mostly due to immigration. Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations.|$|E
500|$|Stojanović {{visited the}} {{villages in the}} area, {{inspecting}} individual companies and platoons of the 1st Krajina Detachment. His visits were accompanied by parades of Partisan units and by mass gatherings. Partisan songs were sung, slogans were shouted, and banners were waved. Stojanović gave speeches to the villagers and soldiers. He said that the Italian troops in the area were not protectors of the Serbs, but occupiers and enemies. He branded those who collaborated with the Italians as traitors to the Serbian people. Stojanović's speeches were not well received by some people, who spread rumours {{that he was not}} Mladen Stojanović, but a [...] "Turk" [...] (Muslim) impersonator. According to them, Stojanović had been killed by the Ustaše in August 1941 and the communists were using an impersonator to deceive the people. Few <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> credence to these rumours.|$|E
500|$|The {{early years}} of the Republic were a time of {{external}} strife and periodic popular unrest. In 494BC, under harsh measures from patrician creditors, during a military campaign, the plebeians under arms seceded to the Mons Sacer outside the city and refused to fight in the campaign without political concessions. With the pressure of an external threat, the patricians were forced to create the office of plebeian tribune (...) who were declared sacrosanct, i.e. that they were declared inviolable and that anyone could be summarily executed for violation of the sanctity of his person. This was the basis of the tribune's ability to veto (literally translated as [...] "I forbid") any political act or to protect any individual from an injustice committed by a magistrate, known as intercessio and auxilium, respectively. The <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> the tribunes, whose number is unclear, two assistants known as plebeian aediles.|$|E

500|$|Harris Farms, where California Chrome was bred, foaled, {{and lived}} {{until the age}} of two, had {{previously}} nurtured champions such as two-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner Tiznow. In 2010 Love the Chase was bred to the Harris Farms stallion Lucky Pulpit. CNN reported that the stud fee for the breeding was $2,000. Steve Coburn said he had a dream three weeks before California Chrome's birth that the foal would be a colt with four white feet and a blaze. California Chrome was relatively large for a newborn horse, weighing , and active, [...] "running circles around Momma" [...] within two hours of birth. Love the Chase suffered a uterine laceration while foaling, and was placed on an IV due to internal bleeding. [...] The mare and foal were stall-bound together for over a month. She was kept on a catheter that administered anti-bleeding medication, and the farm staff checked her two to three times a day. Because <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> the colt extra attention and affection when they cared for his dam, he imprinted on humans as well as his mother. As a result, California Chrome became very people-focused, a trait that has served him well in race training.|$|E

[...] J.J Abrams and Damon Linelof told Monaghan that if he wanted to write the song that would be Charlie's [...] "one hit wonder", they would consider using it in the show. Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, [...] "You all everybody, acting like it's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes." [...] The producers had an inside joke where they would say this quotation to each other.

500|$|In {{relation}} to Swaminarayan's work and views, Gandhi remarked that [...] "the work accomplished by Swaminarayan in Gujarat could not {{and would never}} have been achieved by the law." [...] Scholars note close parallels between Gandhi's work and Swaminarayan's work related to non-violence, truth-telling, hygiene, temperance, and the uplift of masses. Commenting on Gandhi's social work, N.A. Toothi [...] "most of his thought, activities and even methods of most of the institutions which he has been building up and serving, have the flavor of Swaminarayanism, more than that of any other sect of Hindu Dharma." [...] He however did not feel that Swaminarayan's values aligned perfectly with his interpretation of Vaishnavism. In a letter dated 25 July 1918, to Manganlal Gandhi, he stated, “To be sure, I have felt in all seriousness that Swaminarayan and Vallabhacharaya have robbed us of our manliness. They made the people incapable of self-defense... It was all to the good that <b>people</b> <b>gave</b> up drinking, smoking, etc., this, however, is not an end in itself, it only is a means.
