50|$|<b>Paramethadione</b> (brand name Paradione) was {{originally}} {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1949, as a second-line treatment for petit mal and absence seizures. <b>Paramethadione</b> was ultimately discontinued in 1994 due to safety and efficacy concerns, such as being associated with fetal trimethadione syndrome, which {{is also known as}} <b>paramethadione</b> syndrome.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, {{the yearly}} cost for 900 mg/day <b>paramethadione</b> was {{approximately}} $66, which would translate to $462 yearly in 2007 (with CPI inflation) if <b>paramethadione</b> was still sold.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paramethadione</b> {{was first}} {{patented}} in 1949 (...) by Abbott Laboratories. Abbott Labbortories {{continued to hold}} the patent to <b>paramethadione</b> until the approval was withdrawn in 2004 due to the drug no longer being in use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paramethadione</b> is {{associated}} with various adverse effects including sedation, increased visual sensitivity to light, GI distress, edema, nephropathy, neutropenia, myasthenia gravis-like syndrome, fatal aplastic anemia, and severe birth defects known as fetal trimethadione syndrome (or <b>paramethadione</b> syndrome).|$|E
50|$|Fetal {{trimethadione}} syndrome (also {{known as}} <b>paramethadione</b> syndrome, German syndrome, tridione syndrome, among others) {{is a set}} of birth defects caused by the administration of the anticonvulsants trimethadione (also known as Tridione) or <b>paramethadione</b> to epileptic mothers during pregnancy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Paramethadione</b> acts {{to reduce}} T-type calcium {{currents}} in thalamic neurons {{which has been}} proposed to underlie the 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) during absence seizures.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s {{trimethadione}} (brand name Tridione) was {{the only}} available treatment for absence seizures. However, while effective, this drug presented with significant adverse effects, {{which led to the}} search for an equally effective analog. While limited information is available from the time, a pre-market clinical study found that <b>paramethadione,</b> an analog of trimethadione, was not quite as effective at alleviating seizures as trimethadione, however, it did have a significantly lower side effect profile in 85 patients over the course of 2 years. Notably, 80% of patients still showed a good response to <b>paramethadione.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Paramethadione,</b> 5-ethyl-3,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione, {{differs from}} {{trimethadione}} {{only in the}} substitution of one methyl group with an ethyl group. It is synthesized in a completely analogous manner, except that it comes from 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid instead of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paramethadione</b> (brand name Paradione) is an {{anticonvulsant}} in the oxazolidinedione class {{developed by}} the Illinois-based pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories (known as AbbVie since January 1, 2013 [...] ), {{and approved by the}} Food and Drug Administration in 1949 for the treatment of absence seizures, also called partial seizures.|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{removal of}} the methyl group from {{nitrogen}} in 3, 5, 5 -trimethyl 2, 4 -oxazolidinedione (trimethadione) to yield 5, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 4 -oxazolidinedione (â€œDM 0 â€•) has previously been reported (Butler et al., 1952; Butler, 1953 a). From analogy it might be expected that the antiepileptic drug, <b>paramethadione,.</b> would undergo the same reaction to be converted to 5 -ethyl- 5 -methyl- 2, 4 -oxazo lidinedione (henceforth to be designated â€œ¿EMOâ€•). The present report concerns the isolation of EMO from urine of dogs receiving <b>paramethadione,</b> the develop ment of a method for the determination of EMO in plasma, {{and the use of}} this method to study the course of production and elimination of EMO. MATERIALS. The racemic form of EMO was furnished through the kindness of Dr. M. A. Spielman of Abbott Laboratories. <b>Paramethadione</b> was obtained from commercial capsules. Examination of the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of a buffer of pH 8 shaken with an ether solution of this <b>paramethadione</b> indicated that it could not contain as much as 0. 1 per cent of EMO as a contaminant. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF EMO AND <b>PARAMETHADIONE.</b> EMO is a liquid soluble in water to the extent of about 15 gm. per 100 ml. at room temperature. Its ultraviolet absorption spec trum is closely similar to that of DM 0 (Butler, 1953 a). The molar extinction coefficient of the ionic form at 215 is 9...|$|E
40|$|Although {{trimethadione}} (Tridione) and <b>paramethadione</b> (Paradione) {{are two of}} {{the most}} useful agents for the treatment of petit mal epilepsy, comparatively little is know concerning the fate and the excretion of these agents in animals or man. In their report on the analgesic action of trimethadione, Richards, Everett and Pickrell (1946) briefly mentioned experiments in which rats with bilateral nephrectomy or carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage recovered more slowly than control animals from a hypnotic dose of trimethadione. They concluded that in rats both liver and kidney appear {{to play a role in}} the elimination or metabolism of large hypnotic doses of the drug. In the same publication these investigators reported that in adult males less than 3 per cent of a 2 -gram oral dose of trimethadione was recovered in an 8 -hour urine sample, and concluded that in man therapeutic doses are eliminated by means other than excretion through the kidneys. In contrast, there is no published information of which we are aware on the fate and the excretion of <b>paramethadione</b> in animals or man.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} method is described for the quantitative determina tion of trimethadione, <b>paramethadione,</b> ethosuximide, metharbital, methsuxim-ide, phensuximide, mephenytoin, ethotoin, primidone and diazepam in serum. Gas chromatography, with temperature programming, is employed {{and each of}} the drugs or any combination of them may be assayed on a single specimen during a single rapid determination on 3 percent OV- 17 following chloroform extraction. Retention times relative to an internal standard (methyl myristate) are given.
