5|$|Site {{testing for}} both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The {{construction}} of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use <b>post-tensioned</b> <b>concrete,</b> reinforced with rustproof steel cables.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{framework of}} the building utilises a simple system of reinforced concrete beams and slabs, and was originally clad in square mosaic and rectangular ceramic tiles on its walls and columns. The building's foundation comprises large diameter bored piles installed in decomposed sandstone. Beams span an average 7.6 metres except at the main entrance where <b>post-tensioned</b> <b>concrete</b> beams span 15 metres. The auditorium is roofed over by 24-metre long steel trusses with a composite reinforced concrete covering.|$|E
25|$|In {{pre-tensioned}} concrete, the prestressing {{is achieved}} by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for <b>post-tensioned</b> <b>concrete,</b> after casting.|$|E
50|$|The current 12 {{courts were}} {{constructed}} to replace 15 previous courts {{located in the}} same place at the corner of Phillips Rd. and Cameron Blvd. The court is laid over a <b>post-tension</b> <b>concrete</b> slab which provides a medium-fast ball speed on impact.|$|R
25|$|Tao Tennis Courts - The {{courts were}} resurfaced in 2006 with <b>post-tension</b> <b>concrete</b> and were painted {{to reflect the}} school colors, red and green. The six lighted courts are red with the outer {{boundaries}} being green. The courts serve as the on-campus home to Washington University's men's and women's tennis teams.|$|R
50|$|Construction of {{the roof}} started with pouring the {{concrete}}. After the concrete finished curing, construction crews <b>post-tensioned</b> the <b>concrete</b> roof to its final strength.|$|R
25|$|In modern {{construction}} of the precast modules, there are other features to improve {{the strength of the}} structure. An example is to use prestressed strands on <b>post-tensioned</b> <b>concrete</b> for the {{construction of}} the shear walls. Another example is the use of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer to replace steel wire mesh to lighten the load and yield more corrosion resistant especially for the cold-climate areas which use salt for melting snow.|$|E

The test specimen load-deflection relationship, load-strain relationship will be produced, and the location of cracking will be shown...|$|R
50|$|The Walnut Lane Bridge {{is often}} {{confused}} with other bridges in Philadelphia {{that are similar}} in name and construction. The Walnut Street Bridge crosses the Schuylkill River and connects University City, Philadelphia and Center City, Philadelphia. The nearby Wissahickon Memorial Bridge (aka Henry Avenue Bridge), which connects the East Falls and Roxborough neighborhoods of Philadelphia, is also often mistaken for the Walnut Lane Bridge. But the bridge most often confused with the Walnut Lane Bridge is the Walnut Lane Memorial Bridge, which replaced a cast-iron bridge over the Monoshone Creek and Lincoln Drive in Philadelphia in 1950 and is world-famous as a pre-stressed, <b>post-tension</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge.|$|R

2500|$|Jacksonville's early {{predominant}} {{position as}} a regional center of business left an indelible mark on the city's skyline. Many of the earliest skyscrapers in the state were constructed in Jacksonville, dating to 1902. The city last held the state height record from 1974 to 1981. The tallest building in Downtown Jacksonville's skyline is the Bank of America Tower, constructed in 1990 as the Barnett Center. It has a height of [...] and includes 42 floors. Other notable structures include the 37-story Wells Fargo Center (with its distinctive flared base making it the defining building in the Jacksonville skyline), originally built in 1972-74 by the Independent Life and Accident Insurance Company, and the 28-floor Riverplace Tower [...] When completed in 1967, it was the tallest precast, <b>post-tensioned</b> <b>concrete</b> structure in the world.|$|E

40|$|Incorporating {{the effect}} of {{corrosion}} into the reliability analysis of a structure is of paramount importance. Since deterioration due to corrosion is uncertain over time, it should ideally be represented as a time-dependent probabilistic (i. e. stochastic) process. For a more accurate reliability analysis and failure assessment, the multi-failure mode analysis of structures is explained in this chapter. Sensitivity analysis is also discussed as {{a key part of}} reliability analysis from which {{the effect of}} different variables on service life of the structure can be investigated. Worked examples of some structures such as cast iron water mains, <b>concrete</b> sewers and <b>post-tension</b> <b>concrete</b> bridges will also be presented and the results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{understand}} the structural fire performance of two-way post-tensioned flat slabs, particularly their deformations and load-carrying mechanisms in fire, and to explore the behaviour of <b>post-tensioned</b> high-strength self-compacting <b>concrete</b> flat slabs with unbonded tendons in fire. Design/methodology/approach: Four tests of <b>post-tensioned</b> high-strength self-compacting <b>concrete</b> flat slabs were conducted under fire conditions. Numerical modelling using the commercial package ABAQUS was conducted to help interpret the test results. Findings: Two of the specimens with lower moisture contents demonstrated excellent fire resistance performance, while the others with slightly higher moisture contents experienced severe concrete spalling. Originality/value: The test results were discussed in respect of thermal profiles, deflections, crack patterns and concrete spalling. The performance of <b>post-tensioned</b> high-strength self-compacting <b>concrete</b> flat slabs with unbonded tendons under fire conditions was better understood...|$|R

50|$|Because airport {{pavement}} {{construction is}} so expensive, manufacturers aim to minimize aircraft stresses on the pavement. Manufacturers {{of the larger}} planes design landing gear so that {{the weight of the}} plane is supported on larger and more numerous tires. Attention is also paid to the characteristics of the landing gear itself, so that adverse effects on the pavement are minimized. Sometimes it is possible to reinforce a pavement for higher loading by applying an overlay of asphaltic concrete or portland cement concrete that is bonded to the original slab. <b>Post-tensioning</b> <b>concrete</b> has been developed for the runway surface. This permits the use of thinner pavements and should result in longer concrete pavement life. Because of the susceptibility of thinner pavements to frost heave, this process is generally applicable only where there is no appreciable frost action.|$|R

50|$|Dyckerhoff & Widmann AG (Dywidag) {{was founded}} in 1865 as a bridge {{construction}} company. They developed a threaded rebar system {{as a way to}} easily post-tension components in the construction of segmental bridges. This method was a great success so they continued using the technique and began selling the threadbar to other construction companies. The sales of the bar and accessories eventually trumped the revenue from the bridge construction side of the business so the company transitioned to the manufacturing and supplying of products for construction rather than being involved in bridge construction itself. DSI {{was founded in}} 1979 as a Dyckerhoff & Widmann AG subsidiary to market licences for DYWIDAG-products and systems around the world. At the beginning, DSI's focus was on construction, with a principal market focus being <b>post-tensioning</b> <b>concrete</b> and geotechnics. In 2000, DSI began to establish a second division in the underground sector. The main focus of this division is the development, production and supply of products and systems for mining and tunneling.|$|R
