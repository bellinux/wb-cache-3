40|$|While the {{fundamental}} trade-off in leaf traits related to carbon capture {{as described by}} the leaf economics spectrum is well-established among plant species, {{the relationship of the}} leaf economics spectrum to stem hydraulics is much less known. Since carbon capture and transpiration are coupled, a close connection between leaf traits and stem hydraulics should be expected. We thus asked whether xylem traits that describe drought tolerance and vulnerability to cavitation are linked to particular leaf traits. We assessed xylem vulnerability, using the <b>pressure</b> <b>sleeve</b> technique, and anatomical xylem characteristics in 39 subtropical tree species grown under common garden conditions in the BEF-China experiment and tested for correlations with traits related to the leaf economics spectrum as well as to stomatal control, including maximum stomatal conductance, vapor pressure deficit at maximum stomatal conductance and vapor pressure deficit at which stomatal conductance is down-regulated. Our results revealed that specific xylem hydraulic conductivity and cavitation resistance were closely linked to traits represented in the leaf economic spectrum, in particular to leaf nitrogen concentration, as well as to log leaf area and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio but not to any parameter of stomatal conductance. The study highlights the potential use of well-known leaf traits from the leaf economics spectrum to predict plant species' drought resistance...|$|E
40|$|A {{new tool}} is being {{developed}} to characterize tank waste at the Hanford Reservation. This tool, known as the cone penetrometer, is capable of obtaining chemical and physical properties in situ. For the past 50 years, this tool has been used extensively in soil applications and now has been modified for usage in Hanford Underground Storage tanks. These modifications include development of new ``waste`` data models as well as hardware design changes to accommodate the hazardous and radioactive environment of the tanks. The modified cone penetrometer {{is scheduled to be}} deployed at Hanford by Fall 1996. At Hanford, the cone penetrometer will be used as an instrumented pipe which measures chemical and physical properties as it pushes through tank waste. Physical data, such as tank waste stratification and mechanical properties, is obtained through three sensors measuring tip <b>pressure,</b> <b>sleeve</b> friction and pore pressure. Chemical data, such as chemical speciation, is measured using a Raman spectroscopy sensor. The sensor package contains other instrumentation as well, including a tip and side temperature sensor, tank bottom detection and an inclinometer. Once the cone penetrometer has reached the bottom of the tank, a moisture probe will be inserted into the pipe. This probe is used to measure waste moisture content, water level, waste surface moisture and tank temperature. This paper discusses the development of this new measurement system.

40|$|Times Cited: 0 Xylem {{cavitation}} resistance has profound {{implications for}} plant physiology and ecology. This process {{is characterized by}} a 'vulnerability curve' (VC) showing the variation of the percentage of cavitation as a function of xylem pressure potential. The shape of this VC varies from 'sigmoidal' to 'exponential'. This review provides a panorama of the techniques that have been used to generate such a curve. The techniques differ by (i) the way cavitation is induced (e. g. bench dehydration, centrifugation, or air injection), and (ii) the way cavitation is measured (e. g. percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) or acoustic emission), and a nomenclature is proposed based on these two methods. A survey of the literature of more than 1200 VCs was used to draw statistics on the usage of these methods and on their reliability and validity. Four methods accounted for more than 96 % of all curves produced so far: bench dehydration-PLC, centrifugation-PLC, pressure sleeve-PLC, and Cavitron. How the shape of VCs varies across techniques and species xylem anatomy was also analysed. Strikingly, {{it was found that the}} vast majority of curves obtained with the reference bench dehydration-PLC method are 'sigmoidal'. 'Exponential' curves were more typical of the three other methods and were remarkably frequent for species having large xylem conduits (ring-porous), leading to a substantial overestimation of the vulnerability of cavitation for this functional group. We suspect that 'exponential' curves may reflect an open-vessel artefact and call for more precautions with the usage of the <b>pressure</b> <b>sleeve</b> and centrifugation techniques...|$|E
50|$|Most {{downhole}} {{safety valves}} are controlled hydraulically from the surface, meaning they are opened using a hydraulic connection linked {{directly to a}} well control panel. When hydraulic pressure is applied down a control line, the hydraulic <b>pressure</b> forces a <b>sleeve</b> within the valve to slide downwards. This movement compresses a large spring and pushes the flapper downwards to open the valve. When hydraulic pressure is removed, the spring pushes the sleeve back up and causes the flapper to shut.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastroesophageal reflux is {{a common}} problem in {{premature}} infants. The {{aim of this study}} was to use a novel manometric technique to measure esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter pressures in premature infants. METHODS: Micromanometric feeding assemblies (OD, < or = 2 mm) incorporating 4 - 9 manometric channels were used in 49 studies of 27 premature neonates. Esophageal body motility was recorded at three sites for 20 minutes after feeding. Twenty attempts (one per minute) were made to stimulate swallowing via facial stimulation (Santmyer reflex). In 32 studies lower esophageal sphincter <b>pressures</b> were recorded (<b>sleeve)</b> for 15 minutes before and after feeding. RESULTS: Peristaltic motor patterns were less common than non-peristaltic motor patterns (26. 6 % vs. 73. 4 %; P < 0. 0001) that comprised 31. 1 % synchronous, 34. 6 % incomplete, and 6. 3 % retrograde pressure waves. Reflex swallowing was elicited more frequently in neonates older than 34 weeks postconceptional age than in younger infants (33. 4 % vs. 20. 4 %; P < 0. 05). Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure was 20. 5 +/- 1. 7 mm Hg before and 13. 7 +/- 1. 3 mm Hg after feeding (P < 0. 0005). CONCLUSIONS: Premature infants show nonperistaltic esophageal motility that may contribute to poor clearance of refluxed material. In contrast, the lower esophageal sphincter mechanisms seem well developed.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Current space suits {{have limited}} {{movement}} due to gas pressurization during {{exposure to the}} vacuum of space. Alternatively, if pressure is applied by an elastic garment vs. pneumatic garment to produce mechanical counter pressure (MCP), several advantages are possible. In this study, we investigate local microcirculatory and other effects produced with and without a prototype MCP glove and sleeve during exposure to varying levels of vacuum. METHODS: The entire arms of eight male volunteers were studied at normal ambient pressure and during 5 min exposures to - 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg with and without the MCP glove and <b>sleeve.</b> <b>Pressure</b> distribution, skin microvascular flow, and temperature were measured. RESULTS: The MCP glove and sleeve generated over 200 mm Hg on the middle finger, dorsum of the hand, and the wrist. However, pressure was significantly lower on the forearm and the upper arm. Without the glove and sleeve, only two of eight subjects tolerated - 100 mm Hg. Also, no subject tolerated - 150 mm Hg. However, subjects tolerated all vacuum pressures wearing the glove and sleeve. Skin microvascular flow and temperature remained within control values with the glove and sleeve at a chamber pressure of - 150 mm Hg. DISCUSSION: The MCP glove and sleeve counteracts adverse effects of vacuum exposures due to lower pressure differentials. Pressure levels over the hand and wrist {{are similar to those}} of the current U. S. space suit glove and sleeve, but additional development is required to increase MCP over the forearm and upper arm...|$|R

However, we have extremely few data concerning their physiological role in the heart contractility. The aim {{of the study was to}} estimate the mechanical function of the left atrium (LA) and PV sleeves before and early after their isolation. Materials and methods: A total of 17 patients with a mean age of 57. 4  ±  8. 3 years who underwent PVs isolation due to AF were enrolled in the study. A day before the procedure a computed tomography (CT) of the LA and PVs and dopplerography of transmitral flow were performed. During the procedure the mechanical function of the LA and PV sleeves were estimated by transesophageal echocardiography and manometry in the left heart chambers. Results: During the invasive study the patterns of the heart chambers and PV <b>sleeves</b> <b>pressure</b> were identified. These patterns confirmed the active role of the PV sleeves in LA filling and active LA relaxation during left ventricular systole. After PV isolation an alteration of transmitral blood flow and increase of LA pressure were registered. However, diastolic dysfunction was ruled out by LV manometry, thereby testifying LA mechanical function disturbance. The change in PV hemodynamics also occurred as a result of the decrease in PV sleeves contractility, revealed by manometry and paired CT scans. Conclusions: The PVs take an active part in left atrial filling by contraction of their sleeves. Antrum isolation of the PVs leads to the deterioration of their contractility and LA reservoir function...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in 10 health volunteer subjects. Continuous recordings of intraluminal esophageal pH and pressure were obtained on two consecutive nights from 6 : 00 p. m. to 6 : 30 a. m. in each subject. During each study, the subject remained recumbent, except to eat a standardized meal after 1 h of basal recording. A manometric assembly with seven recording lumens monitored: (a) lower esophageal sphincter (LES) <b>pressure</b> via a <b>sleeve</b> device 6. 5 cm in length, (b) esophageal-body motor activity, (c) swallowing activity in the pharynx, and (d) gastric pressure. An electrode 5 cm above the LES recorded esophageal pH. Sleep was monitored by electroencephalogram. All subjects showed wide variations of basal LES pressure. GER {{was not related to}} low steady-state basal LES pressure, but rather occurred during transient 5 - 30 s episodes of inappropriate complete LES relaxation. The inappropriate LES relaxations were usually either spontaneous or immediately followed appropriate sphincter relaxation induced by swallowing. The majority of GER episodes occurred within the first 3 h after eating. During the night LES relaxation and GER occurred only during transient arousals from sleep or when the subjects were fully awake, but not during stable sleep. After GER the esophagus was generally cleared of refluxed acid by primary peristalsis and less frequently by secondary peristalsis. Nonperistaltic contractions were less effective than peristalsis for clearing acid from the esophagus. We conclude that in asymptomatic recumbent subjects GER is related to transient inappropriate LES relaxations rather than to low steady-state basal LES pressure and also, that primary perstalsis is the major mechanism that clears the esophagus of refluxed material...|$|R
40|$|Transient lower esophageal {{sphincter}} relaxations (TLESRs) are {{the main}} mechanism underlying gastro-esophageal reflux and are detected during manometric studies using well defined criteria. Recently, high-resolution esophageal pressure topography (HREPT) has been introduced and is now considered as the new standard to study esophageal and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function. In this study we performed a head-to-head comparison between HREPT and conventional sleeve manometry {{for the detection of}} TLESRs. A setup with two synchronized MMS-solar systems was used. A solid state HREPT catheter, a water-perfused sleeve catheter, and a multi intraluminal impedance pH (MII-pH) catheter were introduced in 10 healthy volunteers (M 6 F 4, age 19 - 56). Subjects were studied 0. 5 h before and 3 h after ingestion of a standardized meal. Tracings were blinded and analyzed by the three authors according to the TLESR criteria. In the HREPT mode 156 TLESRs were scored, vs 143 during sleeve manometry (P = 0. 10). Hundred and twenty-three TLESRs were scored by both techniques. Of all TLESRs (177), 138 were associated with reflux (78 %). High-resolution esophageal pressure topography detected significantly more TLESRs associated with a reflux event (132 vs 119, P = 0. 015) resulting in a sensitivity for detection of TLESRs with reflux of 96 % compared to 86 % respectively. Analysis of the discordant TLESRs associated with reflux showed that TLESRs were missed by sleeve manometry due to low basal LES pressure (N = 5), unstable pharyngeal signal (N = 4), and residual <b>sleeve</b> <b>pressure</b> > 2 mmHg (N = 10). The HREPT is superior to sleeve manometry for the detection of TLESRs associated with reflux. However, rigid HREPT criteria are awaite...|$|R
50|$|On December 12, {{the second}} attempt {{to launch a}} {{complete}} Titan (Missile C-2) took place at LC-16. One pad umbilical failed to detach at ignition, and an automatic shutoff signal terminated thrust before the missile could be released by the launcher mechanism. Ground crews quickly repaired the umbilical, and a second launch attempt was made two days later. Their relief at having avoided certain disaster on December 12 was short-lived when the Titan exploded {{almost as soon as}} it was released by the launcher mechanism. The mishap was quickly traced to the Range Safety destruct charges on the first stage inadvertently going off, as Martin technicians had moved the activator relay into a vibration-prone area during repair work on the missile. Testing confirmed that the shock from the pad hold-down bolts firing was enough to set off the relay. Because the RSO charges had spilled out the propellants and minimized mixing of them, the explosion was not as powerful as that of Titan B-5, and so damage to LC-16 was less extensive. The pad was repaired in only two months. On February 2, 1960, LC-19 returned to action as Missile B-7 marked the first successful flight of a Titan with a live upper stage. On February 5, LC-16 returned to action by hosting Missile C-4. The second attempt at a Lot C Titan failed at T+52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed, causing the RVX-3 reentry vehicle to separate. The missile pitched down and the first stage LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads, blowing the stage to pieces. After the first stage destroyed itself, the second stage separated and began engine ignition, sensing that normal staging had taken place. With no attitude control, it began tumbling end-over-end and quickly lost thrust. The stage plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean some 30-40 miles downrange. After the successful flight of Missile G-4 on February 24, Missile C-1's second stage failed to ignite on March 8 due to a stuck valve preventing the gas generator from starting. On July 1, the newly opened LC-20 hosted its first launch when Missile J-2, an operational prototype, was flown. Unfortunately, a broken hydraulic line caused the Titan's engines to gimbal hard left almost as soon as the tower was cleared. The missile pitched over and flew onto a near-horizontal plane when Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+11 seconds. The burning remains of the Titan impacted 300 meters from the pad in an enormous fireball. The piece of plumbing responsible for the missile failure was retrieved—it had popped out of its sleeve resulting in loss of first stage hydraulic <b>pressure.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> was not tight enough to hold the hydraulic line in place, and the pressure being imparted into it at liftoff was enough to pop it loose. Examination of other Titan missiles found more defective hydraulic lines, and the Missile J-2 debacle caused a wholesale review of manufacturing processes and improved parts testing.|$|R
40|$|Although {{ultraviolet}} (UV) disinfection {{of drinking}} water {{has been shown to}} be effective and cost efficient, one barrier to more widespread adoption is uncertainty surrounding the possible accumulation of fouling materials on quartz surfaces within UV reactors. These quartz surfaces serve as protection for the UV lamps that are immersed in the water being treated, and in many cases they can become coated with precipitated minerals and impacted particles that limit the transmission of germicidal UV radiation from the lamp into the water that is to be treated. While much of the past research on the subject of quartz fouling in UV systems has investigated the formation of foulants in reactors treating wastewater, differences in reactor geometry, lamp type, and water chemistry between these scenarios and drinking water treatment applications makes it difficult to understand how past research may apply to drinking water. Currently, there is limited information available about the chemical composition, rate of formation, and means of predicting the formation of the foulant materials that accumulate. ^ Laboratory and field experiments were conducted at several locations to investigate the relationship between water chemistry and foulant composition, formation, and UV absorbance characteristics. Low Pressure High Output (LPHO) lamp sleeves in a parallel flow configuration were examined for metals accumulation, UV transmittance, and rate of accumulation, and models of solution chemistry were used to understand the formation of mineral species. Zero order kinetics for foulant accumulation were consistently observed. Medium <b>Pressure</b> (MP) lamp <b>sleeves</b> were utilized in a perpendicular flow reactor configuration disinfecting a surface water to determine variations in fouling that can occur when reactor geometry and higher UV intensities are used. Regression modeling was utilized to develop an understanding of the absorbance characteristics of foulant components, and iron and calcium were found to be primary contributors to radiation absorption of germicidal UV radiation by fouled lamp sleeves. Comparisons of foulant buildup and fouling effects among multiple groundwater based treatment facilities highlighted the impact of treatment steps that cause changes in oxidation reduction potential, mineral solubility, and fouling rate. ...|$|R
40|$|Abdominal aortic aneurysms are a focal {{dilation}} of the aorta {{which can}} be potentially life threatening if left untreated. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a noninvasive treatment that can reduce the mortality rate {{when compared to the}} standard open repair. Yet, EVAR is associated with other complications that can arise such as migration, endoleaks, or device related failures. These complications drive the need for reinterventions which have been shown to occur more frequently with EVAR than with open repair. The long term fixation and sealing characteristics of these devices is likely related to the nature of its apposition to the aortic wall. Currently there is little understanding of these mechanics and factors in how the device performs at the time of deployment. A computational model that reflects the compressive nature of an endovascular graft is beneficial in investigating these mechanics. The aims of the study are; 1) formulate an experimental methodology that captures the radial compressive nature of the stent graft, 2) develop a parameterized finite element model of the stent structure, and 3) compare the compressive behavior this model against the acquired experimental data. A 2 mil polyethylene sleeve was used to transfer a compressive vacuum <b>pressure</b> from the <b>sleeve</b> onto 10 independent stent grafts. The loading-unloading pressure was cycled from 0 to - 50 mmHg (complete collapse) over 5 minutes. A pressure transducer and optical micrometer were used to capture the vacuum pressure and diameter relationship. All ten grafts compressed in a similar elliptical shape configuration. Commercial software was leveraged to construct a parameterized model of the stent geometry. All crest and trough vertex locations of the sinusoidal stent structure were validated within 1 mm of a measured value. A dynamic quasi-static computational simulation was completed that included large deformations and contact between the sleeve and stent as well as self-contact in the sleeve. Our results show that the model is representative of the experiments and can be used to interrogate how a stent graft will perform during certain stages of deployment and immediately after deployment with some caution in regard to the stated limitations...|$|R
40|$|Prolonged {{recordings}} of esophageal motility {{have shown that}} dynamic changes of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure such as transient LES relaxation and LES pressure drifts {{are the most common}} mechanisms underlying gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The coexistence of a delayed gastric emptying has also been reported in a high proportion of patients with reflux disease. However, not much information is available on the effects of antireflux therapy on the pathogenetic mechanisms of GER. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine in a group of children with severe reflux disease the effect of omeprazole therapy on motor changes of LES underlying GER as well as on gastric emptying time. Twenty-two children (median age: 6. 6 years) with GER disease, refractory to combined ranitidine and cisapride administration, entered into an eight-week omeprazole course. Ten subjects with moderate GER disease served as controls (median age: 6. 0 years). Before and after omeprazole administration, the following variables were assessed: esophagitis grading, fasting and fed simultaneous prolonged recording of distal esophageal sphincter <b>pressure</b> (with a <b>sleeve</b> catheter) and intraesophageal pH, LES and esophageal peristalsis amplitude, and gastric emptying time of a mixed solid-liquid meal (measured with gastric ultrasound). As compared to controls, patients showed a higher rate of transient LES relaxation and LES pressure drift (P < 0. 01), a reduced amplitude of basal sphincter pressure (P < 0. 01) and peristalsis (P < 0. 05), and a more prolonged gastric emptying time (P < 0. 05). After ending omeprazole, there was no significant change in any of the motor abnormalities of the esophagus and in gastric emptying time despite a marked improvement of symptoms and esophagitis in all patients. Sixteen patients were symptomatic when reevaluated on a clinical basis two months after ending therapy. We conclude that in children with severe GER disease, an abnormally high rate of both transient LES relaxation and LES pressure drift and slow gastric emptying are not affected by omperazole treatment, even though esophageal mucosal damage is markedly improved or cured. These abnormalities represent a primary motor disorder and can be implicated in the refractoriness of reflux disease...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{displacement}} {{of oil from}} reservoir rock pore spaces {{is a function of}} many interacting variables, amongst which the reservoir wetting state {{has been shown to be}} one of the important affected by the rock lithology, oil chemistry and brine salinity. A finding from previous research says that the injection brine into oil saturated core plug increased oil recovery. Based on this the objective of this master thesis is to investigate the effect of brine concentration on flow properties in two types of carbonate rocks for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) through imbibition and water flooding processes. The methodology used to evaluate the effect of brine concentration (BC) and chemical composition (CC) for oil recovery consisted on two stages. The first stage covers the literature review regarding the effect of brine concentration and chemical composition, including carbonates (chalk and limestone) characteristics. The second stage is related to the laboratory experiment which was performed using n-Decane oil, six (6) brines with different concentrations and chemical composition and the six (6) core plugs where four (4) &# 147;chalks&# 148; from Ekofisk (Norway) and the other two (2) &# 147;limestones&# 148; from Iranian field. The experiment was carried out in the laboratory of Institute of Petroleum and Technology (IPT), the materials, chemicals products, apparatus and equipments, methodology and procedures were provided by the IPT laboratory. To carry out the laboratory experiments, initially the two cores from Iranian were cleaned before being used. Different properties of brines, cores and oil were measured using different methods and procedures; and results were computed. Next, each core was saturated with one type of brine and after that flooded by n-Decane oil for establishment of initial water saturation and determination of volume of oil produced by drainage process at room temperature conditions at one bar. After that, all cores were aging about 15 days at room temperature condition. Finally, each core was flooded using brine by imbibition process at room temperature conditions. Results achieved were computed and discussed based on the literature review and compared with &# 147;A salinity (AS) Ekofisk core reference case&# 148; and similar studies. From this study was observed that the matrix block has a high porosity. The average porosity was about 40. 24 % of the volumes of large pores. The average absolute permeability was about 3. 73 mD which is low because the microporous dominate the pore network. The average brine density (&# 961;) was about 1. 026 g/cm 3 and pH was about 7. 25. The initial water saturation varies between 14. 58 to 28. 50 % and residual oil saturation among 22. 49 to 62 %. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>pressure</b> in the cylinder was kept from 15 to 28 bar. During waterfloodig was observed that the breakthrough pressure drop and time to increases when the oil recovery increase. The highest original oil in place (OOIP) was achieved in the low salinity (LS) core which was about 68. 46 % and the lowest was recorded in the C salinity (CS) core which was around 26. 71 %. The reason of the high and the low recovery is related with the effect of brine concentration and chemical composition of Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium and Sulphate, added in the solution. The main driving mechanism for low salinity waterflooding is believed to be multi component ionic exchange made possible by the expansion of electrical double layer. The permeability and porosity of the cores can be pointed as other factor. In general, it was showen that there is an increase in oil recovery as the salinity decreases. </p...|$|R
