Some relevant theory and introductory concepts are presented using practical examples and two running case studies. The book also describes in detail how to perform health economic evaluations using the R package BCEA (Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis). BCEA can be used to post-process the results of a Bayesian cost-effectiveness model and perform advanced analyses producing standardised and highly customisable outputs. It presents all the features of the package, including its many functions and their practical application, as well as its user-friendly web interface.

Programs to foster faculty development related to scholarship {{should be part of}} a school’s overall strategic plan. Methods: This article presents a description of a faculty development program with outcomes regarding scholarship for a five year period. The Boyer model of scholarship was used as a framework to assess resources and also served as a guide for program development. The program was tailored to faculty needs and targeted specific aspects of Boyer’s domains; strategies were developed which promoted faculty growth in these areas. Specific activities were planned and implemented to accomplish the overall outcome of increasing faculty scholarship and create a research culture in the school. Results: The scholarship of discovery was a major area identified for faculty growth. The program goal of increasing faculty scholarship was achieved by {{an increase in the number}} of presentations, publications and funded projects for the faculty in the school over a five year period. Conclusions: Using the Boyer model as a framework  assisted faculty in achieving a more positive view of their scholarship, facilitated <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> meaningful <b>dossiers</b> for promotion and tenure decisions, and contributed to knowledge development in the discipline.  </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{functioning}} of the French committees for the protection of people in biomedical research (CCPPRB). DESIGN: An independent evaluator visited all of the committees and analyzed their functioning by assessing the annual activity reports, filling data grids and observing the committees in session. RESULTS: We observed that the representation of a range of professions, which is required by law, was not always respected. This was partly because the administrative authority had accumulated delays in nominating members. Another explanation could be the absence of remuneration for the work and attendance of the members. There was considerable inter-committee variation concerning the way documents were distributed to the members during sessions and the extent of investigator and promoter involvement. Finally, large differences in the number <b>of</b> <b>dossiers</b> handled between committees led us to investigate the fairness <b>of</b> <b>dossier</b> distribution, as the number <b>of</b> <b>dossiers</b> dealt with has consequences, particularly for the finality of the opinions of the committees.
