40|$|Cyclically {{adjusted}} government <b>budget</b> <b>balances</b> {{have become}} increasingly popular {{as a means of}} analysing the fiscal situation and changes in policy that result from the intentional actions of the government. As the actual <b>budget</b> <b>balances</b> are affected both by cyclical factors ('automatic stabilisers') and structural ('discretionary') measures, they may not, in general, be very useful when seeking to assess the orientation of underlying fiscal policy and possible structural imbalances in the <b>budget</b> <b>balance.</b> The problem however {{is that there is no}} generally accepted method of calculating cyclically adjusted (structural) <b>budget</b> <b>balances.</b> The results tend to be fairly noisy and sensitive to the method of calculation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore budget {{planning}} in the euro area countries in 2004 - 2014. Our analyses are based on annual real-time data from the IMF World Economic Outlook publications. As forecasts made by different institutions are strongly correlated, our dataset reasonably reflects information available for policy makers in real-time. We examine whether real-time forecasts of overall <b>budget</b> <b>balance,</b> real GDP growth and output gap have been systematically biased. We also analyse forecast accuracy of potential output growth, which we construct using different vintages of real-time data. Our results indicate systematic biases in forecasts. Further, we study how real-time macroeconomic conditions affect budget planning. For comparison, we also consider how ex post economic conditions and ex post <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> developments are related. We find robust evidence of mean reversion in <b>budget</b> <b>balances,</b> in both real-time and revised data. Mean reversion is related only to negative <b>budget</b> <b>balances,</b> and it is systematically stronger with respect to revised information. Finally, we analyse errors in <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> forecasts. We provide robust evidence that revisions to current <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> have contributed to errors in <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> forecasts. We also find that forecasted macroeconomic conditions (potential output growth and real GDP growth) and their revisions have affected errors in <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> forecasts.

40|$|Government {{balances}} {{are often}} adjusted {{for changes in}} economic activity in order to draw {{a clearer picture of}} the underlying fiscal situation and to use this as a guide to fiscal policy analysis. International organisations estimate the cyclical component of economic activity by the current level of the output gap. Using elasticities of tax and public expenditures to GDP, they compute the cyclical part of <b>budget</b> <b>balance.</b> The structural <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> is defined as the remainder. Our approach is different, as it rests on the estimation of a bivariate VAR. Variables used are the <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> in percents of GDP, and the annual rate of growth of GDP. The structural part of the <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> is defined as the one which would have occurred had GDP never deviated from its trend. Hence, past business cycles affect the cyclical part of the <b>budget</b> <b>balance,</b> contrary to what more traditional methods assume. In our method, systematic cyclical policies de facto affect the cyclical balance. Our estimated changes in structural balances are consistent with previous methods, given the fairly large standard errors. However, these methods yield significantly different predictions at the peaks and troughs of business cycles : according to our method, structural balances consolidated by more in 1990 - 1991 and deteriorated by more in 1994 - 1995. fiscal policy, VAR, cycles, structural <b>budget</b> <b>balance...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{develop an}} empirical model for fiscal policy in Norway. An {{important feature of}} the methodology is to derive and model {{the changes in the}} primary <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> that comes from changes in the economy (induced changes) and changes in fiscal policy (discretionary changes). This decomposition of the changes in the <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> draws heavily on Braconier and Holden (1999) and (2001). The motivation for this work, besides a wish to understand the workings and nature of fiscal policy, is to endogenise fiscal policy for implementation in empirical macroeconomic models. My approach is to identify and explain the variations in a fiscal policy indicator. The traditional indicators of fiscal policy in Norway are the Non-oil Cyclically Adjusted net of Interest Payments (FIN) produced by The Norwegian Ministry of Finance, and the Cyclically Adjusted <b>Budget</b> <b>Balance</b> (CAB) produced by the OECD. In section 2 I deßne induced and discretionary changes in the <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> and thereby derive the Braconier-Holden Indicator (BHI). Their approach is to decompose the changes in the <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> into what they call induced and discretionary changes (where the latter is interpreted as the ßscal policy indicator). A description of induced and discretionary changes in ßscal policy can be summarized as follows: i) Induced changes: Changes in the <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> following from àuctuations in economic variables such as variations in tax bases, changes in unemployment and potential growth. Variation in these variables induce changes in tax revenues and public expenditures. ii) Discretionary changes: Changes in the <b>budget</b> <b>balance</b> due to ßscal policy decisions.
