500|$|Following its <b>premature</b> <b>release</b> on the Web, {{the music}} video for [...] "You and I" [...] met with {{positive}} reviews. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone felt the video was {{an improvement over}} her earlier videos, Judas and The Edge of Glory, saying, [...] "the best moments of the video put a distinctly Gaga-ish spin on the iconography of Americana and traditional love stories." [...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard wrote the video has: [...] "torture contraptions, mermaid sex, a wedding, bondage in a barn, an ice cream truck, and to top it all off, 'Children of the Corn' and religious overtones thrown in for good measure," [...] and thought [...] the video setting was the strangest representation of Nebraska. Leah Collins of Dose felt the video was a [...] "great opportunity for the singer to finally find out what it's like to make out with herself." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted of the scene in which Gaga plays a piano in a cornfield beside her male alter ego: [...] "She's just Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, playing a piano {{in the middle of}} a corn field—with a little making out on the side, of course." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV News believed that Gaga was not joking when she talked about the video being about the [...] "torture" [...] of being away from the one you love. [...] "And, man, based on the bruising final product, she wasn't kidding," [...] Kaufman concluded.|$|E
500|$|Their {{legs are}} long, the hind pair well adapted for jumping; a flea can jump {{vertically}} up to 7in (18cm) and horizontally up to 13in (33cm), making the flea {{one of the}} best jumpers of all known animals (relative to body size), second only to the froghopper. [...] The flea jump is so rapid and forceful that it exceeds the capabilities of muscle, and instead of relying on direct muscle power, fleas store muscle energy in a pad of the elastic protein named resilin before releasing it rapidly (like a human using a bow and arrow). [...] Immediately before the jump, muscles contract and deform the resilin pad, slowly storing energy which can then be released extremely rapidly to power leg extension for propulsion. [...] To prevent <b>premature</b> <b>release</b> of energy or motions of the leg, the flea employs a [...] "catch mechanism". [...] Early in the jump, the tendon of the primary jumping muscle passes slightly behind the coxa-trochanter joint, generating a torque which holds the joint closed with the leg close to the body. [...] To trigger jumping, another muscle pulls the tendon forward until it passes the joint axis, generating the opposite torque to extend the leg and power the jump by release of stored energy. The actual take off has been shown by high-speed video to be from the tibiae and tarsi rather than from the trochantera (knees).|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{responding}} to the outgoing console generation's technical restrictions with code optimization and a tight release {{near the end of}} the consoles' life cycle, the team decided to focus on the eighth generation with more time to try new ideas. Zampella announced that Respawn would show at E3 2013 via Twitter on February 25, 2013. Their planned announcement leaked early through the <b>premature</b> <b>release</b> of Game Informers July 2013 issue on Google Play, which revealed their first game's title, premise, and release date. Other advance public information included the company's trademark filing for [...] "Titan" [...] in April 2013, and an April 2013 Kotaku report of the game's Titan mech gameplay and Xbox One exclusivity. The game was officially announced during Microsoft's E3 2013 press conference, with expected Windows PC, Xbox 360, and Xbox One releases in Q1 2014. The Xbox 360 version was announced as in development with Respawn's support at another studio, though Bluepoint Games was not announced as the studio until January 2014. Electronic Arts CFO Blake Jorgensen later added that the Microsoft exclusivity agreement would last [...] "for the life of the title", such that other consoles, including the PlayStation 4, will not receive a Titanfall port. In February 2014, Zampella tweeted that Respawn was discussing an OS X port for release some time after launch. The team's small size—less than a quarter of similar triple A studios—also contributed to the game's exclusivity.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{potential}} of wet granulation of ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) material was evaluated to assess the risk of <b>premature</b> drug <b>release</b> during processing and to improve the bulk powder flow properties and compactibility {{for the development of}} an immediate release oral dosage form. The poorly water soluble model compounds, itraconazole, fenofibrate, naproxen, and ibuprofen were loaded into the model OMS, COK- 12, and granulated using a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) binder solution. Preliminary assessments were made with itraconazole loaded COK- 12 to study the effects of the initial drug load, binder concentration, binder addition rate, and granulation temperature on <b>premature</b> drug <b>release.</b> Comparison to pure COK- 12 revealed particle size enlargement and enhanced powder flow based on Carr Index and Hausner Ratio results. Following compression to 120 MPa, the compactibility of the granulated material also improved when compared to the untreated COK- 12. In vitro release of itraconazole from the compressed granulated material was assessed with and without the disintegrant, croscarmellose sodium. Incorporation of 2. 4 wt. croscarmellose sodium prior to compression successfully recovered the slight release loss following compression. To assess <b>premature</b> drug <b>release,</b> developments made with itraconazole loaded COK- 12 were applied to loaded fenofibrate, naproxen, and ibuprofen. Results from modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) indicated that the risk of <b>premature</b> drug <b>release</b> during wet granulation was primarily compound dependent. These findings highlight challenges in preparation for a successful manufacturing process of OMS based formulations. status: publishe...|$|R

500|$|However, {{by spring}} 2009, Kennedy's tumor had spread and {{treatments}} for it {{were no longer}} effective, although this was not disclosed to the public. By June 2009 Kennedy had not cast a Senate vote in three months, and his health had forced him to retreat to Massachusetts, where he was undergoing another round of chemotherapy. In his absence, <b>premature</b> <b>release</b> of his health committee's expansive plan resulted in a poor public reception. Kennedy's friend Chris Dodd had taken over his role on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, but Republican senators and other observers said {{that the lack of}} Kennedy's physical presence had resulted in less consultation with them and was making successful negotiation more difficult. Democrats also missed Kennedy's ability to smooth divisions on the health proposals. Kennedy did cut a television commercial for Dodd, who was struggling early on in his 2010 re-election bid. In July, HBO began showing a documentary tribute to Kennedy's life, Teddy: In His Own Words. A health care reform bill was voted out of the committee with content Kennedy favored, but still faced a long, difficult process before having a chance at becoming law. At the end of July 2009, Kennedy was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He could not attend the ceremony to receive this medal, and attended a private service but not the public funeral when his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver died at age 88 in mid-August. By the end, Kennedy was in a wheelchair and had difficulty speaking, but consistently said that [...] "I've had a wonderful life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mazda and NSU {{signed a}} study {{contract}} {{to develop the}} Wankel engine in 1961 and competed to bring the first Wankel-powered automobile to market. Although Mazda produced an experimental Wankel that year, NSU was first with a Wankel automobile for sale, the sporty NSU Spider in 1964; Mazda countered with a display of two- and four-rotor Wankel engines at that year's Tokyo Motor Show. In 1967, NSU began production of a Wankel-engined luxury car, the Ro 80. However, NSU had not produced reliable apex seals on the rotor, unlike Mazda and Curtiss-Wright. NSU had problems with apex seals' wear, poor shaft lubrication, and poor fuel economy, leading to frequent engine failures, not solved until 1972, which led to large warranty costs curtailing further NSU Wankel engine development. This <b>premature</b> <b>release</b> of the new Wankel engine gave a poor reputation for all makes and even when these issues were solved in the last engines produced by NSU {{in the second half}} of the '70s, sales did not recover. Audi, after the takeover of NSU, built in 1979 a new KKM 871 engine with side intake ports and 750 cc per chamber, [...] at 6,500 rpm, and 220 Nm at 3,500 rpm. The engine was installed in an Audi 100 hull named [...] "Audi 200", but was not mass-produced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{release of}} KDE 4.0 {{was met with}} a mixed reception. While early adopters were {{tolerant}} {{of the lack of}} finish for some of its new features, the release was widely criticized {{because of a lack of}} stability and its [...] "beta" [...] quality. Computerworld reporter Steven Vaughan-Nichols criticised KDE 4.0 and KDE 4.1 and called for a fork of KDE 3.5 by rebuilding it on top of Qt4. The same reporter later praised KDE 4.3 and welcomed the KDE 3.5 continuation project Trinity. Although Linus Torvalds switched from GNOME to KDE on December 2005, he switched back to GNOME after Fedora replaced KDE 3.5 with 4.0. In an interview with Computerworld, he described KDE 4.0 as a [...] "break everything" [...] model and [...] "half-baked" [...] release, claiming that he expected it to be an upgrade of KDE 3.5, when the reality was that there were significant cases of features being regressed due to its extensive changes. (Torvalds did point out, however, that he understood why the developers in charge of the KDE project had chosen to make such drastic changes to the desktop environment in KDE 4.0 and the reason for its <b>premature</b> <b>release,</b> and that his criticism was more on the way KDE 4.0 was pushed out to the public.) Despite the criticism, reviewers such as Ars Technica’s Ryan Paul noted that the visual style [...] "is very attractive and easy on the eyes" [...] and [...] "exhibits a relatively high level of polish" [...] and that [...] "the underlying technologies still have a lot of very serious potential".|$|E
30|$|For {{both the}} PLA NPs/FITC-MMC-SPC and PLA NPs/FITC-MMC, the green {{fluorescence}} {{was presented in}} the cell. This finding {{was similar to the}} reported work[46]. It was also reported that the <b>premature</b> <b>released</b> FITC or FITC-MMC could be not internalized by the cells[37]. To the result, we proposed two possible reasons, one was that the intracellular drug release and transport played a dominate role. A part of drug was released from the NPs and transported inside the cells. Alternatively, the other one was that the intracellular drug accumulation and diffusion played a main role. A high nuclear accumulation of FITC-labeled MMC resulted in the subsequent diffusion to other cytoplasmic areas. Regardless of either mechanism, the result confirmed that the drug delivered to the nuclei resulted from the effective cellular uptake, followed by the efficient intracellular internalization and accumulation of drug.|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) technique is a promising tool that improves cancer detection, facilitates diagnosis and monitors therapeutic effects. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) have emerged as MRI contrast agents for tumor imaging and as potential vectors for targeted anti-cancer drug delivery; nevertheless, the application of SPIOs has been hampered {{due to a lack}} of specificity to tumor tissues and <b>premature</b> drug <b>release.</b> This project aims at developing multifunctional SPIOs for both cancer imaging and targeted drug delivery via conjugation of tumor specific antibodies with SPIOs. The application of anti-TAG- 72 antibodies as tumor targeting modalities was evaluated in cultured colorectal cancer cells and in xenograft models by using fluorescent imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. It was demonstrated that antibody-labeled SPIOs were superior imaging agents and drug carriers for increased tumor specificity. The regulation and kinetics of intracellular drug release from SPIOs were explored by means of fluorescence imaging. In vitro and in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging was employed to investigate the mechanisms of <b>premature</b> drug <b>release</b> from nanocarriers. The large volume and high hydrophobicity of cell membranes were found to play an important role in <b>premature</b> drug <b>release.</b> The encapsulation of SPIOs into nanocarriers decreased drug release in a dose-dependent mode.

40|$|Intracellular Local Ca {{releases}} (LCRs) from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) regulate {{cardiac pacemaker}} cell function by activation of electrogenic Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) during diastole. Prior studies demonstrated {{the existence of}} powerful compensatory mechanisms of LCR regulation via a complex local cross-talk of Ca pump, release and NCX. One major obstacle to study these mechanisms is that LCR exhibit complex Ca release propagation patterns (including merges and separations) {{that have not been}} characterized. Here we developed new terminology, classification, and computer algorithms for automatic detection of numerically simulated LCRs and examined LCR regulation by SR Ca pumping rate (Pup) that provides a major contribution to fight-or-flight response. In our simulations the faster SR Ca pumping accelerates action potential-induced Ca transient decay and quickly clears Ca under the cell membrane in diastole, preventing <b>premature</b> <b>releases.</b> Then the SR generates an earlier, more synchronized, and stronger diastolic LCR signal activating an earlier and larger inward NCX current. LCRs at higher Pup exhibit larger amplitudes and faster propagation with more collisions to each other. The LCRs overlap with Ca transient decay, causing an elevation of the average diastolic [Ca] nadir to ~ 200 nM (at Pup = 24 mM/s). Background Ca (in locations lacking LCRs) quickly decays to resting Ca levels (< 100 nM) at high Pup, but remained elevated during slower decay at low Pup. Release propagation is facilitated at higher Pup by a larger LCR amplitude, whereas at low Pup by higher background Ca. While at low Pup LCRs show smaller amplitudes, their larger durations and sizes combined with longer transient decay stabilize integrals of diastolic Ca and NCX current signals. Thus, the local interplay of SR Ca pump and release channels regulates LCRs and Ca transient decay to insure fail-safe pacemaker cell operation within a wide range of rates...|$|R
