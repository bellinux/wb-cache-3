50|$|He was {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} Jostle IV radio jammer - the most powerful jammer device used over Europe. At 2 kW output it could block all VHF transmissions over 32-48 MHz. However, enclosed in its own <b>pressurised</b> <b>container,</b> (to prevent arcing of the high voltages inside), it was large and took up the entirety of the bomb bay of the Boeing Fortresses used by No. 100 Group RAF. Due to the high transmitter power, test flights had to be carried out in the vicinity of Iceland, otherwise the jamming would have blanked out all frequencies in the specified range over a large area, as well as giving the Germans warning of the impending arrival of a jamming system.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a recent}} {{interview}} with The Food Channel (aired on 16 August 2011), Thibault also referred to murri cuisine as [...] "Fossilised Food (notably different from the fossilised American braising technique)" [...] because of the raw nature of its treatment. Similar to the Sous Vide technique utilised in French cuisine, murri cooking requires all ingredients to be cooked in an air-tight <b>pressurised</b> <b>container</b> for extremely long periods of time, rendering them close in texture to soft fossils. When presented, every ingredient must also retain its original form, most notably in chunks and particles. Vegetables, roasted and ground to powder, act as the main garnishing on the plate, assuming the likeness of fecund earth to complement {{the appearance of the}} meats. [...] "The aim is to present the best of Mother Earth, in close to what we are used to seeing, the soil, leaves, ocean and sky. That is when we form a connection with the universe."

5000|$|The {{counter measure}} to radio {{navigation}} was jamming. R. V. Jones was the MI6 science advisor and TRE staff {{worked closely with}} him, in countering the Luftwaffe's navigational beam technology to hamper the enemy's ability to do pinpoint night bombing raids {{in what has become}} known as the [...] "battle of the beams". Robert Cockburn of the TRE was responsible {{for the development of the}} Jostle IV radio jammer - the most powerful jammer device used over Europe. At 2 kW output it could block all VHF transmissions over 32-48 MHz.

40|$|In this study, {{the basic}} {{engineering}} principles, goals, and constraints are all combined to fuzzy methodology {{and applied to}} design of optimally <b>pressurised</b> <b>containers</b> emphasising the ecological and durability merits of various materials. The present fuzzy heuristics approach is derivable from generalisation of conventional analytical optimisation method into fuzzy multitechnical tasks. In the present approach, first the goals and constraints of the end-user are identified. Then decision variables are expressed as functions of the design variables. Their desirable ranges and biases are defined using the same fuzzy satisfaction function form. The optimal result has highest total satisfaction. These are then checked and fine-tuned by finite element method FEM. The optimal solution is the ecoplastic vessel, and aluminium was close. The method reveals that optimum depends strongly on the preset goals {{and values of the}} producer, society, and end-user...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Various {{hypotheses}} {{have been introduced}} to explain disintegration of the continuous liquid phase into individual droplets leading to spray formation in pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs). In a practicable system, the liquid formulation to be discharged from the <b>pressurised</b> <b>container</b> needs to be nucleated to ensure spray generation. Nucleation {{can be described as}} the generation of a nucleus of the vapour phase within the bulk liquid. As a stable nucleus is formed, it grows significantly and then detaches from its nucleation site to move upwards in the liquid phase. In our research, the effects of various parameters on the nucleation of HFA 227 was analysed with the aim of gaining a better understanding of bubble formation and the nucleation process in HFA propellants, including the surface geometrical properties, actuator orifice size and the mass flow rate through the orifice. Other important factors influencing the nucleation process that were considered comprised the viscosity and surface tension of the formulation, thermodynamic state variables including temperature, pressure and degree of superheat. The results highlighted the effect of surface imperfections on the rate of nucleation and bubble growth. A comparison of two different orifice sizes was made and a significant change in the shape and motion of the bubbles was observed. An intense nucleation was also observed at higher mass flow rate of HFA 227 through the valve. It is anticipated that recognising the factors affecting nucleation and bubble growth of HFA 227 may lead to potential routes of influencing the medical aerosol generation mechanism inside the pMDI and control the fine particle size distribution...|$|E
40|$|German {{researchers}} have engineered a movable trolley cart for an aircraft galley (kitchen) {{that can provide}} supplementary onboard power. The unit was developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology ICT in collaboration with Diehl Aerospace GmbH and the DLR German Aerospace Center, and made its debut at the recent Paris Air Show in France. Airplanes are built for several decades in service, but cabin furnishings and the galleys are renovated {{many times over the}} aircraft lifetime. This means that obsolete equipment is replaced by new, more power-hungry equipment. An auxiliary power unit supplies the required power when the main engines are not running, such as during boarding. But when new electrical loads are added in the passenger cabin, the entire aircraft power system has to be re-approved, because new devices could disrupt or even paralyse the power supply. This project has demonstrated a supplementary galley power unit, {{in the form of a}} movable trolley cart utilising using PEM fuel cells. Researchers at the ICT-IMM branch of the Fraunhofer ICT in Mainz engineered the system in partnership with the DLR German Aerospace Center and Diehl Aerospace GmbH, a joint venture between Diehl Aerosystems in Germany and French-based Thales. The work was conducted under the DIANA project within Diehl Aerospace's DACAPO (Distributed Autonomous Cabin Power) concept. The core of the innovative trolley is the fuel processor developed by Fraunhofer ICT-IMM, which comprises a reformer, integrated evaporator and superheater, and other components. The system uses liquid propylene glycol (3 H 8 O 2), which does not require a <b>pressurised</b> <b>container,</b> becomes non-flammable when mixed with water, and is non-toxic. It is already being used in aircraft as a coolant and de-icing agent. The reformer also transforms byproduct CO into non-toxic CO 2. Fraunhofer researchers engineered the necessary catalysts, and ensured that the device takes up a minimal amount of precious onboard space. The cart can even facilitate the re-approval process, since it does not need new approval every time the airplane gets a retrofit or a face-lift. The research team has produced a mockup of the reformer, and they will assemble and test the first working prototype over the next few months. Last year Diehl Aerospace was granted a patent (US 8814086) for an aircraft onboard power supply system and galley that utilises a combination of low- and high-temperature PEM fuel cells to produce power and heat [FCB, January 2015, p 16]...|$|E

The lamp (made in approx. 1914) burned vaporised paraffin; the vaporiser was heated by a methylated spirit burner to light. When lit, {{some of the}} vaporised fuel was diverted to a Bunsen burner to keep the vaporiser warm and the fuel in vapour form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air; the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so. This in turn <b>pressurised</b> the paraffin <b>container</b> to force the fuel to the lamp.

40|$|The fully {{automated}} in-situ measuring system SIOUX (Stratospheric Observation Unit for nitrogen oXides) {{has been developed}} and established under flight conditions. SIOUX is a two channel measuring device designed for the high-altitude research aircraft M 55 -Geophysica to record reactive nitrogen oxides in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Channel A detects nitric oxide (NO) and channel B the total reactive nitrogen (NO_y), which is reduced to NO {{on the surface of}} a heated gold-converter in conjunction with carbon monoxide (CO) as reducing agent. The technique used for the measurement of NO is chemiluminescence. The detection limit of channel A is 6 pmol/mol and of channel B 10 pmol/mol for an integration time of 1 s. The main components of SIOUX are the sample inlet, the detector incorporating the reaction chambers, photomultipliers and ozone generators, the converter, a pumping system, a calibration/operation gas system and the data recording unit. Except for the sample inlet all components are housed in a <b>pressurised</b> aluminium <b>container.</b> This has a length of 1. 1 m, a diameter of 0. 6 m and a total mass of 250 kg; the maximum power consumption of SIOUX is 1300 W. For aeronautical compliance four test procedures were required to guarantee the flight compatibility of the mechanics and electronics of the device: shock/vibration/EMC(ElectroMagneticCompatibility) /pressure test. In October 2001 SIOUX was implemented for the first time aboard the M 55 -Geophysica during a test campaign in Russia. There, the measuring system was monitored under flight conditions and its operation was established for stratospheric conditions. Mixing ratios for NO and NO_y were registered up to an altitude of 20 km. In July 2002 SIOUX was used aboard the M 55 -Geophysica for validation the ENVISAT instrument MIPAS-E in Italy. A comparison was made for the first time between MIPAS-E measurements of nitric acid (HNO_ 3) and SIOUX measurements of NO_y-NO_x (#approx#HNO_ 3 in the altitude range 17 - 20 km). A mean deviation of 20 %#+-# 6 % between the MIPAS-E and the SIOUX data was registered. (orig.)
