50|$|The {{construction}} of the Woodhead Embankment was ambitious and fraught with difficulties. The embankment was to be about 90 ft in height; it was sealed to the underlying impermeable rock by a central impermeable clay <b>puddle</b> <b>core</b> or curtain. This was supported on each side by selected strong earth material, and then gravel to form a slope of 1 in 1 upstream and 1 in 2 downstream. The upstream would be pitched, and faced in stone. The turnpike would pass over the crest. Drinking water would be extracted {{by means of a}} tunnel from several metres below the water level, while when full, excess water would pass over the overspill or waste weir.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reservoir}} has an embankment as the dam head {{which is}} straight and extends to {{a length of}} 1010 ft, a height of 84.5 ft and which also supports a road between Oxenhope and Stanbury village. The road (since known as Waterhead Lane) used to cut across Sladen valley taking a north west route from Intake Farm and going through the small hamlet of Smith Bank. The hamlet and its mill (which featured in Halliwell Sutcliffe's novel A Man of the Moors) were flooded when the reservoir was completed with the road being diverted northwards onto the dam head. The dam head is concrete with a clay <b>puddle</b> <b>core.</b> There is a spillway at the northern end which drops down to the adjoining waterworks facility.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was formed}} by {{the construction of a}} continuous embankment on the floodplain of the River Lea at Chingford. An earth embankment divides the reservoir into two compartments that are connected by three large diameter culverts. The external grassed embankment consists of a central <b>puddle</b> clay <b>core</b> with shoulder filling comprising a mixture of river terraced gravels and alluvial deposits.|$|R
50|$|The reservoir's dam was {{completed}} in 1904. It is an earth fill embankment dam, 22.5 m high, which required some 500,000 LT of earth to build. There is a vertical <b>puddle</b> clay <b>core</b> supported by zoned earth fill shoulders. The higher part of the upstream shoulder is faced in dry rubble pitching about 60 centimetres (2 ft) thick. The crest and downstream shoulder are grassed.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is formed}} by a continuous earthen embankment that encloses the basin. The embankments {{consist of a}} central <b>puddle</b> clay <b>core</b> with a selected material adjacent to the core forming a filter. The core is a maximum of 12 ft wide at the base and tapers to 5 ft wide at the crest. The core typically extends 3 ft into the London Clay to form a watertight cut off.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was created}} for the Weardale and Shildon District Waterworks Company, with construction of the dam between 1873 and 1879. The earth embankment dam was built across the valley of Waskerley Beck, and measures 1020 feet long and 82 feet high. It was constructed with a <b>puddle</b> clay <b>core,</b> which extended upward from the cut-off trench excavated into the rock foundation on the hillsides. A seven foot diameter draw-off tunnel in one abutment controls reservoir elevation.|$|R
50|$|Construction work {{started in}} 1858, the {{reservoir}} being first completely filled ten years later. During the excavations for the reservoir, a Celtic spear-head with a 5inch (130mm) blade was discovered, implying human habitation {{in the area}} during the Bronze Age. It was soon found that moorland silt was being carried into the reservoir from its feeder streams, Piethorne Brook and Cold Greave Brook; Hanging Lees Reservoir was next built as a settling reservoir. Four further reservoirs were built; Kitcliffe and Norman Hill in the 1870s, Ogden, started in 1878, to compensate mills further down Piethorne Brook for loss of water supply, following the Gas and Water Works Facilities Act 1870, and Rooden Reservoir later. A stone-step cascade, or man-made waterfall, carried Piethorne Brook from Norman Hill Reservoir to Piethorne Reservoir. Another stone-step cascade was built as an overflow from Ogden Reservoir. Horses were used to pull wagons along tramways to haul materials on site. Piethorne and the other reservoirs were built using an impermeable clay <b>puddle</b> <b>core</b> to seal the dams, supported by strong earth material. Navvies trod the clay wearing boots with sacking tied around their legs until the full reservoir height was reached.|$|R
50|$|A {{considerable}} number of early notable dams were built in that era and they are now {{sometimes referred to as}} the 'Pennines embankment' type. These dams are characterized by a slender vertical <b>puddle</b> clay <b>core</b> supported on both sides by earthfill shoulders of more heterogeneous material. To control under-seepage through the natural foundation below the dam, the Pennines embankments generally constructed a puddle clay-filled cutoff trench in rock directly below the central core. Later construction often used concrete to fill the cutoff trench.|$|R
50|$|The dam's earth {{embankment}} is 38 metres {{high and}} 550 metres in length. It is 4.25 metres wide {{at the crest}} and is 183 metres at the widest point at its base. A concrete cutoff in a 23 metre deep trench makes a seal between the foundations and the earthworks preventing leaks. Above the concrete cutoff is the clay core. Dovestone is possibly the last large dam {{to be built in}} Britain with a conventional <b>puddle</b> clay <b>core.</b> The volume of the dam is 34,000 cubic metres.|$|R
50|$|The dam is {{of earth}} with a {{concrete}} slab facing and a <b>puddle</b> clay <b>core</b> and is 370 yards long with {{a height of}} 40 feet. The construction of the dam required 170 men working for nearly 40 months and, due to unforeseen difficulties caused by underlying and extruding sandstone strata, the estimated construction costs were exceeded by a considerable margin. A number of the workers employed on the site were of Welsh origin and several married local girls and settled in the area giving rise to a fair proportion of Welsh surnames in the Sedlescombe community.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} occupies 350 acre {{and holds}} 3,493 million imperial gallons (15,880,000 m3). Its maximum height above the {{original ground level}} is 56 ft. Like the other Lower Thames reservoirs, it is of traditional earthen dam construction, with a <b>puddled</b> clay <b>core</b> supported by ballast embankments built from materials excavated on site. It is entirely man-made, as the area had no natural topographical features that could be dammed off to create a reservoir. To make inspecting {{the integrity of the}} reservoir easier, Thames Water maintains a commercial flock of sheep on the reservoir banks to keep the grass on the reservoir banks close-cropped.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of Hanningfield Reservoir, which was authorised by the Hanningfield Water Act 1950, and began in 1951, was {{a joint venture}} between the two companies. It was built in the Sandon Valley, to the north of Wickford, and covered the hamlet of Peasdown. A 1.25 mi mass earth dam with a <b>puddle</b> clay <b>core</b> was built across the north-east edge of the site, and a new 9 mi pipeline was built from the Langford pumping station to supply the reservoir. The main contractors for the project were W&C French, and it took around 5 years to complete, with the treatment works beginning production in August 1956. The formal opening took place over a year later, when Henry Brooke, MP, the Minister of Housing and Local Government, performed the ceremony in September 1957. The total cost of the project was Â£6 million, and when full, the reservoir can hold [...] If supplies around [...] or treated water per day, although the maximum throughput of the works is [...] per day. Water levels fluctuate seasonally, and during the winter months, up to [...] per day are pumped into the reservoir via the Langford pipeline.|$|R
