50|$|Encouraged, however, by letters {{signed by}} the rabbis of Argentière and Lunel, and {{particularly}} by the support of Kalonymus ben Todros, the nasi of Narbonne, and of the eminent Talmudist Asheri of Toledo, Ben Adret issued a decree, signed by thirty-three rabbis of Barcelona, excommunicating those who should, within the next fifty years, study physics or metaphysics before their thirtieth year of age (basing his action on the principle laid down by Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed <b>part</b> <b>one</b> <b>chapter</b> 34), and had the order promulgated in the synagogue on Sabbath, July 26, 1305. When this heresy-decree, to be made effective, was forwarded to other congregations for approval, the friends of liberal thought, {{under the leadership of}} the Tibbonites, issued a counter-ban, and the conflict threatened to assume a serious character, as blind party zeal (this time on the liberal side) did not shrink from asking the civil powers to intervene. But an unlooked-for calamity brought the warfare to an end. The expulsion of the Jews from France by Philip IV ("the Fair"), in, caused the Jews of Montpellier to take refuge, partly in Provence, partly in Perpignan and partly in Majorca. Consequently, Abba Mari removed first to Arles, and, within the same year, to Perpignan, where he finally settled and disappeared from public view. There he published his correspondence with Ben Adret and his colleagues.|$|E

40|$|The book {{is divided}} into three sections. <b>Part</b> <b>One,</b> <b>chapters</b> 1 - 3, {{provides}} the reader with a framework for understanding relational and restorative pedagogy based on the Five Key Restorative Themes: Everyone has their own unique and equally valued perspectives Thoughts influence emotions, emotions influence actions Empathy and consideration Needs and unmet needs Collective responsibility for problem solving and decision making. (Hopkins, 2011, p. 32) These five themes form the basis {{for the rest of the}} book. Part Two, chapters 4 - 9, describes a range of restorative practices and exercises, such as mixers, circles, and community-building games, as well as the step-by-step instructions on how to implement and conduct them. Part Three, Chapter 10, succinctly discusses the whole-school approach, which is explained in greater detail in Just Schools (Hopkins, 2004). Still, Hopkins would be remiss not to emphasize the need for the whole-school adoption of restorative practices based on current school effectiveness and improvement literature, and again asserts that "developing a restorative staffroom and staff team is likely to be a pre-requisite for a successful, high-achieving school" (Hopkins, 2011, p. 225) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts, each {{covering}} roughly a decade and concentrating on a major phase in the development of Dickens's treatment of High Society. A general introduction gives reasons for reassessing this development and indicates the lines of argument to be followed with an explanation of the terminology involved. <b>Part</b> <b>One,</b> <b>Chapter</b> I, discusses the background to Dickens's treatment of High Society in the period up to Barnaby. It pays special attention to historical and literary influences and compares prevailing attitudes to High Society with Dickens's own. Chapter 2 is a detailed study of the parts Cordon and Chester play in Barnaby. It highlights the importance of Gordon in Dickens's treatment of High Society and sees Barnaby as the culmination of one phase of its development. A general introduction to Part Two emphasised that the eighteen-forties was a decade of change and stresses the problems of discussing such a decade. Chapter 1 is a further background chapter, following the same lines as <b>Part</b> <b>One,</b> <b>Chapter</b> 1. It shows Dickens increasingly discriminating between High Society as an institution and individual members of it. Three Chapters on individual novels shows Dickens's progress towards an overall view 3 of Society and his maturing ability to understand and portray the upper classes. In the Chapter on Bleak House Dicken's treatment of High Society is seen to have matured and the portraits of Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock are discussed as the culmination of development traced through preceding chapters. Chanter 5 is a brief survey of the period after 1852 and suggests that when further development there is merely a refinement of attitudes and techniques apparent in Bleak House. A brief conclusion sums up the argument of the thesis as a whole. <p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} teen soap The O. C. s {{representation of}} gender and masculinity. The study employs a social constructivist view of gender, particularly inspired by Judith Butler s work.

The main question I structure my thesis around is how gender and masculinity are represented in The O. C through the characters of Ryan and Seth. My approach to examining this question is through textual analysis. The analysis is divided into three main <b>parts.</b> <b>One</b> <b>chapter</b> explores the representation {{of gender and}} masculinity from the perspective of film history, focusing especially on how Ryan is influenced by Marlon Brando s star persona, while Seth s display of masculinity evokes Woody Allen s comic screen persona.

In my final chapter I analyze Ryan and Seth s look, style and fashion, pointing out how clothing plays a key element in expressing the flexibility of masculine identities...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into two parts one for {{dimension}} 2 and the other for dimension 3. <b>Part</b> <b>one</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 3) of the thesis generalises the definition of an n-dimensional HQFT in terms of a monoidal functor from a rigid symmetric monoidal category X-Cobn to any monoidal category A. In particular, 2 -dimensional HQFTs with target K(G, 1) taking values in A are generated from any Turaev G-crossed system in A and vice versa. This is the generalisation of the theory given by Turaev into a purely categorical set-up. Part two (Chapter 4) of the thesis generalises the concept of a group-coalgebra, Hopf group-coalgebra, crossed Hopf group-coalgebra and quasitriangular Hopf group-coalgebra {{in the case of a}} group scheme. Quantum double of a crossed Hopf group-scheme coalgebra is constructed in the affine case and conjectured for the more general non-affine case. We can construct 3 -dimensional HQFTs from modular crossed G-categories. The category of representations of a quantum double of a crossed Hopf group-coalgebra is a ribbon (quasitriangular) crossed group-category, and hence can generate 3 -dimensional HQFTs under certain conditions if the category becomes modular. However, the problem of systematic finding of modular crossed G-categories is largely open. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceUniversity of WarwickGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an innovative approach to implement functionalities for an Intelligent Learning Environment, based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) on existing Learning Variable Management System (LVMS). A Learning Object (LO) consists of several related sequential Learning Variables (LV). The creation of LO is the goal. Based on that goal LVs {{need to be}} selected. The proposed model will concentrate on the selection and management process of LVs to create a complete LO. The management process will include receiving the LVs, storing process, repository management, and finally preparing the LVs for the selection process. The selection process includes Web Services (WS), which are utilized to provide LVs. To get a selected LV, the system first selects a WS which then selects the LV. An Integrated Ranking procedure is executed to rank those LVs. Different agents will work on different sections of the system. Finally the LO creation agent (Styler) will create the Learning Object. In this paper we abbreviated the LVMS to Learning System (LS). This paper has been divided into four chapters. The learning variable/object basics and the proposed system have been described in <b>part</b> <b>one.</b> <b>Chapter</b> two reviews web crawling systems and their effect on the proposed system.

40|$|Misty MacDuffee {{sampling}} chinook and coho fry in a {{tributary of}} the Ecstall River. At 85, 000 hectares, the Ecstall is the largest unlogged watershed on the North coast. It supports nine species of salmonids which spawn up to 96 km upstream and in more than one dozen of the watershed’s tributaries and lakes. 35 <b>Part</b> <b>One,</b> <b>Chapter</b> 2 APPROACH AND METHODS The long term survival of salmon depends on maintaining genetic diversity, which in turn depends on adequate numbers of salmon returning to natal spawning grounds. DFO’s ability to assess and manage for genetic diversity and nutrient returns were evaluated by posing 3 questions: • Is escapement adequately monitored? • Has DFO met its own target escapements? • Are these escapement targets adequate to sustain ecosystem and predator requirements? Answers to these questions will reveal DFO’s successes or failure in managing for genetic diversity and nutrient returns. The most practical way to assess fishery managers ’ understanding of salmon diversity is to review DFO’s own database on salmon presence and trends in river systems. Such information reflects the level of on-the-ground field knowledge of metapopulations and demes. We analyze and discuss the database that contains enumerations of salmon returning to their natal streams, namely DFO’s salmon escapement database system (SEDS). Although there are limitations to the SEDS (discussed below), there are no alternative databases for the type of assessment attempted here...|$|E
