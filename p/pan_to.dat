GOSH has exercised these rights internationally to help support the work of the institution.|$|E
25|$|An {{equation}} {{is analogous to}} a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (grain for example) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and {{are said to be}} equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other <b>pan</b> <b>to</b> keep the scale in balance. Likewise, to keep an equation in balance, the same operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division must be performed on both sides of an equation for it to remain true.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 18th century Luoist sects spread along the Grand Canal from Hebei to Zhejiang and Fujian; boatmen {{belonging}} to Luoist sects recognised the eighth generation descendant Luo Mingzhong {{as the head}} of the religion.

They founded three different lines, which congregation halls (an) also functioned as social relief institutions. After the ninth patriarch the line of hereditary leadership came to an end. An investigation of 1816 testifies that the male descendants of Luo no longer practiced the religion of the forefather.|$|E
25|$|A second French embassy {{was sent}} to Siam in March 1687, {{organized}} by Colbert, with Guy Tachard again included. The embassy consisted of a French expeditionary force of 1,361 soldiers, missionaries, envoys and crews aboard five warships, and had the additional duty of returning the embassy of Kosa <b>Pan</b> <b>to</b> Siam. The military wing was led by General Desfarges, and the diplomatic mission by Simon de la Loubère and Claude Céberet du Boullay, {{a director of the}} French East India Company. The embassy arrived in Bangkok in October 1687, on the warships Le Gaillard (52 guns), L'oiseau (46 guns), La Loire (24 guns), La Normande and Le Dromadaire.|$|E

They were married two years later and continued to act together from time to time, both on stage and screen. She played his daughter in the stage play Payment Deferred (1931) though not in the subsequent Hollywood film version. Lanchester and Laughton appeared in the Old Vic season of 1933–34, playing Shakespeare, Chekov and Wilde, and in 1936 she was Peter <b>Pan</b> <b>to</b> Laughton's Captain Hook in J. M.

25|$|In 214, Sun Quan led an army {{to attack}} Hefei, a city defended by Cao Cao's general Zhang Liao, {{leading to the}} Battle of Xiaoyao Ford. When Sun Quan's forces were just setting up their camps outside Hefei, Zhang Liao {{suddenly}} led hundreds of troops to attack them, completely catching the enemy off guard. Chen Wu was killed in action while Song Qian and Xu Sheng were defeated and their men dispersed. Pan Zhang chased the deserting soldiers on horseback and executed two of them, forcing the others to return to battle. Sun Quan's forces managed to hold up against Zhang Liao's assault that day despite sustaining heavy casualties, but eventually suffered a crushing defeat when Zhang Liao launched a surprise counterattack while they were withdrawing. Sun Quan was impressed when he heard of Pan Zhang's actions and he promoted <b>Pan</b> <b>to</b> Lieutenant-General (偏將軍), put him in charge of more troops. and ordered him to garrison at Banzhou (半州).|$|E
25|$|In Ecuador the Day of the Dead is {{observed}} {{to some extent}} by all parts of society, though {{it is especially important}} to the indigenous Kichwa peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population. Indigena families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones. Ceremonial foods include colada morada, a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the Andean blackberry and purple maize. This is typically consumed with guagua de pan, a bread shaped like a swaddled infant, though variations include many pigs—the latter being traditional to the city of Loja. The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with masa in the pre-Columbian era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of guava paste. These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both colada morada and gaugua de <b>pan</b> <b>to</b> their menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too.|$|E

25|$|Rumplestiltskin summons his own {{shadow in}} an effort to bury his dagger and hide it from others. An {{illusion}} of Belle (Emilie de Ravin) regularly visits him in the jungle, though it is later revealed she is Pan's shadow in disguise attempting to steer Rumplestiltskin from his mission. He then collaborates with Regina, summoning the mermaid Ariel (Joanna García Swisher) to retrieve Pandora's Box from Gold's shop in Storybrooke. After Belle protects Storybrooke with a barrier spell, she successfully sends Ariel back with the item, following their misunderstanding with John (Matt Kane) and Michael Darling (James Immekus), who were enlisted by <b>Pan</b> <b>to</b> do everything he says, otherwise he will harm their sister Wendy (Freya Tingley). Rumplestiltskin and Regina later rejoin the rest of the group, though they doubt his true intentions after he reveals the prophecy of Henry being his undoing. To prove himself, Rumplestiltskin travels to Skull Rock to confront Pan, who is shown to be a younger version of his father Malcolm who abandoned him in Neverland years ago. Instead of capturing Pan in Pandora's Box, Rumplestiltskin is placed inside by Pan, who then tricks Henry into giving him his heart from his body. The group then set about to save him, with Regina retrieving his heart and resurrecting him. Rumplestiltskin is released by Neal, then trapping Pan inside the box instead after he discovers him attempting to rip Henry's shadow. The residents of Neverland all board the Jolly Roger and travel home to Storybrooke, using Pan's shadow to fly the ship. However, Pan has secretly inhabited Henry's body after switching before being trapped.|$|E

By 1922, the Fitzgeralds had employed a nurse for their daughter, a couple to clean their house, and a laundress.

Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily. Also, in the case of bacon, do not turn the fire too high, or you will {{have to get out of}} the house for a week. Serve preferably on china plates, though gold or wood will do if handy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{moment in}} which {{the first half of}} the movie {{transitions}} into the second is punctuated by the rising score and camera <b>pan</b> <b>to</b> an ostensibly meaningless point of reflected light on an ornament. According to Rostock, the meaning behind this movement is clear: it marks the spot when Berti's spree ends and Neal's rampage begins. Argento uses the shift in focus to comment on the shaping of the film itself, until that moment a typical, [...] "clichéd and remote" [...] giallo. Neal, previously passive, begins to control what happens in his own story, which is more personal with [...] "weight and meaning". According to Rostock, this structure allows Argento equal scope to play with the narrative while commenting upon it, all without having to deviate from the advancement of plot. According to Kim Newman, the use of a sculpture as a weapon makes literal one of the themes of the film: [...] "art that kills people". Rostock concurs, saying that as the film is a commentary on art, the only weapon that can end the narrative is art itself.|$|E

500|$|Ward {{noted that}} EA's snowboarding video game series SSX was an {{influence}} for Burnout 3s bolder and brasher nature. There was {{an emphasis on}} making the game more aggressive than previous instalments. Ward described Burnout 3 as a game about [...] "fighting through traffic" [...] rather than [...] "racing through traffic". This approach to the game's design led {{to the introduction of}} Takedowns, a feature that rewarded the player with boost and points for knocking their opponents off the track. The Takedown mechanic became a focal point of Burnout 3s design and led to other innovations. At first, the team were not convinced by the idea of having the game's camera <b>pan</b> <b>to</b> show the crash of a taken out vehicle while the player was driving; however, once it was implemented, they agreed that the feature worked well. From there, they decided to show a player's crash as well, which gave rise to the aftertouch mechanic. The crash mode from Burnout 2 was expanded and redesigned to be more puzzle-based; aftertouch control, crashbreakers, and multiplayer support were added to the mode. They wanted to include ramps in crash events so that vehicles could fly into traffic, however the game's physics system was designed to push cars down on the track to prevent them from taking off during a race. This caused vehicles to descend immediately after driving off a ramp. To bypass this issue they [...] "killed" [...] the vehicle once it hit the ramp, leaving it a wreck that was unaffected by the driving physics.|$|E
