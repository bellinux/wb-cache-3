5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the <b>penicillins,</b> a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring <b>penicillins</b> such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other <b>penicillins</b> can be produced by chemical modification of the natural <b>penicillins.</b> Modern <b>penicillins</b> are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E
5|$|Fungi are {{the sources}} of many types of {{medicinal}} drug including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and statins. Major classes of antibiotics, the <b>penicillins</b> and the cephalosporins, are derived from substances produced by fungi. So also are the immunosuppressant macrolides, the cyclosporins.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{primarily}} to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to <b>penicillins,</b> clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "penicillin" [...] {{is often}} used generically to refer to {{benzylpenicillin}} (<b>penicillin</b> G, the original <b>penicillin</b> found in 1928), procaine benzylpenicillin (procaine <b>penicillin),</b> benzathine benzylpenicillin (benzathine <b>penicillin),</b> and phenoxymethylpenicillin (<b>penicillin</b> V). Procaine <b>penicillin</b> and benzathine <b>penicillin</b> have the same antibacterial activity as benzylpenicillin but act {{for a longer period}} of time. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is less active against gram-negative bacteria than benzylpenicillin. Benzylpenicillin, procaine <b>penicillin</b> and benzathine <b>penicillin</b> can be given by intravenous or intramuscular injections, but phenoxymethylpenicillin can be given by mouth because of its acidic stability.|$|R
50|$|CSPC Zhongrun <b>penicillin</b> and {{cephalosporin}} Beta-lactam antibiotic products include 16 {{varieties of}} API and intermediates. The <b>penicillin</b> series includes <b>penicillin</b> G potassium crude, <b>penicillin</b> G potassium, <b>penicillin</b> G sodium, 6-APA, amoxicillin trihydrate, ampicillin trihydrate and ampicillin sodium.|$|R
40|$|<b>PENICILLIN</b> X is a {{fraction}} obtained from {{cultures of the}} same mold (Penicillium notatum) which produces <b>penicillin</b> G (or "regular " <b>penicillin).</b> It differs from <b>penicillin</b> G in the method by which it is extracted, and is usually found more abundantly in flask-grown <b>penicillin.</b> We have tested the relative sensitivity of various bacteria to <b>penicillin</b> X and <b>penicillin</b> G and have found that two to 16 times as much <b>penicillin</b> G is required as <b>penicillin</b> X, unit for unit, to kill many bacteria in vitro. The details of this study will be published elsewhere. Other investigators 1 _ 8 have reported similar results. In the present paper we are summarizing {{the results of the}} treatment with <b>penicillin</b> X of 104 patients suffering from various diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS The <b>penicillin</b> X f used in this study was the calcium salt. The first batches of <b>penicillin</b> contained about 75 per cent of the X-fraction, and the later batches, 90 per cent. At first we used doses varying from 5, 000 to 15, 000 units every two or three hours. After studying the serum penicilli...|$|R
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of <b>penicillins</b> and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and <b>penicillins.</b> Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
25|$|Other {{antibiotics}} {{that may}} work include macrolides, lincosamides, nitroimidazoles, and <b>penicillins.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of <b>penicillin</b> in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were compared simultaneously {{with those in}} the serum in 17 patients with syphilis. The antibiotic concentrations were measured by the agar well diffusion method. There were no detectable {{concentrations of}} <b>penicillin</b> in the CSF after administration of benzathine <b>penicillin</b> 2. 4 megaunits, benzathine <b>penicillin</b> 7. 2 megaunits, procaine <b>penicillin</b> in aluminium monostearate (PAM) 12 megaunits, or aqueous procaine <b>penicillin</b> G 2. 4 megaunits. Only after high doses of aqueous <b>penicillin</b> G 24 megaunits daily or aqueous <b>penicillin</b> G 2 megaunits daily together with oral probenecid 2 g daily was <b>penicillin</b> detectable in the CSF. The concentrations after the latter regimen were the highest and much higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration for Treponema pallidum...|$|R
50|$|Benzathine {{phenoxymethylpenicillin}} (rINN), {{also called}} <b>penicillin</b> V benzathine (USAN) or benzathine <b>penicillin</b> V, is a <b>penicillin.</b> The benzathine component is a diamine that stabilizes the <b>penicillin</b> component and prolongs its sojourn when injected into tissues, thus improving its pharmacokinetics.|$|R
40|$|Paired {{specimens}} of cerebrospinal fluid and serum {{were taken from}} 21 patients to estimate <b>penicillin</b> concentrations {{two to three hours}} after the last dose of a course of 14 - 21 daily intramuscular injections of procaine <b>penicillin</b> 0. 6 MU. Of 10 patients treated with procaine <b>penicillin</b> alone, eight had no detectable <b>penicillin</b> and two had sub-treponemicidal concentrations (less than 0. 018 mg/l) in the cerebrospinal fluid. Of 11 patients treated with procaine <b>penicillin</b> as above and probenecid 2 g a day by mouth, three had no detectable <b>penicillin,</b> two had sub-treponemicidal concentrations, and six had treponemicidal concentrations of <b>penicillin</b> in the cerebrospinal fluid. All 21 patients had treponemicidal concentrations of <b>penicillin</b> in the serum. This dose of procaine <b>penicillin</b> alone or with probenecid is therefore not recommended for treating neurosyphilis...|$|R
25|$|Antibiotic {{treatment}} {{should cover}} both S.nbsp&pyogenes and S.nbsp&aureus. This may include {{a combination of}} cephalosporins, <b>penicillins</b> or vancomycin. The addition of clindamycin or gentamicin reduces toxin production and mortality.|$|E
25|$|Flucloxacillin is more acid-stable {{than many}} other <b>penicillins</b> and can be given orally, in {{addition}} to parenteral routes. However, like methicillin, it is less potent than benzylpenicillin against non-β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Amoxicillin {{is one of}} the semisynthetic <b>penicillins</b> {{discovered}} by Beecham scientists. The patent for amoxicillin has expired, thus amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav preparations are marketed under hundreds of trade names and/or have several synonyms across the world.|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} late {{prosthetic}} endocarditis resulting from Moraxella non-liquefaciens is reported. Correct laboratory indentification is of therapeutic importance as Moraxella is often highly sensitive to <b>penicillin.</b> Because of suspected <b>penicillin</b> sensitivity, antibiotics other than <b>penicillin</b> were used, {{but failed to}} control the endocarditis. Prompt response occurred when <b>penicillin</b> was given. <b>Penicillin</b> remains {{by far the most}} effective antibiotic for the treatment of endocarditis, particularly when affecting prosthetic valves, and caused by organisms sensitive to <b>penicillin...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>penicillin</b> can be altered by taking other {{medications}} at the same time. Taking oral contraceptives along with <b>penicillin</b> may lower {{the effects of the}} contraceptive. When probenecid is used concurrently with <b>penicillin,</b> kidney excretion of probenecid is increase resulting in higher blood levels of <b>penicillin</b> in the circulation. In some instances, this would be intended therapeutic effect. In other instances, this is an unintended side effect. Neomycin can lower the absorption of <b>penicillin</b> from the gastrointestinal tract resulting in lower than expected levels of <b>penicillin</b> in the circulation. This side effect may result in an ineffective therapeutic effect of <b>penicillin.</b> When methotrexate is administered with <b>penicillin,</b> toxicity may occur related to methotrexante.|$|R
40|$|Penicillin-resistant mutants of Staphylococcus aureus H {{were similar}} to the parent in their {{response}} to <b>penicillin</b> though proportionately more <b>penicillin</b> was required for a given effect. The mutants did not inactivate <b>penicillin.</b> Most of the penicillin-binding sites (presumed to be murein transpeptidase molecules) bound <b>penicillin</b> rapidly when exposed to a very low concentration of <b>penicillin</b> (0. 1 μg/ml), and yet the mutants retained some functional murein transpeptidase even {{in the presence of}} 500 μg of <b>penicillin</b> per ml. An hypothesis based on (i) functional versus nonfunctional transpeptidase molecules and (ii) variations in accessibility to <b>penicillin</b> can explain these findings...|$|R
25|$|Vancomycin is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of serious, life-threatening infections by Gram-positive bacteria unresponsive to other antibiotics. In particular, vancomycin should not be used to treat methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus because it is inferior to <b>penicillins</b> such as nafcillin.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{flucloxacillin}} being {{insensitive to}} beta-lactamases, some organisms have developed resistance {{to it and}} other narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics including methicillin. Such organisms include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which has developed resistance to flucloxacillin and other <b>penicillins</b> by having an altered penicillin-binding protein.|$|E
25|$|Flucloxacillin is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with a previous history of allergy to <b>penicillins,</b> cephalosporins, or carbapenems. It should also {{not be used in}} the eye, or administered to those with a history of cholestatic hepatitis {{associated with the use of}} dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin.|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{quantitative}} nasal culture was investigated {{as a means of}} evaluation of new antimicrobial drugs in man. Cyclacillin was somewhat more active in vitro than <b>penicillin</b> G against <b>penicillin</b> G-resistant organisms. Cyclacillin was highly effective in suppressing staphylococci susceptible to <b>penicillin</b> G in nasal carriers but did not suppress staphylococci resistant to <b>penicillin</b> G. Although in previous studies by others cyclacillin was effective in treating mice infected with <b>penicillin</b> G-resistant staphylococci, in the present studies cyclacillin was not effective in suppressing nasal <b>penicillin</b> G-resistant staphylococci in man at doses which markedly suppressed <b>penicillin</b> G-sensitive organisms...|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} {{treatment}} forms for {{any type of}} syphilis uses <b>penicillin,</b> which has been an effective treatment used since the 1940s. Other forms also include Benzathine <b>penicillin,</b> which is usually used for primary and secondary syphilis (it has no resistance to <b>penicillin</b> however). Benzathine <b>penicillin</b> is used for long acting form, and if conditions worsen, <b>penicillin</b> G is used for late syphilis.|$|R
40|$|Penicillin-"virgin" {{strains of}} Enterococcus faecalis {{collected}} from {{a population of}} individuals with no previous antibiotic exposure were subjected in vitro to <b>penicillin</b> delivered as repeated pulses, stepwise increasing concentrations, or sustained levels of a single concentration. Changes in resistance to <b>penicillin</b> were assessed by determination of MICs, and time-kill studies were performed to evaluate changes in tolerance to the bactericidal effects of <b>penicillin.</b> Isogenic clones, derived from various exposure regimens, which exhibited changes in either resistance or tolerance were further examined for changes in penicillin-binding proteins. Exposure to repeated pulses of <b>penicillin</b> resulted {{in the development of}} tolerance to <b>penicillin</b> without changes in the level of resistance. Clones derived from a regimen of stepwise increases in the <b>penicillin</b> concentration acquired both increased <b>penicillin</b> resistance and tolerance. Clones selected after prolonged continuous exposure to a fixed concentration of <b>penicillin</b> displayed minimally increased resistance to <b>penicillin,</b> but they retained the lytic, nontolerant response to the bactericidal effect of <b>penicillin.</b> Clones which acquired tolerance to the bactericidal effect of <b>penicillin</b> without changes in <b>penicillin</b> resistance exhibited a penicillin-binding protein pattern identical to that of the parental strain. Increased labeling of several penicillin-binding proteins accompanied the development of increased <b>penicillin</b> resistance in both penicillin-tolerant and nontolerant strains. Exposure of E. faecalis to <b>penicillin</b> in repeated pulses of brief duration, for prolonged periods at a constant concentration, or in stepwise graded concentrations can result in the selection of clones with increased resistance to the inhibitory or bactericidal effects of <b>penicillin,</b> or both. These observations may be relevant to the selection of dosing regimes for <b>penicillin</b> in the treatment of enterococcal infections, when bactericidal synergism cannot be achieved with penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations...|$|R
25|$|The myriad {{causes of}} {{intrinsic}} AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to vasculitis or glomerulonephritis may respond to steroid medication, cyclophosphamide, and (in some cases) plasma exchange. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as ACE inhibitors, ARB antagonists, aminoglycosides, <b>penicillins,</b> NSAIDs, or paracetamol.|$|E
25|$|Cefalexin is {{a useful}} {{alternative}} to <b>penicillins</b> in patients with penicillin intolerance. For example, penicillin is the treatment of choice for respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus, but cefalexin {{may be used as}} an alternative in penicillin-intolerant patients. Caution must be exercised when administering cephalosporin antibiotics to penicillin-sensitive patients, because cross sensitivity with beta-lactam antibiotics has been documented in up to 10% of patients with a documented penicillin allergy.|$|E
25|$|The overall rate {{of adverse}} events in {{patients}} treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly {{similar to that}} seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with <b>penicillins,</b> clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the reliability with which a given dose of benzathine <b>penicillin</b> will result in predictable ranges of penicillinaemia on any particular day during the week after injection, ambulant adult males were injected with 2 400 000 IU of ”all-purpose” <b>penicillin</b> (600 000 IU potassium <b>penicillin</b> G, 600 000 IU procaine <b>penicillin</b> G and 1 200 000 IU of benzathine <b>penicillin).</b> <b>Penicillin</b> serum assays were performed, 24 each day, from the third to the seventh day after injection (120 assays in all) ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{infants with}} {{nephrotic}} syndrome who developed <b>penicillin</b> resistant pneumococcal peritonitis while receiving <b>penicillin</b> chemoprophylaxis are reported {{and the problems}} associated with prophylaxis against pneumococcal infection discussed. It is suggested that <b>penicillin</b> prophylaxis may be hazardous in an environment in which <b>penicillin</b> resistant pneumococci are prevalent...|$|R
50|$|Almecillin (INN), {{also known}} as <b>penicillin</b> O, is a <b>penicillin</b> that is similar in {{antibiotic}} action to <b>penicillin</b> G. It is obtained by isolation from Penicillium chrysogenum.|$|R
25|$|Resistance to {{methicillin}} {{is mediated}} via the mec operon, {{part of the}} staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). Resistance is conferred by the mecA gene, which codes for an altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a or PBP2') that has a lower affinity for binding β-lactams (<b>penicillins,</b> cephalosporins, and carbapenems). This allows for resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics, and obviates their clinical use during MRSA infections. As such, the glycopeptide vancomycin is often deployed against MRSA.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the {{research}} shows that all beta lactams have the intrinsic hazard of very serious hazardous reactions in susceptible patients. Only the frequency of these reactions vary, based on the structure. Recent papers have shown that a major feature in determining frequency of immunological reactions is the similarity of the side chains (e.g., first generation cephalosporins are similar to <b>penicillins),</b> {{and this is the}} reason the β-lactams are associated with different frequencies of serious reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis).|$|E
25|$|This {{strategy}} {{can have}} two advantages. Firstly, the intermediate {{may be more}} easily extracted, and in higher yield, than the ultimate desired product. An {{example of this is}} paclitaxel, which can be manufactured by extracting 10-deacetylbaccatin III from T. brevifolia needles, then carrying out a four-step synthesis. Secondly, the route designed between semisynthetic starting material and ultimate product may permit analogues of the final product to be synthesized. The newer generation semisynthetic <b>penicillins</b> are an illustration of the benefit of this approach.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{management}} of patients with a history of <b>penicillin</b> allergy between allergists and non-allergists in Thailand. A questionnaire was distributed to Thai physicians by online survey. The answers from 205 physicians were analyzed. The discrepancy of <b>penicillin</b> allergy management between allergists and non-allergists was clearly demonstrated in patients with a history of an immediate reaction in the presence of <b>penicillin</b> skin test (P< 0. 01) and in patients with a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (P< 0. 05) from <b>penicillin.</b> Allergists are more willing to confirm <b>penicillin</b> allergic status, more likely to carefully administer <b>penicillin</b> even after negative skin test, but less concerned for the potential cross-reactivity with 3 rd and 4 th generation cephalosporins, compared to non-allergists. The lack of <b>penicillin</b> skin test reagents, the reliability of <b>penicillin</b> allergy history, and medicolegal problem were the main reasons for prescribing alternate antibiotics without confirmation of <b>penicillin</b> allergic status. In summary, the different management of <b>penicillin</b> allergy between allergists and non-allergists was significantly demonstrated in patients with a history of severe non-immediate reaction and in patients with a history of an immediate reaction when a <b>penicillin</b> skin test is available...|$|R
30|$|Surprisingly, S. pyogenes remains universally {{susceptible}} to <b>penicillin</b> despite {{the widespread use}} of <b>penicillin</b> for over 7 decades [53]. Some strains have, however, developed resistance to macrolides, tetracyclins and clindamycin. <b>Penicillin</b> G is bactericidal and remains, at high parenteral doses, the first-line treatment for infections due to SGA. In vivo, the efficacy of <b>penicillin</b> might be affected by the inoculum size. Clinical failures of <b>penicillin</b> alone have been reported. Due to the inoculum and steady-state volume of distribution disturbance, maximal parenteral doses of <b>penicillin</b> G are required (e.g., 4 mio IU/ 4  h.).|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} semi-synthetic {{production}} involves the drug ampicillin. A beta lactam antibiotic just like <b>penicillin,</b> ampicillin {{was developed by}} adding an addition amino group (NH2) to the R group of <b>penicillin.</b> This additional amino group gives ampicillin a broader spectrum of use than <b>penicillin.</b> Methicillin is another derivative of <b>penicillin</b> and was discovered in the late 1950s, the key difference between <b>penicillin</b> and methicillin being the addition of two methoxy groups to the phenyl group. These methoxy groups allow methicillin to be used against penicillinase producing bacteria {{that would otherwise be}} resistant to <b>penicillin.</b>|$|R
