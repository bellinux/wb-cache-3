With increased {{autonomy in}} <b>personnel</b> <b>policy,</b> principals could wield their leadership to improve teachers’ organizational commitment. However, {{little is known about}} whether the given autonomy in <b>personnel</b> <b>policy</b> meets principals’ expectation and whether and how the gap in between has an effect on teachers’ organizational commitment. This research explores the effects of autonomy gap in <b>personnel</b> <b>policy,</b> principal leadership, teachers’ self-efficacy and school contextual factors on teachers’ organizational commitment. Multilevel analysis was used. The results show the effects of autonomy gap in <b>personnel</b> <b>policy</b> differ among areas. In particular, the autonomy gap in salary was found to be a significant antecedent of teachers’ organizational commitment. The results also highlight the importance of principal leadership in this process. Principals with a stronger leadership tend to perceive generally a larger autonomy gap in <b>personnel</b> <b>policy.</b> In addition, when transformational leadership increased, its positive influence on teachers’ organizational commitment became even stronger. Implications for developing efficacious leadership and autonomy <b>policy</b> in <b>personnel</b> management were discussed...|$|R
40|$|We model <b>personnel</b> <b>policies</b> {{in public}} agencies, {{examining}} how wages and promo-tion standards can partially o¤set a fundamental contracting problem: {{the inability of}} public sector workers to contract on performance, and the inability of political mas-ters to contract on forbearance from meddling. Despite the dual contracting problem, properly constructed <b>personnel</b> <b>policies</b> can encourage intrinsically motivated public sector employees to invest in expertise, seek promotion, remain in the public sector, and develop policy projects. However, doing so requires internal <b>personnel</b> <b>policies</b> that sort "slackers " from "zealots. " <b>Personnel</b> <b>policies</b> that accomplish this task are quite di¤erent in agencies where acquired expertise has little value in the private sector, and agencies where acquired expertise commands a premium in the private sector. Fi-nally, even with well-designed <b>personnel</b> <b>policies,</b> there remains an inescapable trade-o¤ between political control and expertise acquisition. I...|$|R
40|$|Public {{management}} {{reforms of}} the last decades increased the competition {{between the public and}} the private sector and challenged formerly standardised and collective public <b>personnel</b> <b>policies.</b> Based on expert interviews, this paper explores the impact of competition on public <b>personnel</b> <b>policies</b> in comparative case studies. We distinguish between competition for the provision of services, evidenced in waste collection, and competition for highly qualified personnel, exemplified by energy regulatory agencies. These cases are contrasted with the police as a field which is not influenced by either form of competition. Comparing Germany, France, the UK, and Sweden we show how competition shapes public <b>personnel</b> <b>policies</b> in different institutional settings. The results indicate that the designs of <b>personnel</b> <b>policies</b> in different fields of public employment are influenced by the type and the extent of competition. Nevertheless, reactions to competition comply with the constraints and options of the respective national institutional design. public sector labour markets, <b>personnel</b> <b>policies,</b> competition, administrative regimes...|$|R
