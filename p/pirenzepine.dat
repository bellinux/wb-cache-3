5000|$|By {{the use of}} {{selective}} radioactively labeled agonist and antagonist substances, five subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been determined, named M1-M5 (using an upper case M and subscript number).

For example, the drug <b>pirenzepine</b> is a muscarinic antagonist (decreases the effect of ACh), {{which is much more}} potent at M1 receptors than it is at other subtypes.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>pirenzepine</b> on gastric and {{duodenal}} ulceration and barrier mucus levels, {{as well as}} on changes of superior mesenteric artery diameter caused by cysteamine, were investigated in rats and compared with those of atropine. Cysteamine induced severe gastric and duodenal ulcers and decreased both barrier mucus levels and mesenteric blood flow. <b>Pirenzepine</b> reduced gastric and duodenal ulceration induced by cysteamine. Moreover, <b>pirenzepine</b> significantly increased basal mesenteric artery diameter and fully prevented cysteamine-induced decrease in mesenteric blood flow.

40|$|The binding of <b>pirenzepine</b> to digitonin-solubilized rat {{myocardial}} muscarinic acetylcholine receptors {{has been}} examined at 4 degrees C.

In both preparations, <b>pirenzepine</b> binding was complex. High affinity <b>pirenzepine</b> binding (KD approximately 3 X 10 (- 8) M) to the soluble myocardial receptors could be monitored directly using [3 H]-pirenzepine.

40|$|Objectives. Our aims were 1) {{to assess}} whether oral <b>pirenzepine</b> could {{increase}} indexes of cardiac vagal activity in postinfarction patients, and 2) to compare {{the effects of this}} agent with those of transdermal scopolamine. Background. Depression of vagal tone and reflexes predicts a poor arrhythmic outcome after myocardial infarction. Interventions for shifting the sympathovagal balance toward vagal dominance are now of increased clinical interest. Intravenous <b>pirenzepine</b> increases RR interval variability in normal volunteers, a finding that could have therapeutic implications if confirmed in postinfarction patients after oral administration of the drug. Methods. In a single-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials, short-term RR interval variability and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity were evaluated in 20 patients an average of 19 ± 6 days after infarction. Analysis was performed during control conditions and during administration of placebo, oral <b>pirenzepine</b> and transdermal scopolamine. Results. Compared with placebo, at a dose of 25 mg twice daily, <b>pirenzepine</b> significantly increased all time and frequency domain measures of RR interval variability and augmented baroreceptor reflex sensitivity by 60 % (mean ± 1 SD 10. 4 ± 5. 9 vs. 6. 5 ± 3. 2 ms/mm Hg, p = 0. 0007). <b>Pirenzepine</b> and scopolamine showed a similar vagomimetic effect, but the overall incidence of adverse effects was lower with <b>pirenzepine</b> (1 [5 %] of 20 vs. 10 [50 %] of 20). Conclusions. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction, oral <b>pirenzepine</b> proved equal to transdermal scopolamine in significantly increasing indexes of cardiac vagal activity. These data suggest that oral <b>pirenzepine</b> may have a therapeutic potential for preventing malignant ventricular arrhythmias after infarction...|$|E
40|$|Eighty-four {{patients}} with healed duodenal ulcers were treated for 1 year with <b>pirenzepine,</b> 50 mg twice daily, or placebo in this double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial.

Endoscopy was also carried out whenever symptoms compatible with ulcer recurrence were present for more than 2 days. Both groups were well matched for age, sex, duration of peptic ulcer disease, and smoking habits. There were 21 drop-outs {{due to lack of}} compliance. Therefore, 32 patients treated with <b>pirenzepine</b> and 31 with placebo were included in the analysis. Expressed in cumulative percentage of recurrence, with <b>pirenzepine,</b> 28 % of the patients had a relapse at 3 months, 41 % at 6 months, and 53 % at 12 months; with placebo, the recurrence rates were 58 % at 3 months, 68 % at 6 months, and 71 % at 12 months. The mean success time at 1 year is also longer for <b>pirenzepine</b> (7. 38 months) than for placebo (5. 52 months). These differences are significantly in favor of <b>pirenzepine</b> (p less than 0. 05). Both treatments were well tolerated.

Dissociation kinetic studies indicated that the receptor types A, B, and C had different koff values allowing, therefore, a separate study of their binding properties. We observed that: [3 H]NMS recognized muscarinic receptors A, B, and C with the following order of potency: B greater than A much greater than C; and <b>pirenzepine</b> recognized these receptors with a different order of potency: A much greater than B greater than C.

Six obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (BMI range 27. 3 - 39. 8 kg/m²) were studied in random sequence, and received either placebo or <b>pirenzepine</b> (single doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg) one hour before a standard test meal.

Peak post-prandial plasma insulin concentrations were reduced significantly by all three doses used. Post-prandial integrated plasma insulin concentrations were reduced by the two higher doses.

40|$|The {{heterogeneity}} of muscarinic receptors {{has been well}} supported by differential characteristics between <b>pirenzepine</b> and atropine both in receptor binding and in whole tissue pharmacology studies. Under these conditions <b>pirenzepine</b> has been classified as a selective receptor antagonist with high affinity for M 1 receptors. The antisecretory properties of <b>pirenzepine</b> on gastric acid and pepsin secretion {{may be attributed to}} the antagonistic activity of the drug on muscarinic M 1 receptors of gastric intramural plexuses, whereas the effect on parietal muscarinic M 2 receptors seems of less importance. Additional inhibitory mechanisms on gastric secretion may be represented by pirenzepine-induced increase in somatostatin release from gastrointestinal system. Significant cytoprotective properties of <b>pirenzepine</b> have been observed on a variety of experimentally induced peptic ulcerations. This protective activity may be due to pirenzepine-induced increase in gastric mucosal blood flow {{as well as to the}} increase in gastric transmural electric potential difference. In accordance with this pharmacodynamic profile of <b>pirenzepine,</b> numerous clinical studies have revealed its efficacy in the treatment of both duodenal and gastric ulcerations.

Basal, maximum and peak acid output, basal and maximum acidity, and basal and maximum volume were calculated after computerised correction for pyloric loss and duodenal reflux. Both drugs showed dose-related inhibition of {{all facets of}} gastric secretion. Cimetidine (200 mg) had a greater inhibitory effect on gastric basal secretion, but a similar effect on pentagastrin stimulated secretion as with <b>pirenzepine</b> (50 mg). Cimetidine (400 mg) showed about twice the inhibitory activity of <b>pirenzepine</b> (50 mg) both on basal and stimulated secretion...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} acid {{secreting}} {{areas and the}} distribution of intestinal metaplasia in patients with erosive gastritis, and the healing effects of <b>pirenzepine</b> were examined. Studies were done with the endoscopic Congo red-methylene blue test developed in our hospital. Compared with control patients with no gastroduodenal disease, erosive gastritis was associated significantly more frequently with large acid secreting areas, but little or no intestinal metaplasia was detected in the stomach. A double blind trial was carried out, using 100 mg <b>pirenzepine</b> tablets or placebo for three months in 43 patients with erosive gastritis. Endoscopically, complete healing was significantly more frequent in the <b>pirenzepine</b> treated groups three months after the start of the treatment, as compared with the placebo treated group (p less than 0. 05) ...|$|E
