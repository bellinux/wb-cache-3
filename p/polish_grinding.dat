Such strings are usually made by winding round wire around a round or hex core first, then <b>polishing,</b> <b>grinding</b> (thus the name, ground wound) or pressing the exterior part of the winding until it is practically flat. This results in the flat, comfortable playing feel of flatwounds, along with less squeaking, with a brightness generally between roundwounds and flatwounds. The polishing process removes {{almost half of the}} winding wire's mass; thus, to compensate for it, manufacturers use winding wire of a heavier gauge. Because of the extra manufacturing process involved they are normally more expensive than roundwounds, but less than flatwounds.|$|R

Most of these tasks such as grinding, deburring need force control to achieve high performance. These tasks involve contour following.

40|$|Abstract — Lots of {{constrained}} {{motion control}} schemes {{have been proposed}} for robots. However, since constrained motion demands fast tracking with smooth control, few of these schemes are convenient in practice for many tasks, such as hand-control, <b>polishing,</b> <b>grinding,</b> and assembly operations. In particular, adaptive control is quite slow due to its overparametrization, while first order sliding mode control cannot be implemented because its chattering. On the other hand, second order sliding mode control demands knowledge of upper bounds. Recently, to ameliorate these limitations, the theoretical framework and sim-ulations, a synergetic combination of adaptive and second order sliding mode control has been proposed. This controller achieves simultaneous exponential convergence of position/force tracking errors with chattering-free control and without any knowledge of upper bounds. Then, it stands as a viable control technique that exhibits the best of adaptive and sliding mode control.

40|$|Abstract-Polishing is {{the process}} of {{creating}} a smooth and shiny surface by rubbing it or using a chemical action, leaving a surface with a significant spectacular reflection. When an unpolished surface is magnified thousands of times, it usually looks like mountains and valleys.

The surface of a metallographic specimen is prepared by various methods of <b>grinding,</b> <b>polishing,</b> and etching.
