50|$|Within {{a year of}} the Laser 310's release, an 80k {{disk drive}} unit was {{released}} on to the market, of which two could {{be connected to the}} computer at the same time. A plug-pack cartridge containing the DOS ROM was required to operate the drives. The DOS ROM and diskette drives were backwards compatible with the Laser 200.A number of other VTech designed plug-in peripherals were also available for both the Laser 200 and Laser 310 computers. Among them were joysticks, cassette drive, light pen, <b>printer</b> <b>plotter,</b> 75 baud MODEM, word processor cartridge, and the 16k and 64k extended RAM cartridges. As numbers of users grew, so did the number of home-made kits which were on offer, which included a Speech synthesizer, SN6847AN music synthesizer, EEPROM programmer, data logger, 300 baud MODEM, full 101 keyboard, and a RTTY Ham radio kit.|$|E
40|$|FAULT is a {{software}} {{that allows the}} qualitative and quantitative analysis of fault systems, its graphical representation on video and its output on <b>printer,</b> <b>plotter</b> and diffuse standard graphical files. The structural analysis is based on three different methods that is i) the right dihedra method (Angelier & Mechler, 1977), ii) the Conditioned Square Minima Method (Caputo & Caputo, 1988) applied on the right dihedra method and iii) applied on the P/T axes method. For analytical details and {{a better understanding of}} the methodologies, their applicability and limits the reader is referred to the original papers. FAULT allows: - the input of fault systems and their management; - the computation of the areas based on the right dihedra methods; - the computation of the principal stress/strain axes based on the Conditioned Square Minima Method applied on the areas deriving from the right dihedra method; - the computation of the principal stress/strain axes based on the Conditioned Square Minima Method applied on the P/T axes method; - the output of the original data and the obtained results on several devices (video, plotter and printer). It is also possible to create files to send directly to the plotter and, furthermore, it is possible to create standard graphical files readable by most commercial software on the topic (AutoCAD, CorelDraw, FreeHand, PhotoShop and others). Before running the programme FAULT, you need to install it on your computer (see Appendix G). The flow chart of the programme is shown in figure 1...|$|E

50|$|Laser {{printers}} {{combine the}} best features of both <b>printers</b> and <b>plotters.</b> Like <b>plotters,</b> laser <b>printers</b> offer high quality line art, and like dot-matrix printers, {{they are able}} to generate pages of text and raster graphics. Unlike either <b>printers</b> or <b>plotters,</b> however, a laser printer makes it possible to position high-quality graphics and text on the same page. PostScript made it possible to fully exploit these characteristics, by offering a single control language that could be used on any brand of printer.|$|R

50|$|Boatto {{started his}} career as an art {{director}} with a well-known advertisement company but soon after he left for the United States, where he went to San Francisco to attend the Academy of Art College. After completing his formation he was requested to teach there but he preferred {{to move back to}} Venice and start a new career as an independent painter. His connections with the advertisements agencies brought him to create many artworks that have been used for advertising on giant billboards. At that time, in the 1980s and early 1990s, no computer or <b>printer</b> <b>plotters</b> could have done that job but, soon after, in the late 1990s, he was then replaced by the machines, although his point of view as an artist is still looked after from the establishment.|$|R

50|$|In <b>printers</b> and <b>plotters,</b> {{paper is}} {{typically}} electrostatically charged by passing {{it over a}} bar containing {{hundreds or thousands of}} charging contacts. As paper passes over it, an image is formed by either applying or removing a charge from each individual contact. The result is a grid of charged dots on the paper. Toner is then applied as described above.|$|R

In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer-aided design, though they have generally been replaced with wide-format conventional <b>printers.</b> A <b>plotter</b> gives a hard copy of the output.

40|$|Several {{computers}} and several tens of terminals at the University of Natal {{are linked to}} a terminal switching exchange network known as NUNET, which is in fact part of a country-wide network known as NllNET. This thesis describes software that was written to enhance {{the usefulness of the}} network, particularly in the Department of Electronic Engineering. The enhancements include a simple facility to provide help to users of the network, and programs that allow various computers in the Department of Electronic Engineering to create and close network connections. The programs that create and close network connections are used to provide access to <b>printers</b> and <b>plotters</b> that are connected to the network and shared by several computers. Access to peripherals through the network has been integrated into existing <b>printer</b> and <b>plotter</b> driver programs on some of the computers, thus allowing the network to be completely transparent to the user. The same network access programs also allow connections to be made between computers for the purpose of file transfers. Prefac...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, this {{technology}} was first developed at RCA (Radio Corporation of America). Subsequently, many office machine companies, including SCM (Smith Corona Marchant), Savin, etc., introduced copiers that utilized this technology.

Programs like vtroff, by Tom Ferrin at UCSF, consequently justified early more expensive laser printers.|$|R

This means that plotters are vector graphics devices, rather than raster graphics as with other <b>printers.</b> Pen <b>plotters</b> can draw complex line art, including text, but do so slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens. They are often incapable of efficiently creating a solid region of color, but can hatch an area by drawing a number of close, regular lines.|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 14 - 16, 1978 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe {{requirement}} to acquire, process, and display telemetry data from increasingly sophisticated test vehicles {{in real time}} is one of the, principal parameters that shaped the SAMTEC Telemetry Integrated Processing System (TIPS) design. An integrated subsystem incorporating advances in hardware design, linked by a multi-processor software element implementing three distinct processing functions to fill this requirement, is described in this paper. Most of the hardware elements, except the processor, were {{designed to meet the}} specific requirements of this system. This includes telemetry front-end acquisition equipment, electrostatic high speed <b>printer</b> <b>plotters,</b> plasma keyboard displays, and wide band links to transfer data from element to element. The processors are 32 -bit word third generation midi-computers. Each element was selected or specified primarily for its ability to perform at the expected incoming data rates. The Real Time Acquisition (RTA) Software is partitioned into an executive function, an acquisition and event processing function, and a display processing function. Each function resides in its own specific computer configuration. The acquisition configuration (TPP) and display configuration (QLDA) are each replicated to provide multi-input stream and multiple independent display capabilities. Real time requirements, similar to those at SAMTEC, are evolving elsewhere. The hardware and software components described herein are easily adaptable to satisfy these requirements at a variety of other advanced telemetry data processing facilities...|$|R
