While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get <b>paid</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|As of March 2011, {{paid leave}} {{benefits}} {{continued to be}} the most widely available benefit offered by employers in the United States, with paid vacations available to 91 percent of full-time workers in private industry. Access to these benefits, however, varied by employee and establishment characteristics. In private industry, paid vacation benefits were available to only 37 percent of part-time workers. <b>Paid</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave</b> was available to 75 percent of full-time workers and 27 percent of part-time workers. Paid vacations were available to 90 percent of workers earning wages in the highest 10th percent of private industry employees and only to 38 percent of workers in the lowest 10 percent of private industry wage earners. Access to <b>paid</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave</b> benefits ranged from 21 percent for the lowest wage category to 87 percent for the highest wage category. These data are from the National Compensation Survey (NCS), which provides comprehensive measures of compensation cost trends and incidence and provisions of employee benefit plans.|$|E

3000|$|... 2 change, an {{additional}} 6 % {{of the variance}} in organizational commitment was explained by the availability of FFPs (p[*]<[*]. 001). Among the family-friendly policies, <b>paid</b> <b>leave</b> (p[*]<[*]. 001), <b>sick</b> <b>leave</b> (p[*]=[*]. 006), childcare leave (p[*]=[*]. 012), and support for housing (p[*]<[*]. 001) were statistically significant predictors of employees’ organizational commitment. This means that employees who are eligible to apply for <b>paid</b> <b>leave,</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> childcare leave, and support for housing are likely to show slightly higher levels of organizational commitment than those who are not [...]. Like job satisfaction, mandatory FFPs were more likely to affect job satisfaction than voluntary FFPs. Also, subsidized family event cost was a marginally significant predictor of organizational commitment (p[*]=[*]. 1). On the other hand, childcare costs did not statistically have an effect on organizational commitment. In other words, the availability of these three family-friendly programs would not contribute to predicting organizational commitment.|$|R
25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{conflicts}} between the company and employees, Sydvaranger started using single-person contracts. These offered higher wages and more welfare advantages, such as <b>paid</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> than the collective bargaining agreements, and were used by the company to reduce the trade unions' influence {{in an attempt to}} reduce strikes. However, the move resulted in trade unions striking between 12 May 1928 and 13 April 1929, without them succeeding in reducing the output. The conflict resulting in intra-worker {{conflicts between the}} strikers and non-unionized. In 1928 Sydvaranger exported 500,000 tonnes and Tårnelven Kraftaksjeselskap started construction of a power station in Kobbholmvassdraget.

25|$|Disability Insurance, {{often called}} DI or {{disability}} income insurance, or income protection, {{is a form}} of insurance that insures the beneficiary's earned income against the risk that a disability creates a barrier for a worker to complete the core functions of their work. For example, the worker may suffer from an inability to maintain composure in the case of psychological disorders or an injury, illness or condition that causes physical impairment or incapacity to work. It encompasses <b>paid</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> short-term disability benefits (STD), and long-term disability benefits (LTD). Statistics show that in the US a disabling accident occurs, on average, once every second. In fact, nearly 18.5% of Americans are currently living with a disability, and 1 out of every 4 persons in the US workforce will suffer a disabling injury before retirement.|$|E
500|$|Wolf {{has been}} a {{consistent}} supporter of mandated paid sick days for employees, with his company Cape Air offering paid leave for all employees. Wolf, along with Kay Khan in the House of Representatives, introduced the [...] "2013 Earned Paid Sick Time" [...] bill, which would allow employees to one hour of <b>paid</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave</b> for every thirty worked. To generate support among other Senators, Wolf {{went so far as}} to hold a protest with workers' rights activists at a Dunkin' Donuts frequented by legislators. While advocating for the bill in a committee hearing, Wolf admitted “it never occurred to me that there were that many businesses out there that didn't offer this as a benefit,” and referred to the experience as “an eye-opener.” Although the proposal eventually expired without being passed, for reasons Wolf described as a compromise with the legislature having already passed an incremental minimum wage increase, he campaigned for a ballot measure in 2014 which would mandate universal employee sick time.|$|E
30|$|I {{measured}} {{the availability of}} FFPs with the participants’ responses to the questions of whether an individual employee is entitled to receive family-friendly programs by his/her organization or employer. Six family-friendly programs were included in this study: <b>paid</b> <b>leave,</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> childcare leave, partial payment of childcare expenses, partial payment of family events (marriage, funeral, etc.), and support for housing (mortgage loan, etc.). The availability of FFPs was assessed by surveying individuals with questions such as “Are you entitled to receive to paid leave?” and “Are you entitled to receive childcare expenses?” Respondents were asked to answer ‘yes’ if they can apply to a certain family-friendly program and ‘no’ if they cannot, or the respondent answered “I don’t know”. The responses were dummy coded into 0 [*]=[*]no and 1 [*]=[*]yes.|$|R

It debated important issues for women {{such as the}} dress reform, and organized protests against the regulated prostitution {{in line with the}} Svenska Federationen.|$|R
30|$|In addition, the {{literature}} on FFPs has mainly focused on <b>paid</b> <b>leave,</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> childcare leave, and subsidized childcare costs (e.g., Grover and Crooker 1995). In addition to these policies, this research included various family-friendly policies such as partial payment of family event expenses and support for housing, which are unique family supportive programs in South Korea. Grounded in collectivism and Confucianism, South Korea has emphasized solidarity, cooperation, and mutual help. Subsidized family event cost reflects such values. Also, high housing expenses of South Korea contribute {{to the benefit of}} support for housing. With high housing prices, Cheonse lease contract, which is unique to South Korea, requires tenants to make a significant deposit. These contextual factors explain why employers provide the benefit of support for housing expenses. Workers with a dependent family, particularly married employees, are likely to benefit from this program.|$|R
2500|$|After {{steady growth}} over {{the first half of}} the century, {{including}} winning <b>paid</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> annual leave and a forty-hour week, the union really took off in the 1950s. A new [...] leadership led by Ray Gietzelt took over to create a vibrant, member-driven union.

2500|$|PEF {{has also}} been active in {{endorsing}} candidates for political office. [...] But some of these endorsements have proven highly contentious within the union. [...] In 1990, PEF endorsed Mario Cuomo for governor, but the endorsement was bitterly debated within the union and the support PEF pledged to Cuomo's re-election effort was considered [...] "tepid". PEF remained neutral in Cuomo's 1994 re-election campaign. Cuomo was defeated for re-election by George Pataki. PEF remained neutral again during Pataki's successful 1998 re-election bid. But in 2002, PEF supported Pataki for election to a third term. According to PEF President Roger Benson, the endorsement was {{a quid pro quo}} for Pataki's promise to add three days of <b>paid</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave</b> to the union's collective bargaining agreement and for a promise not to lay off any state workers in the following budget year. Some PEF members were deeply angered by the union's endorsement, however, and an internal union poll of the union's health care division showed they overwhelmingly supported Pataki's opponent (New York Comptroller H. Carl McCall). Pro-McCall members of the union submitted a resolution to the union's annual convention which would have rescinded the endorsement. PEF members voted down the resolution on October 8, 2002. In 2006, PEF endorsed New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in his successful run for governor. That same year, Andrew Cuomo ran to replace Spitzer as New York State Attorney General. PEF declined to endorse Cuomo, instead backing New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green in his unsuccessful bid for that office. On July 21, 2009, PEF leaders indicated they might not support David Paterson in the Democratic primary if he chooses to run for re-election as governor.|$|E

30|$|The {{findings}} {{of this study suggest that}} <b>paid</b> <b>leave,</b> <b>sick</b> <b>leave,</b> support for housing, childcare leave, and subsidized family-event costs enhance employees’ positive attitudes. However, the effects of those policies on job satisfaction and organizational commitment were not great. This may be because this study investigated the relationships between the availability of family-friendly programs, rather than use of such programs, and attitudes. The respondents who were eligible for applying for these family supportive policies may not have taken advantage of them, and this in turn means that organizational commitment and job satisfaction were less affected by these particular FFPs (Thompson et al. 2004). Therefore, regarding FFPs in general, availability alone may not affect job satisfaction and commitment toward the organizations. Future research should be conducted on the relationships between use of family-friendly programs and job satisfaction and organizational commitment.|$|R
