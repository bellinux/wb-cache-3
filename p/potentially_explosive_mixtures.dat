It {{is a powerful}} oxidizer when hot, but its aqueous solutions up to approximately 70% by weight at room temperature are generally safe, only showing strong acid features and no oxidizing properties. Perchloric acid is useful for preparing perchlorate salts, especially ammonium perchlorate, an important rocket fuel component.

30|$|Hydrogen (H 2) {{is a kind}} of more {{efficient}} and clean source of energy which has been used in automobiles, aircraft, fuel cells, and chemical industries, etc. [8, 9]. Since H 2 gas is colorless, odorless, highly volatile, and inflammable [9], the detection at room temperature (RT) is very important for chemical industries and environmental applications. Detection sensor is a usual method to alarm the formation of <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> of H 2 in air ambient and therefore to prevent the risk of explosions and fires [10, 11, 12]. RT H 2 gas sensor also attracts much attention in other fields because of their particularly low power consumption [13], the ability to be used safely in flammable environments [14], and long lifetime [15].|$|E

40|$|The Department of Energy {{mandated}} {{the termination}} of the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) Program, effective October 1, 1994. To comply with this decision, Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W) prepared a plan providing detailed requirements to maintain the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) in a radiologically and industrially safe condition, including removal of all irradiated fuel assemblies from the reactor plant, and removal and stabilization of the primary and secondary sodium, a liquid metal used to transfer heat within the reactor plant. The EBR-II is a pool-type reactor. The primary system contained approximately 325 m{sup 3 } (86, 000 gallons) of sodium and the secondary system contained 50 m{sub 3 } (13, 000 gallons). In order to properly dispose of the sodium {{in compliance with the}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), a facility was built to react the sodium to a solid sodium hydroxide monolith for burial as a low level waste in a land disposal facility. Deactivation of a liquid metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR) presents unique concerns. Residual amounts of sodium remaining in circuits and components must be passivated, inerted, or removed to preclude future concerns with sodium-air reactions that could generate <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> of hydrogen and leave corrosive compounds. The passivation process being implemented utilizes a moist carbon dioxide gas that generates a passive layer of sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate over any quantities of residual sodium. Tests being conducted will determine the maximum depths of sodium that can be reacted using this method, defining the amount that must be dealt with later to achieve RCRA clean closure. Deactivation of the EBR-II complex is on schedule for a March, 2002, completion. Each system associated with EBR-II has an associated layup plan defining the system end state, as well as instructions for achieving the layup condition. A goal of system-by-system layup is to minimize surveillance and maintenance requirements during the interim period between deactivation and decommissioning. The plans also establish document archival of not only all the closure documents, but also the key plant documents (P and IDs, design bases, characterization data, etc.) in a convenient location to assure the appropriate knowledge base is available for decommissioning, which could occur decades in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} and engineering {{demands of the}} Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Restoration and Waste Management tasks are enormous. For example, several thousand metric tons of metallic uranium spent nuclear fuel (SNF) remain in water storage awaiting disposition. Of this inventory, 2300 metric tons are N-Reactor fuel that have been stored for up to 24 years in the Hanford, Washington KBasins. No significant precautions were taken to prevent the fuel from corroding since the fuel rods were intended to be reprocessed. Termination of reprocessing has left these fuels stranded in prolonged water storage and an appreciable quantity of the fuel has corroded. In addition, other defense fuels including the aluminum-clad fuels at the Savannah River Site and Idaho National Engineering Laboratory have corroded during interim storage in water. In 1994, the DOE began to implement a strategy for moving water-stored Hanford fuels into dry interim storage and a Record of Decision 1 (ROD) documenting this action was put forth by the Department of Energy on March 4, 1996. Several documents 1 - 4 including this ROD and the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) 1, evaluated and documented concerns regarding the potential for releases of radionuclides to the environment. The DOE plans to remove metallic uranium SNF from water storage and seal it in overpack canisters for ''dry'' interim storage, for up to 75 years. Much of the SNF that will be stored will have been severely corroded during water storage. Chemically bound water not removed during proposed drying operations may lead to long-term corrosion and generation of combustible H 2 and O 2 gas-mixture via radiolysis. No thoroughly tested model is currently available to predict fuel behavior during ''dry'' storage. The PNNL collaborating with the Rutgers University studied the thermo-chemical and radiolytic reactions of actual and prototype SNF materials. The purpose of this project is to deliver pertinent information {{which can be used}} to make decisions concerning the safety and treatment issues associated with dry storage of spent nuclear fuel materials. In particular, we set out to establish an understanding of: (1) water interactions with failed-fuel rods and metal-oxide materials; (2) the role of thermal processes and radiolysis (solid-state and interfacial) in the generation of <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures</b> of gaseous H 2 and O 2, and (3) the potential role of radiation assisted corrosion during fuel rod storage. The project meets several major DOE/EMSP science needs for the Spent Nuclear Fuel Focus Area: (1) Stabilization of spent nuclear fuel, including mechanism of pyrophoricity and combustion parameters for various fuel types; (2) Characterization of spent nuclear fuel; (3) Development of methods to remove moisture without damage to fuel elements; and (4) Characterization of corrosion, degradation, and radionuclide release mechanisms, kinetics, and rates for fuel matrices...|$|E
40|$|A fatal {{explosion}} {{in a sealed}} area at the Sago Mine in 2006 prompted researchers and regulators in the United States to re-examine the requirements for explosion-resistant mine seals. Seals are used in underground coal mines to isolate abandoned mining areas from active workings. Prior to the Sago disaster, mining regulations required seals to withstand a 140 kPa explosion pressure. Recent research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory showed that pressures from explosions can far exceed this pressure. U. S. mining regulations now require much stronger seals. Current research focuses on understanding the science, engineering and management of sealed areas of coal mines. Scientific efforts seek understanding of how <b>explosive</b> methane-air <b>mixtures</b> accumulate using measurements and models of the sealed area atmosphere. Additional scientific efforts aim to understand the explosion pressures that can develop {{using a combination of}} numerical modeling and experiments. Engineering efforts aim to produce design guidelines for seals that can resist the new higher pressure design criteria. NIOSH researchers are also developing guidance for monitoring of sealed area atmospheres and inertization of <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> gas <b>mixtures</b> within sealed areas. This paper seeks to encourage scientific discussion among international peers since preventing explosions within sealed areas is of interest to underground coal operators and regulators...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{drawing on}} {{research}} in The National Archives, I discuss {{the claim that}} Thomas Cromwell protected religious radicals in Calais in the late 1530 s. It has become a seemingly impregnable orthodoxy that Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's leading minister, was a religious reformer, though exactly what kind is less often considered. Whatever {{the finer points of}} his theological standpoint, Cromwell is then confidently presented as pressing Henry VIII into ever more protestant directions, and consequently leaving himself vulnerable to the charges of religious radicalism that ultimately brought him down in 1540. And on this view Cromwell supposedly used Calais as a sort of laboratory or model for the religious reforms that he supposedly sought, reforms that - it is asserted - went beyond what Henry VIII was willing to accept in England. Such an account is, I aim to show, seriously misleading. Cromwell emerges as the king’s servant, not as the leader of some proto-protestant faction. More positively, my study aims to offers intriguing insights into the character of the church as it developed after the break with Rome. If these events in Calais have too long been misunderstood, nonetheless they have a wider significance. Here, as early as the late 1530 s, we can see features that would characterise church and state over a much longer period, not least in the reigns of Elizabeth, James and Charles I. Here we have fears of papists and papist plots, with suspicions that a leading nobleman in a position of authority and strategic importance, Lord Lisle, Lord Deputy of Calais, owed greater loyalty to the pope than to the monarch. Here we have fears of religious radicalism and the associated undermining of social order as preachers were seen as ridiculing existing church services. Here we have charges of papist sympathies by one side and of religious radicalism by the other, dismissed in turn as exaggerated or prejudiced. Here we have damaging accusations against those in authority in church and state, of encouraging, or turning a blind eye to, what they were expected to repress. Here we have royal government somewhere in the middle, denouncing the pope and rejecting blatant superstition, but also denouncing religious extremism. None of this was trivial. Lives and liberties were at stake: those who fell foul of accusations, whether well-founded, whether malicious, found themselves subject to interrogation, trial, even death. Compared to the late 1530 s, accusations of popery and of religious radicalism were no doubt sharper in the years following Queen Elizabeth’s suspension of Archbishop Grindal in the late 1570 s, and fears of popery and fears of religious radicalism were undoubtedly more heightened and more persuasive in 1640 - 42. Yet this study of events in Calais in the late 1530 s reveals, already, the same <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>mixture</b> of divisions and suspicions. Not just in the long run but also very immediately, all this was the complex and often unhappy consequence of Henry VIII’s break with Rome and the very distinctive reformation which he had embraced...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerning}} the safety relevant {{layout of the}} environment of a mercury based 5 -Megawatt-spallation target. All safety relevant aspects related to construction, operation and dismantling as well economical issues were taken into account. Safety concerns are basically driven by the toxic and radioactive inventory {{as well as the}} kind and intensity of radiation produced by the spallation process. Due to significant differences in inventory and radiation between a spallation source and a fission reactor, for the design of the spallation source mentioned above the safety philosophy of a fission reactor must not be used unchanged. Rather than this a systematic study of all safety related boundary conditions is necessary. Within this thesis all safety relevant boundary conditions for this specific type of machine are given. Beside the spatial distribution of different areas inside the target station, influence of medias to be used as well as arising radiation and handling requirements are discussed in detail. A general layout of the target station is presented, serving as a basis for all further component and system development. An enclosure concept for the target station was developed, taking into account the safety relevant issues concerning the mercury used as target materials, the water cooling loops containing massive amounts of tritium as well as the materials used for the moderators <b>potentially</b> forming <b>explosive</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Concept and detailed technical layout of the enclosure system was chosen to guarantee safe operation of the source as well as taking care of requirement arising for handling needs. For design of the shielding different suitable materials have been discussed. A design for assembling the shielding is shown taking into account the safety relevant equirements during operation as well as during dismantling. The neutron beam shutters, buried inside the shielding were designed to optimize handling and positioning issued of the inner part of the neutron guide system. Due to the high amount of safety relevant handling procedures, concepts for time efficient and safe handling of the major components have been developed. Based on the concepts shown is this thesis, construction an operation of a high power spallation source of the described kind seem to be feasible considering safety and costs...|$|R
