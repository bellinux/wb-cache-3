50|$|Soviet {{government}} archives {{show that}} parties of Bolshevik operatives sent from the Smolny by Lenin took over all critical centers {{of power in}} Petrograd {{in the early hours}} of the first night without a shot being fired. This was completed so efficiently that the takeover resembled the changing of the guard. The capture of the Winter Palace was more dramatic, with the Red Guards storming it at 2:10a.m. on 26 October 1917. The Cossacks deserted when the Red Guard approached, and the Cadets and the 140 volunteers of the Women's Battalion surrendered rather than resist the 40,000 strong army. The Aurora was commandeered to then fire blanks at the palace in a symbolic act of rejection of the government. The effectively unoccupied Winter Palace fell not because of acts of courage or a military barrage, but because the back door was left open, allowing the Red Guard to enter. A Red Guard named Adamovich remembered gasping as he burst into the palace, as he had never before seen such luxury and splendour. A small group broke in, got lost in the cavernous interior, and accidentally ran into the remnants of Kerensky's provisional government in the imperial family's breakfast room. The illiterate revolutionaries then compelled those arrested to write up their own <b>arrest</b> papers. The <b>Provisional</b> Government was <b>arrested</b> and imprisoned in Peter and Paul Fortress after the ministers resigned to fate and surrendered without a fight, and officially overthrown.|$|R

50|$|On 20 January 2015, Guzmán {{requested}} another injunction {{through his}} lawyer Andrés Granados Flores to prevent his extradition to the U.S. His defense argued {{that if he}} were to be extradited and judged in a foreign court, his constitutional rights would be violated as expressed in Articles 1, 14, 16, 17, 18 and 20 of the Constitution of Mexico. The decision of his defense was made after Attorney General Murillo Karam said at a press conference that the U.S. was pushing to formally request his extradition. The PGR and Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Affairs stated that Guzmán had a <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest</b> with extradition purposes from the U.S. government since 17 February 2001, but that the formal proceedings to officiate the extradition were not realized because investigators considered that the request was outdated and believed it would have been difficult to gather potential witnesses. Murillo Karam said that the Mexican government would process the request when they deemed it appropriate. He asked for a second injunction preventing his extradition on 26 January. Mexico City federal judge Fabricio Villegas asked federal authorities to confirm in 24 hours if there was a pending extradition request against Guzmán. In a press conference the following day, Murillo Karam said that he was expecting a request from Washington, but said that they would not extradite him until he faces charges and completes his sentences in Mexico. If all the charges are added up, Guzmán may receive a sentence between 300 and 400 years.|$|E
40|$|Ao apontar os pontos principais da presente dissertação, visando atingir o grau de mestre em Filosofia do Direito, partindo da investida em esclarecer as relações íntimas entre a liberdade humana de locomoção e as restrições impostas pelo estado com a prisão cautelar, os estudos escoam para a constatação da restrição da liberdade em casos precisos apontados pela lei, sem deixar de lado outras possibilidades a serem adotadas como formas de prisão cautelar, como se deu com a adoção da prisão temporária em 1989, com a Lei nº 7. 960, de 21 de dezembro. A dinâmica da liberdade deve ser visualizada com a conexão entre o seu desenvolvimento, sua evolução e sua origem, todos estes pontos baseados no avanço histórico e filosófico do instituto. Talvez pela sua importância, a liberdade serviu de introdução para os temas relacionados à prisão cautelar, iniciando-se os estudos dos fundamentos desta e, logo em seguida, as noções básicas sobre o instituto da prisão cautelar foram também estudadas em seus principais aspectos. Isso tudo para atingir os princípios autorizadores das espécies de restrições da liberdade promovidas pelo estado, sem exaltar a natureza principiológica da liberdade num cenário de princípios e regras que podem estabelecer colisões em diversos formatos, quais sejam as colisões entre princípios e normas, ou somente entre normas ou unicamente entre princípios. Embora seja elevada a ocorrência no meio social brasileiro, como já chegou perto da metade das prisões ocorrentes durante um ano, a prisão cautelar não ocupa o mesmo espaço no meio doutrinário, alcançando um vazio sem precedentes na Filosofia do Direito. A realidade da prisão cautelar apresenta-se como caótica, conclamando mudanças imperativas, contribuindo aqui o determinismo em dois aspectos, um para compreender a realidade e outro para transformar a situação lamentável em condições palatáveis para a vida em sociedade. O estado atual desordenado não se apresenta como idôneo para modificações futuras, contudo, atesta-se positivamente que as hipóteses de prisão cautelar são conhecidas por todos. Para o equilíbrio futuro da prisão cautelar, as confusões elementares devem ser desfeitas e a arrumação do presente deve ter por base os erros e acertos do passado e, somente assim, o futuro de estabilidade será atingido com precisãoTo {{point the}} main {{points of the}} present dissertation, aiming at to reach the degree of master in Legal Philosophy, leaving of the onslaught in {{clarifying}} the close relations between the freedom locomotion human being and the restrictions imposed for the government with the action for a <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest,</b> the studies flow off the finding of the restriction of the freedom in specific cases pointed by the law, while other possibilities to be adopted as forms of action for a <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest,</b> as occurred with {{the adoption of the}} temporary arrest in 1989, by the Law nº 7960, of December 21 st. The dynamics of the freedom must be displayed with the connection between its development, its evolution and its origination, all these points based on the historical and philosophical progress of the institute. Likely for its importance, the freedom served as an introduction for the subjects related to the action for a <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest,</b> initiating the studies of beddings of this and, then, immediately afterwards, the basic slight knowledge on the institute of the action for a <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest</b> also had been studied in its main aspects. All this to reach the principles authorizer of the species of restrictions of the freedom promoted by the government, without sublime the nature of the freedom in a scene of principles and rules that can establish collisions in several formats, which are the collisions between principles and norms, or only between norms or solely between principles. Although the occurrence in the Brazilian social environment is raised, as already approximate close to the half of the arrests occurred during one year, the action for a <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest</b> the same does not occupy space in the entourage doctrinaire, reaching an emptiness without precedents in the Legal philosophy.

40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{correctness}} of the application of <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest</b> represents the bulk of case law addressed by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which considers each case {{through the prism of}} conventional standards. In accordance with article 5 § 1 c) Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, remand shall apply to „the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fl eeing after having done so” Against this background is the issue of threat of severe punishment (article 258 § 2 p. p. c.) as an independent rationale for the provisional application of arrest. Important, therefore, is that this provision does not provide for the application of on remand in custody on grounds of threat of severe punishment. In both ECHR case-law and related literature, the view is accepted that threat of severe punishment may be justifi ed on the presumption that the accused will interfere with the investigation in its early stages. However, {{with the passage of time}} and the development of evidence this argument loses ground. ECHR allows use of the premise but only under certain conditions: availability of supporting evidence, the time at which it will be applied during the provisional stage, the length of detention period envisaged, whether the application of <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest</b> can be justifi ed in preparatory proceedings over time. Hence, recognition by the Supreme Court that the threat of severe punishment is a premise for the provisional application of an arrest warrant is at least questionable, especially in view of the revision of article. 258 § 2 p. p. c., and new interpretation of the provision that denies the wording expressed by the Supreme Court in its resolution of 19 January 2012. Therefore, it should be adopted that the interpretation of articles. 258 § 2 p. p. c. presented by the Supreme Court in its previously cited resolution, confl icts with the conventional standards referred to in article 5 § 1 c) of the ECHR.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the widely ignored but important issue regarding the <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest</b> and detention of persons suspected of having committed international crimes by international or internationalized courts.

40|$|V diplomskem delu bom govoril o Mednarodnem kazenskem sodišču (MKS). Gre za neodvisno stalno sodno instanco, ki je bila ustanovljena z Rimskim statutom leta 1998 in ima sedež v Haagu na Nizozemskem. Pristojno je za najhujša kazniva dejanja mednarodnega značaja kot so genocid, hudodelstva zoper človečnost, vojna hudodelstva in agresija, ki so storjena s strani fizičnih oseb na ozemlju katere od držav, ki so podpisnice Rimskega statuta. Prav tako ima MKS svoje neodvisne organe: sodnike, tožilstvo in tajništvo, ki jih sestavljajo najuglednejši strokovnjaki na področju kazenskega prava in drugih pravnih področjih, kot so mednarodno humanitarno pravo in pravo človekovih pravic. Za nemoteno delovanje sodišča je potrebno tudi sodelovanje držav pogodbenic, katere so dolžne sodelovati s sodiščem pri preiskavi in pregonu kaznivih dejanj, ki spadajo pod njeno pristojnost. Eni izmed glavnih oblik sodelovanja sta predaja oseb sodišču in začasen odvzem prostosti osebam, za katere sodišče zahteva predajo. Države pogodbenice morajo za uspešno sodelovanje s sodiščem prilagoditi tudi svoje notranje pravo. Republika Slovenija je v ta namen sprejela ZSMKS, kateri ureja področja, ki jih opredeljuje Rimski statut in pred tem niso imela pravne podlage v slovenski zakonodaji. Prav tako je bil slovenski zakonodajalec primoran poseči tudi v spremembe Ustave, kot je sprejetje 3. a člena in sprememba 47. člena ustave, ki opredeljuje predajo osebe.

The ICC has its own independent bodies: the judges, the prosecution and the Registry, which consist of the most prominent experts in the field of criminal law and other areas of law such as international humanitarian law and human rights. For the court to function smoothly the participation of the State Parties is required. They are obliged to cooperate with the ICC in the investigation and prosecution of crimes falling within its jurisdiction. One of the main forms of cooperation is surrendering persons to the court and <b>provisional</b> <b>arrest.</b> The State Parties should also adjust its internal law for the successful cooperation with the ICC. The Republic of Slovenia has for this purpose adopted ZSMKS, which implements articles defined by the Rome Statute that had not had a legal basis in the Slovenian legislation before.
