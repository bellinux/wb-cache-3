5|$|The highest {{surviving}} {{rocks on}} Helvellyn, {{found on the}} summit plateaux of Helvellyn itself and of Nethermost Pike, and along the crest of Striding Edge, are the volcaniclastic sandstones of the Deepdale Sandstone Formation. Again, this formation is confined {{to the limits of}} the caldera, and represents another return to erosion and sedimentary deposition within a caldera lake, though with layers of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rock</b> showing that the volcanism had not entirely finished.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is split}} into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western {{two thirds of the}} watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rock.</b> Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> are {{the product}} of {{explosive}} volcanism. They are often felsic (high in silica). <b>Pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> are often the result of volcanic debris, such as ash, bombs and tephra, and other volcanic ejecta.

50|$|Klein & Vieira (1980a; b), Klein et al. (1984), Geraldes & Netto (2004a), Silveira et al. (2005), Valente et al. (2005), etc., {{concluded}} the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> and their neighbours {{present at the}} Contenda <b>Rock</b> are <b>pyroclastic</b> flows, using the layered structure as proof. Motoki et al. (2007c) {{concluded the}} development degree and horizontal continuity of the pyroclastic textures are too poor for a pyroclastic flow deposit. The <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> along the Eugênia River are exposed, forming pyroclastic dykes, presenting underground subvolcanic fissures. If the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> originated from <b>pyroclastic</b> flows, the deposits should have been widely present in the Fluminense lowland, such as Mesquita, Nilopolis, Nova Iguaçu, and Duque de Caxias. Welded <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> resist weathering and are therefore easily identified. Such volcanic deposits are {{not found in the}} Fluminense lowland. This confirms that these <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> were not created in pyroclastic flows.|$|R
40|$|The Wind River gold {{prospect}} {{is located}} in TSN, R 7 E of Skamania County, Washington, and is an epithermal gold-quartz vein system hosted in volcanic rocks of the Ohanapecosh Formation, a late Eocene to middle Oligocene unit of calcalkaline chemical composition. Andesitic <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Ohanapecosh Formation are the host of mineralization in the study area, and form the lowest of several stratigraphic subunits. These <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> are overlain by two sequences of lava flows which cap the ridges and are folded by an anticlinal warp over the length of Paradise Ridge, plunging gently to the southeast. Toward the west, the number of flows decreases {{and the proportion of}} intercalated <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> increases. Numerous dikes cut the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> at the Wind River prospect. Geochemical data show these dikes to have been feeders for the overlying lava flows. Differing degrees of alteration of the dikes relative to the most intensely altered <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rocks</b> which they cut indicates a complex history of overlapping hydrothermal and volcanic activity at the prospect...|$|R
25|$|The geology of the undersea {{portion of}} the tunnel {{consists}} of volcanic rock, <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rock,</b> and sedimentary rock of the Neogene Period. The area is folded into a nearly vertical syncline, {{which means that the}} youngest rock is in the centre of the strait and encountered last. Divided roughly into thirds, the Honshū side consists of volcanic rocks (andesite, basalt etc.); the Hokkaido side consists of sedimentary rocks (Tertiary period tuff, mudstone, etc.); and the centre portion consists of Kuromatsunai strata (Tertiary period sand-like mudstone). Igneous intrusions and faults caused crushing of the rock and complicated the tunnelling procedures.|$|E
25|$|At {{least three}} phases of eruptive {{activity}} {{have been recognized}} at Mount Fee. The only exposed remnant of Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor outcrop of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rock.</b> This is evidence of explosive eruptions during Fee's eruptive history, {{as well as its}} first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of volcanic rocks on Fee's eastern flank. This volcanic material was likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of the ancestral Mount Fee. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lavas on its northern flank. The U-shaped crevice separating the two main summits of Mount Fee separates this lava flow from the main volcanic ridge. The conduit from which these lava flows originated was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older rocks deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{southeast}} of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north-south trending ridge. It {{is one of}} the older volcanic features in the central Garibaldi chain. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacai ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining product from Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rock.</b> This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event.

500|$|Lying in {{the middle}} of the Mount Cayley {{volcanic}} field is a subglacial volcano named Slag Hill. At least two geological units compose the edifice. Slag Hill proper consists of andesite lava flows and small amounts of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rock.</b> Lying on the western portion of Slag Hill is a lava flow that likely erupted less than 10,000years ago due to the lack of features indicating volcano-ice interactions.

500|$|The Mount Cayley massif, [...] in elevation, is {{the largest}} and most {{persistent}} volcano in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. It is a highly eroded stratovolcano composed of dacite and rhyodacite lava that was deposited during three phases of volcanic activity. The first eruptive phase started about four million years ago with the eruption of dacite lava flows and <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>rock.</b> This resulted {{in the creation of the}} Mount Cayley proper. Subsequent volcanism during this volcanic phase constructed a significant lava dome.

After the Mount Cayley proper was constructed, lava flows, tephra and welded dacite rubble was erupted. This second phase of activity [...] million years ago resulted in the creation of the Vulcan's Thumb, a craggy volcanic ridge on the southern flank of the Mount Cayley proper. Lengthy dissection from an extended period of erosion demolished much of the original stratovolcano. Volcanic activity after this prolonged period of erosion produced thick dacite lava flows from parasitic vents 300,000years ago that extended into the Turbid and Shovelnose Creek valleys near the Squamish River. This subsequently created two minor parasitic lava domes 200,000years ago. These three volcanic events in contrast to several others around Cayley in that they do not show signs of interaction with glacial ice.|$|E

50|$|Case {{hardening}} is a weathering {{phenomenon of}} rock surface induration.

30|$|Effusive {{eruption}} {{occurs when}} the magma flows into the water or deep water; meanwhile, the outer part of lava flow undergoes the quick cooling and quenching, while the inner part continues moving.
