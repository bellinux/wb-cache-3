50|$|The term van {{may also}} {{refer to a}} minivan. However, minivans are usually {{distinguished}} by their smaller size and traditionally front wheel drive powertrain, although many now are being equipped with four wheel drive. Minivans typically offer seven or eight <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> <b>capacity</b> (similar to the smallest full-sized vans), and better fuel economy than full-sized vans, {{at the expense of}} power, cargo space, and towing capacity. In addition, many new minivans have dual side sliding doors.|$|R
40|$|Using data envelopment {{analysis}} and the Malmquist productivity index, this paper examines changes in the productivity of the major United States passenger airlines from 2000 to 2004. The analysis finds {{that there was a}} significant improvement in the productivity of the carriers at transforming labor, fuel and <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> <b>capacity</b> into available seat-miles during this period. Most of the productivity improvements came about from the efficiency laggards catching up with the efficiency leaders in the industry. To a lesser extent, the adoption of new technologies improved productivity over this period. ...|$|R
5000|$|Five KTM Class 91 train sets, each {{comprising}} six cars, {{were purchased}} by Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad for $67 million (USD). The train sets {{were designed by}} Marubeni Corporation and jointly built by Hyundai Rotem of Korea and Mitsubishi Electric of Japan. The maximum operational speed of the ETS fleet is 140 km/h but is designed to travel up to 160 km/h. [...] The total length of each train set is 138 m and weighs 231.8 tons. Each carriage is 22.95 m long, 2.75 m wide and 4 m high. Each train set has a <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> <b>capacity</b> of 350 and includes on-board facilities including toilets, a buffet car, power sockets per two seats and two LED Televisions per car.|$|R
50|$|The Class 92 is {{designed}} for low dwell times and high <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> <b>capacity,</b> being built with three double leaf doors per side and having full longitudinal seating at its cab-coaches. Its middle coaches feature a mixture of longitudinal and traverse 2+2 seating. It has wide gang-ways interconnecting each coach, allowing passengers to distribute effectively throughout {{the length of the}} train. However, two middle coaches of the class 92 is designated women's only coaches by its operator KTM. Thus, limiting full interactivity within the train set. Dynamic route maps located above doors details trains position relative to station in real-time. CCTVs and 3-pin power outlets are provided as further features. Since the train is to operate in the tropics, the trains have an over-head air-conditioning systems, to provide ventilation, dehumidification and comfortable temperature control.|$|R

A further seven could be {{accommodated}} on the flap seats {{provided in the}} guard's compartment. An additional feature of these cars were the prized seats {{either side of the}} driver (the drivers cab being centrally located {{in the middle of the}} carriage, there was one <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> located either side of the cab, looking directly ahead).|$|R
5000|$|... "Line" [...] 12-metre {{version in}} one, two or three-door form (built from 1999). This version is {{distinct}} from the standard Agora by its engine layout, which is longitudinally-mounted (under the rear <b>passenger</b> <b>seats)</b> instead of being transverserly mounted in the Agora S and L. That gives the Line version a slightly greater <b>seating</b> <b>capacity</b> and a better fuel economy over the S version. This version was briefly sold in the United Kingdom, in right hand drive.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the active}} {{suspension}} {{control of a}} vehicle model that has five degrees of freedom with a <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> using a fuzzy logic controller is studied. Three cases {{are taken into account}} as different control applications. In the first case, the vehicle model having passive suspensions with an active <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> is controlled. In the second case, active suspensions with passive <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> combination are controlled. In the third case, both the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> and suspensions have active controllers. Vibrations of the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> in the three cases due to road bump input are simulated. At the end of the study, the results are compared in order to select the combination that supplies the best ride comfort...|$|R
50|$|The Noble has a <b>seating</b> <b>capacity</b> of four <b>passengers.</b> The rear <b>seats</b> {{provide enough}} room for two adults with plenty of space for their knees, {{although}} the low roof-line restricts headroom significantly. The rear seats can fold down to reveal a flat loading space, which otherwise is negligible. A full size spare wheel is housed under the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|Seventeen B type 'toastrack' trams were rebuilt by Duncan & Fraser (though it is {{believed}} that car 45 was rebuilt in house by the MTT at Hackney Workshops) were converted into A1 type 'California Combination' trams, similar to the A and later C types although the ends didn't drop down on the A1s. They were converted primarily for the isolated Port Adelaide tram system which was run by the MTT and ran between 1917 and 1935. These trams retained their previous B type numbers (refer to fleet table above). All cars had Hale Kilburn fixed rattan seating in the saloon except for car 44 which had wooden seats running along the sides of the saloon. Wooden seating was fitted to the open ends and these cars had the same <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity</b> (<b>seated</b> as well as 'crush load') as the A type. These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a magnetic track brake for emergency use.|$|R
2500|$|The {{configuration}} of driver and <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> varies. Generally the driver {{sits in front}} of the passengers to pedal the rickshaw. There are some designs, though, where the cyclist driver sits behind the passengers. In many Asian countries, like India and China, the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> is located behind the driver, while in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam the driver sits behind the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] In the Philippines, the <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> are usually located beside the driver in a side car. Similarly, in the trishaw in Singapore and the sai kaa in Burma the passengers sit alongside the driver.|$|R
5000|$|DVD-based GPS {{navigation}} {{was also}} introduced, {{as well as}} an [...] "Ottoman" [...] foot rest for the rear <b>passenger</b> <b>seats.</b> This was achieved by enabling part of the seat cushion of the front <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> back to tilt rearward towards the rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
50|$|OC Transpo {{purchased}} 75 more Alexander Dennis Enviro500 triple-axle {{double-decker buses}} in 2012, to replace older 40-foot models purchased from 1997 to 1999. These extra double-decker buses are used mainly on connexion routes. Double-decker buses use {{about the same}} amount of fuel as an articulated 60-foot bus, but only take up the same road area as a regular 40 foot bus, meaning they free up space (especially downtown), and provide increased <b>seated</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity</b> for longer connexion bus routes, lowering OC Transpo's operating costs. As a result of the purchase, the 60-foot articulated buses were be moved from connexion routes to Transitway and other mainline routes, replacing the 40-foot models currently used on some trips by those routes. Those 40-foot models will replace the older 40-foot models currently used on local routes. The older 40-foot buses were retired from service. This plan was approved by the Transit Commission on April 20, 2011. The extra 75 Alexander Dennis E500 double-decker buses entered service between fall 2012 and spring 2013.|$|R
