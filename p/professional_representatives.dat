5000|$|According to Scott Coltrane and Michele Adams, gender {{polarization}} begins {{early in}} childhood when girls {{are encouraged to}} prefer pink over blue, and when boys are encouraged to prefer toy trucks over dolls, and the male-female distinction is communicated to children in countless ways. Children learn by observing others and by direct tutelage what they [...] "can and cannot {{do in terms of}} gendered behavior", according to Elizabeth Lindsey and Walter Zakahi. Bem argued that gender polarization defines mutually exclusive scripts for being male and female. The scripts can have a powerful influence on how a person develops; for example, if a person is a male, then he will likely grow to develop specific ways of looking at the world, with certain behaviors seen as 'masculine', and learn to dress, walk, talk, and even think in a socially-approved way for men. Further, any deviation from these scripts was seen as problematic, possibly defined as [...] "immoral acts" [...] which flout religious customs, or seen as [...] "psychologically pathological". Bem argued that because of past polarization, women were often restricted to family-oriented roles in the private sphere, while men were seen as <b>professional</b> <b>representatives</b> in the public sphere. Cultures vary substantially by what is considered to be appropriate for masculine and feminine roles, and by how emotions are expressed.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Board of Directors {{commissioned}} the public television “system planning project” {{to consider the}} most appropriate organization of national service functions for public television for the 1980s. Among the concerns was the feeling of many that insulation of programing from representational responsibilities, and the more effective conduct of both the operating functions of the national program service and the system planning and representation functions for the licensees, {{would be better served}} if the two functions were not the responsibility of a single organization and management. The planning project concurred with this view, and after a process of consultation with the PBS membership and other agencies, concluded with this recommendation to the PBS Board. At the PBS Annual Meeting in Los Angeles in June 1979, the membership voted unanimously to endorse the establishment of a new “center for public television planning and representation” separate from PBS, and the reorganization of PBS to provide multiple program services. On November 1, 1979, Articles of Incorporation for the Association for Public Broadcasting were filed in the District of Columbia. On November 27, the PBS Board reviewed the work of its Committee and endorsed the formation of the Association. The Association’s Interim Board of Trustees, at its organizational meeting the same day, adopted By-Laws for the new organization. In December and January, the great majority of the public television licensees accepted the Board’s invitation to become Members of the Association, and voted overwhelmingly to approve the By-Laws. The Association began operations on January 1, 1980, with an interim staff and with transitional financial support and staff assistance provided by PBS. The Association’s first full president, Dr. David Carley of Madison, Wisconsin, began in mid-May, and at that time, more than 90 percent of the station licensees had elected to become Members of the Association, and had designated more than 300 lay and <b>professional</b> <b>representatives</b> to serve as charter members of its Board of Delegates. In nationwide mail balloting, the Delegates elected Trustees to oversee the management of the Association’s affairs, and the Trustees called the First Annual Meeting of the Board of Delegates for June 2, 1980, in Washington, D.C.|$|E

40|$|Part 4 : Infrastructure and TechnologyInternational audienceElectronic Identities (eID) {{and their}} {{cross-border}} recognition are {{on top of}} the agenda of various e-Government initiatives of the European Commission (EC). Therefore, the EC launched the EU large scale pilot STORK, which was running for about 3. 5 years and finished at the end of 2011. In this period, STORK has established a European eID interoperability platform for citizens. The focus of STORK was to achieve eID interoperability of natural persons. However, many e-Government processes are conducted by representatives of legal persons. Hence, this paper proposes an eID interoperability framework for the cross-border identification and authentication of legal persons or <b>professional</b> <b>representatives</b> using electronic mandates. The framework strongly bases on the findings of STORK and introduces an extension of the STORK framework supporting cross-border identification and authentication of legal persons...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, in {{many urban}} {{areas of the}} eastern United States water was only rarely disputed publicly. Decisions were left to water service {{providers}} and engineers, {{with the blessing of}} elected officials when necessary. Urban residents hardly noticed the activities of their service providers, except when a new, expensive water or sewage project showed up as a rate increase on their monthly bills. These eight cases of water conflict in Florida foreshadow change in an arena of public decisionmaking long taken for granted. What can we learn from them that will help us to address future challenges? Water conflicts invite a simplistic urge to use the “best ” science to make decisions and settle disputes. However, rising demands by an increasingly diverse group of users—not only residential consumers, industry, and agriculture but also recreationists and advocates of ecosystem protection and restoration—have intensified competition and complexity, and added new parties to the fray. What qualifies as the best science is now often contested, and must be accepted by a wider array of parties than ever: not only resource managers at local, state, and federal agencies but also elected officials, <b>professional</b> <b>representatives</b> from user groups, and ordinary citizens...|$|E
