5000|$|After {{spending}} {{years working}} around wood, Woodworth would design and then patent the Woodworth <b>Planing</b> <b>Machine</b> in 1828. [...] Hailed {{as the greatest}} improvement to the <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> so far {{and one of the}} most important inventions of the century, it added speed and efficiency to the process of creating lumber for domestic usage. [...] The invention could perform the output of 25 laborers, cheapened finished lumber, and greatly increased the supply. In 1829, the Franklin Institute praised the invention. [...] The United States Congress would praise the invention in 1850 along with Eli Whitney's Cotton Gin as the great labor savings inventions of the country.|$|R
5000|$|Latta's first {{jobs were}} for David Bradford Woolen Mills, Samuel Cummings' brass foundry, and William Bylad's machine shop. Latta met Anthony Harkness, {{owner of a}} foundry and machine shop in Cincinnati, while on a {{business}} trip to Washington, D. C. in 1841. He explained to Harkness his mechanical ability and about his invention for a machine that would make parts for steamboat paddle wheels. He made such an impression on Harkness that he was offered a job as a superintendent of Harkness's foundry. His first assignment was that of designing a huge lathe and <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> for Harkness. The inventor George Escol Sellers believed the <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> was a mechanical masterpiece.|$|R

25|$|The first large {{precision}} machine tool was the cylinder boring machine used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. The <b>planing</b> <b>machine,</b> the milling machine and the shaping machine were developed {{in the early decades}} of the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The company {{introduced}} the highly efficient Corliss valve gear into the United Kingdom from the United States in about 1864 and was closely identified with it thereafter; William Inglis {{being responsible for}} promoting the high speed Corliss engine. About 1881 Hick, Hargreaves received orders for two Corliss engines of 3000 hp, the largest cotton mill engines in the world. Hargreaves and Inglis trip gear was first applied to a large single cylinder 1800 hp Corliss engine at Eagley Mills near Bolton and the company received a Gold Medal for its products at the 1885 International Inventions Exhibition. Mill gearing was a speciality including large flywheels for rope drives, one example of 128 tons being 32 ft in diameter and groved for 56 ropes. Turbines and hydraulic machinery were also manufactured. Many of the tools were to suit the specialist work, with travelling cranes to take 15 to 40 tons in weight, a large lathe, side <b>planer,</b> slotting <b>machine,</b> <b>pit</b> <b>planer</b> and a tool for turning four 32 ft rope flywheels simultaneously. The workshops also featured an 80ton hydraulic riveting machine. For the ease of shipping and transportation, Soho Iron Works had its own railway system, traversed by sidings of the London North Western Railway (LNWR). Inglis, who lived in Bolton was a neighbour of LNWR's chief mechanical engineer, Francis Webb.|$|R

5000|$|Johnston {{was still}} {{the owner of the}} Mount Molloy sawmill when it burnt down on 31 January 1934, William J Santowski being the manager at the time. It was {{reported}} that [...] "One 350 h.p. boiler was in the destroyed building, also one Sandycroft steam engine; one twin circular log breaking down plant, four saw benches, one <b>planing</b> <b>machine,</b> saw-dust carriers, belting, shafting and pulleys and other tools of various descriptions, 29 circular saws, one log rolling winch, two saw sharpening machines, three cross-cut sawing machines". However, the employees were able to protect the boiler, main engines and pumping plant from serious damage. There were also two other <b>planing</b> <b>machines</b> in a separate building that was not destroyed. Prior to the fire Johnston had purchased machinery for a new sawmill at Shipton's Flat near Cooktown, and after the fire he placed some of the machinery at Mount Molloy. He claimed that the latter was a paying proposition and a very essential part of his organisation. It was also essential to have the mill at Mount Molloy, as most hardwood supplies came from there.|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} noise {{pollution}} in selected sawmills (Mile 3, Mile 1 and Rumuosi sawmills) in Port Harcourt was carried out. Physical {{measurements of the}} noise levels of sawmill machines, including Table Saw, Planing Machine,Stenner 48 Bandsaw, and Sharpening Machine, were made using a digital sound level meter. The background noise of the sawmills ranged 70. 58 – 79. 70 dBA {{in the order of}} Mile 3 > Mile 1 >Rumuosi. The average noise level of sawmill machines for Mile 3, Mile 1 and Rumuosi ranged 89. 76 ± 0. 09 - 100. 49 ± 0. 20 dBA, 89. 81 ± 0. 13 - 97. 00 ± 0. 46 dBA and 89. 76 ± 0. 07 - 100. 10 ± 0. 53 dBA, respectively. In the three sawmills studied, the Sharpening machine recorded the least noise levelwhile the <b>Planing</b> <b>machine</b> had the highest. The noise dose (D) of the Sharpening machine at the three sawmills ranged 0. 97 - 0. 98, which is below the permissible limit of 1, while the D for Table Saw, <b>Planing</b> <b>Machine</b> and Stenner 48 Bandsawranged 1. 86 - 4. 27, which is in excess of 1. From the measured noise level and the estimated D, an empirical model that could predict the recommended time a worker is supposed to work with the identified sawmill machines was developed {{for each of the three}} sawmills. The values obtained for the hearing deterioration indexindicate that the risk of developing hearing loss after 35 years of exposure is likely to be in the order of <b>Planing</b> <b>machine</b> > Table saw >Stenner 48 bandsaw > Sharpening machine. It is concluded that there is noise pollution emanating from these sawmill machines...|$|R

50|$|With a {{topographic}} landscape {{the question}} arises as to where a feature is and also as to how accurately it can be classified or identified. Geomorphometrics involves deriving values from the DEM data that infer geomorphological features, such as whether relative local values describe peaks, passes, <b>pits,</b> <b>planes,</b> channels and ridges. Due to limitations of resolution, axis-orientation, and object-definitions the derived spatial data may yield meaning with subjective observation or parameterisation, or alternatively processed as fuzzy data to handle the varying contributing errors more quantitatively - for example as a 70% overall chance of a point representing the peak of a mountain given the available data, rather than an educated guess {{to deal with the}} uncertainty.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Rotary planing {{is one of the}} most valuable machining operations in the timber processing industry. It has been established that cutting tool inaccuracy and forced vibration during the machining process are the primary causes of surface quality degradation. The main aim of this thesis is to design a control architecture that is suitable for adaptive operation of a wood <b>planing</b> <b>machining</b> in order to improve the quality of its surface finish. In order to achieve the stated goal, thorough understanding of the effects of machine deficiencies on surface finish quality is required. Therefore, a generic simulation model for synthesising the surface profiles produced by wood planing process is first developed. The model is used to simulate the combined effects of machining parameters, vibration and cutting tool inaccuracy on the resultant surface profiles. It has been postulated that online monitoring of surface finish quality can be used to provide feedback information for a secondary control loop for the machining process, which will lead to the production of consistently high quality surface finishes. There is an existing vision-based wood surface profile measurement technique, but the application of the technique has been limited to static wood samples. This thesis extends the application of the technique to moving wood samples. It is shown experimentally that the method is suitable for in-process surface profile measurements. The current industrial wood <b>planing</b> <b>machines</b> do not have the capability of measuring and adjusting process parameters in real-time. Therefore, knowledge of the causes of surface finish degradation would enable the operators to optimise the mechanical structure of the machines offline. For this reason, two novel approaches for characterising defects on planed timber surfaces have been created in this thesis using synthetic data. The output of this work is a software tool that can assist machine operators in inferring the causes of defects based on the waviness components of the workpiece surface finish. The main achievement in this research is the design of a new active wood planing technique that combines real-time cutter path optimisation (cutting tool inaccuracy compensation) with vibration disturbance rejection. The technique is based on real-time vertical displacements of the machine spindle. Simulation and experimental results obtained from a smart wood <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> show significant improvements in the dynamic performance of the machine and the produced surface finish quality. Potential areas for future research include application of the defects characterisation techniques to real data and full integration of the dynamic surface profile measurements with the smart wood <b>planing</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Woodworth <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> had {{a direct}} impact on patent law in the United States. Because Woodworth and his heirs {{repeatedly}} attempted, and succeeded many times in having the patent extended by Congress, it was attacked politically as a monopoly. Woodworth's heirs were subjected to one of the earlier special interest, community organizing campaigns in the country, as lumber merchants and carpenters, growing tired of paying a royalty to Woodworth's heirs, mounted a public campaign to have the extension of the patent blocked.|$|R
50|$|A {{cheese factory}} {{was built in}} Pittston in the late-1800s. By 1885, an {{addition}} {{was added to the}} cheese factory which housed a grain crusher and <b>planing</b> <b>machine,</b> diversifying operations. The cheese factory burned down twice, once in the late-1800s and once in 1900, and was rebuilt after both fires. By 1900, the factory had reached its peak, producing 20 cheeses a day. The cheese was transported to Spencerville where it was then shipped to Montreal to be exported internationally. The factory closed in the 1940s.|$|R
