It is directed at practitioners, and the approach is therefore pragmatic, based on {{the current state of the}} art; the paper does not attempt to provide a comprehensive survey of all previous work on this topic. The nature of an electronic document is discussed, and the various kinds of portability that may be required are defined. Ways in which portability can be achieved in a variety of restricted contexts are presented,including approachesto portability based on international and de facto industry standards. The likely success of the competing standards is assessed. Finally the paper addresses the question of whether complete document portability is achievable, or even necessary...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to analyse {{practical}} impacts of special rules for determination of applicable legislation {{in accordance with the}} Regulation No. 883 / 2004 and its implementing Regulation No. 987 / 2009. Further the thesis seeks to identify potential negative effects connected to application of the single insurance principle as well as deficiencies arising out of practical performance of European coordination and to discuss the eventual solutions to undesirable effects caused by weak sides of coordination regulations. The thesis is divided into four chapters: an introduction is followed by a chapter about general principles of European coordination of social security systems and about current developments in this field. The topic of a second part is an institute of posting according to Art. 12 of the Regulation No. 883 / 2004, a distinction here is made between employees and self-employed persons. This chapter further contains procedural rules and an overview of issued <b>portable</b> <b>documents</b> A 1 (E 101 forms) during the years 2009 - 2011. Third chapter deals with pursuit of activities in two or more Member States in accordance to Art. 13 of the Regulation No. 883 / 2004. Special attention is paid to a fine line between posting and pursuit of activities. A problem with retroactive determination of applicable legislation is discussed in the last subchapter of the thesis. This problem is being recently solved by Czech institutions and employers. They are trying to find a solution preventing negative consequences of such a retroactive determination. Exception governed in Art. 16 of the Regulation No. 883 / 2004 is a subject of the fourth chapter.

40|$|FreeRTOS is {{a popular}} {{real-time}} operating system, which has been under a significant attention {{in the last years}} due to its main advantages: it is open source, <b>portable,</b> well <b>documented</b> and implemented on more than 30 architectures. FreeRTOS execution environment is dynamic, preemptive and priority based, but it is not suitable for hard real-time tasks, because it provides task execution determinism only to a certain degree and cannot guarantee the absence of task execution jitter. As a solution to this problem, we propose a hard real time execution extension to FreeRTOS in order to support a particular model of HRT tasks, called ModXs, which are executed with no jitter. This article presents a detailed analysis, in terms of scheduling, task execution and memory usage of this hard real time execution environment extension.

40|$|AbstractHistorical {{document}} restoration {{has always}} been a challenging need for information acquisition and conversion to a stable and <b>portable</b> format. <b>Document</b> image binarization, is an important pre-processing phase in document image analysis and processing of such historical documents. It has never been an easy task accounting to the difficulty in choosing a threshold value when the document image suffers from noises due present in the original document due to its degradation, ageing of the paper, other unwanted impurities, background images, bleed-through, and so on. Inconsistency {{in the darkness of the}} letters in handwritten documents adds to the difficulty. Though there are many algorithms that have been proposed for document image binarization, there has not been an effective algorithm which can efficiently binarize all kind of documents. In this paper we introduce a novel method to perform document image binarization using bit-plane slicing. As per this approach, the 8 bit planes of the gray image are extracted and processed separately, at the end of which, the results are combined to give the final binarized output. This method works well for all kinds of historical documents except those with both, less noise and low contrast...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most {{conventional}} design processes produce documentation as a by-product: design is done within an environment or collection of tools {{and the design}} outputs, models, diagrams, results, etc are gathered together along with commentary (usually with hindsight) {{into some kind of}} document {{at the end of the}} process. Inspired by ideas taken from literate programming and notebook interfaces to design tools, a prototype document centred design document has been developed. In such an environment, the document is the main product and the design is a by-product of documenting the design. By implementing the framework components of the system in Java and by using the extended markup language (XML) to encode the contents of the documents, the system is made platform neutral and therefore <b>portable.</b> An example <b>document</b> centred environment for computer-aided control system design (CACSD), that integrates MATLAB and SIMULINK with the document-based framework, is briefly described and indications for future possibilities for this technology are given...|$|R

40|$|In {{the ongoing}} debate over open data-sharing, two {{practical}} concerns re- garding costs in implementing these policies [1] were raised that I think are unfounded. Storing large-volumes of raw data can indeed be expensive, {{but in many}} cases the useful items to share are highly-processed and relatively small, well under a few gigabytes. e. g. the recently published mouse connectome is avail- able as a three-megabyte Excel spreadsheet derived from many gigabytes of raw data [2]. Nor is there a shortage of repositories. Many institutional and in- ternational databases are freely available and well supported (e. g. zenodo. org is maintained by CERN). More repositories are likely to become available as we learn how best to share our data. Sharing computer code may not require as much time investment as one thinks. The modest proposal [3] suggests that sharing code, irrespective of whether it is <b>portable</b> or <b>documented,</b> can be useful to others. Often many technical details are omitted from papers, and the code is the source of that information. People releasing code are under no obligation to maintain it, and the code should be seen as a valuable part of the scholarship relating to the paper. It is also often in your best interests to write code assuming that at some point you will share it; quite often it is reused by others in your lab (or even yourself in 6 – 12 months). We have much to gain by freely sharing our data and code, and the sooner we do it, the better. Stephen Eglen, Cambridge, UK.

40|$|An {{investigation}} is conducted into portable Braille devices {{which would allow}} visually impaired individuals to read electronic documents. Consumer research conducted on the existing Braille devices has identified {{the need for a}} portable and flexible E-books reader. This poster describes the design and development of an electronic device that will enable reading of any electronic text document through a single Braille cell. Braille books tend to be bulky in size due to the minimum size requirements for each Braille cell. Ebooks can be read in Braille using refreshable Braille displays connected to a computer. However, the refreshable Braille displays are expensive, bulky and are not portable. These factors restrict blind and visually impaired individuals from accessing much of the literature which isn’t available in Braille. Our design of a novel Electronic Braille Document Reader will overcome the problem of carrying bulky Braille books by allowing multiple e-books to be saved in a portable memory device. By convert text from ASCII into Braille patterns, it will give an access to books which were never published in Braille. The single Braille cell design reduces the bulk of the device allowing it to be portable. An additional benefit of the device is that it can be integrated into a glove and worn thus giving the user freedom to carry on with other tasks while reading. Our investigation has confirmed the feasibility of the Electronic Braille document reader built around a microcontroller system. <b>Portable</b> Electronic Braille <b>Document</b> Reader will provide substantial benefits to blind and visually impaired individuals, and overcome the limitations of Braille books...|$|R
