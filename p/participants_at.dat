5|$|Some anti-bathhouse activists {{argue that}} these {{measures}} are not enough, especially given that {{it is virtually impossible}} to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, they point out that they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sexboth of which put <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> risk for contracting STDsin such situations.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{resignation}} of SS commander Erhard Heiden in January 1929, Himmler assumed the position of Reichsführer-SS with Hitler's approval; he still carried out his duties at propaganda headquarters. One of his first responsibilities was to organise SS <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> the Nuremberg Rally that September. Over the next year, Himmler grew the SS from a force of about 290 men to about 3,000. By 1930 Himmler had persuaded Hitler to run the SS as a separate organisation, although it was officially still subordinate to the SA.|$|E
5|$|With a {{score of}} 7½/15, Carlsen placed 8th out of 16 <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> the World Blitz Championship in Rishon LeZion, Israel. In the rapid chess tournament Rencontres nationales et internationales d'échecs in Cap d'Agde, France, he reached the semifinal, losing there to Sergey Karjakin. In November, Carlsen {{achieved}} a shared 8th place of 10 participants in the Mikhail Tal Memorial in Moscow with two losses and seven draws. He finished ninth {{in a group of}} 18 participants in the associated blitz tournament, which was won by Anand.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} at Srebrenica, sixteen nations {{met at the}} London Conference, which began on 21 July 1995, to {{consider}} new options for Bosnia. As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E

5|$|England and France {{were in the}} {{concluding}} stages of the Hundred Years War. The French {{did not wish to}} lose their advantage in the fight by sending knights and the English were in no position to do so. Spain was {{in the final stages of}} the Reconquista. The Holy Roman Empire, never centralized enough behind the Hohenstaufen to unite the principalities, had exhausted what could be spared at Varna. Further fighting among the German princes and the Hussite wars seriously reduced the willingness of most to perform a crusade. Poland and Hungary were key <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> Varna and the defeat there along with the Polish–Teutonic Wars kept them busy and unwilling for further commitments.|$|E
5|$|Fixed {{gender roles}} began to become less {{prominent}} in the Western world starting in the late 20th century, allowing men {{to make their own}} choice of career without regard to traditional gender-based roles. Some men who choose this role may do so because they enjoy being an active part of their children's lives, while in other families, the mother wants to pursue her career. For example, of the 187 <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women in the Business Summit, one third of the women's husbands were stay-at-home dads.|$|E

Collins advanced the furthest of any Saint Kitts and Nevis athlete, reaching the semifinals of the 100 meter dash.

5|$|Some {{activities}} {{that were once}} considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, {{have been removed from}} the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the <b>participants,</b> <b>at</b> the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What entertainment is for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.|$|E
5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E
5|$|Carlsen's next tournament was the Grand Slam Masters Final on 9–15 October, {{which he}} had {{qualified}} for automatically by winning three of the previous year's four Grand Slam chess events (2009 Nanjing Pearl Spring, 2010 Corus, 2010 Bazna Kings). Along with Carlsen, the finals consisted of World Champion Anand and the highest two scorers from the preliminary stage held in Shanghai in September: Kramnik and Shirov. The average Elo of the <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> the time was 2789, making the Grand Slam Final the strongest chess tournament in history. In the first round, Carlsen lost with black to Kramnik; this was Carlsen's second consecutive loss to Kramnik, and placed his hold on the world No. 1 ranking in serious jeopardy. In his second round, Carlsen lost with the white pieces to Anand; this was his first loss as White since January 2010. Carlsen recovered somewhat {{in the latter part}} of the tournament, achieving a win over Shirov, and finishing with 2½/6. The tournament was won by Kramnik with 4/6. Carlsen finished this tournament with a rating of 2802, two points behind Anand at 2804 who temporarily ended Carlsen's reign at world No. 1. These setbacks called into question from some whether Carlsen's activities outside chess, such as modelling for G-Star Raw, were distracting him from performing well at the chessboard. Carlsen said he did not believe there was a direct connection.|$|E

5|$|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines {{debuted in}} the Olympic Games at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and, as of 2008, {{has participated in}} every edition since. The Beijing Games marked the {{smallest}} Vincentian delegation in the country's history, the size having declined over the years from its largest delegation of eight <b>participants</b> <b>at</b> the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. At {{the conclusion of the}} 2008 Summer Olympics, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' team has yet to medal in an event. The delegation arrived in Beijing on 28 July 2008, and stayed in the Olympic Village for the duration of their time in China. The Vincentians arrived early, three days after the Village itself opened, to make adjusting to the new environment easier. The delegation was accompanied by coach Gideon Labban; team manager Leroy Llewellyn; and chaperone Jacintha Ballantyne. Kineke Alexander was the flagbearer at the opening ceremony, leading Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as the 64th nation in line.|$|E
5|$|The Three Way {{main event}} began an {{extended}} storyline revolving around the <b>participants.</b> <b>At</b> Bound for Glory, A.J. Styles defeated Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match {{to retain the}} TNA X Division Championship. TNA then held a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November13. In that match, Team Ministry (Alex Shelley, Daniels, Samoa Joe, and Roderick Strong) defeated the team of Austin Aries, Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, and Sonjay Dutt. After the contest, Joe assaulted Daniels, performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on him twice, the second time on a steel chair. Daniels suffered an injury in the storyline due to the attack, sidelining him until December11 at TNA's Turning Point PPV event. At that event, Daniels saved Styles from an assault by Joe following Joe's victory over Styles to win the TNA X Division Championship. Daniels then challenged Joe for the championship at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January15, 2006, but Joe retained the title. At TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February12, 2006, Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in another Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title. The three competed again, but this time in a Three Way Ultimate X match for the championship at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March12, 2006. Daniels won, becoming the new TNA X Division Champion. The rivalry ended on the April13, 2006 episode of Impact! when Joe defeated Daniels to win back the championship. TNA promoted an Unbreakable rematch at their 2009 Turning Point PPV event on November15. This {{time it was a}} Three Way match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between Styles, Daniels, and Joe. Styles won the match to retain the championship. This encounter reignited the feud between Styles and Daniels, leading to a bout for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on December20, 2009, which Styles also won.|$|E
