5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process.

Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2).

In the 1960s and 70s the Caourep Group followed French and other European OEM automotive producers as they expanded in the first postwar recovery wave of globalization. Caourep established its own plants or licensees in every country in which Renault, Peugeot, Fiat, VW, and Daimler-Benz operated directly or by licensing. By the late 1970s, Caourep had become a supplier to the overseas operations of Ford, GM, and Chrysler.

50|$|Chlorinated {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are generated by combustion of organic compounds. Cl-PAHs enter the environment from a multiplicity of sources and tend to persist in soil and in particulate matter in air. Environmental data and emission sources analysis for Cl-PAHs reveal that the dominant process of generation is by reaction of PAHs with chlorine in pyrosynthesis. Cl-PAHs have commonly been detected in tap water, fly ash from an incineration plant for radioactive waste, emissions from coal combustion and municipal waste incineration, automobile exhaust, snow, and urban air. They have also been detected in electronic wastes, workshop-floor dust, vegetation, and surface soil collected from the vicinity of an electronic waste (e-waste) recycling facility and in surface soil from a chemical industrial complex (comprising a coke-oven plant, a coal-fired power plant, and a chlor-alkali plant), and agricultural areas {{in central and eastern}} China. In addition, the combustion of <b>polyvinylchloride</b> and plastic wrap made from polyvinylidene chloride result in the production of Cl-PAHs, suggesting that combustion of organic materials including chlorine is a possible source of environmental pollution.|$|E
50|$|Tubular {{systems are}} {{the most widely used}} {{commercial}} culture systems. They are usually made of polypropylene acrylic or <b>polyvinylchloride</b> pipes which have small internal diameters and an air pump that generates bubbles to mix and agitate the culture. They usually use artificial light but some models use natural light. The major disadvantages of this type of system, varying among individual systems, are high space requirements, cleaning, low efficiency, low gas transfer, and hydrodynamic stress. Several other problems also occur, including growth of the algae on the tube wall leading to blockage of light, high oxygen concentration inhibition of growth, and limits on the length of the tube in single run. Coiled systems were developed mainly to improve space utilization. The main advantages are: 1) large ratio of culture volume to surface area and optimized light penetration depth; 2) easy control over temperature and contaminants; 3) easy spatial distribution of fresh air and CO2; 4) better CO2 transfer through the culture; and 5) automated sensor providing cell concentration reads.|$|E
5000|$|Polymeric {{membranes}} {{lead the}} membrane separation industry market {{because they are}} very competitive in performance and economics. Many polymers are available, but the choice of membrane polymer is not a trivial task. A polymer has to have appropriate characteristics for the intended application. The polymer sometimes has to offer a low binding affinity for separated molecules (as {{in the case of}} biotechnology applications), and has to withstand the harsh cleaning conditions. It has to be compatible with chosen membrane fabrication technology. The polymer has to be a suitable membrane former in terms of its chains rigidity, chain interactions, stereoregularity, and polarity of its functional groups. The polymers can form amorphous and semicrystalline structures (can also have different glass transition temperatures), affecting the membrane performance characteristics. The polymer has to be obtainable and reasonably priced to comply with the low cost criteria of membrane separation process. Many membrane polymers are grafted, custom-modified, or produced as copolymers to improve their properties. The most common polymers in membrane synthesis are cellulose acetate, Nitrocellulose, and cellulose esters (CA, CN, and CE), polysulfone (PS), polyether sulfone(PES), polyacrilonitrile(PAN), polyamide, polyimide, polyethylene and polypropylene (PE and PP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), <b>polyvinylchloride</b> (PVC).|$|E
50|$|A tracer {{projectile}} {{is constructed}} with a hollow base {{filled with a}} pyrotechnic flare material, made of a mixture of a very finely ground metallic fuel, oxidizer, and {{a small amount of}} organic fuel. Metallic fuels include magnesium, aluminum, and occasionally zirconium. The oxidizer is a salt molecule which contains oxygen combined with a specific atom responsible for the desired color output. Upon ignition, the heated salt releases its oxygen to sustain combustion of the fuel in the mixture. The color-emitting atom in the salt is also released and reacts chemically with excess oxygen providing the source of the colored flame. In NATO standard ammunition (including US), the oxidizer salt is usually a mixture of strontium compounds (nitrate, peroxide, etc.) and the metallic fuel is magnesium. Burning strontium yields a bright red light. Russian and Chinese tracer ammunition generates green light using barium salts. An oxidizer and metallic fuel alone, however, do not make a practical pyrotechnic for the purposes of producing colored light. The reaction is too energetic, consuming all materials in one big flash of white lightwhite light being the characteristic output of magnesium-oxide (MgO), for example. Therefore, in the case of using Strontium Nitrate and Magnesium, to produce a red colored flame that is not over-powered by the white light from the burning fuel, a chlorine donor is provided in the pyrotechnic mixture, so that Strontium Chloride can also form in the flame, cooling it so that the white light of MgO is greatly reduced. Cooling the flame in this manner also lengthens the reaction rate so that the mixture has an appreciable burn time. <b>Polyvinylchloride</b> (PVC) is a typical organic fuel in colored light for this purpose. Some modern designs use compositions that produce little to no visible light and radiate mainly in infrared, being visible only on night vision equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{common type}} of {{removable}} retainer is the vacuum formed retainer (VFR). This is a polypropylene or <b>polyvinylchloride</b> (PVC) material, which is more economical and faster to make, typically [...]020" [...] or [...]030" [...] thick. Essix (invented by Dr. John Sheridan) and Zendura are the brand names commonly associated with this retainer. This clear or transparent retainer fits over the entire arch of teeth or only from canine to canine (clip-on retainer) and is produced from a mold. It is similar in appearance to Invisalign trays, though the latter are not considered [...] "retainers." [...] The retainer is virtually invisible and clear when worn. Hence, it can provide aesthetics value to the patient. VFRs, if worn 24 hours per day, do not allow {{the upper and lower}} teeth to touch because plastic covers the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Some orthodontists feel that {{it is important for the}} top and bottom chewing surfaces to meet to allow for [...] "favorable settling" [...] to occur. Besides that, it is advisable to wear VFRs only at night, every night. When eating is necessary, the retainer is removed to allow natural consumption and to avoid the crushing of the VFR. Patient should be informed never to drink, especially cariogenic or fizzy drinks, with VFR in situ as it will lead to substantial loss of tooth surface and dental caries. The retainer can behave like a reservoir, enclosing the incisal edges and cuspal tips with the cariogenic drink, leading to decalcification of teeth. VFRs are less expensive, less visible, and easier to wear than Hawley retainers; however, for patients with disorders such as bruxism, VFRs are prone to rapid breakage and deterioration, especially if the material is PVC, a short chain molecule which breaks down far more quickly than polypropylene, a long chain molecule.|$|E
50|$|Detection of {{pathogens}} using ELISA {{relies on}} {{the interaction between the}} antigen and specific antibodies and has become a popular and cost-effective means of routine detection. In an ELISA the solid phase can be coated with the sample of interest containing the antigen. The efficiency to which the antigen binds to the solid phase is dependent on temperature, length of exposure as well as concentration. Solid phases used include nitrocellulose membranes, paper, glass, agarose and polystyrene or <b>polyvinylchloride</b> microtiter plates. Microtiter plates are the most widely used solid phase because they are easy to handle, allow for automation and for analysis using microtiter plate readers. A drawback of these plates is that they are highly absorptive and this increases the incidence of non-specific binding of components used in the ELISA. Non-specific binding to the plates is reduced through the use of buffers containing proteins such as casein and non-ionic detergents such as Tween 20. After coating, excess sample is removed and the plate typically treated with a 1% casein containing solution. Subsequent to this the solid phase is treated with antibodies raised against the antigen of interest. After each incubation step the plate is washed with Tween 20 containing PBS. These washing steps are aimed to wash away any non-specifically bound components. Nonspecifically bound components are less strongly bound than the specific bound ones. Detection is achieved either through the addition of an enzyme-coupled antibody or the addition and detection of a biotinylated antibody. In a system using an enzyme-coupled antibody the subsequent addition of an appropriate substrate results in the formation of a colour proportional to the amount of antigen. Alternatively the plate can be coated with antibody followed by incubation with the sample that is to be detected. This, in turn, can be detected as described above and is then referred to as the double antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA. Both of these systems, however, have a disadvantage in that coupling of the enzyme to the antibody may result in steric hindrance which in turn may result in a loss in function of the antibody and/or the enzyme. This may be overcome {{through the use of a}} biotin-avidin or biotin-streptavidin bridge. In this type of system biotin is coupled to the antibody. The biotin molecule has no influence on the working of the antibodies and is easily detectedusing avidin or streptavidin conjugated to a suitable enzyme. Streptavidin has an extremely high affinity for biotin which results in even a higher degree of specificity than a system in which the enzyme is coupled directly the antigen. To establish whether or not the antigen is present, a substrate specific for the enzyme used is added. The enzyme then converts the substrate to a coloured product and the colour intensity can be correlated to the amount of antibodies bound and thus the amount of antigen present. A DAS-ELISA has the advantage that it can increase the specificity of the ELISA and reduce the occurrence of non-specific binding. As a result, the DAS-ELISA principle is commonly employed in ELISA’s for the detection of plant pathogens in plant sap without prior purification of the pathogen.|$|E
