25|$|With {{the main}} {{constraint}} on Canadian oil sands development becoming {{the availability of}} export <b>pipeline</b> <b>capacity,</b> pipeline companies have proposed {{a number of major}} new transmission pipelines. Many of these became stalled in government regulatory processes, both by the Canadian and American governments.

All they needed were pipelines. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, governments generally supported throwing open to all contenders the race to build pipelines. Competition among operators moving the gas to market - not government regulation - was supposed to keep transmission costs reasonable in the new milieu.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} common water supply in Singapore {{began with the}} {{construction}} of the MacRitchie Reservoir, which was built by the British in 1866. The Lower Peirce Reservoir and the Upper Seletar Reservoir were completed in 1913 and 1949 respectively, in order to supply the rapidly modernising colonial city with sufficient water. In 1927 the municipal leadership of Singapore and Sultan Ibrahim of the state and territories of Johor in neighboring Malaya signed an agreement that allowed Singapore to rent land in Johor and use its water for free. The Municipal Water Department, under David J. Murnane, began importing raw water from Gunong Pulai in 1927 and filtered water on 31 December 1929. The water filtration and <b>pipeline</b> <b>capacity</b> from Gunong Pulai was doubled in 1939. [...] Another pipeline was built to return a smaller quantity of treated water to Johor. [...] During the Battle of Singapore in 1942 the Causeway that links Singapore with Malaya and that carries the pipeline was blown up by retreating British troops, thus unintentionally destroying the pipeline, which left Singapore with water reserves that could last at most two weeks. According to Lee Kuan Yew, this was one of his motives to envision water self-sufficiency for Singapore later when he became the city-state's Prime Minister.|$|E
