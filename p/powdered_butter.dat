30|$|Oat gum. Oat {{contains}} {{a series of}} interesting compounds, which {{is the reason why}} an increasing part the world production of oat goes to the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The amino acid pattern of oat is rather similar to that of human muscle (only that of buckwheat is more alike), and can thus be expected to deliver most of the amino acids needed to build muscles. Oat is rich in water-soluble fibers, β-glucans, and known for their antiseptic properties. Oat is also rich in natural antioxidants, particularly ferulic acid, caffeic acid, hydrocinnamic acid, and tocopherols and oat was before synthetic antioxidants were available extensively used to preserve foods: milk, milk <b>powder,</b> <b>butter,</b> ice-cream, fish, bacon, sausages and other food products sensitive to fat oxidation. Another ingredient richly available in oat is inositol hexaphosphate (phytic acid), a strong antioxidant, particularly known to enhance natural killer cell activity and to suppress tumour growth. Oat is also rich in polyunsaturated fats/polar lipids such as phosphatidylcholine, known for its protective effects of mucosal and cellular surfaces.|$|R
30|$|Other {{than the}} large players, {{there is a}} host of smaller {{processing}} co-operatives based {{in a number of}} different dairy basins supplying only their immediate geographical markets. This part of the processing sector is very complex and highly fragmented, as it gathers some 30 co-operatives representing less than 15 % of the milk volumes processed. Some of these small co-operatives were dairy processing pioneers in Morocco (“Le Bon Lait” in the Marrakech region, “Colait Extralait” in the Gharb, etc.) but they are currently struggling to survive as they face severe financial and technical problems such as increases in milk prices and other strategic inputs’ costs (such as imported milk <b>powder,</b> <b>butter,</b> energy, etc.). They produce only a narrow range of dairy products that is not usually stocked by supermarkets and they only have little know-how when it comes to milk processing. Some of them, in an attempt of resilience, like “Le Bon Lait” are currently establishing a joint venture with the French leading dairy co-operative group “Sodiaal” to market the brands Candia and Yoplait in the Moroccan market.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} demand for maize, milk <b>powder,</b> <b>butter,</b> and rice imports in Cyprus, using annual time series data covering the period 1975 - 1994. None of these products is produced in Cyprus and all the necessary quantities are imported to meet domestic demand. The primary objective of the paper is to derive long-run price and income elasticities of import demand {{that can be used}} to analyse the impact of various policies such as the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) when, and if, the Republic of Cyprus joins the European Union (EU). In so doing the paper takes on board some recent developments in time series econometrics. The cointegration test used (the 'bounds' test) is a recent test and is based on the estimation of an unrestricted error-correction model (UECM). Parsimonious models were derived using Hendry's 'general to specific' approach. The estimated elasticities were subsequently used to quantify some of the implications for Cyprus had the CAP been operational in 1994. ...|$|R
