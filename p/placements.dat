40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the virtual machine (VM) <b>placement</b> problem has been studied intensively and many {{algorithms}} for the VM <b>placement</b> problem have been proposed. However, those proposed VM <b>placement</b> algorithms have not been widely used in today's cloud data centers as they do not consider the migration cost from current VM <b>placement</b> to the new optimal VM <b>placement.</b> As a result, the gain from optimizing VM <b>placement</b> may be less than {{the loss of the}} migration cost from current VM <b>placement</b> to the new VM <b>placement.</b> To address this issue, this paper presents a penalty-based genetic algorithm (GA) for the VM <b>placement</b> problem that considers the migration cost in addition to the energy-consumption of the new VM <b>placement</b> and the total inter-VM traffic flow in the new VM <b>placement.</b> The GA has been implemented and evaluated by experiments, and the experimental results show that the GA outperforms two well known algorithms for the VM <b>placement</b> problem...|$|R
5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative <b>placements</b> of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results can be attributed to the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements.|$|E
