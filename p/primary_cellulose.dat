They are often related to temperature and heating rate. Unfortunately, significant inconsistencies exist between the values recommended by the authors. In order to bring new insights to this problem, a very simple model of solid pyrolysis is solved {{in the case of}} global <b>primary</b> <b>cellulose</b> pyrolysis. The operating conditions are chosen in order to cover almost all practical situations. The two cases of fixed heat source temperature and of temperature increasing with time are considered. The results show that actual particle temperature and heating rate are inappropriate for defining fast pyrolysis. Other criteria are also discussed. Among them, reactor temperature and external heat transfer coefficient appear to be more relevant, as well as efficiency of primary products removal. However, it is shown that the definition of fast pyrolysis reactor optimal conditions cannot rely on only one criterion. All implied parameters should be taken into account in a global approach including close couplings between reactor properties and particle pyrolysis behaviour...|$|E

We determined TBR {{to belong to}} the plant-specific DUF 231 domain gene family comprising 46 members of unknown function in Arabidopsis. The genes harbor another plant-specific domain, called the TBL domain, which contains a conserved GDSL motif known from some esterases/lipases. TBR and TBR-like 3 (TBL 3) are transcriptionally coordinated with <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>CELLULOSE</b> SYNTHASE (CESA) genes, respectively. The tbr and tbl 3 mutants hold lower levels of crystalline cellulose and have altered pectin composition in trichomes and stems, respectively, tissues generally thought to contain mainly secondary wall crystalline <b>cellulose.</b> In contrast, <b>primary</b> wall <b>cellulose</b> levels remain unchanged in both mutants as measured in etiolated tbr and tbl 3 hypocotyls, while the amount of esterified pectins is reduced and pectin methylesterase activity is increased in this tissue. Furthermore, etiolated tbr hypocotyls have reduced length with swollen epidermal cells, a phenotype characteristic for primary cesa mutants or the wild type treated with cellulose synthesis inhibitors. Taken together, we show that two TBL genes contribute to the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers...|$|R

Synergistic beta-sugar consumption by Thermotogales is crucial for cellulose hydrolysis in the thermophilic cellulose-degrading consortium because the <b>primary</b> <b>cellulose</b> degraders Clostridiales showed metabolic incompetence in subsequent beta-sugar pathways. Additionally, comparable transcription of putative Sus-like polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) was observed in an unclassified order of Bacteroidetes suggesting the importance of PULs mechanism for polysaccharides breakdown in thermophilic systems. Despite the abundance of acetate as a fermentation product, the acetate-utilizing Methanosarcinales were less prevalent by 60 % than the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacteriales. Whereas the aceticlastic methanogenesis pathway was markedly more active in terms of transcriptional activities in key genes, indicating that the less dominant Methanosarcinales are more active than their hydrogenotrophic counterparts in methane metabolism. These findings suggest that the minority of aceticlastic methanogens are not necessarily associated with repressed metabolism, in a pattern that was commonly observed in the cellulose-based methanization consortium, and thus challenge the causal likelihood proposed by previous studies. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Cellulose is {{synthesized}} by the {{so called}} rosette protein complex and the catalytic subunits of this complex are the cellulose synthases (CESAs). It is thought that the rosette complexes in the primary and secondary cell walls each contains at least three different non-redundant cellulose synthases. In addition to the CESA proteins, cellulose biosynthesis almost certainly requires the action of other proteins, although few have been identified and {{little is known about}} the biochemical role of those that have been identified. One of these proteins is KORRIGAN (KOR 1). Mutant analysis of this protein in Arabidopsis thaliana showed altered cellulose content in both the primary and secondary cell wall.

Chapter A reviews the general nature of coal tars and gives a summary of existing vapor pressure correlations for coal tars and model compounds.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Tecnologias Ambientais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaForest {{fires are}} common events in Mediterranean {{countries}} like Portugal, which contribute {{in a large}} way to desertification processes in these areas. In soil, surface is the most affect by fire, mainly the first 5 cm. This layer is often constituted by organic residues and decomposed organic matter, which are the major reservoir of nutrients, among them nitrogen (N), an essential element for plants and organisms. In a short-term, fire releases nutrients from organic matter and make them more available for plants. In a long-term their concentration may be reduced, considering that the replacement of these nutrients in soil is slow after fire. Depending on fire severity different organic matter pools are affected, the most thermolabile are lost even in low intensity fires, while the most resistant, as humin, are lost at higher temperatures. Organic residues application to soils may increase the nutrients content, as well as organic matter, which will affect positively the chemical and physical properties of soil and also the recovery of microbial life and the revegetation. In this work, the effects of fire on nutrient levels (N, P and K), organic matter pools (soil litter, fulvic and humic acids) and organic compounds (lipid, water-soluble compounds, <b>primary</b> <b>cellulose</b> and lignin) in natural burned and unburned soils at different temperatures in a muffle furnace (control, 65, 105 and 250 ºC) were studied. Mineralization after the application of digested pig slurry (P) and municipal organic waste compost (C) to soils was followed for 60 days, and the effects on the previous properties evaluated. Mineral N was analyzed by segmented flow spectrophotometry after 2 M KCl extraction, and P and K were analysed by Riehm extraction. The most important results {{are related to the}} increased content of mineral N after this fire, and the contribution of pig slurry and mixture applications to increase these values. Simulated fires at the higher temperatures didn´t allow nitrification to take place, due to nitrifying populations death. P and K changes after fire, and after residues applications, were not conclusive, once the loss of these nutrients was small and the contribution of residues to increase their content was not evident. In order to evaluate humic substances content a modified lost on Ignition (LOI) method was used. Fire temperatures were able to reduce the litter and fulvic acids fractions, while the most resistant fraction, the humic acids fraction were not altered. Compost application seemed to contribute more to the increase of fulvic acid fraction, while pig slurry increased the litter fraction. Non-humic substances were determined after a sequence of extractions, non-polar extraction with methylene chloride and ultra-sound for lipids, polar extraction for sugars and acid extraction for primarily cellulose. Lignin was determined by ashing. In the burned andcontrol soils, pig slurry increased the cellulose content, while compost increased the lipid and sugar fractions, after 60 days of incubation. [...] Os fogos florestais são eventos comuns em países mediterrâneos, como Portugal, contribuindo para a desertificação. A superfície do solo é a mais afectada pelo fogo, principalmente os 5 cm superficiais, sendo constituída por resíduos vegetais e matéria orgânica em decomposição, e constituindo um reservatório de nutrientes, como o azoto. A curto prazo, o fogo liberta e disponibiliza nutrientes para as plantas, mas a longo prazo o seu teor diminui, uma vez que a restituição destes ao solo pode ser lenta. Dependendo da intensidade do fogo, diferentes fracções da matéria orgânica são afectadas, as mais termolábeis são perdidas a temperaturas mais baixas, enquanto fracções mais resistentes a temperaturas mais elevadas.

Two CESA 3 missense mutants retained apparently normal CESA complexes as did four cellulose-deficient mutants defective in proteins other than CESAs.

30|$|There {{has been}} {{enormous}} recent interest in biorefinery using non-edible biomass {{as a source}} for renewable fuels (Lynd et al. 1999). To achieve this aim, it is necessary to convert various biological substrates into the desired chemicals and fuels (Saha 2003). Terrestrial biomass consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin (Cosgrove 2005). Cellulose is a polymer of β-glucose that constitutes the main backbone of the plant cell wall, and composes of about 50 % of plant cell walls. Hemicellulose forms a <b>primary</b> network with <b>cellulose</b> microfibrils in various conformations, and the hemicellulose binds with pectin. Polysaccharides belonging to hemicellulose can be extracted from plant cell walls with alkali solution. Common hemicellulose polysaccharides include xyloglucan, xylan, and mannan. Pectin is a family of polysaccharides that include homogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan-I, and rhamnogalacturonan-II. Polysaccharides belonging to pectin can be extracted with hot water or chelating agents. Homogalacturonan is a major component of pectin.

Features of those mutant phenotypes point to particular genes depositing cellulose predominantly in either primary or secondary walls. We used transformation with antisense constructs to investigate the functions of CesA 2 (AthA) and CesA 3 (AthB), genes for which reduced synthesis mutants are not yet available. Plants expressing antisense CesA 1 (RSW 1) provided a comparison with a gene whose mutant phenotype (Rsw 1 −) points mainly to a primary wall role. The antisense phenotypes of CesA 1 and CesA 3 were closely similar and correlated with reduced expression of the target gene. Reductions in cell length rather than cell number underlay the shorter bolts and stamen filaments. Surprisingly, seedling roots were unaffected in both CesA 1 and CesA 3 antisense plants. In keeping with the mild phenotype compared with Rsw 1 −, reductions in total cellulose levels in antisense CesA 1 and CesA 3 plants were at the borderline of significance. We conclude that CesA 3, like CesA 1, is required for deposition of <b>primary</b> wall <b>cellulose.</b> To test whether there were important functional differences between the two, we overexpressed CesA 3 in rsw 1 but were unable to complement that mutant's defect in CesA 1.

We also show that CESA 3 and CESA 6 can be coimmunoprecipitated from detergent-solubilized extracts, their protein levels decrease in mutants for either CESA 3, CESA 6, or CESA 1 and CESA 3, CESA 6 and also CESA 1 can physically interact in vivo as shown by bimolecular fluorescence complementation.

Using promoter-beta-glucuronidase fusions we show that CESA 5, CESA 6, and CESA 2 have distinct overlapping expression patterns in hypocotyl and root corresponding to different stages of cellular development.

Constructs that swapped or deleted N-terminal domains were stably transformed into the wild type and into the temperature-sensitive mutants rsw 1 (Ala- 549 Val in CesA 1) and rsw 5 (Pro- 1056 Ser in CesA 3). Dominant-positive behavior was assayed as root elongation at the restrictive temperature and dominant-negative effects were observed at the permissive temperature. A protein with the catalytic and C-terminal domains of CesA 1 and the N-terminal domain of CesA 3 promoted growth only in rsw 1 consistent with it accessing the CesA 1 site even though it contained the CesA 3 N-terminal domain. A protein having the CesA 3 catalytic and C-terminal domains linked to the CesA 1 N-terminal domain dramatically affected growth, {{but only in the}} CesA 3 mutant. This is consistent with the operation of the same access rule taking this chimeric protein to the CesA 3 site. In this case, however, the transgene behaved as a genotype-specific dominant negative, causing a 60 % death rate in rsw 5, but giving no visible phenotype in wild type or rsw 1.

The main two areas of research are in photocatalytic oxidation and photosensitized degradation. Photocatalytic oxidation uses a species that absorbs radiation and creates hydroxyl radicals that react with the filters and start the breakdown. Photosensitized degradation, though, uses a species that absorbs radiation and transfers the energy to the cellulose acetate to start the degradation process. Both processes use other species that absorbed light > 300 nm to start the degradation of cellulose acetate.|$|R
40|$|A {{characterization}} of pyrolysis behaviour of different refuse derived fuels (RDFs) under heating rates typical of conventional pyrolysis processes is presented. The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (d. s. c.) on different RDFs, and on some materials which have been considered 'key components' towards thermal degradation characteristics of RDFs, are reported. The RDF weight loss curve presents two distinct weight loss steps attributable, respectively, to cellulosic materials and plastic degradation. Samples from different plants and different municipal solid waste (MSW) feedstocks show the same qualitative behaviour. In interpretation of the experimental results, the assumption has been made that the pyrolysis rate of thermal degradation of RDF {{can be considered as}} the sum of the rates of the main RDF components: paper (cellulose), wood-like materials (cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose), plastics mainly polyethylene (PE); and that each component contributed to the formation of this sum to an extent proportional to its contribution to the composition of the RDF. On the basis of these data and by means of a simple mathematical approach a method is proposed which provides a simple tool for RDF characterization and, in particular, evaluation of plastic content. A kinetic model has been developed, {{based on the assumption that}} the RDF degradation rate is the weighed sum of the rates of <b>primary</b> reacting species: <b>cellulose,</b> lignin, hemicellulose, PE. Simplified kinetic pathways were used for the description of the degradation processes of RDF components. The model allows quantitative prediction of RDF weight loss and char yield at least at the heating rates used in present work...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{hydrolysis}} of cellulose-to-glucose {{is critically}} important in pro-ducing fuels and chemicals from renewable feedstocks. Cellulose hydrolysis in aqueous media suffers from slow reaction rates because cellulose is a water-insoluble crystalline biopolymer. The high-crystallinity of cellulose fib-rils renders the internal surface of cellulose inaccessible to the hydrolyzing enzymes (cellulases) as well as water. Pretreatment methods, which increase the surface area accessible to water and cellulases are vital to improving the hydrolysis kinetics and conversion of cellulose to glucose. In a novel tech-nique, the microcrystalline cellulose was first subjected to an ionic liquid (IL) treatment and then recovered as essentially amorphous or as a mixture of amorphous and partially crystalline cellulose by rapidly quenching the solu-tion with an antisolvent. Because of their extremely low-volatility, ILs {{are expected to have}} minimal environmental impact. Two different ILs, 1 -n-butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) and 1 -allyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (AMIMCl) were investigated. Hydrolysis kinetics of the IL-treated cellulose is significantly enhanced. With appropriate selection of IL treatment conditions and enzymes, the initial hydrolysis rates for IL-treated cellulose were up to 90 times greater than those of untreated cellulose. We infer that this drastic improvement in the “overall hydrolysis rates ” with IL-treated cellu-lose is mainly because of a significant enhancement in the kinetics of the “pri-mary hydrolysis step ” (conversion of solid cellulose to soluble oligomers), which is the rate-limiting step for untreated cellulose. Thus, with IL-treated <b>cellulose,</b> <b>primary</b> hydrolysis rates increase and become comparable with the rates of inherently faster “secondary hydrolysis ” (conversion of soluble oligomers to glucose) ...|$|R

Plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) are therefore important {{in a wide range}} of biotechnological processes from the production of biofuels and food to waste processing. However, despite the fact that the last common ancestor of all deuterostomes was inferred to be able to digest, or even synthesize, cellulose using endogenous genes, all model insects whose complete genomes have been sequenced lack genes encoding such enzymes. To establish if the apparent "disappearance" of PCWDEs from insects is simply a sampling problem, we used 454 mediated pyrosequencing to scan the gut transcriptomes of beetles that feed on a variety of plant derived diets. By sequencing the transcriptome of five beetles, and surveying publicly available ESTs, we describe 167 new beetle PCWDEs belonging to eight different enzyme families. This survey proves that these enzymes are not only present in non-model insects but that the multigene families that encode them are apparently undergoing complex birth-death dynamics. This reinforces the observation that insects themselves, and not just their microbial symbionts, are a rich source of PCWDEs. Further it emphasises that the apparent absence of genes encoding PCWDEs from model organisms is indeed simply a sampling artefact.

The screen-heater combines fast heating of the cellulose sample with very fast (milliseconds) removal (high escape rate) and quenching of the reaction products. The solid residue, condensed product, non-condensable gas, levoglucosan and glucose yields obtained from the screen-heater experiments are compared with the product yields from the fluidized bed reactor to elucidate potassium catalysed reactions in the hot vapour phase. Potassium {{was found to be}} catalytically active even when the escape rate (milliseconds) of the product was extremely high. Consequently, significantly lower condensed product and sugar yields were obtained. The production of non-condensable gas could almost completely be ascribed to thermal reactions in the vapour phase when the potassium content is low but was predominately produced at the hot reacting particle when the potassium content is high. It was found {{that in the case of}} levoglucosan the anions were active in potassium the following order Cl− > OH− > CO 3 2 −. The activity in reducing the hydrolysable anhydro-sugars (levoglucosan and oligomers), expressed as glucose recovery, shows the following order, OH− > Cl− > CO 3 2 −. Vacuum could help to improve the oil and sugar yield by fast removal of the products from the hot reacting sample. However, this only holds for cellulose with a low potassium (< 100 mg kg− 1) content...|$|R
40|$|CbpA, the {{scaffolding}} protein of Clostridium cellulovorans cellulosomes, possesses one family 3 cellulose binding domain, nine cohesin domains, and four hydrophilic domains (HLDs). Among {{the three types}} of domains, the function of the HLDs is still unknown. We proposed previously that the HLDs of CbpA play a role in attaching the cellulosome to the cell surface, since they showed some homology to the surface layer homology domains of EngE. Several recombinant proteins with HLDs (rHLDs) and recombinant EngE (rEngE) were examined to determine their binding to the C. cellulovorans cell wall fraction. Tandemly linked rHLDs showed higher affinity for the cell wall than individual rHLDs showed. EngE was shown to have a higher affinity for cell walls than rHLDs have. C. cellulovorans native cellulosomes were found to have higher affinity for cell walls than rHLDs have. When immunoblot analysis was carried out with the native cellulosome fraction bound to cell wall fragments, the presence of EngE was also confirmed, suggesting that the mechanism anchoring CbpA to the C. cellulovorans cell surface was mediated through EngE and that the HLDs play a secondary role in the attachment of the cellulosome to the cell surface. During a study of the role of HLDs on cellulose degradation, the mini-cellulosome complexes with HLDs degraded cellulose more efficiently than complexes without HLDs degraded cellulose. The rHLDs also showed binding affinity for crystalline cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These results suggest that the CbpA HLDs play a major role and a minor role in C. cellulovorans cellulosomes. The <b>primary</b> role increases <b>cellulose</b> degradation activity by binding the cellulosome complex to the cellulose substrate; secondarily, HLDs aid the binding of the CbpA/cellulosome to the C. cellulovorans cell surface...|$|R
40|$|The oak wood timbers of the 17 th century Swedish warship Vasa are weak. The {{weakening}} {{has been}} attributed to cellulose degradation, which is more extensive in the interior of the timbers compared to the surface regions. Further, the mechanism of cellulose degradation was attributed to oxidative reactions involving iron as a catalyst. In this work, the non-cellulosic wood components (lignin and extractives) in the wood of the Vasa have been studied in order to assess the level of degradation possibly caused by oxidative reactions. Because the interior of the wood timbers is more acidic and its cellulose more depolymerized than at the near surface regions, a general study of organic acidand iron concentrations with respect to different depths from the surface was also performed. Characterization of lignin in the wood of the Vasa was done by means of wet chemical degradation (thioacidolysis) and subsequent GC-MS analysis of the degradation products, as well as CP/MAS 13 C NMR spectroscopy of the wood. Dry acetone- and water extracts of the wood were analyzed by 13 C NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy in order to study the presence of gallo- and ellagitannins. No severe lignin degradation and no discernible amounts of hydrolysable tannins in the oak wood of the Vasa were detected, indicating that oxidative reactions are not the <b>primary</b> route to <b>cellulose</b> depolymerization. High amounts of oxalic acid (analyzed by HPIEC) and a low pH have been found in the interior of the wood timbers, supporting acid hydrolysis as the main mechanism of cellulose depolymerization. Analysis of the iron distribution using ICP AES shows that iron is most abundant in the surface of the timbers and decreases as the concentration of oxalic acid increases. Experimental work also shows that some iron species (rust) in the Vasa neutralize oxalic acid, thereby protecting the surface wood from acid hydrolysis. QC 20130422 </p...|$|R
