It was, however, not until January 26, 1870, that Virginia was readmitted; Johnston {{was able to take}} his seat shortly afterward. The delay was due to a Congressional need to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> act that would allow Virginia {{representation}} in the body.|$|E

5|$|The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn The {{membership}} and ritual of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were strongly linked to Freemasonry, but membership {{was open to}} non-masons and to women. The grades formed a teaching system for the Kabbalah, and initiates had to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> exam before being allowed {{to advance to the}} next degree.|$|E
5|$|The en passant capture {{rule was}} {{added in the}} 15th century when the rule that gave pawns an initial double-step move was introduced. It {{prevents}} a pawn from using the two-square advance to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> adjacent enemy pawn without {{the risk of being}} captured.|$|E
5|$|After {{involving}} {{itself in}} the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, France found itself financially ruined. Attempts to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> economic plan to alleviate this in the Estates-General of 1789 led instead to the third estate—the commoners—forking to form the National Assembly. Succeeded in turn by the National Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly, the various legislative bodies succeeded in rendering the monarchy constitutional, limited by democratic institutions. Attempts to remove the monarch entirely, although thwarted on 20 June 1792, led to the effective overthrow of Louis XVI on 10 August. On 21 October, France was formally declared a republic.|$|E

5|$|Chapman and Douglas Adams wrote a {{pilot for}} a TV series in 1975, Out of the Trees, but it {{received}} poor ratings after being broadcast {{at the same}} time as Match of the Day and only the initial episode was produced. In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film The Odd Job with McKenna, and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend Keith Moon to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> acting test, so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on Do Not Adjust Your Set with Pythons Idle, Jones, and Palin. The film was moderately successful.|$|E
5|$|Senior {{membership}} {{is open to}} all U.S. citizens, and resident aliens aged 18 and over who are able to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> FBI background check. There is no upper age limit, nor membership restrictions for physical disabilities, due to the number of different tasks which members may be called on to perform. Cadet {{membership is}} open to those aged between 12 and 18 who maintain satisfactory progress in school, as determined by the cadet's unit commander; upon their 18th birthday, cadets may become senior members or remain in the Cadet Program until they are 21.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education. The bill passed the Senate, but not the House. Cooper was made {{chairman}} of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorizing $900million in federal funds to states for highway construction. In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity. He insisted on {{an amendment to the}} War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets. He also co-sponsored legislation allowing {{hundreds of thousands of people}} displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally. He opposed bans on industrywide collective bargaining for organized labor and on the establishment of closed shops. He voted against putting union welfare funds under government control, but helped to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{expected}} TV commercials during such TV hits as Friends and Law & Order, {{as well as}} one in {{the second}} quarter of Super Bowl XXXVII, there was also a tie-in with Kraft, an in-store promotion at Wal-Mart, a marketing campaign with Hamilton Watch Company, who designed the watch Matt wears in the film, and a weeklong Daredevil segment on Entertainment Tonight. As part of an online form of marketing, a viral e-mail drive was started, where participants would be entered in a contest where they could win prizes such as Daredevil T-shirts, Game Boy Advance games, and cufflinks. To enter the drawing, the user had to book tickets for the film online, then <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> e-mail on to someone else. The idea was to encourage online ticket booking, which at the time was seen as a growing trend. The Game Boy Advance Daredevil game was released on February 14, 2003, and was created by Encore, a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation. The soundtrack to the film, , was released in February 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, for mainly {{patriotic}} reasons, the Australian Natives' Association helped establish the Federation League, a society {{dedicated to the}} creation of a federal nation. Following a series of addresses by the future Prime Minister, Edmund Barton to large crowds, some 15 League branches were established in the towns along the southern border. One of these towns, Corowa, was the location for the first conference of the Australian Federation League in 1893. At this conference, Dr John Quick, a delegate from Bendigo, proposed a resolution calling for the colonial legislatures to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> act providing for the election of representatives to a convention to develop a federal constitution. This has been seen as the turning point in the push for Federation. The momentum generated from this point lead to a series of conventions and elections and finally, the inauguration of a federal constitution on 1 January 1901.|$|E
50|$|In 1814, Ursin <b>passed</b> <b>an</b> exam in land {{surveying}} before graduating cum laude from Metropolitanskolen in 1815. Having won a prize assignment involving regular polyhedron, he <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> second exam cum laude.|$|R
50|$|To <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> National Course (such as for example, Higher Mathematics), {{students}} have to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> number of National Units that are internally assessed, as well as <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> final externally assessed examination. Unit assessments are unseen and should a student fail an assessment opportunity, only one re-sit opportunity is provided using a fresh unseen assessment. (A second re-sit opportunity is only allowed in exceptional circumstances.) Failure to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> National Unit at Higher level would mean that a student {{would be unable to}} pass the National Course at Higher level that year, though they may successfully complete a number of National Units.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} gain access to the Regiment, {{volunteer}} Carabinieri must <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> physical selection test. After that, staff will have to face and <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> 15-week access course, divided into 2 phases.|$|R
5|$|On July 11, 1844, Philadelphia {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} {{that gave the}} city a battalion of artillery, a regiment of infantry {{and at least one}} full troop of cavalry for the purpose of providing the preservation of peace within the city when necessary. The difficulty of quelling the riots and other crime led to the Pennsylvania General Assembly to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> 1845 act that required Philadelphia, the township of Moyamensing and the unincorporated districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Penn to maintain a police force of one man per 150 taxable inhabitants. In 1850, another act was passed that established that the Philadelphia police force would police the city and seven surrounding districts. The inability to maintain order effectively in Philadelphia's suburbs would be an important argument for the consolidation of the city in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Romney Academy trustee John Baker White was a {{clerk of}} both the circuit and county courts of Hampshire County and {{was the father of}} Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia from 1877 until 1881. Robert White {{successfully}} lobbied the West Virginia Legislature to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> act establishing the Institution for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind of West Virginia (later named the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind), which utilized the former campus of the Romney Classical Institute, a successor educational institution to Romney Academy. Another trustee, Angus William McDonald, was the father of Marshall McDonald, who served as commissioner of the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries from 1888 until 1895.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly was {{controlled}} by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda. Despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes, when the outgoing Breathitt administration projected a shortfall of $24 million in the state budget, Nunn convinced the General Assembly to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> increase in the motor vehicle license fee from $5.00 to $12.50 and raise the state sales tax from three percent to five percent. Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, and economic development. In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the income tax for low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Netball {{strategy}} involves {{several types}} of passes, including centre passes, penalty passes and short <b>passes.</b> <b>A</b> centre <b>pass</b> occurs after <b>a</b> goal has been scored, when the Centre <b>passes</b> the ball. <b>A</b> short <b>pass</b> is <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> between two players on the same team, where {{the length of the}} pass is so short that a defensive player cannot get between the two opposing players to intercept the ball. <b>A</b> penalty <b>pass</b> is <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> where the ball is returned from the sideline into play. This <b>pass</b> occurs after <b>a</b> penalty has been called.|$|R
5000|$|Her best-known {{action as}} mayor was, {{after the city}} council <b>passed</b> <b>an</b> {{anti-discrimination}} ordinance, taking down a controversial anti-gay sign, [...] "Fagots Stay Out," [...] that was posted in a local landmark restaurant, Barney's Beanery. During her term, the council <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> strong rent-control law, and also began offering domestic partnership benefits, becoming the second American city to legally recognize same-sex relationships (Berkeley had <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> similar law a year earlier).|$|R
25|$|In 1998, {{the state}} of Hawaii <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> {{constitutional}} amendment against gay marriage. In 2013 a ruling, by {{the state attorney general}} on this amendment, allowed the government to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> statute legalizing gay marriage.|$|R
5|$|The {{businessman}} and politician William Smith was appointed Lord Warden in 1891, but died in Walmer Castle {{during his first}} visit here in October of that year. Smith had proposed that the historical artefacts in the castle should be protected from being removed by later Lord Wardens and suggested that government <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> Indenture of Heirlooms Bill. The government carried out the plan after Smith's death, protecting almost 70 pieces of furniture and 50 artworks at the castle and forbidding them being moved from the castle without the Secretary of State for War's approval. Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, became the next Lord Warden; with adequate legal protection now in place, the 3rd Duke of Wellington suggested returning his grandfather's possessions to the castle, but Lady Salisbury declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|The new {{constitution}} {{led to the}} gradual erosion of the Democratic majority. In 1854, the Republican Party was established and drew {{in many of the}} former Whigs. That year the General Assembly was split with no party attaining a majority. The Democrats held the largest number of seats, but the Whigs and Republicans caucused to form a majority and control the assembly. The result was deadlock on most issues because Republicans and Whigs could not agree on most major issues. By 1858, the Whigs were almost completely disempowered and the Republicans gained enough seats to become the largest party, but not enough to form a majority on their own. That year Governor Ashbel P. Willard called the first special session of the General Assembly because they had been unable to <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> appropriations bill. Democrats regained a small majority by gaining the votes of the disaffected Whigs in the 1860 election.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndicated}} version's potential contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, {{are required to}} <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who fail the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they are given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E
50|$|The system {{requires}} the train driver to manually acknowledge <b>a</b> warning when <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> double yellow signal (similar to the Memor/Le Crocodile system), {{as well as}} stopping a train automatically if it <b>passes</b> <b>a</b> red signal.|$|R
5000|$|Also in 1853, Michigan <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> prohibitory liquor {{law which}} was {{ratified}} by 2/3 of the electorate. However, in 1854, {{the law was}} declared unconstitutional. The next year the state legislature <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> revised liquor law.|$|R
