5|$|Biden {{was inaugurated}} {{to a second}} term {{in the early morning}} of January 20, 2013, at a small {{ceremony}} in his official residence with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21). He continued to be in the forefront as, {{in the wake of the}} Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the Obama administration put forth executive orders and <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> towards new gun control measures (the legislation failed to pass).|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Gillibrand <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> {{that would}} remove sexual assault cases from the {{military}} chain of command; the bill was cosponsored by Republican senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Gillibrand's bill failed to gain enough votes to break a filibuster in March 2014; however, her efforts likely improved her standing as a lawmaker in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{efforts to}} remove the road from Mecca to the highway from Blythe to Indio, from the state highway system were met with {{community}} opposition, since it served as an alternate route for the other highway. State Senator Nelson Dilworth <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> to require the road from Banning through Idyllwild to Mountain Center {{to be added to}} the state highway system if SR 195 was removed, as the two were of roughly the same length, but the latter remained in the system.|$|E

5|$|Senator Roberts <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> at {{the start}} of session {{regarding}} the surety bond required for towing carriers in rural areas. SB12-049 would have lowered the surety bond from $50,000 to $10,000 for local entities. The bill was assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after the bill was killed, public upheaval caused Roberts to introduce a new bill, this time in the House, which resolved the same issue. HB12-1347 passed the second time around with a resounding 98-1 vote.|$|E
5|$|In January of the {{following}} year, state Assemblyman Wadie Deddeh <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> to remove the southern portion of SR 125 from the state highway plans again. Soon afterward, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) moved to support retaining SR 125 from Poway to Santee in the county transportation plan, despite opposition from a county supervisor and the mayor of Escondido. Deddeh's bill passed the state Assembly Transportation Committee a month later; in the meeting, Deddeh noted the construction of I-805 to handle the traffic demands of the region, {{as well as a}} lack of funding that would result in the construction being delayed for at least 20 years. Despite a petition from the mayor of Escondido, the CPO again declined to remove SR 125 from the county transportation plan in March.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, several Texas sports teams, {{including}} the Houston Rockets, <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> that would dedicate state tax revenue {{to build new}} arenas. Although the bill was failed in the Texas House of Representatives, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced {{he would continue to}} study the possibility of constructing a new arena in downtown Houston, saying the 20-year-old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable. Although the Summit's management said they could renovate the building for {{a small part of the}} cost of a new arena, the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena, They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner, Chuck Watson, to release them from their contract with the Summit, which ran until 2003.|$|E

5|$|In late 2011, Oregon Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> {{to extend}} the {{payments}} for another five years. The move was backed by Governor John Kitzhaber and the entire Oregon congressional delegation. Republican and Democratic members of Oregon's congressional delegation also proposed setting aside some of the federal land in Oregon as public trusts in which half would be designated for harvest to provide revenue for the counties, and half designated as a conservation area. President Barack Obama's proposed 2013 United States federal budget included $294 million {{to extend the}} program for fiscal year 2013 {{with a plan to}} continue the payments for four more years, with the amount declining 10% each year.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy, {{then the}} U.S. President, gave the {{graduation}} commencement address at Aztec Bowl {{in front of}} 40,000 people on June 6, 1963. Kennedy was given an honorary doctorate degree in law at the ceremony, making San Diego State the first in California to award an honorary doctorate degree. To commemorate his visit, the campus added his portrait to the campus library collection and a granite stone marker placed where his helicopter landed (California Historical Landmark #798). In April 2008, a plaque that commemorated his visit was stolen {{and has yet to}} be recovered. On May 29, 1964 Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the Open Air Theater about <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> in improving rights for African Americans.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag {{assembled}} at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances. Ranks of SA men {{served as}} guards inside the building, while large groups outside opposing the <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament. The {{position of the}} Centre Party, the third largest party in the Reichstag, was decisive. After Hitler verbally promised party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act. The Act passed {{by a vote of}} 441â€“84, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour. The Enabling Act, along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship.|$|E

50|$|The tribunes of the plebs had {{the power}} to convene the concilium plebis, or plebeian assembly, and <b>propose</b> <b>legislation</b> before it. Only one of the tribunes could preside over this assembly, which {{had the power}} to pass laws {{affecting}} only the plebeians, known as plebiscita, or plebiscites. After 287 BC, the decrees of the concilium plebis had the effect of law over all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century BC, the tribunes could also convene and <b>propose</b> <b>legislation</b> before the senate.|$|R

5|$|Political {{plans were}} thrown into disarray by Palmerston's death on 18 October 1865. Russell became Prime Minister again, with Gladstone clearly the Liberal Party's leader-in-waiting, and as Leader of the House Disraeli's direct opponent. One of Russell's early {{priorities}} was a Reform Bill, but the <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> that Gladstone announced on 12 March 1866 divided his party. The Conservatives and the dissident Liberals repeatedly attacked Gladstone's bill, and in June finally defeated the government; Russell resigned on 26 June. The dissidents {{were unwilling to}} serve under Disraeli in the House of Commons, and Derby formed a third Conservative minority government, with Disraeli again as Chancellor. In 1867, the Conservatives introduced a Reform Bill. Without {{a majority in the}} Commons, the Conservatives {{had little choice but to}} accept amendments that considerably liberalised the legislation, though Disraeli refused to accept any from Gladstone.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{alternatives}} to the difficult-to-work copper-nickel alloy, in June 1867 Longacre proposed that the five-cent piece be struck in aluminum. The new Mint director, Henry Linderman, objected to the proposal, stating that the price and supply of aluminum were as yet uncertain, and that the metal was too expensive to use in a minor coin. Numismatic historian Don Taxay, in his history of the United States Mint and its coins, noted that Linderman had <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation</b> increasing the proportion of nickel in the alloy to a third despite having earlier opposed the use of nickel in coins. Taxay suggested that Linderman was most likely influenced by Wharton and the metal's other advocates.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm had {{the right}} to vote on civil, {{administrative}} and legal issues; a simple majority was required to pass laws.

It could issue laws on currency, taxation and budget, deal with issues related to military conscription (such as its size), and amend the constitution. It had no legislative initiative, as that belong only to the king; however, the Sejm could issue petitions to the monarch with <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The spill was the {{culmination}} of a dispute within the Liberal Party over its response to the Rudd Government's proposed emissions trading scheme (ETS). Turnbull supported the introduction of an ETS and sought to negotiate amendments to government's <b>proposed</b> <b>legislation.</b> Abbott came to represent many Liberal members of Parliament who were climate change sceptics or otherwise opposed the ETS. After Turnbull survived a spill motion (a motion to declare the leadership vacant) against his leadership in late November 2009, Abbott declared his candidacy and a subsequent spill was moved on 1 December. Hockeya moderate who had been a supporter of Turnbull's position on the ETSalso stood. While Hockey had been expected to win, he was knocked out {{in the first round of}} voting. Abbott subsequently defeated Turnbull in the second round, 4241.|$|E
