5|$|In the 17th century, chief {{architect}} and Surveyor-General to James I, Inigo Jones, surveyed {{the area and}} introduced the local Portland stone to London; using it in his Banqueting House, Whitehall, and for repairs on St Paul's Cathedral. His successor, Sir Christopher Wren, the architect and Member of Parliament for nearby Weymouth, used six million tons of white Portland limestone to rebuild destroyed parts of the capital after the Great Fire of London of 1666. Well-known buildings in the capital, including St Paul's Cathedral and the eastern front of Buckingham Palace feature the stone. After the First World War, a quarry was opened by The Crown Estate to provide stone for the Cenotaph in Whitehall and half a million gravestones for war cemeteries, and after the Second World War {{hundreds of thousands of}} gravestones were hewn for soldiers who had fallen on the Western Front. <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> {{has nothing to do with}} Portland; it was so named due to its similar colour to Portland stone when mixed with lime and sand.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the {{distinctive}} Scottish use of stone architecture declined as it was replaced by cheaper alternatives such as <b>Portland</b> <b>cement,</b> concrete, and mass-production brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals. In {{the twentieth century}} private architecture was increasingly client driven. James Robert Rhind (1854–1918), the son of David Rhind, was successful in the competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following Andrew Carnegie's gift of £100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for seven libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Rhind's libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by his liberal use of columns, domes and sculpted features. James Miller (1860–1947) is noted for his Scottish railway stations, such as his 1901–05 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station, and the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new <b>Portland</b> <b>cement.</b> The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E

40|$|Drying {{shrinkage}} behaviour of expansive cement pastes were studied and {{compared with those}} of <b>portland</b> <b>cements.</b> Results indicate that the {{shrinkage behaviour}} of these two cements is significantly different from each other. Generally, expansive cements shrink more than <b>portland</b> <b>cements,</b> and especially more so if they have not been adequately cured, i. e. curing period of at least 7 days is necessary to ensure good performance against shrinkage. Internal damage caused by large amounts of expansion leads to a large magnitude of shrinkage. In that event curing {{does not seem to have}} any beneficial impact on shrinkage performance. Steel reinforcement also seems to decrease shrinkage magnitude, but it has no effect on the shrinkage characteristic. Much of the research on expansive cements has so far been focused on the expansion behaviour rather than on the shrinkage behaviour. More research on shrinkage is needed to improve its field performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to explain why}} the C-S-H phase that grows during the hydration of <b>Portland</b> <b>Cements</b> initially requires a high water content, much of which is lost by gentle drying. It is proposed that the rapid growth of C-S-H during the hydration of alite (C 3 S) in <b>Portland</b> <b>cements</b> initially occurs by adsorption of fully hydrated aqueous calcium cations onto anhydrous anionic basal sheets of a silicate-deficient (dimeric) tobermorite-like composition. Both divalent (Ca 2 +) and univalent (CaOH+) solvated cations are incorporated to balance the negative charge of the basal sheet, leading to significant structural disorder, explaining the poorly-crystalline nature of the C-S-H formed. Some of the solvation water is lost irreversibly on first drying due to the formation of Si-O-Ca-O-Si bridges, explaining irreversible shrinkage. The initially-formed C-S-H is metastable relative to a form with longer silicate chains, towards which it may slowly evolve with separation of water and CH...|$|R
40|$|The {{carbonation}} {{resistance of}} alkali-activated binders is often tested via accelerated test protocols designed for <b>Portland</b> <b>cements,</b> without questioning whether the tests replicate the mechanisms observed in service. Thus, validation of accelerated methods {{is required to}} enable realistic prediction of material performance. Changes in pore solution equilibria cause the formation of sodium bicarbonates during accelerated carbonation, compared with hydrous sodium carbonates in natural carbonation. This shifts the carbonation mechanism to favour more rapid reaction progress, to give a higher apparent degree of acceleration (compared to natural conditions) than in <b>Portland</b> <b>cements.</b> The pore solution pH under accelerated carbonation is significantly lower than at natural CO 2 concentrations, leading to a falsely short predicted service life (time to expected corrosion of embedded steel), as natural CO 2 concentrations appear not to reduce the pH below 10. Thus, accelerated carbonation testing is unduly aggressive towards alkali-activated binders, and test results must be cautiously interpreted...|$|R
