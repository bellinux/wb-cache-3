40|$|Malaysia {{has taken}} the {{decision}} to use English as a medium of instruction at university level beginning in 2002 and much debate has surfaced since then. English has also increased in importance in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) since the nation joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) and implemented an Open Door Policy. This study investigates and compares perceived second language anxiety and attempts to identify whether there are any significant differences in the level of anxiety of male and female ESL university students at Stamford College, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia, from the <b>PRC</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> It also attempts to identify the factors that could contribute to language classroom anxiety. Although the study did not control for factors that may influence language apprehension, the results suggest that nearly half {{of the total number of}} respondents are anxious about learning the English language. English Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (ELCAS) with 32 items was constructed and used for the purpose of the study which was adapted and adopted from Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) of Horwitz et. al. 33 items (1986). Findings show that gender is of slight significance but nationality is an important variable in identifying the anxiety level with the various factors that may contribute to English language classroom anxiety...|$|E

There are global security concerns associated with the damage. It is likely broad enough to reduce fish stocks in the world's most fish-dependent region." [...] He explained that, [...] "the world has heard little about the damage inflicted by the People's Republic of China to the reefs is that the experts can't get to them." [...] and noted [...] "I have colleagues from the Philippines, Taiwan, <b>PRC,</b> Vietnam <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia</b> who have worked in the Spratly area.

5000|$|Chinese users seem to {{have fewer}} {{objections}} to Han unification, largely because Unicode {{did not attempt to}} unify Simplified Chinese characters (an invention of the People's Republic of China, and in use among Chinese speakers in the <b>PRC,</b> Singapore, <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia),</b> with Traditional Chinese characters, as used in Hong Kong, Taiwan (Big5), and, with some differences, more familiar to Korean and Japanese users. Unicode is seen as neutral with regards to this politically charged issue, and has encoded Simplified and Traditional Chinese glyphs separately (e.g. the ideograph for [...] "discard" [...] is 丟 U+4E1F for Traditional Chinese Big5 #A5E1 and 丢 U+4E22 for Simplified Chinese GB #2210). It is also noted that Traditional and Simplified characters should be encoded separately according to Unicode Han Unification rules, because they are distinguished in pre-existing PRC character sets. Furthermore, as with other variants, Traditional to Simplified characters is not a one-to-one relationship.|$|R

5000|$|East Timor is a {{destination}} country for women from Indonesia, the People’s Republic of China (<b>P.R.C.),</b> Thailand, <b>Malaysia,</b> <b>and</b> the Philippines trafficked {{for the purpose}} of commercial sexual exploitation. Timorese women and children are vulnerable to being trafficked from rural areas or from camps for internally displaced persons to Dili with lures of employment and then forced into commercial sexual exploitation. Following the re-establishment of international peacekeeping operations in 2006, several businesses suspected of involvement in sex trafficking have reopened. Widespread internal displacement, poverty, and lack of awareness of trafficking risks could lead East Timor to become a source of vulnerable persons trafficked to other countries.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the equilibrium real exchange rate and {{real exchange rate misalignment}}s in developing Asian countries {{during the period}} 1995 – 2008. In addition, the relationship between real exchange rate misalignment and export performance is investigated. In the lead-up to the 1997 – 1998 financial crisis, real exchange rate exhibited persistent overvaluation in the crisis-affected countries. After the crisis, real exchange rate undervaluation was evident in many Asian countries such as People’s Republic of China (<b>PRC),</b> <b>Malaysia,</b> <b>and</b> Thailand. This study also shows that real exchange rate misalignment could {{have a negative impact on}} export performance in developing Asia. With its implications on economic activity, monitoring real exchange rate equilibrium and misalignment is a useful tool for governments/central banks to ensure balance in the economy.

5000|$|While {{the use of}} {{simplified}} Chinese {{is often}} associated with the <b>PRC</b> <b>and</b> its ruling Communist party the connection today is not as simple as it once may have been. Many simplified Chinese texts are published outside of mainland China. Overseas communities are now increasingly using simplified characters, especially when publications are intended for a mainland Chinese audience. Chinese newspapers in Singapore <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia</b> are mainly published in simplified Chinese. Most university Chinese programs in the United States and France teach simplified characters, and the number continues to rise. [...] The internet is also increasingly diverse, with many websites including Wikipedia offering an easy switch between simplified and traditional scripts.|$|R
40|$|We {{tested a}} novel hypothesis, {{generated}} from representational accounts of medial temporal lobe (MTL) function, {{that the major}} white matter tracts converging on perirhinal cortex (<b>PrC)</b> <b>and</b> hippocampus (HC) would be differentially involved in face and scene perception, respectively. Diffusion tensor imaging was applied in healthy participants alongside an odd-one-out paradigm sensitive to <b>PrC</b> <b>and</b> HC lesions in animals and humans. Microstructure of inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF, connecting occipital and ventro-anterior temporal lobe, including <b>PrC)</b> <b>and</b> fornix (the main HC input/output pathway) correlated with accuracy on odd-one-out judgements involving faces and scenes, respectively. Similarly, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in <b>PrC</b> <b>and</b> HC, elicited during oddity judgements, was correlated with face and scene oddity performance, respectively. We also observed associations between ILF and fornix microstructure and category-selective BOLD response in <b>PrC</b> <b>and</b> HC, respectively. These striking three-way associations highlight functionally dissociable, structurally instantiated MTL neurocognitive networks for complex face and scene perception...|$|R

5000|$|East Timor prohibits {{all forms}} of sex and labor {{trafficking}} through its 2003 Immigration and Asylum Act, which prescribes penalties for sex trafficking that are sufficiently stringent, but are not commensurate with those prescribed for rape. While there were no reported prosecutions or convictions for trafficking for labor or sexual exploitation during the last year, law enforcement operations increased. In November 2007, the government intervened to prevent a group of minors from traveling to Malaysia under circumstances that suggested trafficking. In January 2008, the United Nations Police Force (UNPOL) and the National Police of East Timor (PNTL) conducted a joint raid at a Dili bar suspected of sex trafficking. They arrested 32 suspects, mainly women from the <b>P.R.C.,</b> Indonesia, <b>Malaysia,</b> <b>and</b> East Timor. The PNTL conducted a separate raid at another Dili bar, where they arrested over 87 suspects, mainly foreign women engaging in prostitution. While neither raid resulted in prosecution of traffickers, Timorese authorities also did not prosecute the victims. In both cases, the Timorese police detained and then released all suspects after 48 hours and after charging the foreign women with immigration violations because they had entered the country on tourist visas or without visas.|$|R
