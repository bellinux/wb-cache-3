The brain drain of professionals had become so damaging to the political credibility and economic viability of East Germany that the re-securing of the Soviet imperial frontier was imperative. At the same time, there were positive consequences of the emigration for the East German regime, including the removal of anti-Russian nationalists and vocal opponents, which might have helped East Germany government to avoid some of the unrest that developed in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia.|$|E

The Office for National Statistics's abandonment of the method of demographic analysis for the <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>ages</b> has allowed these biases to creep in.

50|$|The {{official}} unemployment rate, though {{very high}} by international standards, understates its magnitude because it includes only {{adults who are}} actively looking for work, excluding those who have given up looking for jobs.

This rate is 30% points lower than that of China, and about 25% lower than that of Brazil or Indonesia. The relatively generous social grants reduces the political cost of unemployment. There is some evidence that households view paid employment and social grants as substitutes at the margin: households that lose a pension-eligible member subsequently report increased labour force participation.|$|E

50|$|Demographic {{window is}} defined {{to be that}} period of time in a nation's {{demographic}} evolution when the proportion of <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>age</b> group is particularly prominent. This occurs when the demographic architecture of a population becomes younger and the percentage of people able to work reaches its height. Typically, the demographic window of opportunity lasts for 30 - 40 years depending upon the country. Because of the mechanical link between fertility levels and age structures, the timing and duration of this period is closely associated to those of fertility decline: when birth rates fall, the age pyramid first shrinks with gradually lower proportions of young population (under 15s) and the dependency ratio decreases as is happening (or happened) in various parts of East Asia over several decades. After a few decades, low fertility however causes the population to get older and the growing proportion of elderly people inflates again the dependency ratio as is observed in present-day Europe.|$|E
