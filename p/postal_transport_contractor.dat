The majority of postal farmers now received salaries and the rural sub-post office system is formalized.|$|R

One of the first measures adopted by the new administration was the organisation of a <b>postal</b> <b>transport</b> service to and from the interior of the country. For this purpose, Atanasio Lapido was nominated as Postal Contractor, with the task of installing staging posts throughout the country. These began to come into operation in May 1853.

30|$|An {{ecosystem}} {{approach can be}} helpful in designing holistic diffusion programs for digitally transforming small businesses and in mobilizing the relevant stakeholders to fund and sustain them. These programs would focus on actual usage and payoffs from e-commerce, rather than focusing solely on digital investment. They would be tailored to country context, to address policy and institutional factors, such as payment systems, privacy and data security, legal protection for online transactions, customs and trade compliance procedures, and Internet governance. They should address issues of access to Internet and broadband, and the diverse forms of digital divide. They may also address those infrastructural issues (e.g., <b>postal,</b> <b>transport,</b> logistics, electricity) that impact SMEs‚Äô e-commerce most adversely. And perhaps most important to SMEs, diffusion programs can promote capability development and advisory services to SMEs to leverage and integrate e-commerce adoption into their business strategies and practices. Effective programs are typically sponsored by the state, in collaboration with local governments, and trade and business associations.|$|R

50|$|Nationalized industries, {{charged with}} {{operating}} in the public interest, may be under strong political and social pressures to give much more attention to externalities. They may be obliged to operate loss-making activities where it is judged that social benefits are greater than social costs ‚Äî for example, rural <b>postal</b> and <b>transport</b> services. The government has recognized these social obligations and, in some cases, provides subsidies for such non-commercial operations.|$|R
