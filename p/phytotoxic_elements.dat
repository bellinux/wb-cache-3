In a study encompassing five growing seasons conducted on a semiarid, montane surface mine site on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, seedling survival, dimensions, and volume measurements were coupled with foliar and soil analyses for macronutrients, micronutrients, and potentially <b>phytotoxic</b> metallic <b>elements.</b> Administered by broadcasting at four rates each, the formulations consisted of an organic amendment derived from municipal biosolids; a controlled release fertilizer containing urea, ammoniacal, and nitrate N sources; and two conventional fertilizers with one featuring urea as the predominant N form while the other delivered ammoniacal and nitrate forms. None of the formulations induced seedling mortality regardless of application rate, but the controlled release fertilizer and the conventional urea-based formulation were the most stimulatory overall, with intermediate rates of both proving most advantageous among those tested. Foliar analysis revealed that enhanced N and P nutrition, which was otherwise severely impacted by soil infertility, possibly along with that of K, probably accounted {{for most of the}} growth stimulation by the amendments, but an accessory role may have been attributable to reduced concentrations of potentially <b>phytotoxic</b> metallic <b>elements,</b> principally Mn but possibly including Fe, Cu, and Al, for which soil levels were all exceedingly elevated. With careful selection of formulation and application rate, post-planting broadcast fertilization can enhance growth and nutrition of Jeffrey pine on degraded substrates.

[br/] Soils derived from ultramafic regoliths are generally nutrient-deficient, have major cation imbalances, and have concomitant high concentrations of potentially <b>phytotoxic</b> trace <b>elements,</b> especially nickel. The South and Southeast Asian region has the largest surface occurrences of ultramafic regoliths in the world, but the geoecology of these outcrops is still poorly studied despite severe conservation threats. Due to the paucity of systematic plant collections in many areas and the lack of georeferenced herbarium records and databased information, {{it is not possible to}} determine the distribution of species, levels of endemism, and the species most threatened. [br/] However, site-specific studies provide insights to the ultramafic geoecology of several locations in South and Southeast Asia. The geoecology of tropical ultramafic regions differs substantially from those in temperate regions in that the vegetation at lower elevations is generally tall forest with relatively low levels of endemism. On ultramafic mountaintops, where the combined forces of edaphic and climatic factors intersect, obligate ultramafic species and hyperendemics often occur. Forest clearing, agricultural development, mining, and climate change-related stressors have contributed to rapid and unprecedented loss of ultramafic-associated habitats in the region.

40|$|Coarse, acidic {{and metal}} {{polluted}} substrata generated by extensive metal mining in the Riotinto area (Huelva province, SW Spain) are model habitats for biogeochemical studies and for designing plant-assisted remediation technologies. Major and trace element concentrations were determined in different plant parts from the few spontaneous species growing in areas differently impacted by abandoned mine waste: Erica andevalensis, Erica australis, Nerium oleander, Halimium ocymoides and Cistus ladanifer, {{in order to}} evaluate their potential for soil reclamation. E. andevalensis, which is an endemic species to the Iberian Pyrite Belt, forms monospecific patches in the most polluted sites and showed an asymptomatic scarcity of essential macroelements (Ca, Mg and P) in leaves. The two heathers accumulate very high concentrations of As, Cu, Fe, Pb, S and Zn in the root bark, but in their aerial parts only As and Pb (among potentially <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements)</b> are accumulated at higher levels than those reported for Erica species growing in unpolluted areas. Stems and leaves from N. oleander, H. ocymoides and C. ladanifer had remarkably higher Cd and Zn concentrations than those measured in E. andevalensis and E. australis. Although comparisons among plant species showed different element accumulation patterns, in general, all species have a common adaptative strategy: the selective uptake of essential elements and the exclusion of potentially <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements.</b> However, as the shrub E. andevalensis tolerates the most extreme edaphic conditions and its breeding and growing are compatible with local climatic conditions, it seems the most suitable species for the phytostabilization of abandoned waste in the Riotinto mining district...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} ecophysiological traits and the {{phytoremediation}} {{potential of the}} endemic heather Erica andevalensis, we determined the concentrations of major and trace elements in different plant parts and in rizosphere soils from Riotinto mining district (Huelva, Spain). The results showed that E. andevalensis may grow on substrates with very high As, Cu, Fe and Pb concentrations (up to 4114, 1050, 71900 and 15614 μg/g dry weight, respectively), very low availability of macro- and micronutrients and with pH values ranging from 3. 3 to 4. 9. In these harsh edaphic conditions E. andevalensis selectively absorbed and translocated essential nutrients and excludes potentially <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements,</b> which were accumulated in the root epidermis. The concentrations of major and trace elements in E. andevalensis aerial parts from the Riotinto mining district were in the normal range for plants; likewise other Erica species it accumulated Mn and only in a very polluted site we measured leaf concentrations of As and Pb within the excessive or toxic limits for plants. Differently from previous studies, which emphasized the soil pH and bioavailability of <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements</b> as the main stress factors, {{this study showed that}} in the Riotinto region, E. andevalensis can tolerate wide range of pH and toxic element concentrations; the harshest environments colonized by monospecific patches of this species were characterized above all by very low availability of nutrients.

40|$|This study {{applied the}} risk {{assessment}} methodology developed by USEPA for establishing regulatory contaminant limits and loading rates for municipal biosolids to MSW compost. Literature data on trace element and organics composition of MSW compost were evaluated relative to {{levels of the}} same compounds in biosolids. In addition, data from several laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies with MSW compost {{were used to determine}} parameter values for MSW compost for the 503 risk assessment algorithms. Assumptions about MSW compost production and use patterns were used to evaluate impacts on other algorithm parameters. Organics and trace elements in MSW compost were low in most cases, and only Pb exceeded the 503 exceptional quality (EQ) concentration limit. Trace organics concentrations in MSW compost are low compared to those in biosolids with the exception of phthalate esters. Degradation, leaching and plant uptake studies with selected organics added to MSW prior to composting showed that these materials degrade during composting and in soil, do not leach, and are taken up by crops at low but measurable levels. Concentrations of organics in MSW compost are low compared to the risk levels, and thus regulation is not warranted based on risk. Trace element bioavailability was similar or lower in MSW compost as in biosolids. Considering this and the likelihood that MSW compost will not be used extensively in general agriculture (primarily used by home gardeners or for specialty crops, and for horticultural applications), and that the supply of MSW compost will be no greater than that of biosolids, it appears that safe, risk-based trace element concentrations for MSW compost may be as high or higher than those for biosolids. Given that the actual concentrations of trace elements in MSW composts are no higher than those in biosolids (with the possible exception of Pb), regulatory limits on trace elements in MSW compost should not affect land application of these materials. A concentration standard for B, a <b>phytotoxic</b> trace <b>element</b> often found in much higher concentrations in MSW compost than in biosolids is recommended...|$|R
30|$|Ultramafic soils {{represent}} {{a category of}} substrates derived from ultramafic bedrock and are sparsely distributed around the world (Brooks 1987). These soils are known for relatively high concentrations of potentially <b>phytotoxic</b> trace <b>elements,</b> mainly nickel (Ni), as well as major cation imbalance and nutrient-deficiencies (Proctor 2003). The ultramafic soils of the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo Island are extensive, occupying an area of about 3500  km 2 (Proctor et al. 1988) and are renowned for their high species richness with at least 2500 different plant species known to date (Van der Ent et al. 2015 a). Some plants restricted to ultramafic soils have evolved ecophysiological mechanisms to tolerate and accumulate Ni, and are termed Ni hyperaccumulators when having in excess of 1000  ug g− 1 Ni in their leaves (Jaffré et al. 1976; Reeves 1992, 2003; Van der Ent et al. 2013 a). This phenomenon is rare and known in approximately 450 species worldwide in many different plant families (Reeves 2003; Van der Ent et al. 2013 a). Nickel hyperaccumulators can be categorized into ‘obligate’ and ‘facultative’ hyperaccumulators (Pollard et al. 2014). Obligate hyperaccumulators are exclusively found on ultramafic soil and all populations of the particular species are hyperaccumulators. However, species that are ‘facultative’ hyperaccumulators have populations on ultramafic soils that are Ni hyperaccumulators, and populations on other soils that are not (Van der Ent et al. 2013 a; Pollard et al. 2014). Hyperaccumulation is hypothesized to have evolved to interfere with other competing plant species (‘elemental allelopathy’) or to protect against insect herbivores (‘elemental herbivory defense’), although {{a variety of other}} explanations have also been proposed (Boyd and Martens 1998; Boyd and Jaffré 2001; Boyd 2012). Recent research activities have revealed the existence of at least 25 different Ni hyperaccumulator species in Sabah, making it a global hotspot for such plants (Van der Ent et al. 2013 c, 2015 b, c). The majority of Ni hyperaccumulating species in Sabah appear to be restricted to a single site or a few ultramafic outcrops and are hence rare and possibly threatened (Van der Ent et al. 2015 b).|$|R
30|$|The foliar {{analyses}} {{show that}} Pittosporum spp. are effective at excluding potentially <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements</b> (Ni, Mn, Mg) from the shoot {{and at the}} same time are efficient in sequestering essential elements (Ca, K, Na, P). Foliar accumulation of most elements is rather similar between the Pittosporum spp. despite the fact they grew in different habitats and on different soils. The leaf samples from P. ferrugineum, P. longisepalum and P. resiniferum originate from non-ultramafic soils, and these soils generally have higher concentrations of Ca, K and P compared to ultramafic soils. Nevertheless, the concentrations of foliar elements are either similar or erratic compared to Pittosporum spp. from ultramafic soils, and this points towards ‘Excluder-type’ ecophysiology (sensu Baker 1981) of this genus on a wide range of soil types.|$|E

The advantages for using Mars regolith include the likely bioavailability of plant-essential ions, mechanical support for plants, and easy access of the material once on the surface. We propose that plant biology experiments must be included in near-term Mars lander missions in order to begin defining the optimum approach for growing plants on Mars. Second, we discuss a range of soil chemistry and soil physics tests that must be conducted prior to, or in concert with, a plant biology experiment in order to properly interpret the results of plant growth studies in Mars regolith.

The aims {{of the study were}} i) to identify the best reliable plant-based water status indicator for field grown grapefruit trees irrigated with saline reclaimed water during five years of cultivation by measuring seasonal changes in physiological parameters (i. e. gas exchange and stem water potential measurements), leaf structural traits (i. e. leaf chlorophyll content, area-based leaf nitrogen and area-based dry mass), <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements</b> and yield; ii) to estimate phytotoxicity thresholds at leaf level. Our results showed that the chlorophyll content was the parameter with the highest number of measures with significant differences (p ≤ 0. 05, ANOVA) between trees irrigated with reclaimed water and control trees throughout growing stages. Moreover, Chl a increased linearly with area-based leaf nitrogen (R 2 = 0. 63; p < 0. 001) and area-based dry mass (R 2 = 0. 64; p < 0. 001). We also determined the salt-induced phytotoxicity thresholds at which a reduction in yields occurs; these levels were Na: 0. 1 g/ 100 g, Cl: 0. 6 g/ 100 gand B: 100 ppm. In conclusion, we revealed the importance of leaf chlorophyll measurements as a significance diagnostic indicator of salt stress on field grown grapefruit trees. This parameter was also related to plant-based water status indicators such as stem water potential, stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of global warming, rainfall {{is expected to increase}} in several regions around the world. This, together with poor soil drainage, will result in waterlogged soil conditions. Brachiaria grasses are widely sown in the tropics and, these grasses confront seasonal waterlogged conditions. Several studies have indicated that an increase in nutrient availability could reduce the negative impact of waterlogging. Therefore, an outdoor study was conducted to evaluate the responses of two Brachiaria sp. grasses with contrasting tolerances to waterlogging, B. ruziziensis (sensitive) and B. humidicola (tolerant), with two soil fertility levels. The genotypes were grown with two different soil fertilization levels (high and low) and under well-drained or waterlogged soil conditions for 15 days. The biomass production, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, and macro- (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) and micronutrient (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and B) contents in the shoot tissue were determined. Significant differences in the nutrient content of the genotypes and treatments were found. An increase of redoximorphic elements (Fe and Mn) in the soil solution occurred with the waterlogging. The greater tolerance of B. humidicola to waterlogged conditions might be due to an efficient root system that is able to acquire nutrients (N, P, K) and potentially exclude <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements</b> (Fe and Mn) under waterlogged conditions.   A high nutrient availability in the waterlogged soils did not result in an improved tolerance for B. ruziziensis. The greater growth impairment seen in the B. ruziziensis with high soil fertility and waterlogging (as opposed to low soil fertility and waterlogging) was possibly due to an increased concentration of redoximorphic elements under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|In some {{irrigated}} regions, {{the disposal}} of agricultural drainage waters poses significant environmental challenges. Efforts are underway to develop irrigation water management practices that reduce the volume of drainage generated. One such management strategy involves restricting flow in subsurface drains {{in an effort to}} raise the water table and induce the consumption of groundwater by crops. A potential complication with this management approach is that upward groundwater flow may salinize the soil and increase concentrations of <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements</b> such as B. In this study, salinity and B concentrations were monitored for 3 yr in a 60 -ha agricultural field located in San Joaquin Valley, California. The irrigated field was managed according to a restricted drainage, shallow groundwater management technique. Salinity and B measurements were made biannually at approximately 75 sites within the field. Soil salinity and B concentrations were found to be highly correlated in the field. The observed spatial and temporal variability in B and salinity was largely a product of soil textural variations within the field and the associated variations in salt leaching. During the 3 -yr study, the field changed very little from one year to the next, although within a given year there were fluctuations related to cropping and irrigation practices and to environmental conditions. However, any changes arising during the growing season were erased in the fallow season by winter rainfall and preplant irrigations that uniformly leached salts from approximately the top 1 m of the field. Overall, it appears that the shallow groundwater management program used in this study could be continued and sustained in this field without increasing soil salinity or B concentrations, and without decreases in yield...|$|E

This work investigates whether and how silicon (Si) ameliorates Cd toxicity in Alfalfa. The addition of Si in Cd-stressed plants caused significant improvement in morpho-physiological features as well as total protein and membrane stability, indicating that Si does have critical roles in Cd detoxification in Alfalfa. Furthermore, Si supplementation in Cd-stressed plants showed a significant decrease in Cd and Fe concentrations in both roots and shoots compared with Cd-stressed plants, revealing that Si-mediated tolerance to Cd stress is associated with Cd inhibition in Alfalfa. Results also showed no significant changes in the expression of two metal chelators [MsPCS 1 (phytochelatin synthase) and MsMT 2 (metallothionein) ] and PC (phytochelatin) accumulation, indicating that there may be no metal sequestration or change in metal sequestration following Si application under Cd stress in Alfalfa. We further performed a targeted study on the effect of Si on Fe uptake mechanisms. We observed the consistent reduction in Fe reductase activity, expression of Fe-related genes [MsIRT 1 (Fe transporter), MsNramp 1 (metal transporter) and OsFRO 1 (ferric chelate reductase] and Fe chelators (citrate and malate) by Si application to Cd stress in roots of Alfalfa. These results support that limiting Fe uptake through the down-regulation of Fe acquisition mechanisms confers Si-mediated alleviation of Cd toxicity in Alfalfa. Finally, an increase of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities along with elevated methionine and proline subjected to Si application might play roles, at least in part, to reduce H 2 O 2 and to provide antioxidant defense against Cd stress in Alfalfa. The study shows evidence of the effect of Si on alleviating Cd toxicity in Alfalfa and can be further extended for phytoremediation of Cd toxicity in plants...|$|E
30|$|Germination index which {{combines}} {{the measure of}} seed germination and root growth of seeds {{is one of the}} most sensitive biological parameter used to evaluate toxicity and the degree of maturity and stability of vermicompost (Zucconi et al. 1981; Wong et al., 2001; Campitelli and Ceppi 2008). GI value of more than 70 % indicates the good compost/vermicompost maturity (Raj and Antil 2011) whereas a GI below 50 % indicates an immature compost/vermicompost (Zucconi et al. 1981). Various researchers have attempted to determine the vermicompost maturity, and the results have revealed that the vermicompost enhanced seed germination (Edwards and Burrows 1988; Bachman and Metzger 2008). Majlessi et al. (2012) used GI as indicator of the stability and maturity of vermicompost produced from food waste. The GI value was 12.8 % in the initial mixture food waste and reached a value of 58.4 % at the end of the vermicomposting. The increase in GI can be due to the progress of decomposition of organic substrates and reduction of <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements</b> resulting from vermicomposting process. Kumar et al. (2013) studied the effect of vermicompost maturity on the GI of Vigna mungo seeds. The results reveal that the vermicompost samples yielded high germination rate (80 %) as compared to the control (50 %). GI has been widely used for the evaluation of maturity and stability of compost/vermicompost extracts (Warman 1999; Paradelo et al. 2010), because it measures the combined effect of the physical, chemical and biochemical properties. Villar et al. (2016) observed higher GI (97.9 %) of vermicompost than that of control. Earthworms were effective for reducing phytotoxic substances, suggesting a suitable level of maturation of final vermicompost produced from municipal sewage sludge. The results suggested that the GI showed that earthworms improved the sludge properties, reaching optimal values of maturation and stabilization. Unuofin et al. (2016) observed over 80 % GI for all test crops (tomato, carrot and radish). The results indicated that addition of phosphorus as rock phosphate to cow dung-waste paper mixtures in the presence of earthworms resulted in matured vermicompost and free of phytotoxins.|$|E

The extreme edaphic specialisation of these species reflects with unusual fidelity the heterogeneity of substrata, therefore creating a system of plant communities that largely contributes to the environmental diversity {{of this part of}} the island. The phytosociological study presented in this paper recognized eight associations, distinguished by the cluster analysis in two main groups, the first including hemicrypto-chamaephytic vegetation, the second including nanophanerophytic garigues. Six associations are belonging to the first group, five of which newly described: Helichryso tyrrhenici-Dianthetum sardoi ass. nov., occurring on gross-grained, hard-sloping dumps deriving from the geologic unit of Gonnesa; Coincyo recurvatae-Helichrysetum tyrrhenici ass. nov., colonizing dumps made of metamorphitic flakes and finer particles; Resedo luteolae-Limonietum merxmuelleri ass. nov., colonizing small-grained mining dumps with high concentrations in sulphides and heavy metals; Ptilostemono casabonae-Iberidetum integerrimae ass. nov., replacing the previous one on older and more consolidated dumps, where the concentration of <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements</b> was reduced by the meteoric agents; Epipactidetum tremolsii ass. nov., colonizing muddy deposits originating from ferrous clay; Euphorbio cupanii-Santolinetum insularis Angiolini & Bacchetta 2003, occurring on very old, stabilized dumps. All these associations can be ascribed to the class Scrophulario-Helichrysetea Brullo, Scelsi & Spampinato, 1998. Within this class, a new Sardo-Corsican alliance, Ptilostemono casabonae-Euphorbion cupanii is here proposed, differentiated by a pool of rare or endemic species. In addition to the above- mentioned associations, it is proposed, as well, to include into the new alliance the Polygono scoparii-Helichrysetum tyrrhenici Biondi, Vagge, Fogu & Mossa 1996 corr., that was described for the gravelly riverbeds of Central-Southern Sardinia. As concerns the second group, two new association have been recognized: Dorycnio suffruticosi-Genistetum corsicae ass. nov., found on abandoned, well consolidated mining dumps, with an upper layer altered by pedogenetic processes; Polygalo sardoae-Linetum muelleri ass. nov., occurring in the vicinities of the mines on steep rocky slopes made of Paleozoic metalliferous limestones. Both of them can be ascribed to the alliance Teucrion mari Gamisans & Muracciole 1985, grouping the Sardo-Corsican aspects of Cisto-Lavanduletea Br. -Bl. in Br. -Bl., Molinier & Wagner 1940...|$|E
40|$|Gold mining in South Africa {{resulted}} in vast volumes of waste material, {{mainly in the}} form of tailings material. Poor management of most of the tailings dams {{resulted in}} the release of acid mine drainage that in some cases caused soil degradation and water contamination underneath and around these sites. Although many tailings dams have been partially or completely reclaimed, their contaminated footprints pose a serious threat to the water quality of the underlying aquifers (e. g. dolomitic aquifers). This study investigated the geotechnical, mineralogical and geochemical parameters of eleven selected partially or completely reclaimed sites situated near Johannesburg. The main objective of the field and laboratory experiments was to assess the pathway of contaminant migration resulting from acid mine drainage from tailings materials through the unsaturated zone into the groundwater system. Comparing extractable contaminant concentrations with a soil standard from literature represents the environmental short-term impact. In contrast, total element concentrations in the soil compared with background values were used to describe the long-term impact or worst-case scenario. Extraction tests have shown that only a minor portion of contaminants (i. e. Co, Ni and Zn) is mobile in acidic soils. This implies that plant growth could be limited because of <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements</b> occurring in the topsoils, complicating rehabilitation measures. In addition, the soils often contain anomalous trace element concentrations, providing a pool for future contamination. Buffer minerals will eventually be depleted and the subsequent acidification of the subsoil, could result in the remobilization of contaminants from the subsoil into the groundwater system in the long term. It is important to understand the parameters, which control the balance between retention and mobility of contaminants in soils. Therefore a risk assessment approach would be required for all tailings dams and reclaimed sites to identify those sites, which need rehabilitation and to define the type and extent of remedial measures. Minimum rehabilitation requirements at reclaimed sites could consist of soil management measures such as liming and the addition of organic material and fertilisers to minimise the contaminant migration from the topsoil into the subsoil and groundwater as well as to provide suitable conditions for vegetation growth and future land use. Removal of remaining tailings and excavation of those portions of the soil, which are excessively contaminated, are necessary. Tailings dams which pose a high risk to the environment would require a well-engineered soil and vegetation cover to limit rainfall infiltration into the impoundment, and thus to reduce the oxidation of sulphide-bearing minerals such as pyrite. Long-term monitoring is an absolute prerequisite to ensure the success of rehabilitation, and therefore the safe use of land and water. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the revegetation potential of abandoned base-metal (Cu-Pb-Zn) tailings at the Tui mine site near Te Aroha, New Zealand. An estimated 100, 000 m 3 of sulphide-rich tailings are the legacy of a once prosperous mining venture conducted at the site between 1967 and 1974 by the now defunct Norpac Mining Ltd. The oxidation of remnant sulphides, which constitute as much as 15 % of the tailings by weight, has prevented plants from colonising the tailings for more than 20 years and resulted in the formation of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) which continues to degrade ground and stream waters in the vicinity of the dam. This study focused on characterising the physical and chemical properties of the tailings in terms of their plant growth potential using a variety of techniques including; Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS), Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as field based observations and standard laboratory analyses. A long term incubation experiment (carried out over a 1 1 / 2 year period) and two plant growth trials were also conducted to investigate the ability of liming materials and/or organic waste to ameliorate the tailings in order to provide a suitable growing medium for plants. The research indicated that, whilst the tailings do not exhibit any major physical limitations to plant growth, chemically the tailings are an extremely hostile plant growth medium. The surface tailings exhibited variable but generally very low pH (2. 76 - 3. 85) and high concentrations of potentially <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>elements</b> including As (254 mg/kg), Cu (26 - 991 mg/kg), Pb (1503 - 27416 mg/kg) and Zn (123 - 2333 mg/kg). The high availability of these and other metals, including Al and Fe. under the acidic conditions prevailing in the tailings, were identified as the primary factors currently inhibiting plant growth. The distribution of heavy metals, sulphate and total sulphur with depth indicated that the surface tailings (0 - 200 mm) have been extensively weathered since their deposition and contain relatively low concentrations of most heavy metals compared to subsurface tailings. An assessment of the Acid Generating Potential (AGP) of the tailings, using both static and kinetic tests, similarly indicated that the surface tailings have a comparatively low ability to generate acidity by sulphide oxidation. The application of lime at a rate of about 50 Mg CaCO 3 /ha is calculated to theoretically prevent the surface tailings from reacidifying. Below 200 mm depth, however, the AGP is appreciably higher (> 140 Mg CaCO 3 /ha) and concentrations of both total and labile (0. 1 M HCl extractable) Cu, Fe and Zn were found to increase substantially, reflecting an increase in the abundance of chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), pyrite (FeS 2) and sphalerite (ZnS) and sulphates with depth. The presence of high concentrations of acid-generating sulphide minerals (primarily pyrite) at shallow depths has important implications in that revegetation of the tailings should be based on techniques that minimise the exposure of the largely unweathered, sulphide-rich, subsurface tailings. The results obtained from the plant growth trials indicated that, on tailings treatments sown with metal-tolerant varieties of Festuca rubra or Agrostis capillaris, satisfactory cover was achieved upon the addition of lime at a rate of 16. 5 Mg/ha or composted sewage sludge at rates > 220 Mg/ha. These metal-tolerant plants were found to out yield their non-metal-tolerant counterparts on the limed treatments by as much as 4 and 10 times, respectively. Although vegetation was successfully established on Tui tailings treated with lime, dry matter yields were relatively low compared to treatments receiving high rates of sludge. The growth of all plant taxa was found to significantly decrease where very high rates of lime (112 Mg/ha) were added due to pH-induced nutrient deficiencies. Results obtained from both the plant growth trials and the lime incubation experiment indicated that the application of low rates of lime and/or sludge (8. 25 and 110 Mg/ha respectively) were ineffective at creating a suitable plant growth medium and, in fact, exacerbated growing conditions within a few weeks of application by increasing the availability of labile (0. 1 M HCl extractable) metals. The findings of this study indicated that the use of amendments may provide a relatively inexpensive way of facilitating the establishment of plants on the tailings at the Tui mine site. It is envisaged that, at the very least, a vegetative cover will improve the aesthetic appearance of the site and at best reduce AMD by creating an oxygen-depleting, organic-rich cover which may ultimately facilitate the establishment of native species from the adjacent forest...|$|E
