50|$|The Galápagos giant {{tortoise}} is now strictly {{protected and}} is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The listing requires that {{trade in the}} taxon and its products is subject to strict regulation by ratifying states, and international trade for <b>primarily</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>purposes</b> is prohibited. In 1936, the Ecuadorian government listed the giant tortoise as a protected species. In 1959, it declared all uninhabited areas in the Galápagos {{to be a national}} park and established the Charles Darwin Foundation. In 1970, capturing or removing many species from the islands (including tortoises and their eggs) was banned. To halt trade in the tortoises altogether, it became illegal to export the tortoises from Ecuador, captive or wild, continental, or insular in provenance. The banning of their exportation resulted in automatic prohibition of importation to the United States under Public Law 91-135 (1969). A 1971 Ecuadorian decree made it illegal to damage, remove, alter, or disturb any organism, rock, or other natural object in the National Park.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{pangolin}} {{is greatly}} sought after for its various body parts, largely driven by demand from China. The mammal {{has been driven}} {{to the edge of}} extinction in Asia, with two Asian species listed as Critically Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. With declining Asian pangolin populations, a shift in trade from Asian to African pangolin species has been suggested. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Trade Database provides a unique opportunity to investigate global trends in pangolin trade at the species level, across a broad temporal scale (1977 – 2014). We found that CITES trade in Asian pangolin species decreased through time, whilst trade in African species increased post 2000. The total number of incidents involving Asian species declined since 2000, yet they were still being traded in large volumes (more than 17, 500 estimated whole Asian pangolins were traded from 2001 to 2014) despite a zero export quota for all wild sourced Asian species, traded for <b>primarily</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>purposes.</b> In 2014 all eight pangolin species were recorded in the CITES trade for the first time. An increasingly complex international network was identified through time, with the United States of America (US) being the dominant player in the global pangolin trade that was reported to CITES. The US was the most frequent trade country throughout the entire period and was the greatest importer of pangolins, and their products; measured both in volume as well as frequency. We hope that identifying these global trade network characteristics, and pangolin trade dynamics will help to inform pangolin conservation efforts, and guide enforcement and legislative changes in the future...|$|E

5000|$|Capital {{existed in}} the form of trading capital already {{thousands}} of years before capitalist factories emerged in the towns; its owners (whether rentiers, merchants or state functionaries) often functioned as intermediaries between commodity producers. They facilitated exchange, for a price - they made money from trade. Marx defines the capitalist mode of production as [...] "generalized commodity production", meaning that most goods and services are produced <b>primarily</b> for <b>commercial</b> <b>purposes,</b> for profitable market sale. This has the consequence, that both the inputs and the outputs of production become tradeable objects with prices, and that the whole of production is reorganized according to commercial principles. Whereas originally commercial trade occurred episodically at the boundaries of different communities, Marx argues, eventually commerce engulfs and reshapes the whole production process of those communities. This involves the transformation of {{a large part of the}} labour force into wage-labour (the sale of labour power as a commodity), and the capitalization of labour employed.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{expansion}} of the global wildlife trade, both within and between countries, has many potentially negative ecological impacts. Emerging economies, in particular, have a largely overlooked potential for rapid internal growth in this trade. An analysis of ~ 17 000 wildlife transportation permits - issued in South Africa <b>primarily</b> for <b>commercial</b> <b>purposes</b> by the Western Cape Province's local government - provides insights into this trend. During the past decade, a total of 912 amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species were transported to and from locations in the province; 60 % of translocated vertebrate species were non-native. Network {{analysis of the data}} indicated that the numbers of participants within local trade networks are increasing rapidly. Static and dynamic structural differences emerged between the networks for selected vertebrate Classes. Changes in density and degree were pronounced for mammal and reptile networks but were more constant for birds over the observed time period. All translocation networks exhibited "small-world", scale-free properties, which would facilitate the rapid propagation of negative influences through the system...|$|R
40|$|The {{forest policy}} of Nepal places higher {{emphasis}} on community forestry development {{rather than on}} private forestry. However, farmers of Nepal’s central Terai region have long focused on the establishment of private tree plantations, with community forestry generally not having been encouraged in this region. Private forestry can be a viable option for promoting sustainable management of the national forest in the Terai because pressures on the national forest are reduced when farmers get their basic needs (i. e. fuelwood and fodder) from their own private plantations which are grown <b>primarily</b> for <b>commercial</b> <b>purposes.</b> The main <b>commercial</b> species in central Terai are Dalbergia sissoo, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Gmelina arborea, Tectona grandis and Anthocephalus chinensis. Although farmers are commercially motivated, they lack {{the skills and knowledge}} to maximize income from their forests. Species’ growth rates and market values determine the income that farmers can gain from their plantation investment. However, there have been no studies to assess the growth patterns and performance of these species so that farmers can select the right species and right harvesting age for the best economic return on their investment. This study examined the growth performance of these five economically important tropical timber species in two different types of plantations: bond plantation (plantation along bonds of the cultivated field) and stand plantation. ...|$|R
