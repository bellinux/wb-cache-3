The tramp enables thousands of men to earn honest livings, educate their children, and bring them up God-fearing and industrious. I know. At one time {{my father was a}} constable and hunted tramps for a living. The community paid him so much per head for all the tramps he could catch, and also, I believe, he got mileage fees. Ways and means was always a pressing <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> household, and the amount of meat on the table, the new pair of shoes, the day's outing, or the text-book for school, were dependent upon my father's luck in the chase. Well I remember the suppressed eagerness and the suspense with which I waited to learn each morning what the results of his past night's toil had been--how many tramps he had gathered in and what the chances were for convicting them. And so it was, when later, as a tramp, I succeeded in eluding some predatory constable, I could not but feel sorry for the little boys and girls at home in that constable's house; it seemed to me in a way that I was defrauding those little boys and girls of some of the good things of life.|$|E

Marcella Jelić of tportal.hr gave Parada a negative review, feeling Dragojević made [...] "a series of morally deeply problematic decisions in the film, the most obvious of which is presenting hardened criminals, chauvinists, war profiteers, and thugs as sympathetic and charming characters". She concludes by exclaiming: [...] "Still, Id be willing to forgive all of its shortcomings had Parada been truly funny, but it isnt except in a few rare moments. As it is, its only saving grace is that its noble aim justifies its means. Its just too bad its means are so boring". Robert Jukić of film-mag.net also didnt like the film, seeing it as [...] "a fairly uneven product that balances between comedy and drama in which Dragojević sinks his teeth into some hot topics such as corruption and war profiteering, but {{the end result is}} pale and aloof".
