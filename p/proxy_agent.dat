5000|$|Milgrom {{has also}} contributed to the {{understanding}} of combinatorial auctions. In work with Larry Ausubel (Ausubel and Milgrom, 2002), auctions of multiple items, which may be substitutes or complements, are considered. They define a mechanism, the “ascending proxy auction,” constructed as follows. Each bidder reports his values to a <b>proxy</b> <b>agent</b> for all packages that the bidder is interested in. Budget constraints can also be reported. The <b>proxy</b> <b>agent</b> then bids in an ascending auction with package bidding on behalf of the real bidder, iteratively submitting the allowable bid that, if accepted, would maximize the real bidder’s profit (value minus price), based on the reported values. The auction is conducted with negligibly small bid increments. After each round, provisionally winning bids are determined that maximize the total revenue from feasible combinations of bids. All of a bidder’s bids are kept live throughout the auction and are treated as mutually exclusive. The auction ends after a round occurs with no new bids. The ascending proxy auction may be viewed either as a compact representation of a dynamic combinatorial auction or as a practical direct mechanism, the first example of what Milgrom would later call a “core selecting auction.” ...|$|E

We derive information-theoretic elicitation policies for <b>proxy</b> <b>agents</b> under a simple model of costly elicitation across different auction designs. An experimental analysis demonstrates that indirect mechanisms, such as ascending-price auctions, can achieve better allocative efficiency with less preference elicitation than sealed-bid (direct) auctions because they promote better decisions about preference elicitation...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to explore the feasibility of building management information gateways that relay management information at regular intervals between the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP). This management information is stored in an object-oriented Management Information Base (MIB) that can be accessed by Common Management Information Service (CMIS) management applications. An approach for polling based on a variable polling frequency is proposed. A stateful model for a simple version CMIP <b>proxy</b> <b>agent</b> for SNMP which requires management information collected from SNMP agents to be stored in the proxy agent's MIB is also proposed. The <b>proxy</b> <b>agent</b> is implemented using the so-called OSIMIS- 3. 0 software package which implements CMIP, and an existing SNMP application. A policy of variable polling frequency which is based on the cost of polling, the cost of loss of relevant management information and the frequency of update of new information is used by the <b>proxy</b> <b>agent.</b> The agent is tested on a distributed network consisting of a LAN at McGill University and another LAN at the University of Montreal. The results from the test show that using the above model of a <b>proxy</b> <b>agent</b> between CMIP and SNMP yields a better response time as compared to the stateless <b>proxy</b> <b>agent</b> model used by the Network Management Forum (NMF 93), as well as an up-to-date information about the network to a CMIS manager during critical situations...|$|E

Consequently, a signature {{created by the}} proxy signer is distinguishable from that created by the principal signer. This level of security is a common requirement in many applications to prevent malicious <b>proxy</b> <b>agents</b> from impersonating the principal signer. Moreover, the scheme is based on bilinear pairings over elliptic curves and thus smaller key sizes are required compared to schemes not utilizing elliptic curves.

40|$|As {{the cost}} of both {{networking}} and producing powerful embedded devices drops, collections of these highly specialized and heterogeneous platforms will proliferate. These networks will face security threats and suffer traditional hardware failure. Failure of embedded devices is undesirable because these devices often perform critical functions and are difficult to take offline and upgrade. Networks of embedded devices require a method to accomplish functional survivability of essential computations in a hostile or volatile environment. This paper presents a protocol and describes an implementation for migrating essential computations from failed devices. An essential computation is a device's primary algorithmic functionality. This migration is accomplished by specifying both an Area Controller (AC), which contains definitions for every essential computation, {{and a number of}} <b>proxy</b> <b>agents,</b> which periodically send the AC update statements. The AC and <b>proxy</b> <b>agents</b> negotiate the specifics of process migration when the AC has determined that a device has failed. The implementation of this protocol in a network of embedded devices is a crucial step toward fault tolerance and survivability in networks of embedded devices. The protocol can also be applied to networks that do not involve embedded systems...|$|R
