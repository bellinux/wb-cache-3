50|$|After firing, the {{substrate}} resistors are trimmed {{to the correct}} value. This process is named Laser trimming. Many chip resistors are made using thick film technology. Large substrates are printed with resistors fired, divided into small chips and these are then terminated, {{so they can be}} soldered on the <b>PCB</b> <b>board.</b> With laser trimming two modes are used; either passive trimming, where each resistor is trimmed to a specific value and tolerance, or active trimming, where the feedback is used to adjust to a specific voltage, frequency or response by laser trimming the resistors on the circuit while powered up.|$|E
5000|$|Butt {{continued}} {{to meet with}} the <b>PCB</b> <b>board</b> to regain the World Cup, to no avail, despite a legal battle which lasted until August. Eventually an out of court settlement of 18 million US dollars was agreed upon; Butt calling it [...] "the best possible solution." [...] Concurrently, the PCB under Butt dissolved the national selection panel and removed Saleem Altaf from his position as chief operating officer. The summer tour of Sri Lanka was also marred by match-fixing allegations over which the PCB sought legal advice. The ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit eventually cleared the Pakistan players of having had any contact with bookmakers.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} MagicBand {{design was}} created by Frog Design. The original design consisted of an outer plastic grey bracelet, which can be removed to adjust for a smaller sized wrist, and an inner plastic bracelet. The inner plastic bracelet is one of eight base colors, which can then {{have a series of}} different designs printed on them for an extra fee. Sealed inside of the middle of the inner band is the circuitry, consisting of high frequency and ultra-high frequency antennas and a coin cell battery, all embedded on a <b>PCB</b> <b>board.</b> Directly outside of the circuitry is an outline of Mickey Mouse's head on the front, while the back includes the Band ID, the FCC ID number, and other information.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the first}} Big Muff {{production}} date was {{for many years}} cited as 1971, {{the first version of}} the Big Muff was actually sold in 1969 as a hand-made [...] "perf board" [...] version. A production version with an etched <b>PCB</b> <b>board</b> was made in early 1970. Mike Matthews was friends with Jimi Hendrix and claims Jimi bought one from Manny's Music in New York, shortly after they were released and had one in the Electric Lady Studios shortly before Jimi's death in 1970. Several variations of the Big Muff Pi followed throughout the 1970s. [...] Electro-Harmonix produced a reissue assembled in New York City; until 2009 it produced a version made by Sovtek in Russia which provided a slightly different tone. The Bass Big Muff replaced the Russian version.|$|E
50|$|The arcade and console {{versions}} of Tekken Tag Tournament differ slightly. The arcade version ran on a 32-bit engine, utilizing the graphics engine of Tekken 3. These graphics ran using the Tekken 3 <b>PCB</b> <b>board,</b> {{based on the}} PlayStation hardware. The console version ran on a highly updated engine, utilizing the PlayStation 2's graphics processor. The game does not run on a 32-bit engine, yet on a new and updated engine highly similar to that found on Tekken 4. The background designs and BGMs differed too, as the console version has new updated tracks, while the arcade version was based on MIDI tracks with an instrumental backing. Unknown is not playable on the arcade version, yet the character is on the PlayStation 2 version. The arcade version also allows players to only select the alternative colors that {{have been added to}} the costumes at first, while the normally colored ones are unlocked when the bonus characters are. There are also crucial differences concerning the playability of the characters, as some moves or attacks are much more efficient in the arcade version than in the console version and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|The parts we do use though are the worldâs {{best and}} again, like our drivers, defy our retail price and are {{considered}} by the industry to be too expensive for speakers in Totems price range. Even our sub $2000 speakers employ air core coils with 99.999% pure and oxygen free copper, Clarity Cap MR, or Mundorf Gold/Silver oil capacitors. When we show our dealers that these parts are available on eBay for $250 each theyâre shocked and truly appreciate the unbelievable value we pack into our speakers. Bruzzese is quite proud of the elegance of his crossover designs and particularly the avoidance of resistors and his use of only premium components. For 99% of the worldâs speaker manufacturers, a crossover network entails a <b>PCB</b> <b>board</b> (Printed Circuit Board) which uses a ferrite core, and added resistors and capacitors. PCBâs however are often exposed to environmental contaminations in their manufacturing process which changes their electrical properties rendering them subject to phase irregularities. Anything that can compromise phase is not acceptable. Our components are secured to a thin piece of fiberboard and then connected directly to each other rather than to copper traces.|$|E
