According to Uniform Crime Report statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2011, there were 19 violent crimes and 166 <b>property</b> <b>crimes.</b> The violent crimes consisted of one forcible rape, three robberies and 15 aggravated assaults, while 32 burglaries, 104 larceny-thefts, eight motor vehicle thefts and one arson defined the <b>property</b> <b>crimes.</b> The FBI classifies Omak as having 4,921 people located within the Omak Police Department area. The city's highest crime rate was recorded in 2004, with 413 incidents per 100,000 people. Until 2013, when a murder and motor-vehicle theft occurred in the city, there had not been a homicide for over ten consecutive years. The crime in Omak has decreased throughout the past decade. Before marijuana was legalized in Washington, marijuana users were arrested, per state law. Growers, drug lords and international smugglers residing in the Omak area are still arrested.|$|E
