25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, static friction does no work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do <b>positive</b> <b>work</b> in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box {{in the same direction}} that the box moves, doing <b>positive</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|CSR {{is known}} for {{impacting}} employee turnover. Several executives suggest that employees are their most valuable asset and {{that the ability to}} retain them leads to organization success. Socially responsible activities promote fairness, which in turn generate lower employee turnover. On the other hand, if an irresponsible behavior is demonstrated by a firm, employees may view this behavior as negative. Proponents argue that treating employees well with competitive pay and good benefits is seen as a socially responsible behavior and therefore reduces employee turnover. Executives have a strong desire for building a <b>positive</b> <b>work</b> context that benefits CSR and the company as a whole. This interest is driven particularly by the realization that a <b>positive</b> <b>work</b> environment can result in desirable outcomes such as more favorable job attitudes and increased work performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we use optimal control on a geared {{electric}} DC motor {{to compare the}} energetic efficiency of a simulation of conceptual monoped hoppers with either parallel elastic actuation (PEA) or series elastic actuation (SEA). The energy is measured using three cost functions: <b>positive</b> actuator <b>work,</b> electrical losses, and <b>positive</b> electrical <b>work.</b> For PEA, {{the presence of the}} motor inertia in the collision losses leads to increased collision losses at large transmission ratios, which lead to energetically costly compensatory strategies where the SEA is at its most efficient. At small transmission ratios, the motor force increases for both cases, leading to increased thermal losses. In agreement with those theoretical predictions, our work shows that for <b>positive</b> actuator <b>work</b> and <b>positive</b> electrical <b>work</b> the optimal parameter choice for SEA is significantly more energetically efficient than the optimal choice for PEA. For electrical losses, a suitable choice of the transmission ratio can lead to negligible cost values for both actuator concepts. I...|$|R

500|$|To resolve {{questions}} about the blades, Pistorius was asked {{to take part in}} a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the German Sport University Cologne with Professor of Biomechanics Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces, and that the <b>positive</b> <b>work</b> or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed. In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to Die Welt newspaper that Pistorius [...] "has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It was more than just a few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear." [...] The study was published in 2008 in Sports Technology, but later researchers stated that the analysis [...] "did not take enough variables into consideration". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge. Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.|$|E

2500|$|Core self-evaluations (CSE) {{represent}} a stable personality trait which encompasses an individual's subconscious, fundamental evaluations about themselves, their own abilities {{and their own}} control. [...] People who have high core self-evaluations will think positively of themselves and be confident in their own abilities. [...] Conversely, people with low core self-evaluations will have a negative appraisal of themselves and will lack confidence. [...] The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997) and involves four personality dimensions: locus of control, neuroticism, generalized self-efficacy, and self-esteem. [...] The trait developed as a dispositional predictor of job satisfaction, but has expanded to predict {{a variety of other}} outcomes. [...] Core self-evaluations are particularly important because they {{represent a}} personality trait which will remain consistent over time. [...] Furthermore, the way in which people appraise themselves using core self-evaluations has the ability to predict <b>positive</b> <b>work</b> outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. [...] These relationships have inspired increasing amounts of research on core self-evaluations and suggest valuable implications about the importance this trait may have for organizations.|$|E
