If a wholesale price can be established at a node on the transmission grid and the electricity quantities at that node can be reconciled, competition for retail customers within the distribution system beyond the node is possible.

25|$|At a more {{technical}} level, various {{versions of the}} Kaldor–Hicks criteria lack desirable formal properties. For instance, Tibor Scitovsky demonstrated that the Kaldor criterion alone is not antisymmetric: it's <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> situation where an outcome A is an improvement (according to the Kaldor criterion) over outcome B, but B is also an improvement over A. The combined Kaldor–Hicks criterion does not have this problem, {{but it can be}} non-transitive (though A may be an improvement over B, and B over C, A is not thereby an improvement over C).|$|E

Although it is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 2:1 operating bandwidth when the height is less than half the width, having the height exactly half the width maximizes the power that can propagate inside the waveguide before dielectric breakdown occurs.|$|E

This raises the possibility of the Brewers eventually representing two different leagues in World Series competition. That has happened twice before, taking the 19th Century contests into account: The Brooklyn Dodgers of 1889 and 1890, and the Cardinals, who won the 1886 Series when they were in the American Association. This also makes this one of two World Series in the modern era (1903–present) that it is not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rematch, the other being the 2005 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and the Houston Astros, due to the Astros moving to the American League for 2013.|$|E

Likewise, Browning argued that it is possible to become soaked in human blood after shooting people at close range based on his research for his 1992 book Ordinary Men and dismissed Irving's argument that accounts of German personnel being soaked in blood were improbable because it is not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> blood splattered uniform after shooting people at close range.|$|E

500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do you mean to tell us that it will be <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E

500|$|In the {{developmental}} transition from God of War III to Ascension, {{one of the}} graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that {{the limits of the}} God of War III engine restricted artist creativity, so they [...] "tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance." [...] For example, the number of UV sets was increased to three per mesh. For a complex character model like Kratos, [...] "independent textures are needed for body parts unique to him, each wrapping around the head, torso and limbs - all of which form an editable 'UV set' when laid out flat." [...] Allowing more UV sets also made it <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> more natural look to the environment. Ascension was not as dramatic an advance in graphics over its predecessor as God of War III had been: [...] "From a graphics 'technical' perspective, to a large degree God of War: Ascension was more refinement on the graphics front" [...] said another graphics engineer, Ben Diamand, who focused on optimization during Ascensions development. The development team also added dynamic lighting, which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved from God of War III: [...] "the idea was to give artists more control to achieve better results with less particles" [...] said Perthuis.|$|E

They were the first major recurring characters outside of the Simpson family to appear. They are based on Tom and Jerry and other cat and mouse cartoons. As a child, series creator Matt Groening and his friends would fantasize about an ultra violent cartoon and how much fun {{it would be to}} work on a show like that. The names [...] "Itchy" [...] and [...] "Scratchy" [...] were inspired by [...] "Pixie and Dixie," [...] who were mice on the cartoon show Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks. The comic strip Squeak the Mouse is also considered as an apparent inspiration for the characters. The show is also based on Herman and Katnip, a show that, according to director David Silverman, [...] "is hilarious because it's just bad." [...] As a child, Groening really liked the 1961 Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians, {{and it was one of}} the reasons to why he got into cartooning. In the film, the puppies watch television, and the idea that it is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening.
