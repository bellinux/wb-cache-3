The concept is similar to today's conventional pulse oximetry, but was difficult to implement because of unstable photocells and light sources; the method is not now used clinically. In 1964 Shaw assembled the first absolute reading ear oximeter by using eight wavelengths of light. It was commercialized by Hewlett-Packard but its use was limited to pulmonary functions and sleep laboratories because of cost and size.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the inkjet method to pharmaceutical products is promising. To make this realistic, {{not only does the}} throughput of this method need to be increased, but also the components should be inert to pharmaceutical preparations. We present designs of glass‐based inkjet devices that are capable of producing droplets at high rates. To achieve this, inkjet devices from glass capillary tubes were manufactured with orifice diameters of 5, 10 and 20 μm and were actuated with diaphragm piezoelectric disks. Also, a <b>pressure</b> <b>capsule</b> was formed by creating a manifold at a distance from the orifice tip. Placing the piezoelectric disk at 0. 5 mm distance from the tip allowed the formation of a jet at 3. 2 MHz in certain designs, but {{for a short period of}} time because of overheating. The length of the <b>pressure</b> <b>capsule,</b> its inlet diameter, and the nozzle tip geometry were crucial to lower the required power. Actuating an inkjet device with 10 μm orifice diameter comfortably at 900 kHz and drying the droplets from 1 % salbutamol sulphate solution allowed the formation of particles with diameters of 1. 76 ± 0. 15 μm and the geometric standard deviation of 1. 08. In conclusion, optimising internal design of glass inkjet devices allowed the production of high‐throughput droplet ejectors. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 103 : 3733 – 3742, 201...|$|E
30|$|We use {{various types}} of digital {{recording}} OBS systems. Most of the OBSs have three-component velocity sensitive electro-magnetic geophones with a natural frequency of 4.5 Hz, and employ a glass sphere as a pressure vessel. The maximum recording period is approximately three months. We also use long-term OBSs, which have 1 -Hz 3 -component geophones and a titanium <b>pressure</b> <b>capsule.</b> The longest recording period is 1 year {{for this type of}} OBS (Kanazawa et al., 2009). Broadband-type OBSs (BBOBSs), which have broadband seismometers with a large dynamic range, were also deployed. An observational band for the BBOBS is 360 s– 100 Hz and the BBOBS have a precise absolute pressure gauge for the detection of long-period events and vertical crustal movement. The resolution of the A/D conversion is 24 bits. Accurate timing, estimated to be within 0.05 s, is provided by a precise crystal oscillator. All the OBSs are of a pop-up type with an acoustic release system. The OBS position at the sea floor was estimated by using acoustic ranging and ship GPS positions. The accuracy of the OBS positions at the sea floor is estimated to be a few tens of meters. We also determined the water depth of the OBSs by acoustic ranging.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Diseases in the {{gastro-intestinal}} tract are on {{an increasing}} trend. In order to diagnose a patient, various signals of the digestive organ, such as temperature, pH, and pressure, can offer the helpful information. Among the above mentioned signals, we choose the pressure variation as a monitoring signal. The variation of a pressure signal of the gastro-intestinal tract can offer the information of a digestive trouble or some clues of the diseases. In this paper, a pressure monitoring {{system for the}} digestive organs of a living pig is presented. This is why a pig’s gastro-intestinal tract is very similar as human’s. This system concept is to transmit the measured biomedical signals from a transmitter in a living pig to a wireless receiver that is positioned out of body. The integrated solution includes the swallow type <b>pressure</b> <b>capsule</b> and the receiving set consisting of a receiver, decoder circuit. The merit of the proposed system is that the monitoring system can supply the precise and a durable characteristic to measure and to transmit a signal in the gastro-intestinal tract. We achieved the pressure tracings in digestive organs and verified the validity of system after several in-vivo tests using the pressure monitoring system. Through various experiments, we found each organ has its own characterized pressure fluctuation...|$|E

40|$|This paper compares {{contemporary}} and historical light water reactor shielding and pressure vessel dosimetry cross-section libraries for a {{pressurized water reactor}} calculational benchmark problem with a standard out-in core loading. The calculational benchmark problem was developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory by {{the request of the}} U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and used the Oak Ridge National Laboratory two-dimensional discrete ordinates code DORT and the BUGLE- 93 cross-section library for the calculations. In this paper, a Westinghouse three-dimensional discrete ordinates code with parallel processing, the RAPTOR-M 3 G code was used. A variety of cross section libraries were used with RAPTOR-M 3 G including the BUGLE- 93, BUGLE- 96, and BUGLE-B 7 cross-section libraries developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the broad-group ALPAN-VII. 0 cross-section library developed at Westinghouse. In comparing the calculation-to-calculation reaction rates using the BUGLE- 93 cross-section library at the thermal shield, pressure vessel, and cavity capsules, for eleven dosimetry reaction rates, a maximum relative difference of 5 % was observed, with the exception of 65 Cu(n, 2 n) in the <b>pressure</b> vessel <b>capsule</b> that had a 90 % relative difference with respect to the reference results.

40|$|The tests {{described}} in this report were made to determine the error caused by using small tubes to connect orifices {{on the surface of}} aircraft to central <b>pressure</b> <b>capsules</b> in making <b>pressure</b> distribution tests. Aluminum tubes of 3 / 16 -inch inside diameter were used to determine this error. Lengths from 20 feet to 226 feet and pressures whose maxima varied from 2 inches to 140 inches of water were used. Single-pressure impulses for which the time of rise of pressure from zero to a maximum varied from 0. 25 second to 3 seconds were investigated. The results show that the pressure recorded at the capsule on {{the far end of the}} tube lags behind the pressure at the orifice end and experiences also a change in magnitude. For the values used in these tests the time lag and pressure change vary principally with the time of rise of pressure from zero to a maximum and the tube length. Curves are constructed showing the time lag and pressure change. Empirical formulas are also given for computing the time lag. Analysis of pressure distribution tests made on airplanes in flight shows that the recorded pressures are slightly higher than the pressures at the orifice and that the time lag is negligible. The apparent increase in pressure is usually within the experimental error, but in the case of the modern pursuit type of airplane the pressure increase may be 5 per cent. For pressure-distribution tests on airships the analysis shows that the time lag and pressure change may be neglected...|$|R

40|$|Recently, medical {{capsules}} (MCs) {{have evolved}} from pure diagnosis devices to multipurpose medical capsule robotic (MCR) systems. Several research groups {{are investigating the}} feasibility of performing drug delivery, biopsy, sensor implantation, and minimally invasive surgery in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with MCs. A GI sensor implantation capsule robot (GSICR) was invented to implant biosensors, which could enable long-term monitoring of in vivo body parameters (temperature, pH, pressure, etc.) for obtaining better clinical outcomes. Reliable capsule localization and locomotion solutions could improve current MC technology. An understanding of capsule-tissue interaction could provide physiology reference for refining the design of MCRs. For example, the contact <b>pressure</b> between a <b>capsule</b> and the small intestine {{could be used to}} estimate the friction experienced by an active capsule. ^ In this study, several MC prototypes for measuring the contact <b>pressure</b> between the <b>capsule</b> and the small intestine were developed. Two pressure sensors were deployed to measure and differentiate the contact pressure and the small intestine intraluminal pressure. After in vitro calibration and validation, these prototypes were tested in live animal models. The measured pressure signals were analyzed in the time and frequency domains. A mathematical model was presented to describe the physiological factors influencing the contact pressure. Besides the contraction of the small intestine tissue, the respiration, heartbeat, and weight of surrounding tissue also influence the contact <b>pressure.</b> ^ Current <b>capsule</b> localization methods based on radio frequency (RF) signals, magnetic fields, X-rays, etc. need external sensors/devices, while pH-based localization only provides general information (e. g., the GI organ the capsule resides in). Based on a simplified model of the capsule’s motion in the small intestine, a self-contained capsule localization method was presented and a capsule prototype integrated with an inertia measurement unit (IMU) and an optical sensor was developed. After calibration and validation, the capsule’s localization ability was tested by tracking linear, curved and random paths. The result shows the self-contained localization method could be used to track the capsule’s position. Moreover, the capsule tracked its position in a fresh small intestine sample. ...|$|R

40|$|The capsular {{polysaccharide}} (CPS) {{is the most}} important identified virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a human pathogen of the upper respiratory tract. One limitation in studies of S. pneumoniae surface virulence factors is the lack of a reliable procedure for isolation of capsule-negative mutants of clinical strains. This paper presents an approach, based on the immobilization of pneumococci in semi-liquid (0 ? 04 % agar) medium, to easily distinguish and select for non-capsulated mutants. A clinical S. pneumoniae type 37 strain was used as a model to show that CPS production results in bacterial immobilization in semi-liquid agar medium and restricts cell sedimentation. Descendants of CPS ” mutants sedimented faster under these conditions and therefore could be separated from immobilized parental cells. The CPS ” phenotype of the obtained mutants was confirmed by both immunoagglutination and immunostaining experiments using specific type 37 capsular antibodies. Complementation of immobilization with the cloned tts gene, encoding type 37 CPS synthase, confirmed that faster sedimentation of mutants was specifically due to loss of the capsule. DNA sequence determination of three independent mutants revealed a point mutation, a 46 nt deletion and a heptanucleotide duplication in the tts gene. Immobilization of strains producing other CPSs (type 2, 3 and 6) also resulted in the appearance of CPS”mutants, thus showing that immobilization-based isolation is not restricted to type 37 pneumococci. Bacterial growth in semi-liquid medium proved to be a useful model system to identify the genetic consequences of immobilization. The results indicate that immobilization due to CPS may impose selective <b>pressure</b> against <b>capsule</b> production and thus contribute to capsule plasticity...|$|R
