50|$|A <b>Hose</b> <b>Reel</b> is a {{cylindrical}} spindle made {{of either}} metal, fiberglass, or plastic {{and is used}} for storing a hose. The most common styles of <b>hose</b> <b>reels</b> are spring driven (which is self retracting), hand crank, or motor driven. <b>Hose</b> <b>reels</b> are categorized by the diameter and length of the hose they hold, the pressure rating and the rewind method. <b>Hose</b> <b>reels</b> can either be fixed in a permanent location, or portable and attached to a truck, trailer, or cart.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> can be {{bolted to}} the floor of the van for storing the vacuum and {{solution}} hoses. Recently, electric rewind <b>hose</b> <b>reels</b> have been introduced to allow for quicker hose storage.|$|R

5000|$|The {{fire pump}} starts when the {{pressure}} in the fire sprinkler system drops below a threshold. The sprinkler system pressure drops significantly when one or more fire sprinklers are exposed to heat above their design temperature, and opens, releasing water. Alternately, other fire <b>hoses</b> <b>reels</b> or other firefighting connections are opened, causing a pressure drop in the fire fighting main.|$|R
50|$|The TUS reel {{assembly}} (TUS-RA) {{is basically a}} large spool much like a garden <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> that pays out cable when the MT moves away and rolls it back up as the MT returns {{to the center of}} the truss. This is the same TUS-RA retrieved during STS-121. It was replaced and this failed unit was returned to earth and refurbished to later fly on ELC-2.|$|R
5000|$|... 35 Rescue Pumps: the {{standard}} firefighting vehicle mobilised to all emergency calls. These appliances {{are equipped with}} a high-pressure two-stage main pump also capable of making foam via an onboard foam inductor system, two high-pressure <b>hose</b> <b>reels,</b> a set of rescue ladders, a light portable fire pump, four breathing apparatus sets, two spare breathing air cylinders and hydraulic rescue equipment, {{as well as other}} miscellaneous tools.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{limited space}} is available, {{and a fresh}} water tank cannot be fitted, the machine will still retain its demand tank, {{but it will be}} fed from an outdoor [...] "garden" [...] water tap via a {{separate}} supply <b>hose</b> <b>reel.</b> This, of course, requires that the property has an external cold water tap, which can be hard to find on some commercial sites. However, by carrying a range of different fittings, a tap key (for taps that have their handle removed to avoid unwanted water usage), and enough <b>hose</b> on the <b>reel,</b> the cleaner will usually be able to handle this situation.|$|R
5000|$|According to the September 9, 1883 {{edition of}} the Detroit Free Press William Scott & Company was the {{architect}} of the building. Detroit's Engine Company No. 11 was organized as the [...] "Steam Fire Engine Company #11" [...] on January 1, 1884. The original equipment included a horse-drawn Silsby Steam engine and <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> cart. The company converted to motorized operation in 1916, obtaining a Seagrave gasoline propelled pumping engine.|$|R
5000|$|On May 17 at 9:00 p.m. an {{enormous}} {{fire broke out}} in the heart of St. Louis. A steamboat named [...] "The White Cloud" [...] sitting on Cherry Street was on fire. The Fire Department, which at that time consisted of 9 hand engines and <b>hose</b> <b>reels,</b> responded to the scene. The moorings holding the boat broke and the steamer floated down stream setting 22 other steamers on fire as it went.|$|R
50|$|On April 20, 1886, the Jacksonville City Council {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} creating a professional fire department. The department initially consisted of 3 fire stations and 17 men. Station 3, or the Catherine Street Fire Station, was located at 500 East Bay Street and manned entirely by African Americans. Henry Butler served as foreman along with privates Louis M. Kelly and J. Sirmans. Station 3 was {{also home to}} a <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> pulled by a horse named George.|$|R
5000|$|Engine Company 12 is {{a former}} fire station and an {{historic}} structure located in the Bloomingdale neighborhood in Washington, D.C.

5000|$|On May 17, 1849 at 9:00 p.m. a {{fire alarm}} sounded in St. Louis. The paddle wheeled {{steamboat}} [...] "The White Cloud" [...] {{on the river}} {{at the foot of}} Cherry Street was on fire. The volunteer Fire Department with nine hand engines and <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> wagons promptly responded. The moorings holding the [...] "White Cloud" [...] burned through and the burning steamboat drifted slowly down the Mississippi River, setting 22 other steam boats and several flatboats and barges on fire.|$|R
50|$|As fire {{fighting}} arrangement, {{the building has}} one 15-cm diameter riser feeding first-aid <b>hose</b> <b>reels</b> as well as fire extinguishers. For feeding the <b>hose</b> <b>reels,</b> there are two overhead tanks. Connected to the air-conditioning plant is two large vertical shafts located {{at one end of}} the building going up to the roofâ€”one meant for the supply of conditioned air and the other for return air. These shafts are closed at the top except for a small vent. All the floors have false ceilings made of Sitatex boards on wooden frames. The space above the false ceilings is utilised as plenum with three horizontal ducts running through the length of the building acting as supply air ducts. The central duct is of galvanised iron sheets. The side walls, above which the glass facings are fitted, has several openings on the window sills, through grills which communicate with the side ducts in the floor just below. These openings are also for the supply of conditioned air. The plenum as well as supply air ducts connected with vertical shafts are provided with inspection doors made of timber which open out directly to the staircase landings on each floor. At each end, a staircase is provided. The lift shafts are adjoining the vertical air shafts at one end.|$|R
50|$|At {{that time}} there were two engine companies, a {{volunteer}} service, and only the driver and engineer paid. The city rented its buildings, {{and that was all}} the fire department there was. Now we have twelve engine companies in service and one in reserve, five hose companies and two chemical companies, making nineteen houses in all. and there are 128 men on the pay roll. We have eighty-five horses instead of the four we had in 1876, for at that time the <b>hose</b> <b>reels</b> were hauled by hand.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{appliance}} in New Zealand is the Pump Tender, {{which is}} primarily equipped for fires. Typical equipment includes a pump (normally driven off the appliance engine via a power take-off); a high pressure <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> for small fires and initial attack; {{a supply of}} high-pressure and low-pressure hoses for larger fires; fire-fighting foam; a standpipe and bar for accessing fire hydrants, and suction hoses for accessing non-reticulated water supplies; forcible entry tools such as Halligan bars, axes and sledgehammers; aluminium and wooden ladders; and a first aid kit with an automated external defibrillator.|$|R
50|$|Through the 1920s, the ginseng crops {{brought from}} $45,000 to $115,000 per year. The {{expanding}} operation needed more space, so the Fromms bought several neighboring farms. In 1921, Walter {{came up with}} a labor-saving way to spray the ginseng with a <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> on a horse-drawn cart. From 1923 to 1926 their seeds rotted during germination, so they reverted to an earlier stratification technique. When their acreage grew too large for hand-planting, Walter and straw-boss Herbert Kleinschmidt constructed a semi-automated 13-row ginseng planter that could plant three acres per day.|$|R
25|$|While the {{traditional}} {{characteristic of a}} fire appliance {{was a lack of}} water pumping or storage, many modern TLs have a water pumping function built in (and some have their own on-board supply reservoir), and may have a pre-piped waterway running the length of the ladder which directs a stream of water to the firefighters at the top. In some cases, there may also be a monitor {{at the top of the}} ladder for ease of use. Other appliances may simply have a track-way which will hold a manually-run <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> securely, and prevent it from falling to the ground.|$|R
