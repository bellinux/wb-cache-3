40|$|The triple {{decomposition}} {{of the relative}} motion near a point (TDM) ― based on the extraction of a so-called “effective” <b>pure</b> <b>shearing</b> motion ― has been recently proposed by the present author. The relative motion near a point has been decomposed through the analysis of a “frozen ” flow field at a given instant in time. This approach has been motivated {{by the fact that}} vorticity cannot distinguish between <b>pure</b> <b>shearing</b> motions and the actual swirling motion of a vortex. The TDM results in two additive vorticity parts and two additive strain-rate parts of distinct nature: the shear component associated with a <b>pure</b> <b>shearing</b> motion and the residual one. Some basic aspects of this novel decomposition technique are treated in the present paper. These aspects include: <b>pure</b> <b>shearing</b> motion and shearing elements in 3 D, orbital compactness vs. arbitrary axial strain of a vortex, the interpretation of residual vorticity and the concept of residual circulation (i. e. a surface quadrature of the residual vorticity) for the description of vortex strength, and qualitative comparison of the TDM vorticity outcome with other known vorticity-decomposition techniques...|$|R

With the help of classical molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations on plastic deformation of the model glass CuTi during <b>pure</b> <b>shearing,</b> we address this issue by evaluating correlations in atomic-scale plastic displacements, viz. the displacement correlation function. From the correlation length, a universal diameter of about 15 Å, or, equivalently, approximately 120 atoms is derived for a variety of conditions, such as variable strains, strain rates, temperatures, and boundary conditions.

A two-phase Couette flow is considered as test problem and studied by numerical solutions of the Enskog-Vlasov kinetic equation and molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones fluid. It is shown that the velocity slip between the hydrodynamic regions of the two phases is due {{not only to the}} presence of the Knudsen layer in the dilute vapor, but also to a rapid acceleration of the velocity within the outermost half of the vapor-liquid interface.

30|$|To explore if the {{discrepancies}} with previously published diffusivities {{as discussed above}} are due to lattice strain, we calculated the diffusion under various systems of strains applied to the wadsleyite structure at 1500  K. We found that a 5 % uniaxial strain along the x-axis reduces the diffusivity by one order of magnitude according to the mean square-displacement analysis. However, as the values are already below 10 − 10  m 2 /s, they do not show diffusion; rather, they reflect an enhancement of the H localization. When <b>pure</b> <b>sheared</b> is applied, the values increase by about one order of magnitude for 7 % shear and almost two orders for 10 % shear. It is only this last case where actual net hydrogen transfers between the lattice sites is observed. While large strain values are highly unlikely to exist in a natural setting, we show that residual strains in experiments may lead to an underestimate of diffusivity due to H localization.|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{stability}} {{analysis is}} carried out on sheared convective boundary layer (SCBL) flow, in which both sheared stratified flow and thermally convective flow coexist. The linear unstable stratification for the thermal convective flow region {{is included in the}} Taylor-Goldstein equations in terms of an unstable factor Jb in parallel with a stable stratification factor J. New unstable regions corresponding to the thermally convective instability are found above the <b>pure</b> <b>sheared</b> stratified flow regions in the wavenumber α˜ versus stratification factor J plane. As the stratification ratio Jb/J increases, the unstable regions of thermal convection gradually approach and dominate the shear stratified unstable regions. The transition from shear stratified unstable mode to thermal convection instable mode is also observed in the temporal growth rate σ˜ versus J plane and in the σ˜ versus α˜ plane. The eigenfunctions of buoyancy, vertical velocity and buoyancy flux perturbations for sheared stratified dominant mode, the transitional mode and the thermal convection dominant mode in SCBL flow configuration are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Shear {{rheology}} is conventionally studied under <b>pure</b> <b>shearing</b> flows, {{rather than}} more realistic mixed flows. Moving parallel surfaces and capillary rheometery are examples of the former, whilst the latter occurs whenever a flow accelerates or decelerates creating an additional component of extension, e. g. on passing through an industrial extrusion die. We postulate and gather supporting evidence that shear rheology {{is a function of}} not only shear, but both shear and extension rate, a factor with important consequences for fibre spinning and extrusion operations. The direction, as well as rate, of extensional deformation is important. A novel two-phase flow, planar extension experiment is developed and the surface coatings necessary to control the interface structure identified. Shear viscosity evolution is monitored, in-situ, under extensional flow, by optically measuring shear rates either side of a test fluid – reference fluid interface; issues due to optical refraction are critically addressed.

According to revised Cailikefu’s rolling {{shear force}} formula, motion path {{equation}} of spatial seven-bar path is built, and mechanical model, with such new structural features as asymmetric and negative offset, is thus successfully established for 2800 mm heavy shear of some Iron&Steel Company.

The discovery is that back-wall push force could be kept large enough at rolling start-up (i. e. {{the time that the}} maximum rolling shear produces), meanwhile, back-wall push force is the most approximate to side forces with adoption of 60 mm~ 100 mm offset.

40|$|International audienceA {{numerical}} model of ballistic {{impact on a}} two-dimensional Kevlar KM 2 ® plain-woven fabric has been validated by experiment. This paper shows {{that it is necessary}} to experimentally measure material constants of yarns for having good input parameters of the model. Effects of yarn Poisson's ratio, transverse and shear modulus on impact behaviors of a simple crimped yarn and a complete fabric have been carried out. The effect of the Poisson's ratio can be negligible in both impact cases: on a single crimped yarn and a complete fabric. The same conclusion has been proven for the effect of the transversal modulus except the cases of its so low values that can cause yarn early damage. The shear modulus of a yarn appears to be an important material parameter that mainly influences the ballistic performance of a two-dimensional plain-woven fabric. When using a very high value of a shear modulus of yarn, a crimped single yarn is broken immediately after contact with projectile in <b>pure</b> <b>shearing</b> mode...|$|R

The work presented herein implements {{two sets of}} boundary element schemes to numerically solve the stress field.

Four benchmark elastic problems are solved numerically to show {{the advantage of the}} two schemes over the conventional boundary element formulation in eliminating the boundary layer effect. The one with the weaker singularity has better convergence and gives more accurate results. The presented formulation also provides a direct approach to solve for stress field in a finite solid body in the presence of dislocations. Combined with discrete dislocations dynamics, boundary value problems with dislocations in finite bodies can be solved. Two examples, bending of a single crystal beam and <b>pure</b> <b>shearing</b> of a polycrystalline solid, are simulated by discrete dislocation dynamics using the scheme that has the weaker singularity.
