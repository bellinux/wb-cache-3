40|$|A {{pasteurization}} {{process for}} rock crab (Cancer irroratus) meat {{was developed for}} an 8 oz plastic container with an aluminum <b>pull</b> <b>top</b> lid. A refrigerated shelf life greater than 6 months was required maintaining good nutritional and microbial quality. [...] The optimal process for the ES 308 plastic container, supplied by Kings Plastic, with a double seemed <b>pull</b> <b>top</b> aluminum lid, {{was found to be}} 130 minutes at 83 °C. This process was developed for a fill weight of 180 g of crab meat and 47 g of 3 % brine. The slowest heating spot within the container was found to occur at a point 3. 0 cm below the aluminum <b>pull</b> <b>top</b> lid. Thermal penetration studies revealed the following heating and cooling parameters for this container and meat: jh = 1. 69 (₌ 0. 04), fh = 34. 74 (₌ 1. 04), jc = 1. 56 (₌ 0. 03), fc = 50. 53 (₌ 1. 73) [...] The 83. 0 °C upper temperature processing limit, for this plastic container, reduced the possible processing times. Reduced processing temperatures, from 83. 0 °C, caused disproportionally great increases in processing times which further resulted in increases of energy expenditure per container produced. The process 130 minutes at 83. 0 °C was found to be optimal from an energy expenditure point of view for this reason. [...] Nutritional quality did not show significant changes apart from some reductions in fatty acid content. The microbial quality from this process was shown to be more than adequate as the shelf life obtained was in excess of 12 months when held consistently at 2. 2 °C. The shelf life was dramatically lowered with increases in storage temperature (above 4. 0 °C) and with abusive handling or inadequate sealing...|$|R

5000|$|In 2002, TV Guide {{compiled}} a list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time as part of the magazine's 50th anniversary. Bugs Bunny was given the honor of number 1. In a CNN broadcast on July 31, 2002, a TV Guide editor talked about the group that created the list. The editor also explained why Bugs <b>pulled</b> <b>top</b> billing: [...] "His stock...has never gone down...Bugs is the best example...of the smart-aleck American comic. He not only is a great cartoon character, he's a great comedian. He was written well. He was drawn beautifully. He has thrilled and made many generations laugh. He is tops." ...|$|R

5000|$|Hayagawari (literally [...] "quick change"):Is used {{to effect}} quick changes of costume for an actor while he remains on stage. Sometimes {{this will be}} done with strings which pull off or <b>pull</b> apart a <b>top</b> layer of costume to reveal another costume underneath. In a {{technique}} called hikinuki (...) , the outermost layer is held on {{with only a few}} threads; stage assistants called kuroko appear on stage and pull these threads, allowing this outer costume layer to come off quite quickly and easily. This might also be accomplished even more simply by having the actor <b>pull</b> his <b>top</b> layer off or apart himself. Hayagawari is used for a number of characters who remove disguises to reveal their true identity, and for hengemono, dances in which a single actor plays multiple roles.|$|R

50|$|Suits {{intended}} for long-term worksuit use, or donned by rescue personnel, typically have a form-fitting neck-encircling seal, with a hood that {{conforms to the}} shape of the chin. This design is both more comfortable and allows the wearer to easily turn their head and look up or down. The suit material is designed to be either loose or elastic enough to allow the wearer to <b>pull</b> the <b>top</b> of the suit up over their head and then down around their neck.|$|R
50|$|During play, {{a player}} <b>pulls</b> the <b>top</b> three cards {{from the deck}} and flips them face up. If less than three cards are left when {{the end of the}} deck is reached, then the {{difference}} should be ignored and the cards flipped as usual. If two cards are left, then only those cards are flipped. The player may not wrap around {{to the front of the}} deck to get a third card. Only the top card can be played, the cards below can be played if the card(s) above them are removed.|$|R
50|$|Deal {{later learned}} of the power rack. He cut out {{the floor of his}} basement, dug down about two feet and built himself a power rack. Here he was able to use heavy weight on the rack which led to an {{exponential}} increase in his lifting numbers. He would perform 1 set of 3 reps in 3 different positions. For each position, Deal would place the pins about a foot apart and then <b>pull</b> the <b>top</b> pin and hold the bar against the top pin for about 6 seconds on the 3rd rep.|$|R

40|$|We use {{magnetic}} force microscopy to both image and manipulate individual vortex lines threading single crystalline YBa$_ 2 $Cu$_ 3 $O$_{ 6. 4 }$, a layered superconductor. We find that when we <b>pull</b> the <b>top</b> of a pinned vortex, it may not tilt smoothly. Sometimes, we observe a vortex to break into discrete segments that {{can be described as}} short stacks of pancake vortices, similar to the "kinked" structure proposed by Benkraouda and Clem. Quantitative analysis gives an estimate of the pinning force and the coupling between the stacks. Our measurements highlight the discrete nature of stacks of pancake vortices in layered superconductors...|$|R

The author started with a campaign of experiments using high-explosive-driven flux compression generators. The campaign's objective was to explore completely novel ideas in condensed-matter physics and chemistry.

5000|$|In {{a typical}} arrangement: an iron {{gooseneck}} was fitted at the fore {{end of the}} tiller. Then, a metal ring was fitted over this and secured with a pin. The ring was attached to a long thin pole (the whipstaff proper) and this pole connected the tiller to the helmsman one or more decks above it through a pivot point, roll, or rowle described as, [...] "that round piece of wood or iron wherein the whip doth go and is made turn about that it may carry over the whip {{from side to side}} with more ease." [...] The helmsman himself still usually did not stand on the topmost deck, but rather viewed what lay ahead of the ship through a small port or hatchway in the deck above him called a companion. To move the ship to port, the forward-facing helmsman <b>pulled</b> the <b>top</b> of the staff to his left and pushed the pole down and to the right; to move it to starboard, he <b>pulled</b> the <b>top</b> to his right and pushed the pole down and to the left. In this fashion the tiller might get as much as 20° of turn though angles of between 5° and 10° seem more likely. [...] The tiller rested on a very strong horizontal wooden bar called the tiller sweep which was sheathed in metal and coated with soap and grease to minimize the drag of the tiller as it rode across it.|$|R
50|$|The {{series was}} {{hindered}} {{for a brief}} time beginning in 2004-05 when Michigan State <b>pulled</b> its <b>top</b> team (then called the Green team) out of the CCWHA to play an independent schedule while placing its second team (then called the White team) in its spot. MSU White was generally far less of a factor in the league, as evidenced by U-M's 10-0-0 record and aggregate 61-4 scoreline against that squad over its two CCWHA seasons (Michigan did continue to schedule MSU Green as well during this period, although meetings were more intermittent). In 2007-08, the Spartans A team re-joined the CCWHA and remains in the conference today.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} {{was made}} by machining two triple cases and then welding them together before the final machining was done. The cylinder block, the head and camboxes were all produced in the same way, but the crankshaft was built up and the camshafts specially made and carried cams with mild timing. Most other parts were from the triple or twin suitably modified where necessary. It <b>pulled</b> a <b>top</b> gear of 4.2 to 1 and ran to nearly 125mph with the mild cams. (Courtesy “Triumph Twins and Triples” by Roy Bacon). Only one was made but {{as a piece of}} ingenious and highly skilled engineering, {{it would be hard to}} beat.|$|R
