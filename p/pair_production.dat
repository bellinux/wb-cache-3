Based on a series constraints of the SM-like Higgs boson signal fits, the perturbative unitarity and stability bounds to the Higgs potential, and the most recent LHC searches for the heavy Higgs bosons, we suggest a set of benchmark models for the future high-energy collider searches for the Higgs <b>pair</b> <b>productions.</b> The e^+ e^- colliders operating at √(s) = (500 GeV, 1 TeV) are capable of measuring the Higgs cubic self couplings of the benchmark models directly.

25|$|Gamma {{spectroscopy}} detectors are passive {{materials that}} {{wait for a}} gamma interaction {{to occur in the}} detector volume. The most important interaction mechanisms are the photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, and <b>pair</b> <b>production.</b> The photoelectric effect is preferred, as it absorbs all of the energy of the incident gamma ray. Full energy absorption is also possible when a series of these interaction mechanisms take place within the detector volume. When a gamma ray undergoes a Compton interaction or <b>pair</b> <b>production,</b> and a portion of the energy escapes from the detector volume without being absorbed, the background rate in the spectrum is increased by one count.

25|$|The fine-structure {{constant}} is {{the coupling}} constant of quantum electrodynamics (QED) determining {{the strength of}} the interaction between electrons and photons. It turns out that the fine structure constant is not really a constant at all owing to the zero-point energy fluctuations of the electron-positron field. The quantum fluctuations caused by zero-point energy have the effect of screening electric charges: owing to (virtual) electron-positron <b>pair</b> <b>production,</b> the charge of the particle measured far from the particle is far smaller than the charge measured when close to it.|$|E

The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter, is called baryon asymmetry.

500|$|Core {{collapse}} can {{be caused}} by several different mechanisms: electron capture; exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit; pair-instability; or photodisintegration. When a massive star develops an iron core larger than the Chandrasekhar mass it will {{no longer be able to}} support itself by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or black hole. [...] Electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate O/Ne/Mg core causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion, with very similar results. [...] Electron-positron <b>pair</b> <b>production</b> in a large post-helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion, resulting in a pair-instability supernova. [...] A sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate gamma-rays energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly, which will cause a complete collapse of the core.|$|E
500|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the significance of}} these formulae, the annihilation of a particle with its antiparticle in free space must result in the creation of at least two photons for the following reason. In the center of momentum frame, the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single photon always has momentum (since, as we have seen, it is determined by the photon's frequency or wavelength, which cannot be zero). Hence, conservation of momentum (or equivalently, translational invariance) requires that at least two photons are created, with zero net momentum. (However, it is possible if the system interacts with another particle or field for the annihilation to produce one photon, as when a positron annihilates with a bound atomic electron, it is possible for only one photon to be emitted, as the nuclear Coulomb field breaks translational symmetry.) The energy of the two photons, or, equivalently, their frequency, may be determined from conservation of four-momentum. Seen another way, the photon can be considered as its own antiparticle. The reverse process, <b>pair</b> <b>production,</b> is the dominant mechanism by which high-energy photons such as gamma rays lose energy while passing through matter. That process is the reverse of [...] "annihilation to one photon" [...] allowed in the electric field of an atomic nucleus.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} known for many years that {{ejection}} of matter at relativistic velocities (velocities very close to the speed of light) is a necessary requirement for producing the emission in a gamma-ray burst. GRBs vary on such short timescales (as short as milliseconds) that the size of the emitting region must be very small, or else the time delay due to the finite speed of light would [...] "smear" [...] the emission out in time, wiping out any short-timescale behavior. At the energies involved in a typical GRB, so much energy crammed into such a small space would make the system opaque to photon-photon <b>pair</b> <b>production,</b> making the burst far less luminous and also giving it a very different spectrum from what is observed. However, if the emitting system is moving towards Earth at relativistic velocities, the burst is compressed in time (as seen by an Earth observer, due to the relativistic Doppler effect) and the emitting region inferred from the finite speed of light becomes much smaller than the true size of the GRB (see relativistic beaming).|$|E
2500|$|One may query {{what this}} has to do with zero-point energy. Given the complex and {{adaptive}} behaviour that arises from nonlinear systems considerable attention in recent years has gone into studying a new class of phase transitions which occur at absolute zero temperature. These are quantum phase transitions which are driven by EM field fluctuations as a consequence of zero-point energy A good example of a spontaneous phase transition that are attributed to zero-point fluctuations can be found in superconductors. Superconductivity is one of the best known empirically quantified macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena whose basis is recognised to be quantum mechanical in origin. The behaviour of the electric and magnetic fields under superconductivity is governed by the London equations. However, it has been questioned in a series of journal articles whether the quantum mechanically canonised London equations can be given a purely classical derivation. Bostick for instance, has claimed to show that the London equations do indeed have a classical origin that applies to superconductors and to some collisionless plasmas as well. In particular it has been asserted that the Beltrami vortices in the plasma focus display the same paired flux-tube morphology as Type II superconductors. Others have also pointed out this connection, Fröhlich has shown that the hydrodynamic equations of compressible fluids, together with the London equations, lead to a macroscopic parameter ( [...] = electric charge density / mass density), without involving either quantum phase factors or Planck's constant. In essence, it has been asserted that Beltrami plasma vortex structures are able to at least simulate the morphology of Type I and Type II superconductors. This occurs because the [...] "organised" [...] dissipative energy of the vortex configuration comprising the ions and electrons far exceeds the [...] "disorganised" [...] dissipative random thermal energy. The transition from disorganised fluctuations to organised helical structures is a phase transition involving a change in the condensate's energy (i.e. the ground state or zero-point energy) but without any associated rise in temperature. This is an example of zero-point energy having multiple stable states (see Quantum phase transition, Quantum critical point, Topological degeneracy, Topological order) and where the overall system structure is independent of a reductionist or deterministic view, that [...] "classical" [...] macroscopic order can also causally affect quantum phenomena.
