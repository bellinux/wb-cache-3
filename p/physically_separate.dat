5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must <b>physically</b> <b>separate</b> the {{two copies of}} the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E

25|$|Separators have to <b>physically</b> <b>separate</b> the two {{electrodes}} {{to prevent}} a short circuit by direct contact. It can be very thin (a few hundredths of a millimeter) and must be very porous to the conducting ions to minimize ESR. Furthermore, separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity. Inexpensive components use open capacitor papers. More sophisticated designs use nonwoven porous polymeric films like polyacrylonitrile or Kapton, woven glass fibers or porous woven ceramic fibres.|$|E

The control, navigation, and communication systems are networked with the passenger cabin's in-flight internet systems. In January 2008, FAA concerns were reported regarding possible passenger access to the 787's computer networks; Boeing has stated that various protective hardware and software solutions are employed, including air gaps to <b>physically</b> <b>separate</b> the networks, and firewalls for software separation. These measures prevent data transfer from the passenger internet system to the maintenance or navigation systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} <b>physically</b> <b>separate</b> {{arriving}} and departing passengers, Auckland Airport {{decided to build}} a new departure level on top of the existing one, with the existing floor becoming the arrivals level. The existing departure lounges, which were separated from the arrivals corridor by glass walls, were kept, and escalators were installed to transport passengers from the new departures level down to each departure lounge. The modifications to the terminal were completed in December 2005, and also involved the expansion of retail space within the pier by 600 square metres and {{an increase in the number}} of bus gates to four.|$|E
25|$|Bisulfite {{sequencing}} {{relies on}} the conversion of every single unmethylated cytosine residue to uracil. If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in false positive results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulfite, therefore denaturation of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical. It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in agarose gel {{has been reported to}} improve the rate of conversion by keeping strands of DNA <b>physically</b> <b>separate.</b>|$|E

25|$|The usual {{technique}} for authorities, either public entities such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) {{that they believe}} is being used improperly is to first <b>physically</b> <b>separate</b> the suspect user from the computer enough {{that he or she}} cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once they have done so, they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions of a mouse, touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going into sleep mode, from which it would usually return to a lock screen which would require a password. One program commonly used for this purpose is Mouse Jiggler.|$|E
25|$|This {{includes}} {{cases in}} which there is contact equilibrium between the system, and several subsystems in its surroundings, including separate connections with subsystems through walls that are permeable to the transfer of matter and internal energy as heat and allowing friction of passage of the transferred matter, but immovable, and separate connections through adiabatic walls with others, and separate connections through diathermic walls impermeable to matter with yet others. Because there are <b>physically</b> <b>separate</b> connections that are permeable to energy but impermeable to matter, between the system and its surroundings, energy transfers between them can occur with definite heat and work characters. Conceptually essential here is that the internal energy transferred with the transfer of matter is measured by a variable that is mathematically independent of the variables that measure heat and work.|$|E
25|$|Maine was <b>physically</b> <b>separate</b> {{from the}} rest of Massachusetts. Long-standing {{disagreements}} over land speculation and settlements led to Maine residents and their allies in Massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the Massachusetts Assembly on permitting Maine to secede; the vote failed. Secessionist sentiment in Maine was stoked during the War of 1812 when Massachusetts pro-British merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders. In 1819, Massachusetts agreed to permit secession, sanctioned by voters of the rapidly growing region the following year. Formal secession and formation of the state of Maine as the 23rd state occurred on March 15, 1820, as part of the Missouri Compromise, which geographically limited the spread of slavery and enabled the admission to statehood of Missouri the following year, keeping a balance between slave and free states.|$|E

25|$|Framing camera (FC)— The framing camera uses 20mm aperture, f/7.9 {{refractive}} {{optical system}} with a focal length of 150mm. A frame-transfer charge-coupled device (CCD), a Thomson TH7888A, at the focal plane has 1024 × 1024 sensitive 93-μrad pixels, yielding a 5.5° x 5.5° field of view. An 8-position filter wheel permits panchromatic (clear filter) and spectrally selective imaging (7 narrow band filters). The broadest filter allows imaging at wavelengths ranging from 400 to 1050nm. In addition, the framing camera will acquire images for optical navigation while in the vicinities of Vesta and Ceres. The FC computer is a custom radiation-hardened Xilinx {{system with a}} LEON2 core and 8 GiB of memory. The camera will offer resolutions of 17 m/pixel for Vesta and 66 m/pixel for Ceres. Because the framing camera is vital for both science and navigation, the payload has two identical and <b>physically</b> <b>separate</b> cameras (FC1 & FC2) for redundancy, {{each with its own}} optics, electronics, and structure.|$|E
