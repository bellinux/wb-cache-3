5000|$|There is {{significant}} debate {{about who is}} responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology. While some non-nanotechnology specific regulatory agencies currently cover some products and processes (to varying degrees) - by [...] "bolting on" [...] nanotechnology to existing regulations - there are clear gaps in these regimes. This enables some nanotechnology applications to figuratively [...] "slip through the cracks" [...] without being covered by any regulations. An example of this has occurred in the US, and involves nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for use in sunscreen where they create a clearer cosmetic appearance. In this case, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the immediate health effects of exposure to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for consumers. However, they did not review its impacts for aquatic ecosystems when the sunscreen rubs off, nor did the EPA, or any other agency. Similarly the Australian equivalent of the FDA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved the use of nanoparticles in sunscreens (without the requirement for package labelling) after a thorough review of the literature, on the basis that although nanoparticles of TI02 and zinc oxide (ZN0) in sunscreens do produce free radicals and oxidative DNA damage in vitro, such particles were unlikely to pass the dead outer cells of the stratum corneum of human skin; a finding which some academics have argued seemed not to apply the precautionary principle in relation to prolonged use on children with cut skin, the elderly with thin skin, people with diseased skin or use over flexural creases. Doubts over the TGA's decision were raised with publication of a paper showing that the uncoated anatase form of TI02 used in some Australian sunscreens caused a photocatalytic reaction that degraded the surface of newly installed <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel</b> roofs in places where they came in contact with the sunscreen coated hands of workmen. Such gaps in regulation are likely to continue alongside the development and commercialization of increasingly complex second and third generation nanotechnologies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} common pressed <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel</b> sheets with trade mark TDC 51 D+Z was studied by neutral salt spray and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The effect of organic polymers on the corrosion performance of <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel</b> sheet was analyzed with glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GDS). The {{results showed that}} the distributing depth of titanium pigment determined the corrosion performance of <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel</b> sheets with white finishing coat...|$|E
40|$|The centerpieces of NKK’s {{new series}} of {{environmentally}} friendly steel sheets, a new chromium-free coated steel sheet “GEO-FRONTIER COAT ” and a new chromium-free <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel</b> sheet “GEO-FRONTIER EXCEL COAT”, have been developed. The major advantage of “GEO-FRONTIER COAT ” {{is that it has}} excellent corrosion resistance comparable to conventional chromate coated steel sheets even after alkaline degreasing. This property is due to a proprietary organic composite coating. It is a new product with a good balance of corrosion resistance, electrical grounding properties, and is easy to weld. While developing “GEO-FRONTIER EXCEL COAT”, a new type of primer coating was designed in order to achieve excellent corrosion resistance comparable to that provided by the conventional chromate-based <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel</b> sheet...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{substantial}} {{database of}} annual metal runoff loads, {{obtained from a}} 14 -month field exposure campaign on 12 different metal roofing materials at two sites within Paris conurbation, is presented herein. Thirteen metallic species have been considered. A comparison among the various roofing materials yields a ranking of their runoff pollution potential, which highlights that aluminum, coated products, and stainless steel display the lower emission levels, before zinc and copper materials. Lead materials appear to release more metallic species, and tend {{to do so in}} quite large quantities. Whatever the material family considered, older materials apparently release more metallic species with higher levels of emission. In considering zinc emissions from zinc-based materials, it is clear that surface coatings significantly reduce zinc emissions (40 % less for the Zn- 3 (PO 4) (2) surface-treated Anthra zinc, compared to natural zinc; and 99 % less for <b>prepainted</b> galvanized <b>steel</b> compared to standard galvanized steel). In the case of Anthra zinc however, surface treatment induces the release of Ni into the runoff, and Ni constitutes a priority pollutant in the European Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 CE). A high level of consistency with literature data has been found for Zn runoff when considering runoff rates reported at the same inclination...|$|R
40|$|A continual testing {{development}} program for Colorbond, a <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel</b> product carefully designed multilayer system that offers corrosion protection and theoretical {{studies of the}} material's performance at the nanoscale are conducted. Results suggest that increasing the hardness and atomic roughness of the polyester surface by crosslinking and/or carefully chosen nano-functionalisation can significantly decrease its interactions with the carbonaceous solids and nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{colonization}} of <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel,</b> {{commonly used in}} roofing applications, impacts their aesthetics, durability, and functionality. Understanding the relevant organisms and the mechanisms by which colonization occurs would provide valuable {{information that can be}} subsequently used to design fouling prevention strategies. Here, next-generation sequencing and microbial community finger printing (T-RFLP) were used to study the community composition of microbes colonizing <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel</b> roofing materials at Burrawang, Australia and Kapar, Malaysia over a 52 -week period. Community diversity was low and was dominated by Bacillus spp., cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, Cladosporium sp., Epicoccum nigrum, and Teratosphaeriaceae sp. Cultivation-based methods isolated approximately 20 different fungi and bacteria, some of which, such as E. nigrum and Cladosporium sp., were represented in the community sequence data. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging showed that fungi were the most dominant organisms present. Analysis of the sequence and T-RFLP data indicated that the microbial communities differed significantly between locations and changed significantly over time. The study demonstrates the utility of molecular ecology tools to identify and characterize microbial communities associated with the fouling of painted steel surfaces and ultimately can enable the targeted development of control strategies based on the dominant species responsible for fouling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractApplication of {{the coating}} to {{material}} {{in a flat}} condition has economical, technological and ecological advantages. As the material is subsequently formed into shape not only the base material needs to withstand this process but the coating as well. Development of forming tools for coated metals is mainly concerned with the prediction of performance of the base material and does not analyse {{the condition of the}} coating. However, during the forming process, major surface damage can occur when the coated sheet is bent and unbent around the die geometry. To reduce surface damage of coatings, proper control of the parameters during forming and a detail study of the surface conditions is required. This research is conducted on metallically and organically coated sheet material which is commonly used for structural applications. The crack density of the coating is analysed during a deep drawing process and a forming limit diagram is obtained from the biaxial straining of the <b>prepainted</b> <b>steel</b> samples. The results show that cracks initiate from within the organic coating and are linked to the strain in the base material...|$|E
