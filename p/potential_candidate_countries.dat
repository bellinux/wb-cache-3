50|$|The CARDS programme, of Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation, is the EU's main {{instrument}} of {{financial assistance to}} the Western Balkans, covering specifically the countries of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania.

The implementation of the Dayton Accords of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the international community, on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the former Yugoslavia.

40|$|Bosnia and Herzegovina is a <b>potential</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>country</b> for EU membership. The Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) between Bosnia and the EU {{was signed}} in June 2008. Much of today's Bosnia {{is a product of}} IC and its {{decision}} making. The discussion is concerned with to what extent the EU has achieved to bring Bosnia closer to the EU negotiation table. For the purpose of the thesis, I have chosen two indicators to measure the effect of the integration; Office of the High Representative/EU Specuial Representative and the formal accession agreement between the EU and Bosnia, SAA. Bosnia represents great challenge for the EU. Constitutional elements established by the Dayton Peace Agreement have been frequently challenged by key political leaders and political rhetoric. This has led to a stagnation of the EU related forms. To summarize the findings, one must conclude {{that when it comes to}} making an environment which assists EU integration, the EU and the international community has failed to do so, despite the large efforts. The lack of positive results should give an enforced European political engagement. The EU is necessary but not sufficient. Bosnia is a test for the EU just as the EU is a test for Bosnia...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{financial}} stability challenges in countries preparing for EU membership, i. e. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*, Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. The paper has been prepared by an expert group of staff from the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in which experts from EU <b>candidate</b> and <b>potential</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>country</b> central banks also participated. The paper finds that near-term challenges to {{financial stability}} primarily relate to credit risks from the generally weak economic dynamics {{in combination with}} already high non-performing loan burdens in many banking systems, especially in the Western Balkans. In the medium-term, challenges to financial stability stem from indirect market risks to banks related to foreign currency lending as well as lingering exposures to funding risks, with Western Balkan economies again appearing as relatively more vulnerable. Looking further ahead, {{the paper highlights that}} the magnitude of the challenge to reach a 2 ̆ 018 new banking normal 2 ̆ 019 for banking systems in these countries appears to remain sizeable, while noting that the establishment of adequate home-host cooperation channels would be important to help maximise the potential benefits to third parties stemming from centralised banking supervision under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) ...|$|R
40|$|Cooperation may {{be defined}} as the {{collaboration}} between two or more parties which fuels initiatives that have shared, or converging interests and objectives. In the European Union territorial cohesion has recently been included in the draft of the European Constitution and is complementary to the EU drive towards economic and social cohesion. This adds a new dimension to European integration which clearly recognises that considering things from a territorial dimension is a tool for reducing the territorial disparity currently present in the EU. In fact, well before its enlargement, significant disparities in prosperity levels existed both between and within member states: prosperity levels in the ten most dynamic regions of the EU, based on GDP per capita, were nearly three times higher than that of the ten least developed regions and regional differences have widened with enlargement. In this context, the territorial cooperation objective aims to: improve cross-border cooperation through joint, local and regional initiatives; strengthen trans-national cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to Community priorities as well as to strengthen interregional cooperation and the exchange of experience at the appropriate territorial level. Three different typologies of territorial cooperation have been identified with the European territory: cross-border cooperation, trans-national cooperation and Interregional cooperation. The paper focuses on the territorial cooperation objective and presents a case study with large and strong economic, social and environmental disparities. It includes EU members and non EU members. More specifically, the IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) Adriatic Cross Border Cooperation (CBC) Program, which includes three EU Member States, one <b>Candidate</b> <b>Country,</b> and three <b>Potential</b> <b>Candidates</b> <b>Countries.</b> cooperation, regional disparities, european external instruments...|$|R
