Purely mechanical pressure {{regulators are}} commonly used to control the supply pressure to the desired value. The in-telligent pneumatic pressure regulator (IPPR) is designed as the demands of pressure control precision increase. Its prominent advantage {{is the ability to}} achieve accurate output pressure, remote control and centralized management. In this paper, the IPPR consists of a mechanical valve body, a stepping motor, a microcontroller, a pressure sensor. Herein, its <b>pneumatic</b> <b>characteristics</b> were analyzed, and the pressure control algorithm was presented. The superior performance of IPPR was shown in AMEsim simulation, especially in terms of avoiding affects from upstream pressure and downstream flow disturbances...|$|R

40|$|The article {{portrays the}} results of {{experimental}} studies conducted {{in the field of}} static strength test of main landing gear of lightweight aircraft {{as well as in the}} area of establishing the <b>pneumatic</b> tyre <b>characteristics</b> of main landing gear. The studies were carried out in compliance with methodologies of performing studies for the purposes of solutions implemented in aviation structures. It was stated that static strength tests of landing gear should not be done with the use of shock absorbers, due to the fact that this element, distinguished by high viscoelastic properties, by being statically loaded, is subject to displacements that do not occur during normal operation of the aircraft. Excessive displacements of shock absorber result in the load distribution in other landing gear elements being incompatible with project assumptions, which in turn leads to this strength test being interrupted, bearing in mind significantly lower loads than anticipated. It was also concluded that in order to determine <b>pneumatic</b> tyre <b>characteristics</b> it is not necessary to carry out tests on the whole landing gear strut, because the results obtained in the compression test of the wheel itself with pneumatic tyre are identical as the results acquired during tests conducted in accordance with methodology. Test preparation process with the use of the wheel itself and its realization is less time-consuming, less expensive and does not entail the necessity to build complex test stands...|$|R
