50|$|Stratospheric <b>Particle</b> <b>Injection</b> for Climate Engineering (SPICE) was a United Kingdom {{government-funded}} {{climate engineering}} (geoengineering) research project that aimed {{to assess the}} feasibility of injecting particles into the stratosphere from a tethered balloon {{for the purposes of}} solar radiation management.|$|E
50|$|Before {{there can}} be {{scientific}} experimentation, organizations must be compliant with good governance, meaning that testing must be moral and practical. Many research organizations such as SPICE (Stratospheric <b>Particle</b> <b>Injection</b> for Climate Engineering) a geoengineering research project that was formed in the U.K. was required to go through stages of evaluation before testing could be conducted {{if they were to}} be funded by stakeholders. In 2011 SPICE made plans to experiment with solar radiation. The method for this experiment included injecting stratospheric sulfur aerosols into the Earths atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between substorm occurrences and HILDCAA events {{has been an}} issue. We have studied the association of <b>particle</b> <b>injections</b> with substorm onsets during HILDCAA intervals {{for the first half}} of year 2003. The examination of aurora images observed by IMAGE spacecraft and electron flux data measured by LANL satellites exhibits a close association of repetitive <b>particle</b> <b>injections</b> with substorm activity. We also find that HILDCAA events can occur equally frequently during slow speed solar wind streams as long as the interplanetary magnetic field exhibits Alfvenic wave feature...|$|R

50|$|Almost {{all work}} {{to date on}} stratospheric sulfate {{injection}} has been limited to modelling and laboratory work. A Russian team tested aerosol formation in the lower troposphere using helicopters. The Stratospheric <b>Particle</b> <b>Injection</b> for Climate Engineering (SPICE) project planned on a limited field test in order to evaluate a potential delivery system, but this component {{of the project was}} canceled. In 2015, a group based at Harvard University has described a potential field experiment to test the possible damage to stratospheric ozone from stratospheric sulfate injection, and a first test is scheduled for 2017/2018, taking place in the Tucson desert.|$|E
50|$|Persico {{was born}} in Rome on 9 August 1900. During his {{university}} years his friendship with Enrico Fermi intensified. He graduated in 1921. In 1926 he was already teaching physics at the University of Rome, and co-authored with Fermi {{on the topic of}} wave mechanics. He then moved to Florence, where he organized lectures on wave mechanics. At the end of 1930 he was called to Turin. From Turin he maintained relationships with Fermi. He was a witness to the discovery of the slowing down of neutrons and recorded results of the readings of the counters used by Fermi in order to measure the activity induced by neutrons in particles of silver, with and without the presence of paraffin. In the autumn of the 1949 Persico, discouraged from the oppressive atmosphere of the post-war period, accepted a position in Canada, taking the place of Franco Rasetti. In the autumn of 1950 he returned to Rome, to take up the advanced Physical Chair. He continued an interest in optoelectronics, an area that had already cultivated in Canada. In the 1953 Persico directed the theoretical work that underpinned the construction of a 1.1 GeV synchrotron. He also developed the general theory of loaded <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> in particle accelerators.|$|E
40|$|A <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> {{model has}} been applied to the radio outbursts of the X-ray binary Circinus X- 1. The radio outbursts of this system have often been {{observed}} to exhibit a double peaked structure, i. e., with two apparent consecutive maxima. We show here that <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> models can account for such observed behavior provided that a time variable <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> rate is adopted...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{evolution}} of ultraviolet auroral features located equatorward of the main emission appearing in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of the northern and the southern Jovian hemisphere. We investigate the possibility that those ultraviolet auroral structures are associated with energetic <b>particle</b> <b>injections.</b> For this study, we compare {{the characteristics of the}} simulated auroral signature of plasma injections with the observed parameters of equatorward isolated auroral structures...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{investigations}} {{was carried out}} during the First Spacelab Mission to study the space plasma environment from the Shuttle/Spacelab. The emphasis of the experiments was {{on the performance of}} <b>particle</b> <b>injections</b> from the Shuttle/Spacelab and studies of the ensuing effects on the orbiter, the near orbiter environment, and the earth's atmosphere. Results of these experiments, including electron beam injections, plasma injections, neutral injections, electron-plasma injections, electron-neutral injections, and ambient environmental measurements, are reviewed...|$|R
30|$|Chorus {{generation}} is reported during geomagnetic storms (Horne and Thorne 1998; Summers et al. 1998, 2002; Meredith et al. 2002; Horne et al. 2003, 2005 a, 2005 b, 2007). However, the <b>particle</b> <b>injections</b> during storms are {{deeper into the}} magnetosphere (stronger convection electric fields) and last for only hours of duration. On the other hand, HSS HILDCAAs can last for days to weeks (Tsurutani et al. 1995; Hajra et al. 2013), and presumably, the chorus lasts that long as well.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> {{model has}} been applied to the radio outbursts of the X-ray binary Circinus X- 1. The radio outbursts of this system have often been {{observed}} to exhibit a double peaked structure, i. e., with two apparent consecutive maxima. We show here that <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> models can account for such observed behaviour provided that a time variable <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> rate is adopted. Several possible time dependences are assumed and the corresponding predicted radio light curves compared with multi-frequency observations collected from the literature...|$|E
40|$|The interplanetary {{energy flux}} is {{estimated}} {{on the basis}} of the Poynting flux and its variations with the rate of energy dissipation in terms of: (1) the ring-current <b>particle</b> <b>injection,</b> (2) Joule dissipation in the ionosphere, and (3) auroral <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> for 15 major geomagnetic storms. A relationship, in terms of the angle between the interplanetary magnetic field vector and the magnetospheric field vector, is defined by which the growth of geomagnetic storms is closely associated with the Poynting flux. It is found that the energy flux that enters the magnetosphere is dissipated through intramagnetospheric substorm processes. Geomagnetic storm phenomena represent the combined influence of such effects...|$|E
40|$|Context. Diffusive shock {{acceleration}} in {{the solar}} corona can accelerate solar energetic particles to very high energies. Acceleration efficiency is increased by entrapment through self-generated waves, which is highly dependent {{on the amount of}} accelerated particles. This, in turn, is determined by the efficiency of <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> into the acceleration process. Aims. We present an analysis of the injection efficiency at coronal shocks of varying obliquity. We assessed injection through reflection and downstream scattering, including the effect of a cross-shock potential. Both quasi-thermal and suprathermal seed populations were analysed. We present results on the effect of cross-field diffusion downstream of the shock on the injection efficiency. Methods. Using analytical methods, we present applicable injection speed thresholds that were compared with both semi-analytical flux integration and Monte Carlo simulations, which do not resort to binary thresholds. Shock-normal angle θBn and shock-normal velocity Vs were varied to assess the injection efficiency with respect to these parameters. Results. We present evidence of a significant bias of thermal seed <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> at small shock-normal angles. We show that downstream isotropisation methods affect the θBn-dependence of this result. We show a non-negligible effect caused by the crossshock potential, and that the effect of downstream cross-field diffusion is highly dependent on boundary definitions. Conclusions. Our results show that for Monte Carlo simulations of coronal shock acceleration a full distribution function assessment with downstream isotropisation through scatterings is necessary to realistically model <b>particle</b> <b>injection.</b> Based on our results, seed <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> at quasi-parallel coronal shocks can result in significant acceleration efficiency, especially when combined with varying field-line geometry...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} field in accelerator magnets decays {{when the current}} is kept constant during the <b>particles</b> <b>injection</b> phase, and returns quickly (snaps back) to the original values as soon as ramping is restarted. Here we show results of measurements of the decay of the field errors in 10 m long LHC model dipole magnets. In accordance with previous findings, precycles and stops at intermediate current levels influence the decay. We discuss a possible mechanism causing the decay and snap-back, based on the internal field change in the cable...|$|R

Similar spectral changes were observed in both locations. In both cases, the spectra became harder with injection. Postinjection, the flux decreased exponentially with radial distance. The gradients observed for all ion species were very similar...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the ring current for the September 4 - 7, 1984 storm is studied with data from the Medium Energy Particle Analyzer on the AMPTE/CCE spacecraft. From an examination of particle pressures and current densities, {{it is found that}} the leading and trailing edges of <b>particle</b> <b>injections</b> are associated with depressions and enhancements of westward current densities, respectively. Based on the ion composition measurements which cover the bulk of the ring current population, the contribution of the O(+) ions to the westward ring current density is estimated to be no more than about 25 percent for this magnetic storm...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the importance of dissipation in the pulsar magnetosphere we decided to combine Force-Free with Aristotelian Electrodynamics. We obtain solutions that are ideal (non-dissipative) everywhere except in an equatorial current sheet where Poynting flux from both hemispheres converges and is dissipated into particle acceleration and radiation. We find significant dissipative losses (up to about 50 % of the pulsar spindown luminosity), similar to what is found in global PIC simulations in which particles are provided only on the stellar surface. We conclude that there might indeed exist two types of pulsars, strongly dissipative ones with <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> only from the stellar surface, and ideal (weakly dissipative) ones with <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> in the outer magnetosphere and in particular at the Y-point.

40|$|We {{report a}} superposed epoch {{analysis}} of the hemispheric open magnetic flux, maximum nightside auroral intensity, geomagnetic activity, and solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions {{around the time of}} substorm onset for three distinct categories of substorms defined by their energetic <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> signatures. Substorms identified from global auroral imagery are classified into one of three categories based on their energetic <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> signatures as seen at geosynchronous orbit by the Los Alamos National Laboratory spacecraft. Category 1 events are associated with a "classic" substorm injection, category 2 events show varied activity (i. e., energetic enhancements not following the evolution expected for classic substorms), and category 3 events show no apparent injection activity. The superposed epoch analysis reveals that the three distinct <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> categories exhibit distinct differences in the level and continuity of magnetospheric driving by the solar wind, such that category 1 events can be described as classic substorm events, category 2 as continuously driven events, and category 3 as weak events. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the level and continuity of the dayside solar wind driving of the magnetosphere during substorms have a direct impact on the injection of energetic particles to geosynchronous orbit at substorm onset. These results could have considerable value in empirical predictions of the space weather environment...|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} the figure that the {{injection}} pressure is nearly the same at the water and polymer flooding stage for the three injection methods. However, the injection pressure starts to show a great difference at the sequent water flooding stage for the three injection methods. The breakthrough pressure of sequent water flooding after cross-linking agent injection is relatively low and finally maintains a stable low pressure. The breakthrough of sequent water flooding after gel <b>particles</b> <b>injection</b> increases and shows some fluctuation. The breakthrough pressure of sequent water flooding after binary system injection is high. Both the fluctuation range and fluctuation extent are higher than single injection situation.|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the natural}} analogs of {{proposed}} seeding experiments in the magnetosphere are: electric charged <b>particle</b> <b>injections</b> during substorms; lightning-induced whistlers providing wave injections; 'detachment' of plasma from the plasmapause, which is equivalent to light-ion seeding in the outer magnetosphere. In the present paper, the characteristics of some natural precedents to active experiments are reviewed, and their relative advantages and drawbacks are examined. One of these precedents - wave generation in detached plasma regions - is then discussed in some detail; the discussion reveals the generation of ELF electromagnetic noise when the energetic electrons exceed the stably trapped limit, and also indicates that a critical dimension for the seeded volume exists transverse to the geomagnetic field...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We present {{simultaneous}} riometer {{observations of}} cosmic noise absorption in the nightside and dawn-noon sectors during sawtooth <b>particle</b> <b>injections</b> during 18 April 2002. Energetic electron precipitation (> 30 keV) is {{a feature of}} magnetospheric substorms and cosmic radio noise absorption acts {{as a proxy for}} qualitatively measuring this precipitation. This event provides an opportunity to compare the absorption that accompanies periodic electron injections with the accepted paradigm of substorm-related absorption. We consider whether the absorption is consistent with the premise that these injections are quasi-periodic substorms and study the effects of sustained activity on the level of precipitation. Four consecutive electron injection events have been identified from the LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) geosynchronous data; the first two showing that additiona...|$|R
40|$|A {{relation}} between two exponents characterizing the scaling behavior of random agglomeration models with <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> is proposed and verified by numerical simulations.

40|$|A {{macroscopic}} 'self-consistent' nonlinear two-fluid {{model is}} developed for energetic-particle-modeled shocks. The model incorporates particle exchange between a thermal gas and an energetic population via a 'thermal leakage' mechanism. In the model, injection {{is regarded as}} a process whereby particles in the cooler thermal core of a total particle distribution are energized sufficiently to cross a 'momentum boundary' into the wings of the distribution. Particles in the wings are identified as 'energetic particles' or 'cosmic rays' and are assumed to propagate according to the diffusive transport equation of cosmic ray theory. Thermal particles are energized either as a result of adiabatic compression in a decelerating flow or directly via anomalous heating within a subshock. It is shown that the nature and model of <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> directly affects the nature and dynamics of the shock, and hence the efficiency of particle acceleration, and that the shock itself regulates <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> dynamically...|$|E
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} hybrid particle code is used {{to study}} the interactions between upflowing thermal ions from conjugate ionospheres. The simulation model allows for multiple species, convection of plasmaspheric flux tubes, and Coulomb self-collisions which conserve momentum and energy locally. The model incorporates a variable-flux boundary condition where the flux, at the boundaries, approaches zero as the plasmasphere fills and equilibrium conditions are reached. The effects of two important processes on plasmaspheric refilling have been considered. The first includes convection of the plasmaspheric flux tube. The second is the interaction of ionospheric thermal plasma and <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> from an external source. <b>Particle</b> <b>injection</b> seems {{to play an important}} role in the evolution of the total particle distribution on the early timescales (t less than 1 hour); however, for late timescales (t larger than 8 days) the thermal plasma from the ionosphere dominates the particle distribution...|$|E

The fault isolation, error recovery and error logging {{capabilities of the}} POWER 6 enabled measurement of the architectural derating factors. The proportion of errors as well as derating factors matched well between the simulated and <b>particle</b> beam <b>injection</b> cases. The simulated and particle beam induced fault injection methods are compared and contrasted.

40|$|Recent {{magnetohydrodynamic}} simulations {{demonstrate that}} a global tail instability, initiated by localized breakdown of MHD, can cause plasmoid formation and ejection {{as well as}} dipolarization and the current diversion of the substorm current wedge. The connection between the reconnection process and the current wedge signatures is provided by earthward flow from the reconnection site. Its braking and diversion in the inner magnetosphere causes dipolarization and the magnetic field distortions of the current wedge. The authors demonstrate the characteristic properties of this process and the current systems involved. The strong localized electric field associated with the flow burst and the dipolarization is also the cause of particle acceleration and energetic <b>particle</b> <b>injections.</b> Test <b>particle</b> simulations of orbits in the MHD fields yield results that are quite consistent with observed injection signatures...|$|R

The turbulent heat and mass exchange in the melt is calculated using a 3 D electromagnetic (EM) model and a 3 D transient Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach. Low frequency oscillations of the temperature maximum and {{its position in the}} ICF channel are considered. Melt flow patterns in characteristic cross-sections of the channel are presented. Oscillations of instantaneous velocity in near wall region between two oppositely directed time-averaged melt vortices are obtained and qualitative distributions of turbulent kinetic energy for re-circulated flows in different MHD devices are compared. Lagrangian particles tracks and particles clouds distributions after <b>particles</b> <b>injection</b> in ICF bath and channel are considered. 1...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{machining}} {{and milling}} of metallic alloys and ceramics have been previously {{carried out by}} either direct vaporisation or assist gas ejection of laser-melted materials. For certain metallic materials, due to the high viscosity of the materials in the molten state, {{it is difficult to}} achieve a clean cut. Recast and heat affected zones are normally formed. This paper reports a hybrid process combining a grit blasting and laser melting for the milling and grooving of stainless steel, mild steel and titanium alloys. The work shows that up to 100 increase in material removal rate and 15 reduction in the heat affected zone size can be achieved compared with a gas jet assisted laser machining process under the same operating conditions. Surface roughness has been reduced by 60. The effect of <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> angle, direction on material removal rate is presented. A critical <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> angle is established...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} particle release {{time from the}} sources to the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum below 10 ^ 15 eV in the Galaxy are studied in detail. We discuss different possible forms of <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> like the burst-like injection, continuous injection for a finite time, injection from a stationary source and energy dependent injection. When applied to the nearby known supernova remnants, {{it is found that}} the observed CR anisotropy data favours the burst-like <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> model for the CR diffusion coefficient D(E) ∝ E^a with a= 0. 3 - 0. 6 in the local region. The study has also found that the contribution of the sources, G 114. 3 + 0. 3 and Monogem, dominate if the observed anisotropy is due to the effect of the nearby sources. Further study shows that the contribution of the undetected old sources to the local CR anisotropy cannot be neglected...|$|E
40|$|The {{comparatively}} well-ordered magnetic {{structure in}} the solar corona during the decline of Solar Cycle 20 revealed a characteristic dependence of solar energetic <b>particle</b> <b>injection</b> upon heliographic longitude. When analyzed using solar wind mapping of the large scale interplanetary magnetic field line connection from the corona to the Earth, particle fluxes display an approximately exponential dependence on heliographic longitude. Since variations in the solar wind velocity (and hence the coronal connection longitude) can severely distort the simple coronal injection profile, the use of real-time solar wind velocity measurements can be of great aid in predicting the decay of solar particle events. Although such exponential injection profiles are commonplace during 1973 - 1975, they have also been identified earlier in Solar Cycle 20, and hence this structure may be present during the rise and maximum of the cycle, but somewhat obscured by greater temporal variations in <b>particle</b> <b>injection...</b>|$|E

Based on the mechanical testing results and fractographic evidence presented in this work, several observations and conclusions about the influence of impurity particles on short and long term mechanical properties in short fibre reinforced thermoplastics may be noted.

40|$|Using a year's {{worth of}} {{geosynchronous}} spacecraft data, the substorm associated {{behavior of the}} thermal plasma in the plasma sheet in relation to energetic <b>particle</b> <b>injections</b> is reviewed. Five classes of injection events were found: ion injections without accompanying electron injection at 21 local time (LT); ion injection followed {{a few minutes later}} by an electron injection at 22 LT; simultaneous ion and electron injection close to midnight; electron injections followed by an ion injection at 01 LT; and pure electron injections at 02 LT. The thermal electrons show a significant increase in temperature and pressure at substorm onset, while the density and thermal ion signatures are typically weak. Energetic ions are found to contribute to the total ion pressure and temperature.
