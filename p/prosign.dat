5000|$|Morse code {{abbreviations}} {{are used}} to speed up Morse communications by foreshortening textual words and phrases. Morse abbreviations are short forms representing normal textual words and phrases formed from some (fewer) characters borrowed from the words or phrases being abbreviated. Aside: Morse code abbreviations {{are not the same}} as the so-called <b>Prosigns</b> for Morse code. Morse abbreviations are composed of (normal) textual alpha-numeric character symbols with normal Morse code inter-character spacing; the character symbols in abbreviations, unlike the delineated character groups representing Morse code <b>prosigns,</b> are not [...] "run together" [...] or concatenated in the way most <b>prosigns</b> for Morse code are formed.|$|R

2500|$|Each Morse {{code symbol}} {{represents}} either a text character (letter or numeral) or a <b>prosign</b> and {{is represented by}} a unique sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash {{is followed by a}} short silence, equal to the dot duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots (one dash), and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots. To increase the speed of the communication, the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse is approximately inverse to its frequency of occurrence in English. Thus the most common letter in English, the letter [...] "E", has the shortest code, a single dot.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} decades of {{telegraphy}} many operating efficiency improvements, such as the introduction of Morse symbols known as procedure signs or <b>prosigns,</b> were incorporated into the telegraph operations. <b>Prosigns</b> were not defined by the inventors of Morse code, but were gradually introduced over time and greatly improved the speed and performance of daily high volume telegraph message handling operations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} Table lists twelve unique Morse <b>prosigns</b> and two useful Morse code abbreviations, ordered alphabetically.|$|R
50|$|When Morse code {{is written}} out as text, overlines {{are used to}} {{distinguish}} <b>prosigns</b> and other concatenated character groups from strings of individual characters.|$|R
5000|$|Aside: Note that in Morse code {{there is}} no dot dash {{sequence}} defined for the mathematical equal sign and so in fact equal signs are never transmitted by Morse code operators. Usually the word [...] "EQUALS" [...] would be sent in lieu of an actual mathematical equal sign. That said however, in the following example of a casual Morse code conversation between two station operators, the mathematical symbol, the equal sign [...] "=", {{is shown in the}} following paragraphs in the illustrated Morse data streams. This equal sign convention is only used here in this Wikipedia article to represent the actual Morse <b>prosign</b> [...] often verbalized as [...] "dahdidididah". This Morse code <b>prosign</b> essentially indicates a new paragraph in the text. This use of the mathematical symbol [...] "=" [...] to represent the new paragraph Morse <b>prosign</b> [...] is only ever encountered by operators who may be copying Morse code using certain single or dual line display electronic automatic Morse code readers. Normally when copying Morse code manually by handwriting or typewriting the equal sign [...] "=" [...] representation of the Morse <b>prosign</b> [...] shown here is never actually written down by Morse operators who copy manually. Instead of writing or typing an equal sign, or writing some other representation of the <b>prosign</b> , a receiving Morse operator who is copying manually merely creates a new paragraph in the recorded text upon reception of the <b>prosign.</b> This new paragraph copying convention is illustrated in the following example conversation. When copying mentally instead of manually writing text on paper or to a computer file, the receiving operator copying mentally will merely use the time taken by the [...] <b>prosign</b> for either a mental pause, or to jot down for later reference a short word or phrase from the information being sent.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{hearing the}} {{break-in}} signal between the dots and dashes being sent, the interrupted station stops sending immediately and either: (a) just pauses momentarily or, (b) sends a single letter K <b>prosign</b> (...) meaning [...] "go ahead" [...] and pauses momentarily, thus {{turning over the}} channel to the interrupter, and subsequently listens for the other station during the momentary pause. Highly skilled fluent telegraphists seldom bother to send the K <b>prosign</b> when interrupted instead simply letting the interrupter take over the channel during the pause.|$|E
5000|$|Prosigns may be {{represented}} in printed material either by a sequence of dots and dashes, or by a sequence of letters, which, if sent without the normal inter-character spacing (concatenated), correspond to the <b>prosign</b> symbol.|$|E
25|$|The {{syllabus}} {{includes the}} following Morse code characters: all alphabets, numbers, <b>prosigns,</b> and punctuations such as the full-stop; comma; semi-colon; break sign; hyphen and question mark.|$|R
25|$|<b>Prosigns</b> for Morse code {{are special}} (usually) unwritten {{procedural}} signals or symbols {{that are used}} to indicate changes in communications protocol status or white space text formatting actions.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} example of a typical casual Morse code conversation between two stations there is extensive use of such: Morse code abbreviations, brevity codes, Morse <b>prosigns</b> and other such conventions.|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} {{application is}} signalling for help through SOS, [...] "". This {{can be sent}} many ways: keying a radio on and off, flashing a mirror, toggling a flashlight, and similar methods. SOS is not three separate characters, rather, it is a <b>prosign</b> SOS, and is keyed without gaps between characters.|$|E
5000|$|In earlier {{communications}} methods, an end {{of message}} ("EOM") sequence of characters indicated to a receiving device or operator that the current message has ended. In teleprinter systems, the sequence [...] "NNNN", on a line by itself, is {{an end of}} message indicator. In several Morse code conventions, including amateur radio, the <b>prosign</b> AR (dit dah dit dah dit) means end of message.|$|E
5000|$|The {{representation}} of the & sign given above, often shown as AS, is also the Morse <b>prosign</b> for wait. In addition, the American landline {{representation of}} an ampersand was similar to [...] "ES" [...] (...) and hams have carried over this usage as a synonym for [...] "and" [...] (WX HR COLD ES RAINY, [...] "the weather here is cold & rainy").|$|E
50|$|Procedure {{words or}} {{prowords}} are words or phrases limited to radio telephone procedure used to facilitate communication by conveying {{information in a}} condensed standard verbal format. Prowords {{are similar to the}} much older <b>prosigns</b> for Morse code first developed in the 1860s for Morse telegraphy.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to knowing, understanding, {{and being able}} to copy the standard written alpha-numeric and punctuation characters or symbols at high speeds, skilled high speed operators must also be fully knowledgeable of all of the special unwritten Morse code symbols for the standard <b>Prosigns</b> for Morse code and the meanings of these special procedural signals in standard Morse code communications protocol.|$|R
50|$|Q {{code and}} <b>prosigns</b> for Morse code {{are used in}} amateur radio, {{aviation}} and marine radio. They provide specific abbreviations for concepts related to aviation, shipping, RTTY, radiotelegraph and amateur radio. In radiotelegraph operation, a Q code is often shorter (as ten-codes require transmission of three prefix characters: 1, 0, hyphen) and provides standardization of codes, essential in international and shortwave communications.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distress}} signal SOS (with the overbar indicating {{that it is}} a <b>prosign,</b> sent as a single Morse character) is often believed to be an abbreviation for [...] "Save Our Ship" [...] or [...] "Save Our Souls". In fact, it was chosen because it has a simple and unmistakable Morse code representation three dots, three dashes, three dots, all sent without any pauses between characters.|$|E
50|$|Receiving {{stations}} {{wishing to}} break-in on semi break-in stations must {{wait for the}} longer silent periods between the sending stations words or sentences before attempting to interrupt or break-in. At worst, receiving stations must wait until semi break-in stations explicitly turn over the channel to the receiving station by sending a break <b>prosign.</b> Unlike full break-in operation, semi break-in operation is not fast enough to provide a fluid Morse code conversational capability approximating that of normal human voice conversation.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1800s, {{long before}} the advent of {{teleprinters}} and teletype machines, Morse code operators or telegraphists invented and used Morse code prosigns to encode white space text formatting in formal written text messages. In particular the Morse <b>prosign</b> represented by the concatenation of two literal textual Morse code [...] "A" [...] characters sent without the normal inter-character spacing is used in Morse code to encode and indicate a new line in a formal text message.|$|E
25|$|Also {{included}} in the syllabus are Q codes such as QRA, QRG, QRH, QRI, QRK, QRL, QRM, QRN, QRQ, QRS, QRT, QRU, QRV, QRW, QRX, QRZ, QSA, QSB, QSL, QSO, QSU, QSV, QSW, QSX, QSY, QSZ, QTC, QTH, QTR, and QUM; and CW abbreviations and <b>prosigns</b> such as AA, AB, AR, AS, C, CFM, CL, CQ, DE, K, NIL, OK, R, TU, VA, WA, and WB.|$|R
5000|$|OTHER PUNCTUATION is {{spelled out}} (in {{order to avoid}} {{confusion}} with <b>prosigns</b> used in the transmission of the message) as in [...] "QUERY" [...] for a question, [...] "DASH" [...] to separate special number or mixed groups, [...] "EXCLAMATION", [...] "COMMA", etc. (Hyphens are NOT used in telephone number groups {{or anywhere else in}} the text.) Such punctuation words are separate groups and ARE counted for the check.|$|R
5000|$|For example, the Morse code dot/dash {{sequence}} (...) {{which indicates}} the action of spacing down two lines on a page {{in order to create}} the white space indicating {{the start of a new}} paragraph. Other than the two line white spaces themselves, there is no actual written or printed character representation or symbol for a new paragraph. Thus, in general, typical Morse code <b>prosigns</b> do not have written or printed textual character representations in the original source information.|$|R
5000|$|Morse {{code was}} used as an {{international}} standard for maritime distress until 1999 when it was replaced by the Global Maritime Distress Safety System. When the French Navy ceased using Morse code on January 31, 1997, the final message transmitted was [...] "Calling all. This is our last cry before our eternal silence." [...] In the United States the final commercial Morse code transmission was on July 12, 1999, signing off with Samuel Morse's original 1844 message, [...] "", and the <b>prosign</b> [...] "SK".|$|E
5000|$|Improvements to the {{legibility}} {{of formal}} written telegraph messages (telegrams) {{by means of}} white space formatting were thus supported by {{the creation of the}} additional new procedure symbols. With one exception, namely the Morse symbol for the alphabetic letter [...] "K" [...] (...) , which also serves as a <b>prosign</b> when used alone {{at the end of a}} transmission, the remaining Morse code prosigns are unique dot/dash sequence code symbols. Mastery of these special Morse code prosigns is an important part of becoming a fluent and efficient telegrapher/telegraphist.|$|E
5000|$|Morse code prosigns or {{procedural}} {{signals are}} dot/dash sequence symbols {{that do not}} represent written characters, but instead are used to manage transmission and formatting of messages. [...] Prosigns are symbols, that have specific functions, such as: indicating changes of transmission communications protocol status, and indicating (or initiating) textual white space formatting. Morse prosigns play a role similar to {{the role played by}} the nonprinting control characters of teleprinter and computer character set codes such as Baudot or ASCII. Morse code <b>prosign</b> symbols have been used since the 1860s.|$|E
50|$|To make Morse code {{communications}} {{faster and}} more efficient, there are many internationally agreed patterns or conventions of communication which include: extensive use of abbreviations, use of brevity codes such as the RST code, Q code, Z code {{as well as the}} use of Morse <b>prosigns.</b> The skills required to have efficient fast conversations with Morse comprise more than simply knowing the Morse code symbols for the alphabet and numerals. Skilled telegraphists must also know many traditional International Morse code communications conventions.|$|R
500|$|Also by 1867, {{codes for}} Q (...) and Z (...) {{were added to}} the one-needle code, but not, apparently, for J. [...] However, codes for Q (...) , Z (...) , and J (...) are marked on the plates of later needle telegraphs, {{together}} with six-unit codes for number shift (...) and letter shift (...) [...] [...] Numerous compound codes were added for operator controls such as wait and repeat. [...] These compounds are similar to the <b>prosigns</b> found in Morse code where the two characters are run together without a character gap. [...] The two-needle number shift and letter shift codes are also compounds, which is the reason they have been written with an overbar.|$|R
50|$|Rag chewer {{is a name}} {{applied to}} amateur radio Morse code {{operators}} who engage in informal Morse code conversations (known as chewing the rag) while discussing subjects such as: the weather, their location, signal quality, and their equipment. Meaningful rag chewing between fluent Morse code operators having different native languages is possible because of a common Lingua Franca provided by: the <b>prosigns</b> for Morse code, the International Q code, Z code, RST code, the telegraph era Phillips Code and many well known Morse code abbreviations as discussed in this Wikipedia article. Together all of these traditional conventions serve as a somewhat cryptic but commonly understood language (Lingua Franca) within the world-wide community of amateur radio Morse code operators.|$|R
