During four trials (n= 150 samples), Listeria spp. were selected by using two enrichments (University of Vermont-modified I and II) and plating to selective Palcam agar base. A multiplex polymerase chain (PCR) reaction was used to confirm Listeria isolations. The specificity of the multiplex PCR assay was evaluated with reference strains of Listeria from the National Animal Disease Center (NADC) Culture Collection. The Listeria spp. yields a single 938 -bp product, whereas L. monocytogenes yields the 938 -bp product along with a 174 -bp fragment. Results from trials I-IV indicated L. monocytogenes could not be detected by PCR in the UVM enrichment due perhaps to PCR inhibitors present in <b>poultry</b> <b>fats</b> and muscle myoglobin. The multiplex PCR performed from suspect colonies grown on Palcam, however, indicated 29 out of 150 (19 %) of the MST meat harbored Listeria spp. Fifty-seven of 150 (38 %) were confirmed positive for L. monocytogenes.

Furthermore, tallow derived from beef or mutton would have been uneconomical, particularly given that virtually all suet (the raw material for tallow) is chelev and its consumption is forbidden.

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question: What will most likely happen in terms of emitted greenhouse gases if the use of <b>poultry</b> <b>fat</b> for making biodiesel used in transportation is increased? Through a well-to-wheel assessment, several different possible scenarios are assessed, showing that under average conditions, the use of <b>poultry</b> <b>fat</b> biodiesel instead of diesel leads to a slight reduction (6 %) in greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis shows that <b>poultry</b> <b>fat</b> is already used for different purposes and using <b>poultry</b> <b>fat</b> for biodiesel will therefore remove the <b>poultry</b> <b>fat</b> from its original use. This implies {{that even though the}} use of biodiesel is assumed to displace petrochemical diesel, the ‘original user ’ of the <b>poultry</b> <b>fat</b> will have to find a substitute, whose production leads to a greenhouse gas emissions comparable to what is saved through driving on <b>poultry</b> <b>fat</b> biodiesel rather than petrochemical diesel.

Feeding efficiency is reflected on the birds’ performance and its products. According to National Research Council (1994), poultry required at least 38% components in their feed. The ration of each feed components, although differ for each different stage of birds, must include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals and vitamins. Carbohydrates which is usually supply by grains including corn, wheat, barley, etc. serve as major energy source in <b>poultry</b> feeds. <b>Fats</b> usually from tallow, lard or vegetables oil are essentially required to provide important fatty acid in poultry feed for membrane integrity and hormone synthesis. Proteins are important to supply the essential amino acids for the development of body tissues like muscles, nerves, cartilage, etc. Meals from soybean, canola, and corn gluten are the major source of plant protein in poultry diets. Supplementations of minerals are often required because grains, which is the main components of commercial feed contain very little amount of those. Calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, magnesium, potassium, and sodium are required in larger amounts by poultry. Vitamins, such as vitamin A, B, C, D, E, and K on the other hand are the component that required in lower amount by poultry animals.|$|R

Two experiments were carried out using one-day-old male Cobb chicks in an entirely random design with a 2 x 2 factorial scheme. In the first experiment, 560 chicks were used to evaluate performance and carcass characteristics. In the second experiment, 100 chicks {{were used to determine}} the nutrient digestibility, dietary energy utilization and the lipase and amylase pancreatic activity. There was no interaction between the fat sources and the addition levels for any of the analyzed variables, except for the digestibility coefficient of dry matter (DCDM), which was higher in diets added with 2 % soybean oil when compared to chicken tallow. The addition of 4 % fat in the diet, regardless of fat source, improved the digestibility coefficient of ethereal extract (DCEE) and increased weight gain and feed intake. Moreover, in the initial phase, the addition of 4 % fat to the diet increased lipase activity when compared to diets with 2 % addition, and a positive correlation between DCEE and pancreatic lipase activity was observed. In conclusion, there is no interaction between fat sources and addition levels, except for DCDM. Carcass characteristics are not influenced by any of the studied factors. The addition of 4 % fat increases pancreatic lipase activity and improves DCEE, resulting in greater weight gain, regardless of the tested fat source, making chicken tallow a great alternative to soybean oil...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and assess nutrient intake levels {{for the purpose of}} improving MS risk factors. The {{participants in this study were}} 512 adults consisting of 271 men and 241 women aged 30 and over, who visited a public health center for a medical check up. The diagnosis of MS subjects was adapted from the NCEP-ATP guidelines and the WHO Asia-Pacific Area criteria for obesity. The MS group was defined as subjects displaying three or more risk factors, and the non MS group was defined as those displaying two or less risk factors. A dietary survey was conducted using the 24 -hour recall method. The number of subjects displaying MS syndrome factors was 158 (30. 9 %), broken down into, 89 men and 69 women. Regarding risk factors in the MS group, the prevalence of waist circumference was 40. 5 %, hypertension 34. 2 %, hyperglycemia 31. 0 %, low HDL-cholesterol 24. 7 %, and hypertriglycemia 19. 6 %. BMI, sistolic blood pressure, blood glocose, blood triglyceride, and blood HCL-cholesterol of the MS group were significantly higher compared to the non MS group. Male subjects in the MS group reported high intakes of cereals, sugar, fruits, meat and <b>poultry,</b> oil and <b>fats,</b> and beverages and total food intake was significantly higher compared to the non MS group. Women in the MS group reported high intakes of meat and poultry, milk and dairy products, beverages, and seasonings, and total food intake was higher compared to the non MS group...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not offer}} the idea as a {{contribution}} to statistics, {{but it seems to}} me that the most active branch of industry in Venice is plucking fowls. In summer the people all work on their thresholds, and in their windows, and as nearly out of doors as the narrowness of the streets will let them,-- and it is hard to pass through any part of the city without coming to a poulterer's shop, in the door of which inevitably sits a boy, tugging at the plumage of some wretched bird. He is seldom to be seen except in that crisis of plucking when he seems to have all but finished; yet he seems never to accomplish the fact perfectly. Perhaps it is part of his hard fate that the feathers shall grow again under his hand as fast as he plucks them away: at the restaurants, I know, the quantity of plumage one devours in consuming roast chicken is surprising--at first. The birds are always very lean, too, and have but a languid and weary look, in spite of the ardent manner in which the boy clasps them while at work. It may be that the Venetians do not like <b>fat</b> <b>poultry.</b> Their turkeys, especially, are of that emaciation which is attributed among ourselves only to the turkey of Job; and as for the geese and ducks, they can only interest anatomists. It is as if the long ages of incursion and oppression which have impoverished and devastated Italy had at last taken effect upon the poultry, and made it as poor as the population.|$|R

A better understanding of the genes associated have been identified and studied in mammals that link with controlling feed intake and energy balance and how appetite and energy balance.
