40|$|Abstract. Small-angle neutron {{scattering}} (SANS) measurements of low concentration, single crystal Nb–D alloys {{have been performed}} to characterize the effect of deformation on deuteride phase formation. The SANS response from the deuteride phase formed at low temperature in the undeformed matrix was consistent with a spherical particle morphology, as expected from {{a large body of}} published TEM studies. In addition, a significant hysteresis was observed (1 T 100) in the SANS response versus temperature from the undeformed sample material. The hysteresis is attributed to the irreversible plastic deformation required to nucleate the incoherent phase. Deformation produced by unidirectional rolling to 50 % thickness reduction altered the deuteride phase transformation characteristics in a fundamental way. The SANS response was highly anisotropic, indicative of an oriented, anisometric particle morphology. Metallographic analysis of deformed specimens electropolished below the solvus temperature confirmed the presence of large deuteride plates with an orientation consistent with the anisotropic SANS response. Deformation also eliminated the temperature hysteresis observed in the undeformed material. A cellular dislocation substructure was found in TEM characterization of the deformed Nb single crystal material. The <b>plate-like</b> <b>particle</b> morphology in the deformed material is attributed to an interaction between the precipitating deuterium and the cellular dislocation substructure. The elimination of the temperature hysteresis is consistent with an interaction between the deuterium and regions of high dislocation density facilitating heterogeneous nucleation. 1...|$|E

Different dispersions were prepared with solids volume fractions between φ{symbol} = 0. 20 and φ{symbol} = 0. 47 {{in the presence}} of sodium silicate (between X s = 0. 075 mg dispersant/m 2 and X s = 0. 225 mg dispersant/m 2), to determine the electrokinetic and rheological properties. The Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, and Si concentrations, pH, and electrical conductivity of the solutions increased after dispersant addition, X s, and/or the solids volume fraction, φ{symbol}, was raised. Electrophoretic mobility, negative for all studied dispersions, became more negative after dispersant addition and less negative with increasing solids fraction. The dispersions with X s ≤ 0. 075 mg dispersant/m 2 displayed plastic behaviour (in the shear flow test) and exhibited the characteristics of a gel (in the oscillatory test), owing to the extensive aggregation of the kaolinite particles. The dispersions with X s ≥ 0. 105 mg dispersant/m 2 displayed shear-thinning behaviour (in the shear flow test) and viscoelastic fluid characteristics (in the oscillatory test). This behaviour is typical of dense dispersions of plate-shaped colloidal particles, which are well stabilised by electrostatic repulsion. The rheological properties of well-stabilised dispersions were analysed and readily interpreted by redefining the kaolin platelets as new effective hard particles, the thickness of the <b>plate-like</b> <b>particle</b> with its ionic double layer being considered as effective thickness. This enabled an effective volume fraction to be calculated that describes the combined effect of the solids volume fraction and the dispersant addition on dispersion rheological properties. The study showed that excluded volume interactions are essential to understanding the effect of ionic strength on the rheological properties of well-stabilised highly concentrated dispersions. © 2010 Elsevier B.

The ball mill process to make the <b>plate-like</b> <b>particles</b> is called a solid-state powder processing technique which involves repeated welding, fracturing and re-welding of powder particles in a high-energy ball mill.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we aim to}} provide a many-sided answer to the question: what are the {{consequences}} of plate-like colloidal shape on a suspensions' physical properties? A central role in this investigation is played by the experimental model system of platelets which, building on the Van 't Hoff Laboratory's rich tradition with respect to synthesizing colloidal model systems, was developed for this purpose. Consisting of fairly monodisperse sterically stabilised gibbsite platelets, this system allows us to focus on the effect of <b>plate-like</b> <b>particle</b> shape while keeping the shape, size and interactions well-defined. In part I, we consider the dynamical properties of dilute suspensions. This yields the first results for the viscosity, sedimentation, and diffusion behaviour of such a platelet suspension {{as a function of the}} volume fraction. It will be interesting to see whether these experiments will inspire theoretical efforts towards calculating the f-coefficients in the viscosity, sedimentation, and diffusion, for which no predictions are yet available. In part II, we show that these suspensions of approximately hard platelets exhibit an isotropic to nematic phase transition. While being predicted by the Onsager theory and computer simulations, this observation clearly contrasts with the ubiquitous (but poorly understood) gel formation in suspensions of clay platelets. Furthermore, increasing the platelets' polydispersity leads to a broadening of the I-N coexistence region and the appearance of pronounced fractionation. We demonstrate that a remarkable feature of the observed I-N transition in these more polydisperse systems -where the nematic phase becomes the upper phase- can be explained on the basis of strong fractionation with respect to platelet thickness. Moreover, at high particle densities, the suspensions exhibit a nematic to columnar phase transition. Although predicted by simulations for monodisperse platelets, the stability of a columnar phase in suspensions with up to 25...|$|E
30|$|Two {{dimensional}} (2 D) semiconductor nanocrystals fabricated in the plate-like form {{have been}} intensely investigated since {{the invention of}} single-layer graphene. The majority of binary compounds among them are either metal dichalcogenides (of molybdenum, vanadium, tungsten) or indium and gallium monochalcogenides. Gallium selenide with chemically passive selenium-terminated (11 – 20) surfaces has been applied as effective optical material for IR[1, 2] and terahertz[3, 4] ranges, termination layers in heterointerface fabrication[5 – 7], etc. Unique structure properties stand GaSe among materials suitable for production single layer 2 D plates, even extracted and isolated from bulk. Although several groups have already succeeded in mechanical-[8, 9], thermal-, and laser-induced[10] GaSe exfoliation, fabrication of free single sheet particles {{was found to be}} not an easy task. The properties of those GaSe foils are essentially substrate-dependent in the mechanical procedures, while higher temperature growth is accompanied by rolling of the sheets into more thermodynamically favorable[11] tubular 3 D structures. Other successful attempts resulted in synthesis of colloidal single-layered nanoparticles in organic solutions[12 – 14] further underwent self-organization into more complicated structures[13, 14] and fabricated by aqueous- or alcohol-based ultrasonification of GaSe powders[15, 16]. The main problem in the application of such objects is synthesis and stabilization chemistry to be rather nonreproducible and hardly to be controlled as a rule. That usually results in unwanted electronic processes on surface-passivator boundaries and requires of the strongly binding ligands, preferably unreactive in respect to the ambient. Recent perspective[17] indicates that 2 D plate-like nanoparticles (including those of GaSe) are excellent luminescent emitters due to the suppression of the absorption strengths into one electronic state in contrary to the band for a bulk material. Not long ago, we found that the mutual interaction of components in the hybrid composites containing GaSe and conducting polyaniline (PANI) polymer leads to an increased essential conductivity, UV shifting in GaSe luminescence spectra, <b>plate-like</b> <b>particle</b> formation, etc.[18].

40|$|Mg-substituted {{hydroxyapatite}} {{made up of}} needle-like and <b>plate-like</b> <b>particles</b> containing different {{amounts of}} Mg (between 0. 21 wt% and 2. 11 wt%) were prepared via wet chemical precipitation method of a homogenous suspension of Mg(OH) 2 /Ca(OH) 2 and an aqueous solution of H 3 PO 4. According to the data of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method and field emission scanning electron microscopy, high specific surface area Mg-substituted hydroxyapatite was obtained. Specific surface area of as-synthesized powders increased from 94. 9 m 2 g− 1 to 104. 3 m 2 g− 1 with increasing concentration of Mg up to 0. 64 wt%. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, differential thermal analysis, and heating microscopy, were used to evaluate thermal stability and sintering behavior of synthesis products. Increase in concentration of Mg in synthesis products (≥ 0. 83 wt%) promoted decomposition of Mg-substituted hydroxyapatite to Mg-substituted β-tricalcium phosphate after thermal treatment...|$|R
