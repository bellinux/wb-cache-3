50|$|DNA is {{read in the}} 3' → 5' direction, therefore, {{nucleotides}} are synthesized (or {{attached to}} the template strand) in the 5' → 3' direction. However, one of the <b>parent</b> <b>strands</b> of DNA is 3' → 5' while the other is 5' → 3'. To solve this, replication occurs in opposite directions. Heading towards the replication fork, the leading strand is synthesized in a continuous fashion, only requiring one primer. On the other hand, the lagging strand, heading away from the replication fork, is synthesized {{in a series of}} short fragments known as Okazaki fragments, consequently requiring many primers. The RNA primers of Okazaki fragments are subsequently degraded by RNase H and DNA Polymerase I (exonuclease), and the gaps (or nicks) are filled with deoxyribonucleotides and sealed by the enzyme ligase.|$|R
25|$|By {{firing of}} {{replication}} origins, controlled spatially and temporally, {{the formation of}} replication foci is regulated. D. A. Jackson et al.(1998) revealed that neighboring origins fire simultaneously in mammalian cells. Spatial juxtaposition of replication sites brings clustering of replication forks. The clustering do rescue of stalled replication forks and favors normal progress of replication forks. Progress of replication forks is inhibited by many factors; collision with proteins or with complexes binding strongly on DNA, deficiency of dNTPs, nicks on template DNAs and so on. If replication forks stall and the remaining sequences from the stalled forks are not replicated, the daughter strands have nick obtained un-replicated sites. The un-replicated sites on one <b>parent's</b> <b>strand</b> hold the other strand together but not daughter strands. Therefore, the resulting sister chromatids cannot separate {{from each other and}} cannot divide into 2 daughter cells. When neighboring origins fire and a fork from one origin is stalled, fork from other origin access on an opposite direction of the stalled fork and duplicate the un-replicated sites. As other mechanism of the rescue there is application of dormant replication origins that excess origins don't fire in normal DNA replication.|$|R

40|$|Asymmetric strand {{segregation}} {{has been}} proposed as a mechanism to minimize effective mutation rates in epithelial tissues. Under asymmetric strand segregation, the double-stranded molecule that contains the oldest DNA strand is preferentially targeted to the somatic stem cell after each round of DNA replication. This oldest DNA strand {{is expected to have}} fewer errors than younger strands because some of the errors that arise on daughter strands during their synthesis fail to be repaired. Empirical findings suggest the possibility of asymmetric strand segregation in a subset of mammalian cell lineages, indicating that it may indeed function to increase genetic fidelity. However, the implications of asymmetric strand segregation for the fidelity of epigenetic information remain unexplored. Here, I explore the impact of strand-segregation dynamics on epigenetic fidelity using a mathematical-modelling approach that draws on the known molecular mechanisms of DNA methylation and existing rate estimates from empirical methylation data. I find that, {{for a wide range of}} starting methylation densities, asymmetric [...] but not symmetric [...] strand segregation leads to systematic increases in methylation levels if <b>parent</b> <b>strands</b> are subject to de novo methylation events.

Their double-helix model had two strands of DNA with the nucleotides pointing inward, each matching a complementary nucleotide on the other strand to form what look like rungs on a twisted ladder. This structure showed that genetic information exists in the sequence of nucleotides on each strand of DNA. The structure also suggested a simple method for replication: if the strands are separated, new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based on the sequence of the old strand. This property is what gives DNA its semi-conservative nature where one strand of new DNA is from an original <b>parent</b> <b>strand.</b>|$|E
50|$|CpG islands {{typically}} {{occur at}} or near the transcription start site of genes, particularly housekeeping genes, in vertebrates. A C (cytosine) base followed immediately by a G (guanine) base (a CpG) is rare in vertebrate DNA because the cytosines in such an arrangement tend to be methylated. This methylation helps distinguish the newly synthesized DNA strand from the <b>parent</b> <b>strand,</b> which aids {{in the final stages of}} DNA proofreading after duplication. However, over time methylated cytosines tend to turn into thymines because of spontaneous deamination. There is a special enzyme in humans (Thymine-DNA glycosylase, or TDG) that specifically replaces T's from T/G mismatches. However, due to the rarity of CpGs, it is theorised to be insufficiently effective in preventing a possibly rapid mutation of the dinucleotides. The existence of CpG islands is usually explained by the existence of selective forces for relatively high CpG content, or low levels of methylation in that genomic area, perhaps having to do with the regulation of gene expression. Recently a study showed that most CpG islands are a result of non-selective forces.|$|E

DNA methylation patterns are established during differentiation, and silence inappropriate or unnecessary genes by promoting a condensed chromatin configuration that is inaccessible to transcription factors. The methylation patterns are then replicated each time a cell divides by DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt 1). Dnmt 1 is upregulated during mitosis, binds the replication fork, and catalyzes transfer of the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to dC bases in the daughter DNA strand only where the <b>parent</b> <b>strand</b> is methylated. Environmental agents that block ERK pathway signaling prevent Dnmt 1 upregulation, and low Dnmt 1 levels synergize with dietary micronutrient deficiencies that decrease SAM pools to impair methylation of the daughter strand.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a point-mutation model describing the evolutionary dynamics {{of a population}} of adult stem cells. Such a model may prove useful for quantitative studies of tissue aging {{and the emergence of}} cancer. We consider two modes of chromosome segregation: (1) Random segregation, where the daughter chromosomes of a given parent chromosome segregate randomly into the stem cell and its differentiating sister cell. (2) "Immortal DNA strand" co-segregation, for which the stem cell retains the daughter chromosomes with the oldest <b>parent</b> <b>strands.</b> Immortal strand co-segregation is a mechanism, originally proposed by Cairns (J. Cairns, Nature 255, 197 (1975)), by which stem cells preserve the integrity of their genomes. For random segregation, we develop an ordered strand pair formulation of the dynamics, analogous to the ordered strand pair formalism developed for quasispecies dynamics involving semiconservative replication with imperfect lesion repair (in this context, lesion repair is taken to mean repair of postreplication base-pair mismatches). Interestingly, a similar formulation is possible with immortal strand co-segregation, despite the fact that this segregation mechanism is age-dependent. From our model we are able to mathematically show that, when lesion repair is imperfect, then immortal strand co-segregation leads to better preservation of the stem cell lineage than random chromosome segregation. Furthermore, our model allows us to estimate the optimal lesion repair efficiency for preserving an adult stem cell population for a given period of time. For human stem cells, we obtain that mispaired bases still present after replication and cell division should be left untouched, to avoid potentially fixing a mutation in both DNA strands.

40|$|Accurate DNA {{replication}} {{is crucial}} for cell survival {{and the maintenance of}} genome stability. Cells have developed mechanisms to cope with the frequent genotoxic injuries that arise from both endogenous and environmental sources. Lesions encountered during DNA replication are often tolerated by post-replication repair mechanisms that prevent replication fork collapse and avert the formation of DNA double strand breaks. There are two predominant post-replication repair pathways, trans-lesion synthesis (TLS) and template switching (TS). TLS is a DNA damage-tolerant and low-fidelity mode of DNA synthesis that utilizes specialized ‘Y-family’ DNA polymerases to replicate damaged templates. TS, however, is an error-free ‘DNA damage avoidance’ mode of DNA synthesis that uses a newly synthesized sister chromatid as a template in lieu of the damaged <b>parent</b> <b>strand.</b> Both TLS and TS pathways are tightly controlled signaling cascades that integrate DNA synthesis with the overall DNA damage response and are thus crucial for genome stability.

40|$|AbstractDNA {{methylation}} {{is one of}} the key mechanisms {{underlying the}} epigenetic regulation of gene expression. During DNA replication, the methylation pattern of the <b>parent</b> <b>strand</b> is maintained on the replicated strand through the action of Dnmt 1 (DNA Methyltransferase 1). In mammals, Dnmt 1 is recruited to hemimethylated replication foci by Uhrf 1 (Ubiquitin-like, Containing PHD and RING Finger Domains 1). Here we show that Uhrf 1 is required for DNA methylation in vivo during zebrafish embryogenesis. Due in part to the early embryonic lethality of Dnmt 1 and Uhrf 1 knockout mice, roles for these proteins during lens development have yet to be reported. We show that zebrafish mutants in uhrf 1 and dnmt 1 have defects in lens development and maintenance. uhrf 1 and dnmt 1 are expressed in the lens epithelium, and in the absence of Uhrf 1 or of catalytically active Dnmt 1, lens epithelial cells have altered gene expression and reduced proliferation in both mutant backgrounds. This is correlated with a wave of apoptosis in the epithelial layer, which is followed by apoptosis and unraveling of secondary lens fibers. Despite these disruptions in the lens fiber region, lens fibers express appropriate differentiation markers. The results of lens transplant experiments demonstrate that Uhrf 1 and Dnmt 1 functions are required lens-autonomously, but perhaps not cell-autonomously, during lens development in zebrafish. These data provide the first evidence that Uhrf 1 and Dnmt 1 function is required for vertebrate lens development and maintenance...|$|E

The longest cDNA transcripts synthesized by using avian myeloblastosis virus, Moloney murine leukemia virus, and clone 124 mouse sarcoma virus were 7, 9 and 6 kilobases (kb), respectively. The in vitro system used was capable of synthesizing double-stranded DNA, but the plus strands (same polarity as the viral RNA) were only 0. 5 to 1. 5 kb long. Lone Moloney murine leukemia virus cDNA transcripts were used as templates to synthesize the second plus strand. Essentially two strategies were employed as follows. (i) The 3 ' ends of the cDNA transcripts were extended by addition of 50 to 100 dAMP residues by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The (dA) n-tailed cDNA transcripts were used as templates along with an oligomer of dT as primer and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase to synthesize the plus strands. (ii) DNase-digested calf thymus DNA was used to prime the synthesis of plus strands on long cDNA with E. coli DNA polymerase I. In both cases, the synthesis of the plus strands was monitored by increased resistance of the cDNA templates to single-strand-specific S 1 nuclease. The double-stranded DNA was fractionated on neutral sucrose gradients. Analysis of the double-stranded DNA synthesized by using oligo(dT) primer showed the plus strands to be about 5 to 6 kb long, whereas the plus strands synthesized by using DNase-digested calf thymus DNA primers were only 0. 3 to 0. 5 kb long. Double-stranded DNA synthesized by either method has an average size of 6 x 10 (6) daltons.

In Escherichia coli, {{it is thought}} that -AAF adducts block the replication fork and that the mutagenic processing of the -AAF adducts is mediated by the SOS response. The construction in vitro of plasmids containing -AAF adducts in one strand only of a double-stranded DNA molecule enabled us to investigate the segregation of the strands and the mutagenicity of the lesions in vivo. The two DNA strands were "genetically labelled" by means of a single base-pair mismatch in the tetracycline-resistance gene, one strand carrying the wild-type allele and the other strand a mutant tetracycline-sensitive allele. The two strands contained either no -AAF adducts, -AAF adducts in one strand or -AAF adducts in both strands. When such constructions are used to transform bacterial cells the following are found. 1. (1) When no -AAF adducts are present on either strand of the DNA, a mixture of plasmids having information from both parent strands is found in 80 % of the transformed bacterial clones. 2. (2) With -AAF adducts present in one strand only, in 90 % of the transformants there is a consistent loss of the <b>parent</b> <b>strand</b> information that contained the -AAF adducts. 3. (3) In the constructions having -AAF adducts in both strands, the transformed bacteria carry either one or the other allele in a pure form. Our results suggest that when blocking lesions (-AAF adducts) are present in one strand only, they trigger the specific loss of that strand. The forward mutation frequency (i. e. the tetracycline-resistance gene inactivation frequency) was found to be more than ten times lower when the -AAF adducts are bound to one strand only compared with the situation where both strands carry the premutagenic lesions. Moreover, when the isolated mutants were sequenced, the mutations were found to consist of a mixture of true -AAF-induced mutations (i. e. - 1 or - 2 frameshift mutation at previously determined mutation hot spots) and of mutations that are not targeted at -AAF adducts. We suggest that these "background" mutants arose from the mutagenic processing of cryptic lesions present in our DNA. The low mutagenic efficiency of -AAF adducts, when present in one strand only of a duplex DNA, most probably results from the above-described loss of the damaged strand. It should be stressed that experiments involving the introduction of a single bulky adduct in a double-stranded genome in order to study mutagenic efficiency and specificity will face the difficulty resulting from the specific loss of the strand carrying the adduct. © 1987.

40|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid, {{generally}} {{referred to}} as DNA by its acronym, {{is the basis of}} life, which contains the information for the development and functioning of all the living organisms. The DNA research began in 1868, when Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher first identified what he called “nuclein” inside the nuclei of human white blood cells. In 1889, R. Altmann separated nuclein from protein and because of its acidic character he named it nucleic acid. Phoebus Levene identified the components of DNA and showed that they were linked in the order phosphate- sugar-base to form units which he referred as nucleotide and suggested that the DNA molecule consisted of a string of nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups, which is the ‘backbone’ of the molecule. The role of DNA in heredity was recognized in 1944, when Avery and co-workers published their famous result that DNA and not proteins were the carriers of genetic information (Avery et al., 1944). The complementary base-pair rule was found by Chargaff in 1950 (Chargaff et al., 1950). A milestone in DNA research was the double helix structure which was proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953 based upon the X-ray fiber diffraction data from fibres of DNA obtained by Rosalind Franklin (Watson and Crick, 1953). From the double helical structure, it was immediately obvious how information could pass {{from one generation to the}} next by synthesis of DNA complementary <b>strands</b> from <b>parent</b> <b>strands.</b> In 1962 they received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery along with the crystallographer Maurice Wilkins. The first published account of the directed chemical synthesis of an oligonucleotide occurred in 1955 when Michelson and Todd reported the preparation of a dithymidinyl nucleotide (Michelson and Todd, 1955). In the late 1950 ’s Khorana and his group were able to synthesize oligoribonucleotides that were used to confirm the Genetic Code. In 1968, Khorana received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis. Khorana’s method was revolutionary at the time and produced a truly remarkable feat: the synthesis of an active 72 -mer tRNA molecule, which was published in Nature (Agarwal et al., 1970). However, it was not until the late 1970 ’s that the development of DNA research became explosive, when synthetic DNA fragments became commercially available. Pohl and Jovin first observed the salt-induced cooperative conformational changes of the synthetic DNA poly(dG-dC). poly(dG-dC) duplex, from a right-handed helix to left handed helix from the circular dichroism study (Pohl and Jovin, 1972) ...|$|R

Each DNA or RNA molecule in the sample is first “amplified” (i.e., copied) in-situ via rolling-circle amplification to create a localized “rolling circle colony” (rolony) consisting of identical copies of the parent molecule. A series of biochemical steps are then carried out. In the kth cycle, a fluorescent tag is introduced, the color of which corresponds to {{the identity of the}} kth base along the rolony’s <b>parent</b> DNA <b>strand.</b> The system is then “paused” in this state for imaging. The entire sample can be imaged in each cycle. The fluorescent tags are then cleaved and washed away, and the next cycle is initiated. Each rolony - corresponding to a single “parent” DNA or RNA molecule in the tissue - thus appears across {{a series of}} fluorescent images, as a localized “spot” with a sequence of colors corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the parent molecule. The nucleotide sequence of each DNA or RNA molecule is thus read out in-situ via fluorescent microscopy.|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of non-random chromosome segregation is discussed {{from the perspective}} of what was known in 1965 and 1966. The distinction between daughter, <b>parent</b> or grandparent <b>strands</b> of DNA was developed in a bacterial system and led to the discovery that multiple copies of DNA elements of bacteria are not distributed randomly with respect to the age of the template strand. Experiments with higher eukaryotic cells demonstrated that during mitosis Mendel’s laws were violated; and the initial serendipitous choice of eukaryotic cell system led to the striking example of non-random segregation of parent and grand-parent DNA template strands in primary cultures of cells derived from mouse embryos. Attempts to extrapolate these findings to established TC lines demonstrated that the property could be lost. Experiments using plant root tips demonstrated that the phenomenon exists in plants and that it was, at some level, under genetic control. Despite publication in major journals and symposia (Lark et al. (1966 a); Lark (1967 a; 1967 b; 1969, 1969 a; 1969 b)) the potential implications of these findings were ignored for several decades. Here we explore possible reasons for the pre-maturity (Stent, 1972) of this discovery...|$|R
40|$|In storing and {{transmitting}} epigenetic information, organisms must {{balance the}} need to maintain information about past conditions with the capacity to respond to information in their current and future environments. Some of this information is encoded by DNA methylation, which can be transmitted with variable fidelity from <b>parent</b> to daughter <b>strand.</b> High fidelity confers strong pattern matching between the strands of individual DNA molecules and thus pattern stability over rounds of DNA replication; lower fidelity confers reduced pattern matching, and thus greater flexibility. Here, we present a new conceptual framework, Ratio of Concordance Preference (RCP), that uses double-stranded methylation data to quantify the flexibility and stability of the system that gave rise to a given set of patterns. We find that differentiated mammalian cells operate with high DNA methylation stability, consistent with earlier reports. Stem cells in culture and in embryos, in contrast, operate with reduced, albeit significant, methylation stability. We conclude that preference for concordant DNA methylation is a consistent mode of information transfer, and thus provides epigenetic stability across cell divisions, even in stem cells and those undergoing developmental transitions. Broader application of our RCP framework will permit comparison of epigenetic-information systems across cells, developmental stages, and organisms whose methylation machineries differ substantially or are not yet well understood...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} semiconservative quasispecies {{equations}} {{to account for}} arbitrary post-replication lesion repair efficiency. Such an extension could be an important tool for understanding processes such as cancer development and stem cell growth. Starting from the quasispecies dynamics over the space of genomes, we derive an equivalent dynamics over the space of ordered sequence pairs. From this set of equations, {{we are able to}} derive the infinite sequence length form of the dynamics for a class of ``master-genome''-based fitness landscapes. We use these equations to solve for a ``generalized'' single-fitness-peak landscape, where the master genome can sustain a maximum number of lesions and remain viable. The central pattern that emerges from our studies is that imperfect lesion repair often leads to increased mutational robustness over semiconservative replication with completely efficient lesion repair. The {{reason for this is that}} imperfect lesion repair breaks some of the correlation between the <b>parent</b> and daughter <b>strands,</b> thereby preventing replication errors from destroying the information in the original genome. The result is a delayed error catastrophe over that expected from the original semiconservative quasispecies model. In particular, we show that when only of the strands is necessary for conferring viability, then, when lesion repair is turned off, a semiconservatively replicating system becomes an effectively conservatively replicating one.
