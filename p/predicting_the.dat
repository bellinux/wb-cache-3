5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper {{essentially}} <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> {{existence of the}} positron, after a paper by Paul Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect. Oppenheimer, drawing {{on the body of}} experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued {{that they would have to}} have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{physicist}} Niels Bohr was {{the first}} to seriously consider the possibility of an element with atomic number as high as 118, noting in 1922 that such an element would take its place in the periodic table below radon as the seventh noble gas. Following this, Aristid von Grosse wrote an article in 1965 <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> likely properties of element 118. These were remarkably early predictions, given that it was not yet known how to produce elements artificially in 1922, and that the existence of the island of stability had not yet been theorized in 1965. It was 80 years from Bohr's prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesised, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Franklin was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} storm over the western Atlantic Ocean during July of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.

Franklin eventually became extratropical near Newfoundland on July 30, before being absorbed by a larger system. The National Hurricane Center struggled to predict Tropical Storm Franklin mainly due to difficulties in <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> effects of wind shear. There were only minor effects on land from Tropical Storm Franklin and no damages were caused. The name Franklin was used for the first time because of Hurricane Floyd which was retired in the 1999 season.|$|E

5|$|Within the tropics, 36hours {{prior to}} the center passage of a {{tropical}} cyclone, a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches {{from the direction of}} the cyclone. In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Cuba, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm.
