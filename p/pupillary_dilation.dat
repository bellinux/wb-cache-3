40|$|Cognitive {{psychology}} has {{in recent}} years had an increasing focus on how attention may reflects the degree of processing intensity, also known as attentional effort. The theoretical developments on attentional effort have followed two main trajectories; effort as momentary demands on the attentional system, or degree of appliance reflecting top-down processing. The momentary demands on the attentional system have been operationalized through <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations,</b> and increasing attentional effort is measured as the increased dilation of the eye pupil. Attentional effort as top-down processing on the other hand, have been investigated through functional imaging. A broad empirical evidence suggests that top-down attentional control is expressed in a distinct neural network, conceptualized as the dorsal network. A recent developmet of theory {{have suggested that the}} underlying mechanism regulating both <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations,</b> and the neural network responsible for attentional control, is mediated by the release of noradrenaline (NE) from the Locus Correulus (LC). This offers a potential bridge between the two different theoretical traditions, unifying them in a joint account of attentional effort. It has further been suggested that the <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations</b> can be used to predict activity in these neural nodes responsible for attentional processing. This relationship has however never been directly investigated. The current study therefore asessed concurrent pupillometry and fMRI during a sustained visual attention-task where degree of load, and hence attentional effort, on the attentional system was directly manipulated. We investigated how <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations</b> in combination with parametrical increase of load can be used to predict neural activity in the LC-NE system, as well as activity in the dorsal system. Results reveal that <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations,</b> in combination of parametrical modulation of load, correctly predicts activity in the dorsal network, as well in the LC.

40|$|The {{goals of}} the study were to examine {{inhibitory}} deficits on the antisaccade task in 8 - to 20 -year olds with youth-onset psychosis or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and healthy controls and to examine if age-related changes in performance differed across groups. In addition to the conventional measures of performance, <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations</b> were used to obtain estimates of phasic and tonic level of arousal. Results showed that the psychosis, but not the ADHD, group had elevated antisaccade error rates; however, variability of error rates was high in all groups. These inhibitory failures were accompanied by a lower level of momentary cognitive effort (as indexed by <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations).</b> The largest differences between the control and clinical groups were found not in the expected indices of inhibition but in the probability of correcting inhibitory errors and in variability of antisaccade response times, which were correlated with each other. These findings {{did not appear to be}} attributable to a deficit in maintaining task instructions in mind in either disorder or lack of motivation in ADHD.

40|$|Pupillary {{responses}} are a well-known indicator of emotional arousal {{but have not}} yet been systematically investigated in response to music. Here, we measured <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations</b> evoked by short musical excerpts normalized for intensity and selected for their stylistic uniformity. Thirty participants (15 females) provided subjective ratings of music-induced felt arousal, tension, pleasantness and familiarity for 80 classical music excerpts. The pupillary responses evoked by these excerpts were measured in another thirty participants (15 females). We probed the role of listener-specific characteristics such as mood, stress reactivity, self-reported role of music in life, liking for the selected excerpts, as well as of subjective responses to music, in pupillary responses. Linear mixed model analyses showed that a greater role of music in life was associated with larger dilations, and that larger dilations were also predicted for excerpts rated as more arousing or tense. However, an interaction between arousal and liking for the excerpts suggested that pupillary responses were modulated less strongly by arousal when the excerpts were particularly liked. An analogous interaction was observed between tension and liking. Additionally, males exhibited larger dilations than females. Overall, these findings suggest a complex interplay between bottom-up and top-down influences on pupillary responses to music...|$|R

We avoided asking for metacognitive reports that have been shown to disturb insight problem solving (Schooler, Olsson, & Brooks, 1993), and made use of routine (non-insight) problems of a very similar task nature to compare with the performance, eye-related physiological measures, and subjective ratings of participants on their solving of puzzle (insight) problems. We found that puzzle problems and routine problems led to different <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations</b> with perception of the tasks and mood as possible mediators of the effect. Profiles of pupillary responses and blinks are found to be indicators that depict characteristics of the task nature when a person is unable to predict his/her own problem solving performance on an insight problem. We also found that discontinuity and restructuring are possibly more important in characterizing an insight problem solving event. Third, instead of the traditional sharp and abrupt but indistinct characterization of the insight moment, our data suggested that an insight is possibly an emerging moment of a sense of clarity about the solution which takes time before the time of an 'Aha!' solution declaration, which converges with some of the claims made according to records of historical scientific discoveries (Gruber, 1995) ...|$|R

Seven eyes of seven cats were studied under general anesthesia. Trains of monophasic pulses (current, 0. 1 to 1. 0 mA; duration, 0. 5 ms/phase; frequency, 5 to 40 Hz) were applied to the lateral or medial branch of the short ciliary nerve near the posterior pole of the eye. A pair of electrodes was hooked onto one or both branch of the short ciliary nerve. The electrodes were placed about 5 mm from the scleral surface. The wavefront aberrations were recorded continuously for 2 seconds before, 8 seconds during, and for 20 seconds after the electrical stimulation. The pupillary images were simultaneously recorded during the stimulation period. Both the wavefront aberrations and the pupillary images were obtained 10 times/sec with a custom-built wavefront aberrometer. The maximum accommodative amplitude was 1. 19 diopters (D) produced by electrical stimulation of the short ciliary nerves. The latency of the accommodative changes was very short, and the accommodative level gradually increased up to 4 seconds and reached a plateau. When only one branch of the ciliary nerve was stimulated, the pupil dilated asymmetrically, and the oblique astigmatism and one of the asymmetrical wavefront terms was also altered.

In discussing his choice for naming a 1994 Ontario gay and lesbian film and video retrospective and then re-using the phrase for his book The Fruit Machine: Twenty Years of Writings on Queer Cinema, film critic Thomas Waugh explains [...] "In the late fifties and early sixties our very own Mounties, ever conscious of security threats, had commissioned research into a mechanical devices for detecting homosexuality, inspired by similar research in the (United) States where McCarthyism and the sex panics had created a market for such lunatic pseudoscience. The idea was to unmask perverts by measuring involuntary <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations</b> and other physiological reactions to pictures and words. Dubbed the fruit machine by terrified straight Mounties who didn't want to be the guinea pigs and whose security was already threatened, the technology came in several proposed models. One involved perspiratory responses to vocabulary with homosexual meanings like queen, circus, gay, bagpipe, bell, whole, blind, mother, punk, queer, rim, sew, swing, trade, velvet, wolf, blackmail, prowl, bar, house, club, restaurant, tea room, and top men." [...] Other devices involved showing subjects pictures of seminude men and measuring eye movement or attention span. [...] "Basically they'd show suspected homos slides of naked men and measure their responses (dilated eyeballs, sweaty palms). The poor dilated sweaty souls would then be fired or arrested.

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the effect that}} hedonic value can have on economic decisions (e. g., willingness to pay) as well as oculomotor behavior and pupillary responses (i. e., measures of the allocation of attention). Due to the well-known interactions between reward circuitry in the brain, modes of activity in the LC, and <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilations</b> (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005; Laeng, et al., 2012), pupillometry with eye tracking should be a promising method to study the effect of hedonic stimuli. To our knowledge, no previous study has provided evidence that changes in the eye pupil’s diameter can index parametrically the hedonic response (i. e., proportionally {{to the level of}} attractiveness of either social or non-social stimuli). Specifically, pupillary changes along with eye fixations of 49 participants were monitored while they were viewing images of either human faces or wine bottles. Both sets of stimuli had initially being rated by an independent group of 80 participants for their hedonic value. Participants made economic decisions by estimating either price or salary that participants would be willing to give for each wine bottle or person, respectively. Results showed a linear increase in pupil dilations in response to parametric increases in facial attractiveness, whereas non-linear, i. e. U-shaped, pupillary changes were registered in response to wine labels. Moreover, above median level of attractiveness in faces and wine labels triggered, respectively, smaller and greater numbers of eye fixations. The data from economic decisions revealed a linear increase in the level of offered monetary payoffs as a function of hedonic level for both faces and wine labels. Areas of interest analyses revealed the visual features that attracted the most attention and a left-side laterality effect. Finally, only facial attractiveness showed gender-dependent effects on both economic decisions and biological responses...|$|R
5000|$|Pupil is {{the dark}} {{circular}} {{opening in the}} center of the iris and is where light enters the eye. Based on analogy with a camera, pupil is equivalent to aperture, whereas iris is equivalent to shutter. Pupillary reflex should have been named iris reflex, because iris is the actual muscular structure that responds to light and pupil is merely the passive opening formed by the active iris. Pupillary reflex is synonymous with pupillary response, which may be <b>pupillary</b> constriction or <b>dilation.</b> <b>Pupillary</b> reflex is conceptually linked to the side (left or right) of the reacting pupil, and not to the side from which light stimulation originates. Left pupillary reflex refers to the response of the left pupil to light, regardless of which eye is exposed to a light source. Right pupillary reflex means reaction of the right pupil, whether light is shone into the left eye, right eye, or both eyes. In contrast, the terms direct and consensual refers to the side where the light source comes from, relative to the side of the reacting pupil. A direct pupillary reflex is pupillary response to light that enters the ipsilateral (same) eye. A consensual pupillary reflex is response of a pupil to light that enters the contralateral (opposite) eye. Thus there are four types of pupillary light reflexes, based on this terminology of absolute (left versus right) and relative (same side versus opposite side) laterality: ...|$|R
50|$|Stage 2: Stage 2, {{also known}} as the {{excitement}} stage, is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity. During this stage, the patient's respiration and heart rate may become irregular. In addition, there may be uncontrolled movements, vomiting, suspension of breathing, and <b>pupillary</b> <b>dilation.</b> Because the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and irregular respiration may compromise the patient's airway, rapidly acting drugs are used to minimize time in this stage and reach Stage 3 as fast as possible.|$|E

50|$|Messages {{travel through}} the {{sympathetic}} nervous system in a bidirectional flow. Efferent messages can trigger changes {{in different parts of}} the body simultaneously.

One exception is with certain blood vessels such as those in the cerebral and coronary arteries, which dilate (rather than constrict) with an increase in sympathetic tone. This is because of a proportional increase in the presence of β2 adrenergic receptors rather than α1 receptors. β2 receptors promote vessel dilation instead of constriction like α1 receptors.|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} {{pupil size}} in adult human subjects while we manipulated both the luminance {{of the visual}} scene {{and the location of}} attention.

Irrespective {{of the size of the}} attended region (focused at the center of the stimulus or spread within and outside the stimulus), the attentional enhancement is large: more than 20 % of the response to stimuli in the unattended hemifield. This indicates that a sizable portion of this simple ocular behavior-often considered a subcortical "reflex"-in fact depends on cortical processing.

40|$|Covertly {{shifting}} {{attention to}} a brighter or darker image (without moving one's eyes) is sufficient to evoke <b>pupillary</b> constriction or <b>dilation,</b> respectively. One possibility is that this attentional modulation involves the pupillary light response pathway, which pivots around the olivary pretectal nucleus. We investigate this possibility by studying patients with Parinaud's syndrome, where the normal pupillary light response is strongly impaired due to lesions in the pretectal area. Four patients and nine control participants covertly attended (while maintaining fixation {{at the center of}} a monitor screen) to one of two disks located in the left and right periphery: one brighter, the other darker than the background. Patients and control subjects behaved alike, showing smaller pupils when attending to the brighter stimulus (despite no eye movements); consistent results were obtained with a dynamic version of the stimulus. We interpret this as proof of principle that attention to bright or dark stimuli can dynamically modulate pupil size in patients with Parinaud's syndrome, suggesting that attention acts independently of the pretectal circuit for the pupillary light response and indicating that several components of the pupillary response can be isolated - including one related to the focus of covert attention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{prolonged}} exposure (i. e., perceptual adaptation) {{to a male}} or a female face can produce changes (i. e., aftereffects) in the subsequent gender attribution of a neutral or average face, so that it appears respectively more female or more male.

The results indicated that both perceptual and imagery adaptation produce aftereffects, but that they run in opposite directions: a contrast effect with perception (e. g., after visual exposure to a female face, the androgynous appears as more male) and an assimilation effect with imagery (e. g., after imaginative exposure to a female face, the androgynous face appears as more female).
