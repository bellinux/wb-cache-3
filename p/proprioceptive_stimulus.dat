40|$|International audienceHere we {{investigated}} how the tactile modality is used along with muscle proprioception in hand movement perception, whether these two sensory inputs are centrally integrated {{and whether they}} work complementarily or concurrently. The illusory right hand rotations induced in eleven volunteers by a textured disk scrolling under their hand in two directions at three velocities and/or by mechanical vibration applied to their wrist muscles at three frequencies were compared. The kinesthetic illusions were copied by the subjects on-line with their left hand. Results: 1) in all the subjects, tactile stimulation alone induced an illusory hand rotation {{in the opposite direction}} to that of the disk, and the velocity of the illusion increased non-linearly with the disk velocity: the highest gain (the illusion velocity to disk velocity ratio) occurred at the slowest disk rotation; 2) adding a consistent <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimulus</b> increased the perceptual effects, whereas adding a conflicting <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimulus</b> of increasing frequency gradually decreased the tactile illusions and reversed their initial direction; 3) under both consistent and conflicting conditions, only strong proprioceptive stimulation significantly affected the gain of the resulting illusions, whereas the largest gain always occurred at low tactile stimulation levels when the illusory movements were {{in the same direction as}} the tactile-induced illusion. Tactile information may equal or even override muscle proprioceptive information in the perception of relatively small, slow hand movements. These two somatosensory inputs may be integrated complementarily, depending on their respective relevance to the task of accurately perceiving one's own hand movements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Rapid and {{accurate}} {{interaction with the}} world requires that we perceive the consequences of our actions. It has been well demonstrated that delaying visual feedback impairs performance {{on a range of}} tasks (e. g., 1 - 4). We have recently shown that a few minutes of exposure to delayed feedback induces sensorimotor temporal adaptation (5). Temporal adaptation is analogous to prism adaptation. For example, temporal adaptation: • allows nearly normal performance with the delay. • seems to alter intersensory perceptual judgments (e. g., after adaptating to the delay, the delayed visual stimulus and non-delayed <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimulus</b> are perceived as occurring simultaneously). • subsequent removal of the delay severely impairs performance (negative aftereffect – Figure 1) As part of an ongoing line of research into how the visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular systems are integrated, we examined the sensitivity an...|$|E
30|$|The {{model is}} able to provide two types of <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimulus</b> to the ES cells: through the P cells for {{continuous}} stimuli or through NetStim spike generator units with location (NSLOC) for discrete stimuli. P cells are implemented as integrate and fire neurons, and therefore include cell dynamics and internal variables, such as membrane voltage. When a spike is received from the external data source, an action potential is artificially triggered in the corresponding P cell. P cells also potentially allow for continuous stimuli inputs by modulating its membrane voltage over time. NSLOC units are simple spike generators, known as NetStim in the NEURON environment, with no internal dynamics. The user can determine its firing rate or, as in our case, the specific times when spikes should be generated. In our model, we have extended NetStim to have an x, y, z location (thus the name NSLOC) {{in order to facilitate}} distance-based random connectivity.|$|E

40|$|Vision and {{proprioception}} are {{the main}} sensory modalities that convey hand location and direction of movement. Fusion of these sensory signals into a single robust percept is now well documented. However, {{it is not known}} whether these modalities also interact in the spatial allocation of attention, which has been demonstrated for other modality pairings. The aim {{of this study was to}} test whether proprioceptive signals can spatially cue a visual target to improve its detection. Participants were instructed to use a planar manipulandum in a forward reaching action and determine during this movement whether a near-threshold visual target appeared at either of two lateral positions. The target presentation was followed by a masking stimulus, which made its possible location unambiguous, but not its presence. Proprioceptive cues were given by applying a brief lateral force to the participant’s arm, either in the same direction (validly cued) or in the opposite direction (invalidly cued) to the on-screen location of the mask. The d′ detection rate of the target increased when the direction of <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimulus</b> was compatible with the location of the visual target compared to when it was incompatible.

Here we examine changes in the way proprioceptive and visual inputs interact. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate visual responses in the context of varying levels of proprioceptive input in 12 BVL subjects and 15 normal controls. A novel metal-free vibrator was developed to allow vibrotactile neck proprioceptive input to be delivered in the MRI system. A high level (100 Hz) and low level (30 Hz) control stimulus was applied over the left splenius capitis; only the high frequency stimulus generates a significant <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimulus.</b> The neck stimulus was applied in combination with static and moving (optokinetic) visual stimuli, in a factorial fMRI experimental design. We found that high level neck proprioceptive input had more cortical effect on brain activity in the BVL patients. This included a reduction in visual motion responses during high levels of proprioceptive input and differential activation in the midline cerebellum. In early visual cortical areas, the effect of high proprioceptive input was present for both visual conditions but in lateral visual areas, including V 5 /MT, the effect was only seen in the context of visual motion stimulation. The finding of a cortical visuo-proprioceptive interaction in BVL patients is consistent with behavioural data indicating that, in BVL patients, neck afferents partly replace vestibular input during the CNS-mediated compensatory process. An fMRI cervico-visual interaction may thus substitute the known visuo-vestibular interaction reported in normal subject fMRI studies. The results provide evidence for a cortical mechanism of adaptation to vestibular failure, {{in the form of an}} enhanced proprioceptive influence on visual processing.

Previous studies of passive movements and illusory vibration have reported inconsistent activation patterns related to proprioception, particularly in high order sensorimotor cortices. We investigated brain activation specific to proprioception, its laterality and changes following stroke. Twelve healthy and three stroke affected individuals with proprioceptive deficits participated. Proprioception was assessed clinically with the Wrist Position Sense Test, and participants underwent functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. An event-related study design was used, where each <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimulus</b> of passive wrist movement {{was followed by a}} motor response of mirror copying with the other wrist. Left (LWP) and right (RWP) wrist proprioception were tested separately. Laterality indices (LI) were calculated for the main cortical regions activated during proprioception. We found proprioception-related brain activation in high order sensorimotor cortices in healthy participants especially in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG LWP z= 4. 51, RWP z= 4. 24) and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd LWP z= 4. 10, RWP z= 3. 93). Right hemispheric dominance was observed in the SMG (LI LWP mean 0. 41, SD 0. 22; RWP 0. 29, SD 0. 20), and to a lesser degree in the PMd (LI LWP 0. 34, SD 0. 17; RWP 0. 13, SD 0. 25). In stroke affected participants the main difference in proprioception-related brain activation was reduced laterality in the right SMG. Our findings indicate that the SMG and PMd {{play a key role in}} proprioception probably due to their role in spatial processing and motor control respectively. The findings from stroke affected individuals suggest that decreased right SMG function may be associated with decreased proprioception. We recommend that clinicians pay particular attention to the assessment and rehabilitation of proprioception following right hemispheric lesion...|$|E

In the present study we tested temporal processing of <b>proprioceptive</b> and tactile <b>stimuli</b> in 20 patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how {{the human brain}} adapts after peripheral vestibular injury. Vestibular perceptual function {{is used as a}} probe of cortical vestibular function. A paradigm determining vestibular perceptual thresholds to yaw axis rotation by a method of limits is described. Asymmetry in the thresholds is induced in normal subjects with galvanic vestibular stimulation. In patients with acute vestibular neuritis, perceptual thresholds were bilaterally elevated, with less asymmetry when compared to the brainstem reflexive function. Thresholds were measured in a prospective longitudinal study in vestibular neuritis patients, assessed acutely and at follow-­‐up (n= 16). Assessments comprised vestibular caloric testing, visual dependency measures, questionnaire measures of symptom load, anxiety, depression and fear of body sensations. Clinical recruitment found a low rate of correct diagnoses by referring clinicians. Symptomatic outcome at follow-up was associated with increased visual dependence, asymmetric caloric function, increased anxiety and depression. It was also associated with increased fear and anxiety of body sensations present acutely, suggesting this may be predisposing. The anatomical substrate of central compensation was investigated in patients with bilateral vestibular failure (n= 12) and normal controls (n= 15) using functional MRI. A novel air turbine-powered vibrating device was developed to provide high and low levels of <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimulus</b> to neck rotator muscles. This was combined with a horizontal visual motion paradigm in a factorial design. A lateralised interaction was found in the lateral occipital visual processing areas in the avestibular patients. In addition to the known visual-vestibular interaction, this demonstrates a visuo-proprioceptive interaction, which may reflect compensation after vestibular injury. Conclusions: Vestibular perceptual function can be measured in disease, and is elevated in patients with acute peripheral vestibulopathy. Specific psychological and physiological factors associated with clinical recovery after vestibular neuritis are proposed. Functional MRI shows that proprioceptive signals interact with visual motion signals in patients with vestibular failure. Imperial Users onl...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the effects of a stimulus change inserted in the large component of a mixed fixed-ratio 10 fixed-ratio 100 schedule. In mixed fixed-ratio schedules, a run of responses which approximates the response requirement of the smaller fixed ratio occurs {{at the beginning of the}} larger fixed ratio. This run of responses and the pause it precedes is called a prime. In Experiment I, priming acquisition was compared in a mixed schedule in which a change in key-color followed completion of the first 10 responses of the fixed-ratio 100 component and a mixed schedule with no stimulus change. Primes were acquired more rapidly in the mixed schedule with the stimulus change and the number of responses in a priming run was less variable than occurred without the stimulus change. In Experiment II, the effect of the stimulus change on primes was further investigated by removal of the smaller fixed-ratio component or by varying the location of the stimulus change. Primes occurred only when the smaller fixed-ratio component was present. Varying the location of the stimulus change resulted in the transfer of control from the external stimulus to response-produced stimuli. Future investigation of this point of transfer should prove useful in the study of the <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimulus</b> control of homogeneous behavior sequences. In Experiments Ill through VI, the variables controlling the length of the post-prime and the post-reinforcement pauses were investigated using the mixed FR x chained FR x FR y schedule. In this series of experiments, FR x was varied with FR y held constant at both high and low values. In addition, FR y was varied with FR x held constant at both high and low values. The results indicate that the post-prime pause is primarily a function of FR y, the number of responses required after the priming run. On the other hand, both post-reinforcement pauses were shown to be a function of FR x, the size of the small fixed ratio. An interaction between FR x and FR y and both the post-reinforcement and the post-prime pauses suggested that pausing in mixed schedules is a closed system. Taken as a whole, these results indicate the importance of mixed chained schedules in the investigation of the priming phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{classical}} view of somatosensory processing {{holds that}} proprioceptive and cutaneous inputs are conveyed to cortex through segregated channels, initially synapsing in modality-specific areas 3 a (proprioception) and 3 b (cutaneous) of primary somatosensory cortex (SI). These areas relay their signals to areas 1 and 2 where multimodal convergence first emerges. However, proprioceptive and cutaneous maps {{have traditionally been}} characterized using unreliable stimulation tools. Here, we employed a mechanical stimulator that reliably positioned animals’ hands in different postures and presented tactile stimuli with superb precision. Single-unit recordings in SI revealed that most neurons responded to cutaneous and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimuli,</b> including cells in areas 3 a and 3 b. Multimodal responses were characterized by linear and nonlinear effects that emerged during early (∼ 20  ms) and latter (>  100  ms) stages of stimulus processing, respectively.

By introducing cue conflicts during the active return and asking the participants whether they had noticed a cue conflict, we measured the influence of each cue on the response.

This suggests that participants used task-induced attention to reduce the influence of stimuli that conflict with the task instructions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Basic postures such as sit, {{stand and}} lie are {{ubiquitous}} in human interaction. In {{order to build}} robots that aid and support humans in their daily life, {{we need to understand}} how posture categories can be learned and recognized. This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach to posture recognition for a biped humanoid robot. The approach is based on Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), a biologically inspired algorithm for extracting slowly changing signals from signals varying on a fast time scale. Two experiments are carried out: First, we consider the problem of recognizing static postures in a multimodal sensory stream which consists of visual and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Secondly, we show how to extract a low-dimensional representation of the sensory state space which is suitable for posture recognition in a more complex setting. We point out that the beneficial performance of SFA in this task can be related to the fact that SFA computes manifolds which are used in robotics to model invariants in motion and behavior. Based on this insight, we also propose a method for using SFA components for guided exploration of the state space.

Here we studied how externally applied noise influences action potential firing in mouse primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia, modelling a basic process in sensory perception. Since noisy mechanical stimuli may cause stochastic fluctuations in receptor potential, we {{examined the effects of}} sub-threshold depolarizing current steps with superimposed random fluctuations. We performed whole cell patch clamp recordings in cultured neurons of mouse dorsal root ganglia. Noise was added either before and during the step, or during the depolarizing step only, to focus onto the specific effects of external noise on action potential generation. In both cases, step + noise stimuli triggered significantly more action potentials than steps alone. The normalized power norm had a clear peak at intermediate noise levels, demonstrating that the phenomenon is driven by stochastic resonance. Spikes evoked in step + noise trials occur earlier and show faster rise time as compared to the occasional ones elicited by steps alone. These data suggest that external noise enhances, via stochastic resonance, the recruitment of transient voltage-gated Na channels, responsible for action potential firing in response to rapid step-wise depolarizing currents...|$|R

Case report:After a ski accident, a 71 -year-old man suffered an incomplete SCI (level C 3; AIS C, central cord syndrome), with a C 3 /C 4 dislocation fracture. From the first week after injury, he experienced a phantom duplication of both upper limbs that lasted for 7 months. The supernumerary limbs were only occasionally related to painful sensation, specifically when they were perceived as crossed on his trunk. Although the painful sensations were responsive to pain medication, {{the presence of the}} illusory limb sensations were persistent. During neurological recovery, the supernumerary limbs gradually disappeared. A rubber hand illusion paradigm was used twice during recovery to monitor the patient's ability to integrate visual, tactile and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Conclusion:Overall, the clinical relevance of supernumerary phantom limbs is not clear, specific treatment protocols have not yet been developed, and the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood. Supernumerary phantom limbs have been previously reported in patients with (sub) cortical lesions, but might be rather undocumented in patients suffering from traumatic SCI. For the appropriate diagnosis and treatment after SCI, supernumerary phantoms should be distinguished from other phantom sensations and pain syndromes after SCI.

In the unpredictable condition, the CS was never paired with the US. Instead, the US occurred at variable time points during the inter-trial interval. In the extinction phase there were three between-subjects groups: Extinction (only predictable trials), Exposure (only unpredictable trials), and Control (both predictable and unpredictable trials). For the Extinction and Exposure groups the US was not presented. Dependent variables were self-report ratings, including US expectancy and CS-evoked fear, as well as skin conductance, heart rate, and fear-potentiated startle reflex. Results: Data analysis is currently ongoing and results will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: The results will demonstrate whether current findings relating to fear of movement-related pain can be generalized to another domain, specifically having implications for extending the fear-avoidance model to more generalized chronic pain disorders that are characterized by tactile allodynia. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Traveling through {{immersive}} virtual environments (IVEs) {{by means}} of real walking is an important activity to increase naturalness of VR-based interaction. However, {{the size of the}} virtual world often exceeds the size of the tracked space so that a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not possible. Redirected walking is one concept to solve this problem of walking in IVEs by inconspicuously guiding the user on a physical path that may differ from the path the user visually perceives. When the user approaches a virtual object she can be redirected to a real proxy object that is registered to the virtual counterpart and provides passive haptic feedback. In such passive haptic environments, any number of virtual objects can be mapped to proxy objects having similar haptic properties, e. g., size, shape and texture. The user can sense a virtual object by touching its real world counterpart. Redirecting a user to a registered proxy object makes it necessary to predict the user’s intended position in the IVE. Based on this target position we determine a path through the physical space such that the user is guided to the registered proxy object. We present a taxonomy of possible redirection techniques that enable user guidance such that inconsistencies between visual and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimuli</b> are imperceptible. We describe how a user’s target in the virtual world can be predicted reliably and how a corresponding real-world path to the registered proxy object can be derived...|$|R
40|$|Processing {{proprioceptive}} {{information in}} the brain is essential for optimal postural control and can be studied with proprioceptive stimulation, provided by muscle vibration, during {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Classic electromagnetic muscle vibrators, however, cannot be used in the high-strength magnetic field of the fMRI scanner. Pneumatic vibrators offer an fMRI-compatible alternative. However, whether these devices produce reliable and valid <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimuli</b> has not been investigated, although essential for these devices to be used in longitudinal research. Test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the postural response on muscle vibration, provided by custom-made fMRI-compatible pneumatic vibrators, were assessed in a repeated-measures design. Mean center of pressure (CoP) displacements during respectively ankle muscle and back muscle vibration (45 - 60 Hz, 0. 5 mm) provided by an electromagnetic and pneumatic vibrator were measured in ten young healthy subjects. The test was repeated on the same day and again within one week. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess (a) intra- and interday reliability of the postural responses on respectively pneumatic and electromagnetic vibration, and (b) concurrent validity of the response on pneumatic compared to electromagnetic vibration. Test-retest reliability of mean CoP displacements during pneumatic vibration was good to excellent (ICCs= 0. 64 – 0. 90) and resembled that of responses on electromagnetic vibration (ICCs= 0. 64 – 0. 94). Concurrent validity of the postural effect of pneumatic vibration was good to excellent (ICCs= 0. 63 – 0. 95). In conclusion, the proposed fMRI-compatible pneumatic vibrator can be used with confidence to stimulate muscle spindles during fMRI to study central processing of proprioception. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{is often}} accompanied by hyper- and hyporeactivity to sensory stimuli. Atypical reactivity to sensory information can lead to stress reactions. Clinical practice suggests that that {{this can lead to}} long term distress and impairments in day-to-day functioning. It seems reasonable to assume that coping strategies could be of influence on the level of distress associated with atypical reactivity. Methodology: Results of 44 adults (23 men, 21 women; full scale IQ > 85) with ASD on the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ) were compared to the results on the Utrechtse Coping Lijst (UCL). Results: Preliminary analyses show that of all scales only scores on the subscale ‘Passive reaction pattern’ significantly predicted scores on the scales ‘Hyperreactivity' (b= 2. 61, t (29) = 3. 69, p=. 001, R²=. 319) and ‘Hyporeactivity' (b= 1. 61, t (29) = 2. 69, p=. 012, R²=. 199) of the GSQ. This could indicate that a passive reaction pattern influences the reactivity to stimuli, or vice versa. ‘Passive reaction pattern’ also significantly predicted the scores on some but not all of the sense-specific scales, e. g. <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimuli</b> (b=. 509, t (29) = 3. 78, p=. 001, R²=. 330). Perspectives: Investigating which coping strategies are related to hyper- or hyperactivity is essential for the development of interventions focusing on sensory issues and aiming at stress reduction for adults with ASD. The results obtained in this research will be used in the development of such an intervention. At the time of the conference the results of additional participants and analyses will be available. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Somatosensory {{feedback}} {{is an important}} component of the balance control system. Older adults, patients with diabetic neuropathy, and patients with stroke exhibit a marked deficit in the perception of cutaneous and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimuli</b> (e. g., see [1] and references therein). Such changes to the somatosensory system, which have been associated with increases in mechanoreceptor detection thresholds, may predispose individuals to falls, which are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality among older persons. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to develop bioengineering techniques and devices that improve sensorimotor function in older adults and patients with sensory deficits. Recently, it has been shown that noise can enhance the detection and transmission of weak signals in certain nonlinear systems, via a mechanism known as stochastic resonance (SR). The phenomenon of SR, which is counterintuitive given that noise has traditionally been viewed as a detriment to signal detection and transmission, is based on the concept that the flow of information through a system can be maximized by the presence of a particular, nonzero level of noise. SR was originally proposed in the context of global climate modeling as a possible explanation for the periodic recurrences of the Earth’s ice ages [2], [3]. Since then, SR-type dynamics have been demonstrated in a variety of physical and biological systems [4]-[10], including rat cutaneous afferents [11] and human muscle spindles [12]. In this article, we review our work on using input noise (mechanical and electrical, respectively) to enhance somatosensation in humans [1], [13]-[16] and improve the performance of the human balance control system [17], [18]. We also discuss bioengineering applications and future directions for SR-based techniques and devices...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{the spinal}} dorsal column and the gracile (GN) and cuneate (CN) nuclei are {{considered}} to convey somatic tactile and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimuli.</b> However, clinical and experimental studies prove their involvement in visceral nociception. Early studies in our laboratory showed that, at variance with that of laboratory animals, the human CN contains discrete subregions strongly immunoreactive to substance P (SP), a neuropeptide classically involved in pain transmission. Here we provide further information on the chemical neuroanatomy of the human dorsal column nuclei and show that the SP-immunoreactive subregions of the CN retain the neurochemical features of the protopathic relay nuclei. Tissue distribution of neuropeptides SP, calcitonin gene-related peptide, leucine- and methionine-enkephalin, somatostatin, galanin and peptide histidine-isoleucine, trophins of the Neurotrophin and Glial-derived neurotrophic factor families and related receptors, transient receptor potential vanilloid type- 1, and neuroplasticity-associated proteins growth-associated protein- 43 and polysialylatedneural cell adhesion molecule was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in postmortem specimens of medulla oblongata from subjects aged 21 gestation weeks to 78 years, with no signs of neuropathology. Immunoreactivity to the examined molecules labels neuronal elements with similar aspect and density in the GN and main CN. By contrast, in restricted areas of the CN, located along its dorsal edge or embedded in the cuneate fasciculus, immunoreactive elements show aspect, density and reciprocal distribution strikingly similar to those detected in the superficial layers of the spinal dorsal horn and trigeminal subnucleus caudalis. We propose that, at variance with that of laboratory mammals, including primates, the human CN contains clear-cut, previously uncharacterized subregions with neurochemical features reminiscent of those present in the relay nuclei for protopathic and pain perception. Moreover, the peculiar localization of the examined substances suggests that the superficial layers of those regions may constitute a “gelatinous subnucleus”. The origin and functional involvement of such innervation remains to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|The only {{recorded}} experimental {{attempt to}} determine the functional, biological significance of peripheral inhibition in the Crustacea is that of Hoffmann (1914). From a series of experiments on Astacus fluviatilis L. involving transsection of the opener inhibitor and motor axons of the cheliped, he concluded that the opener inhibitor axon of the claw responded to prolonged or repeated sensory stimulation by transmitting inhibitory impulses to the opener muscle, the peripheral inhibition thus evoked causing adaptation of the reflex opening responses of the claw to the sensory stimulation. This suggests {{that there may be}} (1) a very high degree of peripheral control of (a) the reactions of the animal to external stimuli, and perhaps also to <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>stimuli,</b> and therefore (b) of the behaviour of the animal; and (2) a correspondingly high degree of independence of this behaviour from central nervous control. It is therefore of importance to discover whether, in fact, this conclusion is valid for Astacus and other Decapod Crustacea, and if so, then to what extent the adaptation is peripherally controlled. A preliminary attempt haa been made to repeat these experiments of Hoffmann, using Potamon perlatus (M. Edw.). Experiments in which mechanical sensory stimulation was used to evoke reflex claw opening indicated that this conclusion is not applicable to P. perlatus. The adaptation of the mechanical claw openining responses which occurred with repeated sensory stimulation was not affected by transsection of either the specific opener inhibitor axon or the common inhibitor axon of the claw. It was evidently mainly due to sensory adaptation when the sensory stimuli were heavy, and to centrally controlled adaptation when the sensory stimuli were light. The significance of these results is discussed. Other effects observed {{during the course of the}} work, of electrical "sensory" stimulation, and of cerebral ganglion elimination, are also described and discussed in relation to the present problem...|$|R
