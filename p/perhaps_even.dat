5|$|According to {{historian}} John V. A. Fine, Shishman {{may have}} established his {{authority over the}} Vidin region {{as early as the}} 1270s, after the death of the previous lord of that area, Jacob Svetoslav. He was perhaps elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was likely a close relative, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> a brother, of George Terter I.|$|E

5|$|Aristocratic Heian women lived {{restricted}} and secluded lives, {{allowed to}} speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father's household until her mid-twenties or <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> to her early thirties.|$|E
5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than {{had previously been}} believed (or mapped). Thus, {{it was possible that}} an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|In April 1863, food {{shortages}} led to rioting in Richmond, as poor people robbed and looted numerous stores for food until Davis cracked down and restored order. Davis feuded bitterly with his vice president. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>even</b> more seriously, he clashed with powerful state governors who used states' rights arguments to withhold their militia units from national service and otherwise blocked mobilization plans.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians have}} argued that the Ford {{administration}} felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.|$|E
5|$|The demises of the Theological Repository and the New Review left a {{publishing}} vacuum; the arrival in London {{of the author}} Thomas Christie, who was dedicated to starting a new periodical that would replace and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> improve upon these precursors, was the primary impetus {{in the creation of}} the Analytical Review. Johnson and Christie were mutual friends of Priestley and others, and their combined interest in beginning such a journal resulted in the foundation of the Analytical Review.|$|E
5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider {{that they had a}} side effect of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E

5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus {{was at the top}} of the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{interest}} in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado. He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree in that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the Spanish Enlightenment, Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a freemason. He gave up his religious studies to study law and get married, but never actually became a priest, {{so there was no}} defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> encouraged the change of vocation.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{lost only}} one starter, Aaron Jackson, from the 2008–09 team which {{ended with a}} record of 21–13, the first time since 1981 that the school had 20 or more wins in a season. Picked to finish 12th in the Atlantic 10, Duquesne went on to finish second, losing to Temple by only five points in the conference {{championship}} game. This earned Duquesne a bid into the National Invitation Tournament, its first postseason appearance since 1994. The team was eliminated in a double-overtime first round loss to Virginia Tech, but the Dukes' unlikely success inspired the hope of a return to the NIT, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> the NCAA tournament.|$|E

5|$|Edin's Hall Broch in Berwickshire is {{the best}} {{preserved}} southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar {{to some of the}} larger Orcadian broch villages {{it is unlikely that the}} tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> the Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.|$|E
5|$|From ca. 1088 on, he {{used his}} base at Smyrna to wage war against the Byzantines. Employing Christian craftsmen, he built a fleet, with which he {{captured}} Phocaea and the eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos (except for the fortress of Methymna), Samos, Chios and Rhodes. A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle. Some modern scholars have speculated that his activities during this time {{may have been in}} conjunction, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine Greek rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete.|$|E
5|$|Nothing came of the proposal, which The Times of London {{called one}} of the most loathsome stories of the war. Historians believe that the SS, {{including}} its commander, Heinrich Himmler, intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would exclude the Soviet Union and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> Adolf Hitler. Whatever its purpose, the proposal was thwarted by the British government. They arrested Brand in Aleppo (then under British control), where he had gone to propose Eichmann's offer to the Jewish Agency, {{and put an end to}} it by leaking details to the media.|$|E

5|$|The country {{owes its}} varied topography, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> its {{emergence}} above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. New Zealand {{is part of}} Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly {{half the size of}} Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent. About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault. Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches further north.|$|E
5|$|The species's range may be relictual in nature: while Oryzomys is {{currently}} found {{along the eastern}} coast of the Gulf of California only {{as far north as}} coastal southern Sonora, the past distribution of the genus may have extended further northward, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> into the southwestern United States, and from there south into Baja California. Subsequent disappearance of Oryzomys from the northern regions would have led to its observed disjunct distribution, with O.peninsulae isolated on the peninsula. This possibility is supported by the relatively close resemblance between O.peninsulae and O.couesi mexicanus, from coastal western Mexico.|$|E
5|$|To {{test this}} idea he {{surveyed}} hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing {{that there was an}} astronomical intent to the orientation of {{at least some of the}} alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two solstices, the two equinoxes and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.|$|E
