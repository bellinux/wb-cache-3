5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. The country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program <b>prepared</b> <b>food</b> stock in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E
5|$|Dean {{was taken}} to a local police {{headquarters}} and kept in a cage overnight. North Korean troops were initially not aware of his identity. Dean {{was taken to}} a prison camp in Suwon where he was given food and medical treatment, but he began suffering from diarrhea and dysentery. Dean was then transported to the main North Korean prisoner of war camp in Seoul with other American prisoners. He attempted to keep his identity a secret but he was quickly recognized by a South Korean administrator who had worked under him before the war. Dean was moved to P'yongyang and given a larger living quarters in an underground North Korean facility. He remained sick owing to poorly <b>prepared</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the nutritional importance of non-home <b>prepared</b> <b>foods</b> for men, women and schoolchildren living in two low-income residential areas of Nairobi, and {{the sources of}} these non-home <b>prepared</b> <b>foods.</b> Design, setting and subjects: A survey was conducted in Korogocho, a slum area, and Dandora, a low-middle-income residential area. Some 241 men, 254 women and 146 children aged 9 to 14 years {{were included in the}} study. Food intake was measured using three 24 -hour recalls per individual, with special attention on the sources of all foods consumed. Results: The median proportion of daily energy intake of consumers provided by non-home <b>prepared</b> <b>foods</b> ranged from 13 % for schoolchildren in Korogocho to 36 % for men in Dandora. The median contribution to fat intake was higher than to energy, but the contributions to iron and vitamin A intakes were lower than to energy intake. Men consumed more non-home <b>prepared</b> <b>foods</b> on weekdays than at the weekend. Intakes of energy and most nutrients were below Kenyan Recommended Daily Intakes in all groups, but similar for consumers and non-consumers. In Korogocho, street foods were the main source of non-home <b>prepared</b> <b>foods.</b> In Dandora, both kiosks and street foods were major sources. Conclusions: Non-home <b>prepared</b> <b>foods</b> are an important source of energy and nutients for men, women and schoolchildren in Nairobi. In Korogocho, street foods, and in Dandora, both kiosks and street foods are the main sources of non-home <b>prepared</b> <b>foods.</b> The adequacy of energy and nutrient intakes does not differ between consumers and non-consumers of non-home <b>prepared</b> <b>foods...</b>|$|R

5|$|One of the hardest-hit counties, Curry County, {{introduced}} a ballot measure {{to add a}} 3% sales tax to pay for county services. Oregon {{is one of only}} five states in the United States with no county or state sales tax, and the tax has been voted down regularly by voters whenever it has been proposed (though some areas assess a gas tax, and two cities in tourist areas, Ashland and Yachats, assess a local tax on <b>prepared</b> <b>food).</b> In Josephine County, after a proposed property tax increase to pay for law enforcement was defeated in May 2012, the sheriff's office reduced its staff by 2/3 and released inmates from the county jail to reduce spending. Lane County released 96 prisoners from its prisons and laid off 40 law enforcement personnel to cut costs.|$|E
5|$|Several {{flights in}} and out of the state were delayed or {{canceled}}, and the Cape May-Lewes Ferry canceled travel across the Delaware Bay during the duration of Isabel. In Atlantic City, casino workers prepared for coastal flooding by placing sandbags at boardwalk entrances. New Jersey Transit workers secured its buses, railways, and light rail equipment. To ensure service would remain accessible during and after the hurricane, NJ Transit prepared backup generators, pumps, and chainsaws, with workers inspecting trains and the paths of the lines. FEMA mobilized and dispatched an Urban Search and Rescue Task Force of 28people to the state for possible rescue duty. Days before the storm made landfall, the Salvation Army <b>prepared</b> <b>food</b> and aid for potentially affected citizens. In anticipation for the effects of Isabel, Governor Jim McGreevey declared a state of emergency, which allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deal with the situation.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica, {{which was}} {{forecast}} {{to bear the}} brunt of Hurricane Dean, underwent the most extensive preparations. The Jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans, including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections, to allow residents to prepare for the storm. Curfews were put in place for parts of the island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work. More than 1,000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. Evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1,000 water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program <b>prepared</b> <b>food</b> stocks in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team tried to reach Jamaica, but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled. The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed, and the North-West Caribbean Donor Group met to decide what actions would need to be taken.|$|E

25|$|In October 1988, Orr {{publicly}} {{announced the}} upcoming release of his cookbook, which became his first published work. His initial {{idea for the}} cookbook had been a one-page sheet, consisting of just nine recipes. Three were recipes for mixed drinks, while the remaining six were for <b>prepared</b> <b>food.</b> The cookbook was expanded to include contributions from other notable Nebraskan men, including Tonight Show host Johnny Carson and football coach Tom Osborne. Ultimately, Orr wrote the cookbook to include recipe submissions from famous {{men and women with}} ties to Nebraska or the Orrs. Notable contributors to Orr's cookbook, in addition to Carson and Osborne, included then United States First Lady Barbara Bush, former First Lady Nancy Reagan, Katharine Hepburn, Dick Cavett, and Warren Buffett.|$|E
25|$|Distributions to {{qualified}} {{persons were}} monthly. However, a certain {{proportion of the}} population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply. To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with <b>prepared</b> <b>food.</b> It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.|$|E

25|$|The Tennessee {{income tax}} {{does not apply}} to {{salaries}} and wages, but most income from stock, bonds and notes receivable is taxable. All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the $1,250 single exemption or the $2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6%. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%. Food is taxed at a lower rate of 5.25%, but candy, dietary supplements and <b>prepared</b> <b>food</b> are taxed at the full 7% rate. Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5% and 9.75%, one of the highest levels in the nation. Intangible property is assessed on the shares of stock of stockholders of any loan company, investment company, insurance company or for-profit cemetery companies. The assessment ratio is 40% of the value multiplied by the tax rate for the jurisdiction. Tennessee imposes an inheritance tax on decedents' estates that exceed maximum single exemption limits ($1,000,000 for deaths in 2006 and thereafter).|$|E
500|$|Most {{apartments in}} Rome lacked kitchens, though a {{charcoal}} brazier {{could be used}} for rudimentary cookery. <b>Prepared</b> <b>food</b> was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls (tabernae, cauponae, popinae, thermopolia).
