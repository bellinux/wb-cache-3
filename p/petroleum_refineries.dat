25|$|In the mid-1950s, {{the first}} noble metal {{catalytic}} reforming process (the Platformer process) was commercialized. At the same time, the catalytic hydrodesulfurization of the naphtha feed to such reformers was also commercialized. In the decades that followed, various proprietary catalytic hydrodesulfurization processes, {{such as the}} one depicted in the flow diagram below, have been commercialized. Currently, virtually all of the <b>petroleum</b> <b>refineries</b> worldwide have one or more HDS units.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{production}} and <b>petroleum</b> <b>refineries</b> will usually employ computers for logging and for limit testing the many temperatures {{associated with a}} process, typically numbering in the hundreds. For such cases, a number of thermocouple leads {{will be brought to}} a common reference block (a large block of copper) containing the second thermocouple of each circuit. The temperature of the block is in turn measured by a thermistor. Simple computations are used to determine the temperature at each measured location.|$|E

25|$|A heat {{exchanger}} is a device used to transfer heat between a solid object and a fluid, or between {{two or more}} fluids. The fluids may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing {{or they may be}} in direct contact. They are widely used in space heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, power stations, chemical plants, petrochemical plants, <b>petroleum</b> <b>refineries,</b> natural-gas processing, and sewage treatment. The classic example of a {{heat exchanger}} is found in an internal combustion engine in which a circulating fluid known as engine coolant flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air. Another example is the heat sink, which is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant.|$|E

25|$|New Orleans {{is located}} {{near to the}} Gulf of Mexico and its many oil rigs. Louisiana ranks fifth among states in oil {{production}} and eighth in reserves. It has {{two of the four}} Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) storage facilities: West Hackberry in Cameron Parish and Bayou Choctaw in Iberville Parish. The area hosts 17 <b>petroleum</b> <b>refineries,</b> with a combined crude oil distillation capacity of nearly , the second highest after Texas. Louisiana's numerous ports include the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), which is capable of receiving the largest oil tankers. Given the quantity of oil imports, Louisiana is home to many major pipelines: Crude Oil (Exxon, Chevron, BP, Texaco, Shell, Scurloch-Permian, Mid-Valley, Calumet, Conoco, Koch Industries, Unocal, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Locap); Product (TEPPCO Partners, Colonial, Plantation, Explorer, Texaco, Collins); and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Dixie, TEPPCO, Black Lake, Koch, Chevron, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, Dow Chemical Company, Bridgeline, FMP, Tejas, Texaco, UTP). Several energy companies have regional headquarters in the area, including Royal Dutch Shell, Eni and Chevron. Other energy producers and oilfield services companies are headquartered in the city or region, and the sector supports a large professional services base of specialized engineering and design firms, as well as a term office for the federal government's Minerals Management Service.|$|E

"The {{industrial}} megaplex {{that begins}} {{on the east}} side of Houston and continues uninterrupted to the Gulf of Mexico, 50miles away, is the largest concentration of <b>petroleum</b> <b>refineries,</b> petrochemical companies, and storage structures on Earth." [...] The city grew from a small commercial center in 1900 to one of the largest cities in the United States during the decades following the era. [...] This period, however, changed all of Texas' commercial centers (and developed the Beaumont/Port Arthur area, where the boom began).|$|E
500|$|Distillation {{is one of}} {{the unit}} {{operations}} of chemical engineering. Continuous distillation is used widely in the chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled. Such industries are the natural gas processing, petrochemical production, coal tar processing, liquor production, liquified air separation, hydrocarbon solvents production and similar industries, but it finds its widest application in <b>petroleum</b> <b>refineries.</b> In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a very complex multicomponent mixture that must be separated and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected, only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, which are called fractions. [...] These fractions are the origin of the term fractional distillation or fractionation. [...] It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these fractions any further based on product requirements and economics.|$|E

2500|$|Industrial {{cooling towers}} {{can be used}} to remove heat from various sources such as {{machinery}} or heated process material. [...] The primary use of large, industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating cooling water systems used in power plants, <b>petroleum</b> <b>refineries,</b> petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants, food processing plants, semi-conductor plants, and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns, for cooling liquid in crystallization, etc. The circulation rate of cooling water in a typical 700 MW coal-fired power plant with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour (315,000 US gallons per minute) and the circulating water requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent (i.e., 3,600 cubic metres an hour).|$|E
2500|$|In the {{resulting}} Battle of Pusan Perimeter (August–September 1950), the U.S. Army withstood KPA attacks meant {{to capture the}} city at the Naktong Bulge, P'ohang-dong, and Taegu. The United States Air Force (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic. KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night. To deny matériel to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, <b>petroleum</b> <b>refineries,</b> and harbors, while the U.S. Navy air forces attacked transport hubs. Consequently, the over-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south. [...] On 27 August, 67th Fighter Squadron aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in Chinese territory and the Soviet Union called the UN Security Council's attention to China's complaint about the incident. The U.S. proposed that a commission of India and Sweden determine what the U.S. should pay in compensation but the Soviets vetoed the U.S. proposal.|$|E
