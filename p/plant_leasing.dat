50|$|The {{plant was}} {{designed}} to manufacture approximately 2,000 Hyundai Sonatas per week. Subsequently, Chrysler and Hyundai considered a joint venture that would have Chrysler rebranding the Sonata manufactured at Bromont, only to later announce the deal had failed. The Bromont plant was operational for four years before it closed in 1994, with Hyundai's sales unable to support the plant. Hyundai subsequently sold the plant to Olymbec Inc., which, in turn, subdivided the <b>plant</b> <b>leasing</b> the former paint and assembly plant to Goodyear from February 2007 and, later, the former metal stamping portion of the plant to AAER Inc., a manufacturer of wind turbines based in Quebec.|$|E
40|$|Botswana {{has adopted}} {{policies}} in its construction industry aimed at developing its citizen contractors {{to a standard}} comparable to any other. Towards this end, it has instituted a number of interventions {{one of which is}} to provide these contractors with an advance loan to enable them mobilize on site. This facility greatly enhances their chances of success. This study is an evaluation of this scheme and provides a valuable feedback on the scheme's effectiveness, its shortcomings as well as offering some suggestions as to how its administration can be improved. This it does through a critical analysis of the performance of beneficiaries over a six-year period, identifies reasons for their failure and tries to address concerns of the key players in the application of the scheme. The major findings are that the scheme has not been as successful as expected. The biggest problem seems to be the diversion of loan funds from their intended purpose. Rigorous sustained training of contractors and monitoring of their progress in skills attainment is the recommended solution. The Government's intervention should also target other role players in the industry for support including emerging suppliers and <b>plant</b> <b>leasing</b> companies, to break down existing monopolistic structures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a real option model is {{developed}} {{to examine the}} critical factors affecting the decision to lease agricultural land to a company installing a PV power <b>plant.</b> The <b>leasing</b> payment is certain while the net revenues from agriculture are uncertain.

Packard's Utica, Michigan, engine <b>plant</b> was <b>leased</b> to Curtiss-Wright during 1956 (and eventually sold to them), marking the end of genuine Packard production. Packard-badged cars were produced for two more years, but they were essentially rebadged Studebakers. The Packard V8, introduced only two years earlier, was therefore no longer available. It was replaced with the Studebaker 289 in³ (4.7 L) V8 {{with the addition of}} a McCulloch supercharger, giving the same [...] output as the Packard engine.
