5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} in the secluded south-west corner of the Palace of Westminster, overlooking the King's garden in the Privy Palace, the most <b>private</b> <b>part</b> of Westminster. The tower was positioned {{so as not to}} encroach on the existing palace, but this meant it was built on top of land owned by the neighbouring Westminster Abbey. It took six years for the Abbey to convince the King to agree to compensate for them for this annexation. William Usshborne, one of Edward's officials, was blamed for this and, when he later choked to death while eating a fish from a pond in the palace, the monks argued that this was divine justice {{for his role in the}} affair.|$|E
25|$|The task {{of making}} a {{recommendation}} for a permanent solution for the national airline was given to a new Civil Aviation Board, which had Falck as a board member. They came with their recommendation on 28 November 1945, which favored a single, privately owned Norwegian flag carrier, with a broad ownership, who would receive a concession for the operation of all domestic and international routes. Following the Norwegian parliamentary election, 1945 on 8 October, the Labor Party received a majority, with 76 of 150 seats. Also the Norwegian Communist Party did its best election ever, receiving 11 seats. A proposition {{was made by the}} Ministry of Defense on 18 January 1946, and sent to parliament. It discussed several options, such as creating a government agency or a state-owned limited company, permitting several airlines to operate the different routes, and looked at the possibility that the shipowners were purchasing DNL shares to hinder competition with their shipping lines. It concluded with a part <b>private,</b> <b>part</b> state-owned company was preferred, and that the state should purchase shares for NOK5 million. While the Labor Party at the time was in favor of nationalization, the proposition stated that this was a possibility to limit the state's spending of dearly needed capital.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rear section}} (Acehnese: seuramoe likoot, [...] "back terrace") {{is similar to}} the front section, in that it is a spacious long gallery, but lacks a main entrance.

2500|$|The Basilica is {{the first}} part visible from the Clivus Palatinus, the road that connects the Roman Forum to the Palatine Hill. A long portico (Po) runs {{alongside}} the domus on the west and north sides {{at the end of}} which is the main entrance (E) which seems to serve both the public and the <b>private</b> <b>part</b> of the palace. Once inside the visitor enters the Lararium (L) housing a detachment of the Praetorian guard. It is the smallest and most poorly preserved room in the palace. Behind it was once a staircase providing access to the Domus Augustana. Below this room parts of the earlier House of the Griffins have been excavated and from which exquisite decorations have been removed to the Antiquarium.|$|E

60|$|He {{branched}} {{off through}} Covent Garden. On this sultry day of late July the garbage-tainted {{air of the}} old market offended him, and Soho seemed more than ever the disenchanted home of rapscallionism. Alone, the Restaurant Bretagne, neat, daintily painted, with its blue tubs and the dwarf trees therein, retained an aloof and Frenchified self-respect. It was the slack hour, and pale trim waitresses were preparing the little tables for dinner. Soames went through into the <b>private</b> <b>part.</b> To his discomfiture Annette answered his knock. She, too, looked pale and dragged down by the heat.|$|E
60|$|What wonder is it, then, {{that being}} born for {{a blessing to}} mankind, your {{supposed}} death in that engagement was so generally lamented through the nation!

60|$|The prince {{approached}} and tied up his horse near the negro's head. Then he let fall the Bismillah from his lips, entered {{the garden and}} walked through it till {{he came to the}} <b>private</b> <b>part,</b> delighting in the great trees, the lovely verdure, and the flowery borders. In the inner garden there were very many deer. These signed to him with eye and foot to go back, for that this was enchanted ground; but he did not understand them, and thought their pretty gestures were a welcome. After a while he reached a palace which had a porch more splendid than Caesar's, and was built of gold and silver bricks. In its midst was a high seat, overlaid with fine carpets, and into it opened eight doors, each having opposite to it a marble basin.|$|E

60|$|Poverty had {{compelled}} Mad. de la Rocheaimard to {{seek the}} cheapest respectable lodgings she could find on reaching town. In anticipation of a long residence, and, for the consideration of a considerable abatement in price, she had fortunately paid six months' rent in advance; thus removing from Adrienne the apprehension of having no {{place in which to}} cover her head, for some time to come. These lodgings were in an entresol of the Place Royale, a perfectly reputable and <b>private</b> <b>part</b> of the town, and in many respects were highly eligible. Many of the menial offices, too, were to be performed by the wife of the porter, according to the bargain, leaving to poor Adrienne, however, all the care of her grandmother, whose room she seldom quitted, the duties of nurse and cook, and the still more important task of finding the means of subsistence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I may be {{catching}} myself {{any time}} doing things of which I have no conception," [...] he thought. And {{as he was}} passing near the mizzen-mast he perceived a coil of rope left lying on the deck by the oversight of the sweepers. By an impulse which had nothing mysterious in it, he stooped as he went by {{with the intention of}} picking it up and hanging it up on its proper pin. This movement brought his head down {{to the level of the}} glazed end of the after skylight--the lighted skylight of the most <b>private</b> <b>part</b> of the saloon, consecrated to the exclusiveness of Captain Anthony's married life; the part, let me remind you, cut off from the rest of that forbidden space by a pair of heavy curtains. I mention these curtains because at this point Mr Powell himself recalled the existence of that unusual arrangement, to my mind.|$|E
6000|$|Jacob {{had endured}} a cheap {{dinner at a}} popular {{restaurant}} and circle seats at a music hall with uncomplaining good humour, but the evening, if anything, had increased his depression. He wandered {{into one of the}} clubs of which he was a member, only to find there was not a soul there whom he had ever seen before in his life. He came out within half an hour, but a spirit of unrest had seized him. Instead of going up to his rooms, he wandered into the foyer of the great hotel, in the <b>private</b> <b>part</b> of which his suite was situated, and watched the people coming out from supper. Again, as he sat alone, he was conscious of that feeling of isolation. Every man seemed to be accompanied by a woman who for the moment, at any rate, was content to give her whole attention to the task of entertaining her companion. There were little parties, older people some of them, but always with that connecting link of friendship and good-fellowship. Jacob sat grimly back in the shadows and watched. Perhaps it would have been better, he thought, if he had remained a poor traveller. He would have found some little, hardly used, teashop waitress, or perhaps the daughter of one of his customers, or a little shopgirl whom he had hustled in the Tube,--some one whose life might have touched his and brought into it the genial flavour of companionship. As it was-- ...|$|E

60|$|In our rambles about town, we {{went into}} a bookseller's shop to inquire {{if he had any}} {{description}} of Boston for sale. He offered me (or, rather, produced for inspection, not supposing that I would buy it) a quarto history of the town, published by subscription, nearly forty years ago. The bookseller showed himself a well-informed and affable man, and a local antiquary, to whom a party of inquisitive strangers were a godsend. He had met with several Americans, who, at various times, had come on pilgrimages to this place, and he had been in correspondence with others. Happening to have heard the name of one member of our party, he showed us great courtesy and kindness, and invited us into his inner domicile, where, as he modestly intimated, he kept a few articles which it might interest us to see. So we went with him through the shop, up stairs, into the <b>private</b> <b>part</b> of his establishment; and, really, {{it was one of the}} rarest adventures I ever met with, to stumble upon this treasure of a man, with his treasury of antiquities and curiosities, veiled behind the unostentatious front of a bookseller's shop, in a very moderate line of village business. The two up-stair rooms into which he introduced us were so crowded with inestimable articles, that we were almost afraid to stir for fear of breaking some fragile thing that had been accumulating value for unknown centuries.|$|E

6000|$|The soldier, brutal as he was, grew insensibly {{to have a}} {{kindness}} for a man, who was so {{much concerned}} in his advantages, and took pleasure in hearing him discourse not only of war, and sea affairs, but also of religion and morality. In conclusion, he made some reflections on the horror of his life, and felt even some remorse of conscience for it.

[...] "Ah Father," [...] said the soldier, [...] "I have not been at confession these many years!"

[...] "The vicar was, in my opinion," [...] said Xavier, [...] "somewhat too severe, to treat you in that manner. He had perhaps his reasons for that usage, and I have mine to treat you otherwise. For indeed the mercies of our Lord are infinite, and God would have us as indulgent to our brethren, as he himself is to us. Thus, when the sins, of which you find yourself guilty, are a thousand times more numerous and more crying than they are, I shall have the patience to hear them all, and shall make no difficulty of giving you absolution, provided you take those thoughts and resolutions which I shall endeavour to infuse into you." ...|$|E
