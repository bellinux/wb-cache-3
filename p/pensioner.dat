5|$|Former Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake became {{manager in}} 1952 and {{proceeded}} to modernise the club. He removed the club's Chelsea <b>pensioner</b> crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League and the FA Chelsea were persuaded {{to withdraw from the}} competition before it started. Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.|$|E

Tikhonov began his political career in local industry, and worked his way up the hierarchy of Soviet industrial ministries. He was appointed deputy chairman of the Gosplan in 1963. After Alexei Kosygin's resignation Tikhonov was voted into office as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. In this position, he refrained from taking effective measures to reform the Soviet economy, a need which was strongly evidenced during the earlymid-1980s. He retired from active politics in 1989 as a <b>pensioner.</b> Tikhonov died on 1 June 1997.|$|E

5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co. Nominating somebody {{to receive benefits}} of a pension fund should the <b>pensioner</b> die is also not a valid disposition, as in Re Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, and neither is nominating a beneficiary under a life insurance policy, as in Gold v Hill. Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E

5|$|On 11 May 1941 {{the station}} was officially {{declared}} closed. The last recorded funeral carried on the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea <b>Pensioner</b> Edward Irish (1868–1941), buried on 11 April 1941. The SR offered the LNC the temporary use of platform 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to allow the service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling {{to and from the}} cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery had little reason to choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains over the SR's fast and frequent services to their own Brookwood railway station. The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which bona fide mourners could still travel cheaply to the cemetery on the 11.57am service to Brookwood (the SR service closest to the LNC's traditional departure time), but the SR management (themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage) refused to entertain any compromise.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{potential}} conflict of interest between a pension fund sponsor and future <b>pensioners</b> when they share unequally in the pension fund performance. Thus when a scheme offers a yearly guaranteed minimum return to <b>pensioners,</b> as is presently the case with German Pensionskassen, the managers cannot afford to invest in risky assets and consequently, <b>pensioners</b> end up with safe but very low expected returns. We examine optimal investment strategies for fund managers under alternative profit sharing rules and seek the rules that are most beneficial to <b>pensioners.</b> We find the current yearly performance sharing rule imposed on Pensionskassen could be tilted in favor of managers without impairing the welfare of <b>pensioners.</b> We also find that the welfare of <b>pensioners</b> would be greatly enhanced if the guaranteed minimum return were applied to cumulative returns since inception of the scheme rather than to yearly returns. The small ensuing credit risk of <b>pensioners</b> on fund managers could be {{kept to a minimum}} by proper regulation; this would push fund managers to adopt safe constant proportionality portfolio insurance (CPPI) styl...|$|R
