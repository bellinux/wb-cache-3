40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of regional convergence of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>outputs</b> in China from 1952 – 2004, particularly focusing on considering the presence of multiple structural breaks in the provincial-level panel data.

Next, the test is applied to China’s provincial real <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>outputs</b> to examine the regional convergence in China. To obtain the p-values of unit root tests for each province, which are combined to construct the panel unit root test, this study assumes three data generating processes: a driftless random walk process, an ARMA process, and an AR process with cross-sectionally dependent errors in Monte Carlo simulation. The results obtained from this study reveal that the convergence of the provincial <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>outputs</b> exists {{in each of the three}} geographically classified regions—the Eastern, Central, and Western regions—of China. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{topics of}} {{international}} and inter-regional research {{in the past decade}} has been that of convergence or divergence in real outputs and incomes across countries and regions within individual countries. Most empirical studies, however, tend to focus on only one measure of economic performance (<b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GDP or value added <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> or <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> incomes) rather than multiple measures of performance and fail to conduct comparative studies of multiple measures across countries. Do nations differ in the comparative degree of inequality across alternative measures of economic performance? This research paper attempts to address these past shortcomings by focusing on identifying, analyzing and comparing the degree of inequality and the degree of convergence or divergence overtime in three important economic performance measures - <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> real <b>outputs,</b> family and household incomes, and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> incomes with families - in regions of Italy and the U. S. over the past two decades. In this study, we analyze three measures of regional economic performance in each country and three statistical measures of regional inequality: the coefficient of variation (Sigma convergence), the relative size {{of the differences between the}} highest and the lowest regions in <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>outputs</b> and family incomes, and simple regression tests for the unconditional convergence of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>outputs</b> or family/median household incomes across regions of Italy and the U. S. from the early 1980 s to the late 1990 s. Findings in this paper will illustrate the comparative degree of inequality in regional economic performance measures within Italy and the U. S., estimate differences in the degree of inequality across these three measures within both countries, and analyze convergence trends over time in regional economic performance for each of these measures within both countries. Factors contributing to the remaining differences in regional inequality within these two countries will be identified, and future research issues will be reviewed. ...|$|R

We provide a simple model that predicts convergence in government spending under certain assumptions. We show that Barro’s (1990) model of endogenous growth with government spending provides one justification for the necessary assumptions and therefore supports the convergence hypothesis. We also discuss the possibility that increasing globalization has led to convergence in government spending. Our cross-country empirical investigation provides compelling evidence of convergence in <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> government capital spending, <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> government consumption spending and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> government education spending.

The initial economic condition {{was measured by}} three variables: the <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> industrial <b>output</b> in 1952, population size in 1952, and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> arable land in 1952. In the model of industrial output growth from 1978 to 1998, we also control the <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> industrial <b>output</b> in 1978. Geographic variables consist of the average altitude, the share of flat ground whose slope gradient is less than 15 ° in total county area 23, the distance to Shanghai, {{as well as the}} length of coastline (equal to zero for an inland county). The last two variables reflect a county’s location advantage via its access to a superbusiness hub (Shanghai) or a port. To control the effect of human capital on long-term economic growth, we draw on Zhu and Xie (1980) work and use the total number of chinshihs (进士) in each county during the Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty as a proxy for the historical education tradition. Moreover, we take the logarithm of the following four control variables: average altitude, length of coastline, number of chinshihs, and distance to Shanghai.
