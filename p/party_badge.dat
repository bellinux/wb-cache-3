25|$|Raeder {{claimed in}} his 1957 memoirs Mein Leben {{that he had}} first learned that the regime in which he served so long was a {{criminal}} regime in March 1945 when he visited his old colleague, the former Defence Minister Otto Gessler in a hospital when he was recovering from the torture he received in a concentration camp. Shocked at Gessler's appearance, Raeder decided to protest against the Nazi regime by not wearing the Nazi Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> that he had worn until then. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett mocked Raeder for taking until March 1945 {{to discover that the}} Nazi regime was a criminal regime, and called his protest via not wearing his Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> pathetic.|$|E
25|$|To the displeasure of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, it was {{discovered}} that neither Emmy nor Edda's nanny were Nazi Party members, but this was soon corrected when Göring arranged for Emmy to join the party. On Hitler's instructions, she received the Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge,</b> a rare award originally only for founding members, long-term supporters or people who had shown outstanding service to the party.|$|E
50|$|These epithets {{instantly}} {{caught the}} public fancy {{and had already}} become <b>party</b> <b>badges</b> when the estates met in 1738. This Riksdag was to mark another turning-point in Swedish history.|$|R

5000|$|The Treachery Act of 1934 was a German law {{established}} by the Third Reich on 20 December 1934. Known as the Heimtückegesetz, its official title was the [...] "Law against Treacherous Attacks on the State and Party and for the Protection of Party Uniforms" [...] (Gesetz gegen heimtückische Angriffe auf Staat und Partei und zum Schutz der Parteiuniformen). It established penalties for the abuse of Nazi <b>Party</b> <b>badges</b> and uniforms, restricted the right to freedom of speech, and criminalized all remarks causing putative severe damage {{to the welfare of}} the Third Reich, the prestige of the Nazi government or the Nazi Party.|$|R
25|$|Hitler summons Dr. Schenck, Dr. Werner Haase, {{and nurse}} Erna Flegel to the bunker {{to thank them}} for their medical {{services}} for the wounded. Dr. Haase explains to Hitler the best method for suicide {{as well as for}} administering poison to Hitler's dog, Blondi. Hitler eats his final meal and then bids farewell to the bunker staff. He gives Magda Goebbels his own Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> Number 1. Emotionally overcome by the gesture, Magda tries to convince Hitler to reconsider suicide. Hitler and Eva then kill themselves and, as per his orders, are cremated in the Chancellery garden.|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, a [...] "Gold Cross with Diamonds" [...] {{grade was}} proposed, the {{criteria}} being {{the birth of}} twelve children, although {{in at least one}} document that number was stated to be sixteen (double the number required for the golden order). [...] There were no known presentations of the decoration, although a prototype drawing was reportedly shown to Magda Goebbels. She would later be awarded the ad hoc and unofficial title [...] "First Mother of the Reich" [...] when Adolf Hitler gave her his Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> just prior to his suicide.|$|E
2500|$|... Two Japanese {{soldiers}} have {{climbed over the}} garden wall and are about to break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my <b>party</b> <b>badge,</b> they return the same way. In {{one of the houses}} in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital. (...) Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College Girls alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers." ...|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "1929 Nuremberg <b>Party</b> Badge", the <b>badge</b> was awarded to those Nazi Party members who had {{attended}} the national Nazi Party rally {{in the city of}} Nuremberg. After the founding of Nazi Germany, the Nuremberg <b>Party</b> Day <b>Badge</b> took on a symbol of the [...] "Old Guard" [...] and was frequently displayed by high-ranking leaders, including Adolf Hitler (who normally did not wear an excess of Nazi awards) at subsequent Nuremberg rallies.|$|R
50|$|The Nuremberg <b>Party</b> Day <b>Badge</b> (German: Nürnberger Parteitagsabzeichen 1929) was {{a highly}} revered {{political}} decoration of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). It was established on 15 August 1929 and was the second badge recognized as a national award of the NSDAP.|$|R
5000|$|Count Arvid Horn, {{leader of}} the Caps, had governed Sweden since 1719. Following Sweden's defeat in the Great Northern War, he had {{reversed}} the traditional policy of Sweden by keeping France at a distance, drawing near to Great Britain, and making no significant effort to regain Sweden's lost Baltic empire. Those opposed to this peaceful policy derisively nicknamed his adherents [...] "Night-caps", and these epithets became <b>party</b> <b>badges</b> when the estates met in 1738. The Hats routed the government, and Horn was compelled to retire after 33 years in high office. Now in power, the Hats aimed at restoring Sweden to her former position as a great power, and sought to renew the traditional alliance with France. France welcomed {{the rise of a}} Swedish government which would uphold French interests in northern Europe, and Versailles generously financed the Hat party for the next two generations.|$|R
2500|$|Raeder {{testified that}} he was an apolitical {{professional}} who was just doing his duty, and to the extent he thought about politics, he disliked the Nazi regime. Raeder {{testified that he}} was deeply horrified {{by the nature of the}} Nazi regime when he saw how badly Gessler had been tortured in March 1945, stated he had stopped wearing his Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> to protest the Nazi regime after he had seen what had been done to Gessler, and he had frequently made [...] "serious protests" [...] against the Nazi regime during private meetings with Hitler, so it was unfair to blame him for the crimes of the Third Reich. This in turn led him to be questioned by Maxwell Fyfe about his speech on Heroes' Day on 12 March 1939 praising Hitler [...] "...for the clear and unmerciful declaration of war against Bolshevism and International Jewry, whose drive for destruction of peoples we have felt quite enough in our racial body". Raeder testified in response to Maxwell Fyfe's question about his Heroes' Day speech to his belief that starting in 1917 [...] "International Jewry had destroyed the resistance of the German people...and had gained an excessively large and oppressive influence in German affairs" [...] and all of the anti-Semitic measures of the Nazi regime which presumably included genocide were merely just acts of German self-defence. Goda wrote that Raeder by his own testimony disproved his own claims to have been an apolitical professional who was against the Nazi regime, and instead established {{that he was an}} anti-Semite who willingly served the Nazi regime because of his hatred for Jews. Taylor commented about Raeder's claim to have been just an apolitical professional doing his job was meaningless because: [...] "It is an innocent and respectable business to be a locksmith, but it is nonetheless a crime if the locksmith turns his talents into picking the locks of his neighbours and looting their homes." [...] Raeder's claims to have been an apolitical officer who objected to the Nazis involved him in many testy exchanges with Maxwell Fyfe. Maxwell Fyfe charged that Raeder had been part of the effort to cover up that it was an U-boat that sank the Athenia and to falsely accuse the British of sinking the Athenia. Raeder claimed that he had been [...] "very indignant" [...] about his government's claim that Britain had sunk the Athenia, which led Maxwell Fyfe to remark that he had done nothing to express that [...] "indignation", just as he claimed to have been angry about the false charges of homosexuality against Werner von Fritsch, where he had also done nothing after Fritsch had been cleared.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1945, Magda Goebbels was {{presented}} with Hitler's Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> and declared as [...] "First Mother of the Reich". Under Nazi law, Hitler's verbal decree had technically created a new grade to the Nazi <b>Party</b> <b>Badge,</b> although status as an officially recognized decoration was never recorded.|$|E
5000|$|The Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> was {{the basic}} Nazi <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> with the {{addition}} of a gold wreath completely encircling the badge. The badge was awarded in two sizes: 30.5 mm for wearing on uniforms and 24 mm for other use. Adolf Hitler's own Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> had the number '1'. He awarded it to Magda Goebbels in late April 1945 and proclaimed her as the [...] "First Mother of the Reich". The '1' badge was stolen from a display in Russia in 2005. The guards thought that a cat had set off the alarms and this allowed the burglar to escape.|$|E
2500|$|Hudal {{is said to}} have {{received}} a Golden Nazi <b>Party</b> membership <b>badge,</b> but this is disputed. In 1937, in Vienna, Hudal published a book entitled The Foundations of National Socialism, with an imprimatur from Archbishop Innitzer, which was an enthusiastic endorsement of Hitler. Hudal sent Hitler a copy with a handwritten dedication praising him as [...] "the new Siegfried of Germany's greatness".|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't you {{ashamed of}} yourselves, lads?" [...] said the severe voice of Willis, from above. The men rose sulkily; and Frank hastened on, as ready to cry as ever {{he had been}} in his life. Poor fellow! he had been labouring among these people for now twelve months, as no man had ever laboured before, and he felt that he had not won the {{confidence}} of a single human being,--not even of the old women, who took his teaching {{for the sake of his}} charity, and who scented popery, all the while, in words in which there was no popery, and in doctrines which were just the same, on the whole, as those of the dissenting preacher, simply because he would sprinkle among them certain words and phrases which had become [...] "suspect," [...] as <b>party</b> <b>badges.</b> His church was all but empty; the general excuse was, that it was a mile from the town: but Frank knew that that was not the true reason; that all the parish had got it into their heads that he had a leaning to popery; that he was going over to Rome; that he was probably a Jesuit in disguise.|$|R
5000|$|By 1927, the Sturmabteilung had greatly {{increased}} its numbers and had standardized the [...] "brown shirt" [...] uniform which would thereafter be permanently {{associated with that}} group: shirt, tie, breeches, boots, and cylindrical kepi, all brown. As the SS was at this time a small unit within the SA, SS personnel during this period likewise wore brown shirt uniforms but distinguished themselves as an elite among the SA by wearing black neckties and black kepis with Totenkopf and <b>Party</b> eagle <b>badges.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{swastika}} {{was widely}} used in Europe {{at the start of}} the 20th century. It symbolized many things to the Europeans, with the most common symbolism being of good luck and auspiciousness. In the wake of widespread popular usage, in post-World War I Germany, the newly established Nazi Party formally adopted the Hakenkreuz ( [...] , meaning [...] "hooked-cross") in 1920. The emblem was a black swastika (hooks branching clockwise) rotated 45 degrees on a white circle on a red background. This insignia was used on the <b>party's</b> flag, <b>badge,</b> and armband.|$|R

5|$|From {{the time}} he had fled to Germany, Meyszner had been engaged in a dispute {{regarding}} his membership in the Nazi Party. He had maintained that the Venice Agreement meant that he {{and other members of the}} Styrian Home Guard had been accepted into the Nazi Party with prestigious low membership numbers corresponding to the dates of their entry into the Home Guard. However, the treasurer of the Nazi Party, Franz Xaver Schwarz did not accept the Agreement and determined that the members of the Styrian Home Guard were not automatically transferred to the Nazi Party. This became an issue when Hitler decided to mark the 10th anniversary of his seizure of power and tasked his private secretary and head of the Nazi Party Chancellery, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, to determine who should be issued one of a strictly limited number of Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badges</b> to mark the anniversary. Meyszner, who had been recommended by Himmler, accepted that his party membership was retrospectively determined to be 1 June 1938 and he was allocated a party number of 6,119,650. Thus he effectively joined the Nazi Party as late as 1943. Due to these decisions, Meyszner did not qualify as an Alter Kämpfer (Old Fighter) and Himmler had to intervene on behalf of Meyszner to ensure he received the badge. Meyszner was one of only five SS men that Himmler deemed worthy of this particular award.|$|R
50|$|Hitler was, {{by default}} as Führer, the supreme {{commander}} of every Nazi paramilitary organization, {{but he never}} adopted extra ranks in these organizations nor did he have special uniforms to denote his position (for instance, there was no special SS uniform or insignia for Hitler, {{even though he was}} considered SS member #1 and outranked Heinrich Himmler). Hitler also technically qualified for every Nazi political decoration, but in practice only wore his World War I Iron Cross, the Golden Nazi Party Pin, and the Wound badge in Black. During Nazi rallies at Nuremberg in the early 1930s, Hitler temporarily wore the 1929 Nuremberg <b>Party</b> Day <b>Badge,</b> but discontinued this after about 1935.|$|R
5000|$|Members took {{to wearing}} vermin badges (a chrome badge {{featuring}} a rat {{and the word}} VERMIN). A whole hierarchy was established, so that those who recruited ten new <b>party</b> members wore <b>badges</b> identifying them as vile vermin; those who recruited twenty were very vile vermin. Margaret Thatcher was an early {{member of the group}} and rose through the ranks to become a [...] "Chief Rat". In her memoirs, Thatcher described another [...] "Chief Rat" [...] as having lived somewhere in Twickenham. The club boasted a membership of between 105-120,000 at its height.|$|R
50|$|The party badges {{listed below}} are those Hitler had {{received}} and sometimes wore on his various party uniforms. In 1936, their {{order of precedence}} was set, but by 1938 the Golden <b>Party</b> <b>Badge</b> {{was the only one}} he wore on a regular basis.|$|E

50|$|Returning to London in 1918, Beamish set up The Britons as a {{specifically}} antisemitic propaganda organisation and also {{became involved with}} the Silver <b>Badge</b> <b>Party.</b> He ran as an independent in a 1918 by-election in Clapham on an anti-immigrant platform, supported by right-wing MP Noel Pemberton Billing, but did not win, receiving 43% of the votes cast. Along with Lieutenant-Commander E.M. Frazer, Beamish produced a poster in 1919 denouncing Commissioner of Works Sir Alfred Mond (Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett) as a traitor. This poster resulted in a libel suit filed by Mond, who was successful and was awarded £5000, although Beamish left Britain without paying.|$|R
50|$|The {{group was}} founded in London in 1919 by Henry Hamilton Beamish, who had {{developed}} an antisemitic viewpoint when he spent time in South Africa. Beamish wrote The Britons' constitution and the group was launched {{at a meeting of}} 14 people chaired by John Henry Clarke. The group held monthly meetings in London and launched its own publishing imprint The Judaic Publishing Company Ltd which was to be the source of much anti-Semitic and conspiratorial literature. Beamish became involved with the Silver <b>Badge</b> <b>Party,</b> although by 1919 he had left Britain altogether after losing a libel case brought by Sir Alfred Mond and thereafter became a 'travelling salesman for anti-Semitism'.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1943, Meyszner {{complained to}} Himmler that Benzler had adopted a [...] "soft" [...] policy towards the Serbs, {{allowing}} them {{to take charge of}} the supervision of crops. He considered those that granted additional powers and freedoms to the Serbian puppet regime were irresponsible, because they did not understand the real motives of the various Serb groups. One of many matters of concern to Meyszner was the formation of the Serbian Volunteer Corps, which was an extension of Ljotić's movement. Meyszner thought that Turner and Benzler had erred in allowing its formation and observed that it was spreading royalist propaganda. According to Moll, Meyszner's perspective was very narrow and did not take into account foreign policy objectives associated with giving some power to the Nedić regime. By the end of 1942, Meyszner had extracted all the usable military manpower from the Volksdeutsche of the Banat and the economy and administration of that territory was suffering. As a consequence, he requested the release of all men aged 40 and over from service in the 7th SS Division. As an alternative, he {{turned his attention to the}} minority groups that also lived in the Banat, including Hungarians, Romanians and Slovaks. His recommendation that these people be subjected to conscription was not accepted by Himmler.From the time he had fled to Germany, Meyszner had been engaged in a dispute regarding his membership in the Nazi Party. He had maintained that the Venice Agreement meant that he and other members of the Styrian Home Guard had been accepted into the Nazi Party with prestigious low membership numbers corresponding to the dates of their entry into the Home Guard.
