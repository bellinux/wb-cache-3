5|$|Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival {{where it}} {{received}} the Golden Lion {{award for best}} picture. Critical opinion was mildly positive. Reviewers praised the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the film's visual style and its empathy {{for a handful of}} characters, but some found Somewhere to be too repetitive of themes in Coppola's previous work, or did not sympathize with the protagonist because of his relative success. It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10, 2010, and in the United States on December 22, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo {{accepted}} the document {{and moved to}} the balcony to submit it directly to the people for ratification. But, because of the late hour and the weather, {{the number of people in}} the plaza had declined. Leiva ridiculed the claim of the remaining representatives to speak on behalf of the people. This wore the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the few who were still in the plaza in the rain. Beruti did not accept any further delays, and threatened to call people to arms. Facing the prospect of further violence, the popular request was read aloud and immediately ratified by those present.|$|E

In a later interview, she admitted that due to multiple conflicts in schedule she was unable to attend all the training sessions arranged for her by pageant organizers, which included sessions to improve her speaking ability. She also admitted to throwing a fit in the middle of a rehearsal when she received news that her grandfather was dying, and demanded that she be allowed to leave.|$|E

5|$|The {{action at}} Plaman Mapu {{was also a}} key factor in turning the tide of {{political}} opinion against the increasingly beleaguered Sukarno. Defeat in what was intended to be a highly publicised victory helped to break the fracturing <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the army generals on the right and unite them against what they now saw to be the destructive force of Sukarno and the Communist Party. Tensions between the army and the Communists, already high, peaked on 30 September, when elements of the army, likely Communist, kidnapped and murdered six high-ranking army generals whom they accused of planning a CIA-sponsored coup against the President. Army Reserve Commander Suharto at Sukarno's behest took control of the army and crushed the revolt, but the damage had been done. The army blamed the revolt on the Communists, and excited an anti-leftist fervour among the populace that contributed to the subsequent anti-Communist Purge, where high-ranking members were executed along with hundreds of thousands of suspected collaborators with millions imprisoned. This move almost eliminated the Communists from power and left Sukarno alone and isolated.|$|E
5|$|While the Polish {{king and}} the Senate of Poland were debating on the course of action, the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> foreign powers was running out. Eventually, {{one of the most}} {{prominent}} opponents of agreeing to the foreign demands, bishop Adam Stanisław Krasiński, was abducted by Cossacks and transported to Warsaw, where the foreign ambassadors demanded that the King and the Senate call in the Sejm (the entire Polish parliament) to ratify the partition. In another sign of their influence, the next meeting of the Senate saw the senators from the annexed territories denied participation (those denied participation included the bishop of Inflanty, the voivode of Ruthenia and the voivode of Witebsk). When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative was available save passive submission to their will. Warsaw was de facto a garrison of the foreign powers, with their forces commanded by the Austrian (or Russian, sources vary) general Abram Romanius (Abraham). On 19 April the Senate agreed to call for the Sejm to convene.|$|E

40|$|Four {{different}} fluid model formulations {{have been}} recently developed for G_t/GI/N+GI queues, including a two-parameter fluid model in Whitt (2006) by tracking elapsed service and <b>patience</b> times <b>of</b> each customer, a measure-valued fluid model in Kang and Ramanan (2010) and its extension in Zuñiga (2014) by tracking elapsed service and <b>patience</b> times <b>of</b> each customer, and a measure-valued fluid model in Zhang (2013) by tracking residual service and <b>patience</b> times <b>of</b> each customer. We {{show that the}} two fluid models tracking elapsed times (Whitt's and Kang and Ramanan's fluid models) are equivalent formulations for the same G_t/GI/N+GI queue, whereas Zuñiga's fluid model and Zhang's fluid model are not entirely equivalent under general initial conditions. We then identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which Zuñiga's fluid model and Zhang's fluid model {{can be derived from}} each other for the same system, in which certain measure-valued fluid processes tracking residual service and <b>patience</b> times <b>of</b> each customer derived from Kang-Ramanan and Zuñiga's fluid models play an important role. The equivalence properties discovered provide important implications for the understanding of the recent development for non-Markovian many-server queues. Comment: 33 page...|$|R
25|$|The {{political}} events which {{led up to}} the peaceful dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 could hardly have been attained but for the tact and <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the king himself. He was dethroned on 7 June 1905 by the Storting and renounced the Norwegian throne on 26 October. He declined, indeed, to permit any prince of his house to become king of Norway, but better {{relations between the two countries}} were restored before his death.

25|$|An aging legacy-huntress named Philomela {{places her}} son and {{daughter}} with Eumolpus, ostensibly for education. Eumolpus makes love to the daughter, although because of his pretence of ill health he requires the help of Corax. Encolpius reveals that he has somehow been cured of his impotence (140). He warns Eumolpus that, because the wealth {{he claims to have}} has not appeared, the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the legacy-hunters is running out. Eumolpus's will is read to the legacy-hunters, who apparently now believe he is dead, and they learn they can inherit only if they consume his body. In the final passage preserved, historical examples of cannibalism are cited (141).|$|E
25|$|While the Romans {{were busy}} raising an army and sorting out political/religious matters, Hannibal had marched in a leisurely manner south from Hartia. His army, rested, {{restored}} to health, retrained and re-equipped, cut {{a path of}} destruction through central Italy as they collected grain, cattle, provisions and supplies during the march. Hannibal followed the coastal plain before turning west. Near the town of Arpi, the Roman army under Fabius made contact with the Carthaginian army and camped at Aecae, six {{miles away from the}} Carthaginian camp. Hannibal drew up his army and offered battle, but Fabius ignored the offer and the Roman army remained in their camp. The stage was set for Fabius to reveal his plans, which would tax the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the Romans and the political clout of Fabius to the limit and ultimately be credited by later historians as the most prudent, if economically costly, strategy against the threat of Hannibal.|$|E

25|$|The {{refusal of}} Hadrian II to ordain a {{candidate}} approved by Boris exhausted the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the Bulgarian prince. After a three-month stay in Bulgaria Silvester returned to Rome {{with a letter}} to the Pope in which for the last time Boris I insisted that either Formosus or Marinus be ordained, but the Pope declined the proposal once again. During that time the Bulgarian ruler had already started negotiations with the Patriarch of Constantinople Ignatius, who was trying to improve the relations with Rome, which had been strained after the mutual anathemas made in 863 by his predecessor Photios I and Pope Nicolas I. Just like Photios, however, Ignatius did not want to allow a permanent establishment of the Roman Church in Bulgaria. In order to settle {{the differences between the two}} Churches, the Eighth Ecumenical Council was planned to be held in Constantinople in 869. After a long stay in Rome (868–869), Peter returned to Bulgaria and was immediately sent to participate in the council.|$|E
25|$|Journalists {{were able}} to play The Last Guardian at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 and the 2016 Tokyo Game Show {{in the months before}} the game's release, and several {{expressed}} further concerns {{about the nature of the}} game's lengthy development period. Patrick Garrett, writing for VG247, found that the visuals felt flat and aged considering modern hardware capabilities, and expressed concern that while older gamers would readily purchase the title, The Last Guardian may not draw in enough newer gamers to be a commercial success. Philip Kollar for Polygon, though still impressed with the characters, graphics, and core gameplay, found controlling the character difficult and managing the game's camera tricky, elements that made the game feel like a PlayStation 2 title rather than something on modern hardware. Wireds Chris Kohler found much of the demo to require patient observation of Trico's movements and puzzle solving, which, he commented, some players would appreciate but were elements that have slowly been phased out of action games over the last console generation, and other players may not have the patience for these. Brian Ashcroft of Kotaku also noted that the demo's pace was often set by how fast Trico would respond or react, which may test the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> players looking for a more action-based experience.|$|E
500|$|Placed under {{surveillance}} {{due to his}} involvement in revolutionary politics by 1894, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was eventually expelled from France, despite Huysmans' intervention in his favor. Reputedly, the deportation document identified him as a [...] "threat to public order". One urban legend recounts that Bogdan-Pitești was present at Vaillant's public execution and leaned over to kiss Vaillant's mangled body, which both disgusted and alarmed the judicial establishment. Zambaccian suggests {{that the decision to}} deport the Romanian provocateur was not politically motivated. He writes that Bogdan-Pitești had exhausted the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> French authorities by trafficking in stolen bicycles.|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Blue Lotus showed {{evidence}} of Hergé's [...] "left-wing counter-tendency" [...] that rejected his earlier right-wing worldview. He {{believed that this}} was {{partly due to the}} influence of Zhang, who had destroyed Hergé's [...] "European absolutism", and overall thought of it as [...] "the most visually rich of all the Tintin books". Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University thought that Wang signified the forces of good in the story while Rastapopoulos represented evil, and that the character Didi– who was poisoned with Raijaijah– inverted [...] "the model of justice ruling the world of the Good". He saw a similarity between Didi and Tintin, who both have [...] "feline suppleness, a devotion to good causes, and the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> an animal stalking its prey". He furthermore argued that Didi's desire to behead people when under the poison's influence expressed his Oedipus complex and was a substitute for castration.|$|E

[...] He gave the episode a grade of B. James Hunt for the website Den of Geek, watched the episode in November 2012. While he was mostly negative of the episode, saying that [...] "Troi episodes tend to test the <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> even the most devoted Trek fan", he said that [...] "Haven" [...] marked the first time that the series would [...] "properly execute the idea that TNG episodes can have an A and B plot which dovetail nicely in the final act".|$|E
