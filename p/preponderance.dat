5|$|Finally, the Supreme Court {{majority}} {{upheld the}} validity of {{another aspect of the}} law as enacted by Congress: that the government could assume that a potentially expatriating act had been performed voluntarily and that any claim that a person had acted under duress was up to the person involved to establish by <b>preponderance</b> of evidence.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least {{clear and convincing}} {{evidence}} of neglect. Justice William Rehnquist, joined by three others, dissented, {{on the grounds that}} the majority's focus on a single aspect of the law disregarded the fairness of the scheme as a whole. The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs. Because of the ruling, all states previously using the fair <b>preponderance</b> standard changed to the clear and convincing standard, but California has since abandoned the clear and convincing standard and returned to the fair <b>preponderance</b> standard.|$|E
5|$|As Crown Prince Cảnh {{had died}} of {{smallpox}} during {{the war against the}} Tây Sơn, it was assumed that Cảnh's son would succeed Gia Long, but in 1816 Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, the son of Gia Long's second wife, was appointed instead. Gia Long chose him for his strong character and his deeply conservative aversion to Westerners, whereas Cảnh's lineage had converted to Catholicism and had shunned Confucian traditions such as ancestor worship. Gia Long told his son to treat the Europeans—especially the French—respectfully, but not to grant them any position of <b>preponderance.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{discovered}} in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, {{one of the pioneers}} of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a <b>preponderance</b> of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|The Capture of USS Chesapeake, or the Battle of Boston Harbor, {{was fought}} on 1 June 1813, between the Royal Navy's frigate HMS Shannon and American frigate USS Chesapeake, {{as part of}} the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain. The Chesapeake was {{captured}} in a brief but intense action in which over 80 men were killed. This was the only frigate action of the war in which there was no <b>preponderance</b> of force on either side.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between nonmetals and metals {{is by no}} means clear. The result is that a few borderline elements lacking a <b>preponderance</b> of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids, or vice versa. For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid, particularly in environmental chemistry; and astatine (At), which is a metalloid and a halogen, is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case. This requires only an inference, not <b>preponderance.</b> Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual. A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear <b>preponderance</b> of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the <b>preponderance</b> of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1967 to its abolition in 1992, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation created {{by far the}} largest and most ambitious of the British new towns: indeed its objective was to build a new city of 250,000 people. Many of Britain's most acclaimed building and landscape architects contributed to what was to be a show-piece of British design. Unlike previous new towns, Milton Keynes has a <b>preponderance</b> of privately funded development but these developments were subject to an exacting design brief in line with the design principles laid out in The Plan for Milton Keynes.|$|E
5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging {{and leaving the}} care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens {{as they grow older}} and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight <b>preponderance</b> of males at all ages is usual.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium was {{discovered}} by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles in 1955, the same method still used to produce it today. It was named after Dmitri Mendeleev, father of the periodic table of the chemical elements. Using available microgram quantities of the isotope einsteinium-253, over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced each hour. The chemistry of mendelevium is typical for the late actinides, with a <b>preponderance</b> of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced mendelevium {{and all of its}} isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{then turned}} {{its attention to}} the question of a standard of proof in loss-of-citizenship cases. Terrazas had argued and the 7th Circuit had agreed that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted in Afroyim, had left Congress without any constitutional authority to set the standard of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of clear and convincing evidence. The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of <b>preponderance</b> of evidence (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved.|$|E
5|$|While similar lifeforms {{have been}} known to exist in {{shallower}} oceanic trenches (>7,000m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems. This <b>preponderance</b> of soft-shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may be a result of selection pressure. Millions of years ago, the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the Challenger Deep.|$|E
5|$|As Crown Prince Nguyen Canh {{had died}} of {{smallpox}} during {{the war against the}} Tây Sơn, it was assumed that Canh's son would succeed Gia Long as emperor, but in 1816 Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, the son of his second wife, was appointed instead, and ruled as Minh Mạng. Gia Long chose him for his strong character and his deep aversion to westerners, whereas Canh's lineage had converted to Catholicism and were reluctant to maintain their Confucian traditions such as ancestor worship. Before his accession, Nguyễn Phúc Đảm was reported to have praised the Japanese for having expelled and eradicated Christianity from their country. Gia Long told his son to treat the Europeans respectfully, especially the French, but not to grant them any position of <b>preponderance.</b> Gia Long died on 3 February 1820 and was buried at the Thien Tho Tomb and posthumously named Thế Tổ Cao Hoàng đế.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching {{for a way to}} achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material <b>preponderance</b> of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, {{paramagnetic}} metal. Its {{chemistry is}} typical of the late actinides, with a <b>preponderance</b> of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to berkelium-249 and then californium-249 {{at a rate of about}} 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.|$|E
5|$|The Federal {{government}} retired Jones in 1952 {{and replaced}} him with Air Marshal Donald Hardman, RAF, who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. The first was re-formed {{from the existing}} Eastern Area Command, which was considered a de facto operational organisation owing to the <b>preponderance</b> of combat forces within its sphere. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, as it was already the hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and final functional command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of all operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Area Commands.|$|E
5|$|The Madras Presidency had {{the highest}} {{literacy}} rate of all the provinces in British India. In 1901, Madras had a male literacy rate of 11.9 percent and a female literacy rate of 0.9 percent. In 1950, when the Madras Presidency became Madras State, the literacy rate was slightly {{higher than the national}} average of 18 percent. In 1901, there were 26,771 public and private institutions with 923,760 scholars of whom 784,621 were male and 139,139 female. By 1947, the number of educational institutions had increased to 37,811 and the number of scholars to 3,989,686. Apart from colleges, in 1947 there were 31,975 public and elementary schools, 720 secondary schools for boys and 4,173 elementary and 181 secondary schools for girls. Most of the early graduates were Brahmins. The <b>preponderance</b> of Brahmins in the universities and in the civic administration {{was one of the main}} causes for the growth of the Anti-Brahmin movement in the presidency. Madras was also the first province in British India where caste-based communal reservations were introduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} the region {{are known to be}} {{evergreen}} type with a <b>preponderance</b> of deciduous species with a levelled distribution. The topmost level consists of Garjan (Dipterocarpus alatus), Telsur (Hopea odorata), Chapalish (Artocarpus chaplasha), Chundul (Tetrameles nudiflora) and Koroi or the Moluccan albizia (Falcataria moluccana). The lower level consists of species of Jarul (Lagerstroemia speciosa), Toon (Toona ciliata), Jam (Syzygium cumini), Jalpai (Elaeocarpus robustus) and Glochidion. Lianas, epiphytes (mostly of orchids, asclepiads, ferns and leafy mosses) and herbaceous undergrowths are abundant. Savannah formations are found in the open, along the banks of rivers and swamps with common tall grasses like Kans (Saccharum spontaneum), Shon (Imperata cylindrica and I. arundincca) and Bena (Vetiveria zizanoides). Several species of Bamboo are cultivated that are common in Bangladesh including Bambusa balcooa (which is also common in Assam), B. vulgaris, B. longispiculata, B. tulda and B. nutans; the latter two also being common in the hills of the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} decoration was extraordinarily rich. The walls were decorated with marble, {{the roof was}} gilded, while the narthex featured a depiction of the baptism of Constantine the Great. Fragments of ivory, amethyst, gold and colored glass, originally inlaid in the marble sculptures, have also been found at the site, as well as fragments of mosaics. The deliberate evocation of the Solomonic Temple was further reinforced by the <b>preponderance</b> of motifs such as palm trees, pomegranates and lilies in the church's decoration. A notable characteristic, {{which has not been}} attested before in Constantinopolitan art and architecture, is the extensive use of Sassanid Persian decorative motifs such as friezes of running palmette and pomegranate leaves or symmetric geometric and vegetal patterns. Persian motifs became increasingly popular in the 6th century, and were also used in the decoration of the Hagia Sophia. Another exceptional find are ten relief plaques bearing the images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Apostles; such images are very rare due to the destruction of human representations in the Iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|While local {{sources of}} gold are attested during the Aksumite era, silver {{seems to have}} been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was {{imported}} as attested by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, given the <b>preponderance</b> of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare {{that it had to be}} mainly imported. Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called electrum. Copper and bronze do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire, though they were noted as imports in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E
5|$|A <b>preponderance</b> {{of historians}} favour {{the story that}} though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok Strait rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through {{a show of force}} during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, {{including}} Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, are content with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the Strait for one reason or another, and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda Strait issue altogether. This was a sentiment shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok Strait went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign of hostility, and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok Strait was just as convenient for passage as the Sunda Strait, despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia. At the very least, the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Kursk, Model had {{anticipated}} {{the possibility of}} a Soviet attack into the Orel Salient, and had (without OKH's knowledge) constructed extensive defensive works to meet such an attack. Following the stalling of his advance, the Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Kutuzov, duly opened on 12 July. It involved not just Rokossovsky's Central Front, but also the Bryansk and Western Fronts, a greater concentration of forces than Model had assaulted in Operation Citadel. For the battle, Kluge placed him in command of Second Panzer Army in addition to Ninth Army—again, a larger total force than he had commanded in Citadel. The Soviet <b>preponderance</b> of strength was such that Stavka expected it to take only 48 hours to reach Orel, splitting the German forces into three parts; instead, the battle ended three weeks later with Model's orderly withdrawal from the salient. An idea of the scale of the fighting compared to Citadel can be gained from the combined casualty lists for Second Panzer and Ninth Armies: from 1 to 10 July, the Germans took 21,000 casualties, and from 11 to 31 July, 62,000. Despite these losses he had inflicted similarly heavy casualties on the three Red Army Fronts, shortened the line, and avoided annihilation. His standing with Hitler thus survived the failure of Citadel.|$|E

25|$|Although {{underground}} mining technology had {{been available for}} many centuries, {{it is likely that}} the joint problems of the hardness of the granite rock and the <b>preponderance</b> of underground water together with the relatively easy pickings from near the surface made deep mining unviable until the late 18th century.|$|E
25|$|On a {{microscopic}} scale, relaxed rubber is a disorganized cluster of erratically changing wrinkled chains. In stretched rubber, the chains are almost linear.
