Most waste is removed, including <b>paper</b> <b>waste,</b> remains of prey, and dead larvae. In addition, a predefecation head dance occurs in both workers and the queen, and this fecal material is then removed. Workers also have been found to remove healthy larvae from their cells. Two or more workers together pull otherwise healthy larva from the cell and frequently cut it up and feed it to other larvae. This tendency increases during colony decline.|$|E

The dissolution of cellulosebased materials like tissue <b>paper</b> <b>waste,</b> generated in chemical industries and at research laboratories, in room temperature IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, bmimCl and the recovery of valuable compounds by electrodeposition from this cellulose matrix was studied. [...] The [...] "valorization" [...] of cellulose, i.e. its conversion to more valuable chemicals, has been achieved by the use of ionic liquids. [...] Representative products are glucose esters, sorbitol, and alkylgycosides. IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride dissolves freeze dried banana pulp and with an additional 15% DMSO, lends itself to Carbon-13 NMR analysis. In this way the entire complex of starch, sucrose, glucose, and fructose can be monitored as a function of banana ripening.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the technological economics of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recovery and recycling in UK. The {{major problem in}} <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recycling is still the removal of contraries, although technological developments have so far been able to remove some of them. The costs incurred by the local authorities in recovering <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> were investigated. Local authority costing {{was found to be}} inconsistent and many of them did not include all the relevant indirect costs and savings, so that many local authorities claimed to be making heavy losses in their operations. Full accounting incorporating all the relevant indirect costs and savings have shown that most local authorities incurred much smaller losses and in some cases profited from their <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recovery operations. A general computer model was developed to allow local authorities to check the viability of their on-going operations and another computer model was developed for an investment appraisal of a proposed <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recovery operation. Multiple regression models were developed to forecast the demand of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> in the short term and the long term.

30|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to develop the low-cost activated carbon (AC) from some waste materials as potential mercury (Hg) sorbent to remove high amount of Hg from aqueous phase. The ACs were prepared from banana peel, orange peel, cotton fiber and <b>paper</b> <b>wastes</b> by pyrolysis and characterized by analyzing physico-chemical properties and Hg sorption capacity. The Brunauer Emmett and Teller surface areas (cotton 138  m 2 /g; paper 119  m 2 /g), micropore surface areas (cotton 65  m 2 /g; paper 54  m 2 /g) and major constituent carbon contents (cotton 95.04  %; paper 94.4  %) were higher in ACs of cotton fiber and <b>paper</b> <b>wastes</b> than the rest two ACs. The Hg sorption capacities and removal percentages were greater in cotton and paper wastes-derived ACs compared {{to those of the}} banana and orange peels. The results revealed that elevated Hg removal ability of cotton and paper wastes-derived ACs is largely regulated by their surface area, porosity and carbon content properties. Therefore, ACs of cotton and <b>paper</b> <b>wastes</b> were identified as potential sorbent among four developed ACs to remove high amount of Hg from aqueous phase. Furthermore, easily accessible precursor material, simple preparation process, favorable physico-chemical properties and high Hg sorption capacity indicated that cotton and paper wastes-derived ACs could be used as potential and low-cost sorbents of Hg for applying in practical field to control the severe effect of Hg contamination in the aquatic environment to avoid its human and environmental health risks.|$|R

Concentrated acid hydrolysis of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> with sulfuric acid was optimized to maximize glucose conversion. The concentrated acid hydrolysis conditions for <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> (disintegrated time: 30 s, deinking agent loading: 15 ㎖) were optimized by using central composite design and response surface methodology. The optimization process employed a central composite design, where the investigated variables were acid concentration (60 ∼ 80 %), loading sulfuric acid (1 ∼ 5 ㎖) and reaction time (1 ∼ 5 h). All the tested variables were identified to have significant effects (p < 0. 05) on glucose conversion. The optimum concentrated acid hydrolysis conditions were acid concentration of 70. 8 %, loading sulfuric acid of 3. 2 ㎖ and a reaction time of 3. 6 h.
