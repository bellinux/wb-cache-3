No offer was made to Rhodes, and the county subsequently appointed amateur William Worsley as captain. He was respected by the team but had little personal success, lasted for just two seasons, and was followed by two further short-term leaders. In 1933 Brian Sellers, a more competent amateur, was appointed and became the long-serving captain that Yorkshire had sought.|$|E

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen growing {{interest}} in open science practices, which include initiatives to increase transparency in research methods, data collection, and analysis, to enhance accessibility to data and materials, and to improve the dissemination of findings to broader audiences. Language Learning is enhancing its participation in the open science movement by launching Registered Reports as an article category as of 1 January 2018. Registered Reports allow authors to submit the conceptual justifications and the full method and analysis protocol of their study to peer review prior to data collection. High quality submissions then receive <b>provisional,</b> in-principle <b>acceptance.</b> Provided that data collection, analyses, and reporting follow the proposed and accepted methodology and analysis protocols, the paper is subsequently publishable whatever the findings.

500|$|In mid-2009, the FIA and {{the newly}} formed Formula One Teams Association {{disagreed}} over the format of rules for the following season. When the entry list for the 2010 championship was announced on 12 June 2009, the entries of five of the eight FOTA teams remained <b>provisional</b> on their <b>acceptance</b> of the new rules. The next day, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association announced its support for FOTA's request for [...] "stability, clear rules, a clear and transparent system of governance" [...] and their threat to form a breakaway series from Formula One. The BBC Sport website reported this as an attack on Mosley's authority and noted that Mosley was expected to stand again for the presidency in 2009.|$|R
40|$|In 1983, {{at one of}} {{the more}} intense moments of the Cold War period, the United States Catholic Bishops issued a {{pastoral}} letter addressing the moral implications of the deterrence doctrine. The letter observed that the mass attack plans on which the operational practice of deterrence was based could not be reconciled with traditional just war principles and declared that the practice was only provisionally acceptable in moral terms. That formulation expressed reluctant deference to the prevailing belief that national security depended on the deterrent effect of a massively destructive threat actively deployed {{and that there was no}} viable alternative. A decade later, after the alliance confrontation that defined the Cold War had dissolved, the bishops issued a commentary on the original letter. They reaffirmed their original judgment on deterrence and broadened their discussion to address the problems of civil conflict and basic human rights then emerging into greater prominence. They reiterated their support for policies that would restrain the practice of deterrence, but they did not intensify their moral prescription. They acknowledged differing judgments regarding the strategic justification of the deterrence doctrine and set no time limit on <b>provisional</b> moral <b>acceptance.</b> They did not issue a moral mandate to transform the legacy practice. Nearly three decades after the pastoral letter, the practice of deterrence continues essentially unaltered. The number of operationally deployed nuclear weapons has been substantially reduced, but their destructive potential has not been proportionately affected. Urban industrial infrastructure and human population concentrations are nearly as vulnerable as they ever were. If the mass attack plans embedded in continuously alert deterrent forces were ever implemented, they would inflict tens of millions of immediate casualties and so damage social capacity that recovery would be a distant and uncertain question. The potential destructiveness of contemporary deterrent forces poses by far the greatest immediate physical threat to human life as we know it. As a result the security of all people and all countries fundamentally depends on the justifying doctrine – that is, on the assumption that continuously wielding a massive threat reliably assures it will never be carried out. Because of its central importance and potential consequence, the deterrence doctrine has become both an axiom of security policy and a matter of intense personal belief. In both countries primarily engaged in the operational practice of deterrence – The Russian Federation and the United States [...] the doctrine has evolved beyond the status of a justifying assumption and is generally treated as an elemental truth not open to meaningful doubt. But that is an attitude not an assured reality, and there are strong reasons not only to question the core validity of the basic deterrent assumption but also to fear that prevailing operational practice involves an unacceptable and unnecessary risk of catastrophe. That in turn implies that <b>provisional</b> moral <b>acceptance</b> of the doctrine needs to be reconsidered...|$|R

60|$|Be this or be {{it not a}} warrantable conclusion, there is, I think, {{good reason}} for a <b>provisional</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the {{hypothesis}} that the effects of use and disuse are inheritable; and for a methodic pursuit of inquiries with the view of either establishing it or disproving it. It seems scarcely reasonable to accept without clear demonstration, the belief that while a trivial difference of structure arising spontaneously is transmissible, a massive difference of structure, maintained generation after generation by change of function, leaves no trace in posterity. Considering that unquestionably the modification of structure by function is a vera causa, in so far as concerns the individual; and considering the number of facts which so competent an observer as Mr. Darwin regarded as evidence that transmission of such modifications takes place in particular cases; the hypothesis that such transmission takes place in conformity with a general law, holding of all active structures, should, I think, be regarded as at least a good working hypothesis.|$|E
5000|$|Mosley {{was elected}} unopposed to his fourth term as {{president}} of the FIA in 2005. In recognition of his contribution to road safety and motorsport, Mosley was made a Chevalier dans l’Ordre de la Légion d’honneur in 2006. The Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honour) is France's highest decoration for outstanding achievements in military or civil life; a Chevalier (Knight) is the fifth class. Continuing a theme of his presidency, in 2006 Mosley called for Formula One manufacturers to develop technology relevant to road cars. In recent years, {{a large proportion of the}} enormous budget of Formula One has been spent on the development of very powerful, very high-revving engines, which some say have little applicability to road cars. Mosley has announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he sent a letter to the Formula One teams, in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption. The 2007 Formula One season was dominated by Ferrari's accusations that the McLaren team had made illegal use of their intellectual property, leading to legal cases in the United Kingdom and Italy. Unlike previous cases, such as the Toyota team's illegal use of Ferrari intellectual property in 2004 that had been handled by German police, the FIA investigated. They initially found McLaren innocent; unable to find enough evidence to suggest that anyone other than designer Mike Coughlan had seen the information or that the team had used it. Ron Dennis, team principal of McLaren, was unaware at this point that Mosley had been sent personal e-mails from Fernando Alonso, stating that the data had been used and seen by others in the team. When Italian police uncovered a series of text messages between McLaren and their spy at Ferrari, the team was hauled in front of the World Motor Sports Council (WMSC) once more. This time they were found guilty and eventually fined a gross $100M and excluded from the 2007 constructors' championship. Later in the year, the Renault team was found guilty by the FIA of possessing McLaren's intellectual property, but was not punished, as the [...] "FIA's WMSC decided there was not enough evidence to show the championship had been affected." [...] In relation to McLaren, triple world champion Jackie Stewart criticised Mosley and stated that other teams did not back McLaren for [...] "fear of repercussions". TV commentator and newspaper columnist Martin Brundle, a former driver, was among those who criticised the FIA and Mosley for inconsistency and questioned the [...] "energetic manner" [...] in which he felt McLaren was being pursued, suggesting that there was a [...] "witch hunt" [...] against the team. Brundle and The Sunday Times subsequently received a writ for libel before the paper printed a correction. Mosley went on to defend himself of the charges made by Brundle, highlighting that the WMSC originally acquitted McLaren of any wrongdoing, stating: [...] "Concrete evidence of use by McLaren of the Ferrari information was simply not there." [...] It was only later in the year when [...] "e-mails emerged which showed others inside McLaren were indeed aware of the Ferrari information", that the FIA found the team guilty. At the start of 2008, Mosley said that he wanted to see through reforms such as budget capping and new technologies like KERS successfully introduced into Formula One before retiring. In March of that year the News of the World released video footage of Mosley engaged in acts with five consenting women in a scenario that the paper alleged involved Nazi role-playing (an allegation that, though dismissed in court as [...] "no genuine basis", allegedly [...] "ruined" [...] Mosley's reputation). The situation was made more controversial by his father's association with the Nazis. Mosley admitted [...] "the embarrassment the revelations caused", but said that there was no Nazi theme involved. He was strongly criticised by former drivers, motor manufacturers and several of the national motoring bodies who form the FIA. His involvement in the Bahrain Grand Prix was cancelled. Public expressions of support were limited. Mosley says that he received much supportive correspondence, and said that he would continue to the end of his current term, which he said would be his last. Mosley's longtime ally Ecclestone eventually appeared to support Mosley's removal. Mosley won a vote of confidence at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the FIA on 3 June 2008, with 103 votes in support and 55 against, with seven abstentions and four invalid votes. Several clubs, including the ADAC, AAA and KNAF considered withdrawal from the FIA after the decision. Other formerly critical organisations have since said that they will accept the outcome of the vote and now wish to move on. In July 2008, Mosley won a High Court legal case against the News of the World for invasion of privacy. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Eady, said: [...] "I see no genuine basis at all for the suggestion that the participants mocked the victims of the Holocaust." [...] In December 2008, Mosley said that he still intended to stand down when his term ran out in October 2009, but would take the final decision in June of that year. Mosley's close relationship with Ecclestone, the sport's promoter, was criticised in early 2009 by Sir Jackie Stewart, who suggested that Mosley should resign in favour of a CEO from outside motorsport. In mid-2009, the FIA and the newly formed Formula One Teams Association disagreed over the format of rules for the following season. When the entry list for the 2010 championship was announced on 12 June 2009, the entries of five of the eight FOTA teams remained <b>provisional</b> on their <b>acceptance</b> of the new rules. The next day, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association announced its support for FOTA's request for [...] "stability, clear rules, a clear and transparent system of governance" [...] and their threat to form a breakaway series from Formula One. The BBC Sport website reported this as an attack on Mosley's authority and noted that Mosley was expected to stand again for the presidency in 2009. On 23 June, Mosley said he was considering running for a fifth term as FIA president in October [...] "in light of the attack on my mandate". However, the following day FOTA and the FIA reached an agreement with Mosley agreeing not to stand for re-election as part of the deal: 'now there is peace'. Luca di Montezemolo welcomed Mosley's decision to stand down and called Mosley a 'dictator'. Mosley responded by saying that he was still considering his 'options' and might well stand for re-election in October after all. He later said that he was [...] "under pressure from all over the world" [...] to stand for re-election. On 15 July, Mosley confirmed that he would after all stand down, and again endorsed former Ferrari Executive Director Jean Todt as his successor. Todt went on to win the presidency.|$|R

5000|$|In conclusion, moral {{judgment}} and truth should be verified by personal experience. This then {{leads to a}} <b>provisional</b> <b>acceptance,</b> called [...] "preserving the truth". Faith goes hand-in-hand with an open attitude of willing to learn and try out, familiarizing oneself with the teaching. Through personal verification a person's faith deepens, ultimately changing from [...] "preserving" [...] to [...] "discovering" [...] the truth. This verification process involves ordinary experience, but also the yogic experience of cultivation of the mind. Furthermore, the Buddha applies these criteria to his own teaching: {{he has the right}} to teach his Dhamma because he has verified it for himself, not learnt it from someone else or reasoned it out. Indeed, the Buddha states in several suttas, including the Vimaṁsaka Sutta, that his disciples should investigate even him as to whether he really is enlightened and pure in conduct, by observing him for a long time. Several people are described in the Pali Canon observing the Buddha in such way, and arriving at grounded faith.|$|E
40|$|At {{a private}} for-profit {{hospitality}} college in Philadelphia, there are rising percentages of students not persisting to the sophomore year. The study was grounded by the theoretical framework of Tinto 2 ̆ 7 s model of student retention. The {{purpose of this}} causal comparative {{study was to examine}} the relationship between student persistence and the academic variables of major, vocational technical preparation, and <b>provisional</b> <b>acceptance.</b> The relationship was analyzed using a chi-square test of independence. The data collected for the study came from archival data based upon the sample of 162 full-time students enrolled during the August 2014 class start in the majors of Culinary Arts, Pastry Arts, Restaurant Management, and Hotel Management. The results displayed that persistence is dependent on the student major of choice and students who had vocational technical preparation. However, the results displayed that persistence was most likely independent of students who were provisionally accepted, suggesting that <b>provisional</b> <b>acceptance</b> had no influence on whether students persisted from freshmen to sophomore year or not. The implications for positive social change on the local level include providing research-based findings on variables associated with first-year student persistence to inform targeted student support services and ultimately improve student persistence at the institution studied. A professional development workshop has been created to educate faculty and staff at the college about the results of the study.

40|$|We {{argue that}} common knowledge, {{of the kind}} used in {{reasoning}} in law and computing is best analyzed using a dialogue model argumentation (Walton & Krabbe 1995).

We argue that, in this sense, common knowledge is not really knowledge of the kind represent by belief and/or knowledge of the epistemic kind studied in current epistemology. This paper takes a different approach, defining it {{in relation to a}} common commitment store of two participants in a rule-governed dialogue in which two parties engage in rational argumentation (Jackson & Jacobs 1980; van Eemeren & Grootendorst 2004). A theme of the paper is how arguments containing common knowledge premises can be studied with the help of argumentation schemes for arguments from generally accepted opinion and expert opinion.

40|$|Concentrating Photovoltaics (CPV) is an {{alternative}} to flat-plate module photovoltaic (PV) technology. The bankability of CPV projects {{is an important issue}} to pave the way toward a swift and sustained growth in this technology. The bankability of a PV plant is generally addressed through the modeling of its energy yield under a baseline loss scenario, followed by an on-site measurement campaign aimed at verifying its energy performance. This paper proposes a procedure for assessing the performance of a CPV project, articulated around four main successive steps: Solar Resource Assessment, Yield Assessment, Certificate of <b>Provisional</b> <b>Acceptance,</b> and Certificate of Final Acceptance. This methodology allows the long-term energy production of a CPV project to be estimated with an associated uncertainty of ≈ 5 %. To our knowledge, no such method has been proposed to the CPV industry yet, and this critical situation has hindered or made impossible the completion of several important CPV projects undertaken in the world. The main motive for this proposed method is to bring a practical solution to this urgent problem. This procedure can be operated under a wide range of climatic conditions, and makes it possible to assess the bankability of a CPV plant whose design uses any of the technologies currently available on the market. The method is also compliant with both international standards and local regulations. In consequence, its applicability is both general and international...|$|E
30|$|Not unexpectedly, {{there are}} no known records of the procurement, processing, or {{transport}} of this titaniferous white pigment that would indicate its importance to the Inka or its probable source in the southern Andes. Ethnohistorical documents, such as the chronicles of Betanzos, Cobo, and Guaman Poma, occasionally include discussion of the materials and technologies of Inka art and architecture, but make no mention of this material as a pigment. Further investigations into Pre-Columbian white pigments, especially in the southern Andes, may well reveal its use in other ancient or historic contexts, but at present {{there is no evidence}} of its use except on polychromed qeros of the Transitional Inka/Early Colonial period discussed here. Confirmation of the “Giacomo Deposit” or a related proximate occurrence must await on-site structural analysis and geochemical study. For our present work, its <b>provisional</b> <b>acceptance</b> as a plausible source of the titanium dioxide/silica pigment is based on its visual appearance, scale, and geographic location in the region of Tacna in southern Peru, as reported online. Colonized by the Tiwanaku state and later by the Inka empire, this region was the northernmost point of the Inka Empire’s southern realm known as Collasuyu, an area that incorporated much of what is now Bolivia, northwest Argentina, and northern Chile. This region, traversed by a network of imperial roads linking the highlands to the coast and connecting administrative centers and settlements, was heavily exploited by the Inka (and later the Spanish) for its rich mineral resources [52].|$|E

Standard entrance exams are held each January and February, however some universities offer {{a limited number of}} students an opportunity to apply earlier. Depending on the university, <b>provisional</b> <b>acceptance</b> through this alternative is given up to ten months before lectures start. With no university entrance exams to prepare for, it is possible for students to experience a decline in study skills and knowledge during this interim period. To address this, it is common for universities to offer a pre-enrolment course, typically in the form of irregular on-campus events, paper-based correspondence courses or quiz-based online courses with little-to-no interaction with other students. However, the affordances of modern e-learning systems allow {{for the creation of a}} more engaging online environment. Students at the authors' university major in design and computer science-related fields. Computer literacy is essential; e-learning is part of their daily routine and they have to complete numerous tasks using computers. Three years ago, the authors designed a pre- enrolment English course with these students in mind. It has been created using the Moodle LMS for an annual cohort of 100 students who come from all over Japan. They generally have low technology skills, low English skills (CEFR A 2 to B 1), and no e-learning experience. The aims of the course are not only to improve their English, but to introduce them to e-learning, their future classmates, and university life. Analysis of activity logs and end-of-course surveys tells us what students thought of the course, and how they engaged with it, leading to suggestions for change.

40|$|Ithaca,” {{in which}} Leopold Bloom finally returns home at two am after his odyssey around Dublin, {{is both the}} most comfortingly {{familiar}} episode of Ulysses and the most disconcertingly bizarre. “Ithaca”’s representation of objects contributes much to the episode’s paradoxical mingling of domesticity and strangeness. This article juxtaposes Martin Heidegger’s evolving theories of objects and things with “Ithaca” {{in order to understand}} the “objective” style of the episode, and its role in this paradox. The narrator’s scientific scrutiny of the material world transforms the familiar objects of 7 Eccles Street into bizarre, esoteric devices. At first, this technical account of Bloom’s material world seems to do no justice to the familiarity with which he inhabits his own home. This calls to mind Heidegger’s later conviction that post-Cartesian science had estranged humans from their habitats by framing things as objects, alienated by our rational modes of enquiry. On closer reading, it becomes clear that the narrator’s alienation of the material world mimics Bloom’s own alienation from a home whose surfaces bear the material evidence of his wife, Molly’s, adultery. Overall, however, beyond alienation, “Ithaca”’s relentless search for relations presents a world in which every thing owes its existence to everything else. This was the kind of unity that Heidegger later gestured towards when he declared that “poetically man dwells on this earth. ” For Heidegger, to dwell is to live among “things,” which reveal everything to which they are indebted for their existence, unlike the “objects” of science or mass technology which disguise this conditionality. Yet, in “Ithaca,” I will argue, Joyce gestures towards such a unified act of dwelling through the very scientific discourse and technology that Heidegger believes undermines it. The episode also forges connections with the rest of Ulysses and between its narrator and its protagonist such that Bloom’s famous <b>provisional</b> <b>acceptance</b> of his wife’s disloyalty seems to be indebted to the episode’s own sense of interrelatedness...|$|E
