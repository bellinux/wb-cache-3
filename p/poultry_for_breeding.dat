40|$|Four chicken genotypes (Rhode Island Red, Vanaraja, Haringhata Black and Divyayan Red) were {{evaluated}} for their suitability under backyard farming in South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India. The experiment {{was carried out}} in a randomized design with seven replications. Body weight gain and adult body weight (2008. 3 gm) were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in Divyayan Red. This breed was also proved to be superior to other three breeds in terms of age at sexual maturity (168 days), egg production (155 numbers) and egg weight (55. 5 gm). It can be concluded that Divyayan Red breed could be considered <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding</b> programs in South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the studies}} on {{heritability}} {{in relation to the}} physiological and biochemical characteristics of the chicken, heritability estimates of the weights of a few endocrine organs and the hemoglobin and reduced glutathione levels in blood, have been reported at this laboratory (MATSUMOTO et al., 1958 a, b). Since the heritabilities of these characteristics were comparatively high (for example, 0. 43 for thyroid weight and 0. 45 for hemoglobin level), to investigate the degree of heritability in relation to such characteristics would be of interest <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding.</b> The individual variation in the serum alkaline phosphatase activity of fowls was noted by AUCHINACHIE & EMSLIE (1934) and PETERSON & PARRISH (1939 b). The results of the former indicated that the normal range in female was wider than that in male, while the latter reported that the value for cockerels varied as much as that for pullets. However, they did not analyse the matter con-cerning the genetic control of this characteristic except that the breed differences only were noted by the former...|$|R
40|$|Objective Polymorphisms {{occurring}} in the precursor region of microRNAs (miRNAs) affect the target gene and alter the biogenesis of miRNAs, resulting in phenotypic variation. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the genetic effects of rs 16681031 (C>G) mutation in the precursor region of gga-miR- 1658 on the economic traits of the Gushi-Anka chicken F 2 resource population. Methods To explore the effect of miR- 1658 polymorphisms on chicken economic traits, the SNP was genotyped by MassArray matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The association between the SNP and chicken body size, growth and carcass traits was determined by linear mixed models. Results The SNP was not only significantly associated with body weight at the age of 6, 8, 10, 12 weeks, respectively, but also with the breadth of the chicken chest, body slanting length and pelvic breadth at 4 weeks, chest depth at 8 weeks of age, and body slanting length at 12 weeks (p< 0. 05), respectively. Conclusion Our data serve as a useful resource for further analysis of miRNA function, and represent a molecular genetic basis <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding...</b>|$|R
