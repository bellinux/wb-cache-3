40|$|<b>The</b> {{purposes}} <b>of</b> {{this study}} were to analyze and synthesize the research findings on <b>the</b> MMPI performance <b>of</b> blacks and to determine the relationship between demographic variables and <b>the</b> MMPI performance <b>of</b> black college students. A comprehensive review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature revealed that blacks and whites differ in MMPI performance, with blacks generally scoring higher than whites, especially on scales F, 8 and 9. Hypotheses about the reasons for these differences included greater psychopathology among blacks and racial differences in socioeconomic factors. The research findings {{did not support the}} first hypothesis. No association was found between black-white MMPI differences and greater psychopathology among black subjects. Factor studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> items to which blacks and whites respond differently indicated that black-white NMPI differences reflect racial differences in values, perceptions and expectations, rather than racial differences in psychological adjustment. It was found that some MMPI scales do and others do not discriminate among levels and types of abnormality among blacks. However, {{it was found that the}} white-based MMPI norms are invalid for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> blacks and black-based MMPI norms have not been developed. These findings suggest that the MMPI scales do not contain the most effective item combinations for efficient discrimination among blacks. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> white MNPI norms to interpret <b>the</b> MMPI profiles <b>of</b> blacks was shown to have negative consequences for black individuals, the psychological professions, the scientific community, and <b>the</b> American society. <b>Of</b> several proposed solutions to this problem, the most effective seemed to be <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present MMPI item pool to construct and validate MMPI scales for the black population. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> some studies of deviant groups suggested that black-white MMPI differences and <b>the</b> MMPI scores <b>of</b> blacks may be associated with education and other socioeconomic factors. To test this hypothesis in a group <b>of</b> normal subjects, <b>the</b> MMPI and a demographic questionnaire were administered to 205 black females (n= 126) and males (n= 79) attending two predominantly black southern colleges. Canonical correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to determine the relationships between 25 NMPI scale scores and 15 demographic variables. <b>The</b> highest levels <b>of</b> significance obtained were reported, and probabilities greater than. 05 were considered nonsignificant. The following results were obtained: (a) <b>The</b> <b>variance</b> in MMPI scale scores was due primarily to sex and secondarily to geographic region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students' present residence.

5000|$|Group {{socialization}} is {{the theory}} that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood. Parental behavior and the home environment has either {{no effect on the}} social development of children, or the effect varies significantly between children. Adolescents spend more time with peers than with parents. Therefore, peer groups have stronger correlations with personality development than parental figures do. For example, twin brothers, whose genetic makeup are identical, will differ in personality because they have different groups of friends, not necessarily because their parents raised them differently. Behavioral genetics suggest that up to fifty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> adult personality is due to genetic differences. [...] The environment in which a child is raised accounts for only approximately ten percent in the variance of an adult’s personality. As much as twenty percent of the variance is due to measurement error. [...] This suggests that only a very small part of an adult’s personality is influenced by factors parents control (i.e. the home environment). Harris claims that while it’s true that siblings don’t have identical experiences in the home environment (making it difficult to associate a definite figure to the variance of personality due to home environments), the variance found by current methods is so low that researchers should look elsewhere to try to account for the remaining variance. Harris also states that developing long-term personality characteristics away from the home environment would be evolutionarily beneficial because future success is more likely to depend on interactions with peers than interactions with parents and siblings. Also, because of already existing genetic similarities with parents, developing personalities outside of childhood home environments would further diversify individuals, increasing their evolutionary success.|$|E

The subjects were 60 women {{ranging in age from}} 24 to 74 and were of varying degrees of adiposity. These subjects had participated in the Women's Nutrition Project each year and were not pregnant and/or lactating between the first year and the fourth year. Factors selected for this study included age, waist/hip ratio, triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), mid-arm circumference (MAC), caloric intake, {{percent of calories from fat}} intake, Eating Anxiety Index, Eating Restraint, report of dieting, reproductive history, activity patterns, exercise fluctuation, Health Practices Index, Satisfaction with Health Practices Index, Satisfaction with Food Intake Index, Holmes and Rahe Life Events Scale, Outlook Index, Importance of Slenderness Index, Husband Involvement Index, and Husband Pressure Index. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to identify correlations between the dependent variables and independent variables in order to aid in determining the appropriate model for subsequent multiple regression determinations. Two sets of multiple regression with and without anthropometric factors were calculated to predict the value of a dependent variable - BMI in year 4, threeyear weight fluctuation, and three-year net weight change - from a group of independent variables. The multiple regression equation revealed that four variables, initial TSF, MAC, waist/hip ratio, and caloric intake in year 1 accounted for 71. 7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> the final BMI. Initial BMI and Health Practices Index were predictive factors for weight fluctuation and accounted for 27. 8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> weight fluctuation over three years.

For health care professionals to provide interventions to increase breastfeeding incidence and duration, {{it is essential that}} substantive theory be developed and tested. A correlational descriptive design with causal modeling methodology was utilized. The purposes of the research were three-fold: (1) to examine differences between women who breastfed and bottle-fed; (2) to test Ajzen's theory of planned behavior with a group of 138 breast and bottle-feeding mothers; and (3) to test a model based on the theory to increase explanation in behavior in terms of early experiences and duration of breastfeeding (n = 148). Measures based on the theory, Cuson's Attitudes on Breastfeeding Scale, the Breastfeeding Experience Scale, Hughes Breastfeeding Support Scale, and a demographic questionnaire were used for data collection. Women were contacted in their final weeks of pregnancy, shortly following birth, and for those breastfeeding, four to six weeks postpartum. Data analysis included: use of descriptive, parametric, and nonparametric statistics to examine group differences; psychometric testing; and multiple linear and logistic regression, as well as residual analysis, to test the models. Results indicated {{significant differences between the two}} groups of women on major demographic variables and some model variables. The theory of planned behavior reduced to its predecessor, the theory of reasoned action, and with respecification resulted in a model containing additional variables; previous breastfeeding experience and family income.

Results indicated that the model was capable of accounting for between 24 an! 32 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> inquiry skill for the general population of 17 -year-olds; more specifically, ability alone accounted for between 17 and 22 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> inquiry skill for the general population. Little difference ix. the prediction of inquiry skill for males and females using the model was found. In addition, for nonwhite students, the MEP accounted for only 18 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> science inquiry skill; specifically, ability accounted for only 6 percent of the variance, suggesting that {{little is known about the}} factors contributing to the science inquiry skill of nonwhite students.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} skill {{mismatch}} {{is a significant}} source of inequality in real earnings in the U. S. and that a substantial fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increase in wage dispersion during the period 1973 - 2002 was due to the increase in mismatch rates and mismatch premia. In 2000 - 2002 surplus and deficit qualifications taken together accounted for 4. 3 and 4. 6 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> log earnings, or around 15 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total explained <b>variance.</b> <b>The</b> dramatic increase in over-education rates and premia accounts for around 20 and 48 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increase in the Gini coefficient during the 30 years under analysis for males and females respectively. The surplus qualification factor is important in understanding why earnings inequality polarized in the last decades. ...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{professionals}} {{in science and}} gifted education suggest that elementary teachers should offer interest-based experiences, teach methodological skills, and provide students {{with the opportunity to}} engage in research, as promising methods to nurture scientific talent. This study compared <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> three instructional methods in environmental science (Type I exploratory activities, Type II methodological training, and combined Type I/Type II activities) and <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> grade level, gender, achievement scores, attitude toward science, and self-efficacy for creative productivity on <b>the</b> initiation <b>of</b> scientific investigations. In addition, these variables and assignment to treatment group were investigated for their effect on post-treatment attitudes toward science and post-treatment self-efficacy for creative productivity. ^ A quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design was used to examine <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variables during <b>the</b> ten weeks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study, and grade level and pre-treatment self-efficacy for creative productivity scores were covaried for all analyses. The subjects were 342 above-average 4 th, 5 th and 6 th grade students in 11 states. ^ The discriminant function equation used to investigate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> variables upon investigation initiation was significant (chi square = 31. 53, 5 df, p 3 ̆c. 00001), with five variables accounting for 9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance.</b> Participation in <b>the</b> Type 1 group was the most powerful predictor of student decisions to initiate investigations. ^ The stepwise multiple regression used to investigate self-efficacy accounted for 7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance,</b> beyond <b>the</b> 37 percent accounted for by the covariates. Participation in the Type II group was the most powerful predictor of posttest self-efficacy. ^ The stepwise multiple regression used to investigate science attitude accounted for 21 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance,</b> beyond <b>the</b> 10 percent accounted for by <b>the</b> covariates <b>of</b> grade, pre-treatment self-efficacy, and pre-treatment attitude.

40|$|Many {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that hospital utilization rates vary widely across small geographic areas. The variation is often attributed to the style of practice of the provider. This study demonstrates that hospital utilization varies widely between "micro" areas within individual hospital market areas. Further, the study demonstrates that hospital utilization rates within a hospital market area are more similar to each other than to rates in "micro" areas within other hospital market areas. After adjustment for available demographic, socioeconomic, and epidemiological factors, the utilization rates within "micro" areas are highly related to the group of hospitals that dominates the market area. After simultaneously adjusting for age and poverty, the market share-dominant group explains 35 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> surgical use rates of "micro" areas and 39 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> medical use rates...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of college students' attitudes toward commercialization and their psychological attachment to an intercollegiate athletic program on their purchasing intentions of sponsors' products. The relationships between attitudes toward commercialization and psychological attachment were also examined. Data were collected from college students (N = 124) of a large Midwest University. A series of hierarchical regression analysis revealed that attitudes toward commercialization and psychological attachment together explained 28 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> purchasing intentions; attitudes toward commercialization uniquely explained 12 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> purchasing intentions after controlling for psychological attachment. However, of the three subdimensions of psychological attachment, only team identification {{was significantly associated with}} purchasing intentions while team commitment and school identification did not have significant effects on purchasing intentions. In addition, our study found an interaction effect between team identification and attitudes towards commercialization on purchasing intentions. ...|$|E

The need for little wealth, high revenue return and flexibility shows <b>the</b> economical explanation <b>of</b> fast benefiting agencies more than before. These agencies face with limitations, obstacles and problems such as human resource limitation, lack of facilities to develop produce and lack of fair distribution of financial resources. Therefore, this research which is a discovering one has dealt with the progressive and preventive factors of developing fast benefiting agricultural agencies in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Birjand in <b>the</b> year 2012. <b>The</b> causative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data showed that <b>the</b> six factors <b>of</b> “economical”, “legal-programming”, “relations and connections”, “market management”, “knowledge and skill ” and “policy making ” were identified as progressive factors of developing agricultural fast benefiting agencies which have totally determined 62. 19 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> all progressive factors. <b>The</b> inhibitive factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural fast benefiting agencies include the five ones in order of priority of “legal-office”, “current expenses”, financial”, attitude-agricultural ” and “deep structural ” which determined 60. 56 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> inhibitive factors...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to analyse <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> {{experiencing}} fear due to threatening terror attacks on road accident occurences, fatalities and injuries. This was done by comparing the official Israeli data base of road accidents with the one listing all terror attacks in the country between January 2001 and June 2004. The results show, that during periods of high fear due to severe terror attacks, there are generally fewer road accidents and that these accidents tend to be less severe. A clear picture of negative correlations (explaining between 9 and 25 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance)</b> between citizens hurt or killed in terror attacks and road accidents was found for <b>the</b> first year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intifada, a chronic fear reaction without obvious direct correlations between incidents was found for 2002 and 2003 whilst high, positive correlations (explaining between 32 and 67 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance)</b> were found for <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> 2004, a period most Israelis considered to be post-intifada. The results are discussed as predicted by and supporting Wilde’s theory of target risk. Recommendations for accident reduction interventions are proposed. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> fear on human behaviour in general and specifically on driving behaviour has been studied extensively.
