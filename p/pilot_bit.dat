30|$|In addition, as {{mentioned}} in “Methods” section, the novel PAM transmission scheme {{leads to an}} improved transmission efficiency. The training sequence takes up {{a certain amount of}} transmission energy and hence reduces the overall system efficiency. For the classical DFE-RLS and DFE-LMS equalizers, the predefined training sequence is inserted before the data symbols. The equalizers work in training mode when the training symbols are received and then switch to the equalization mode when data symbols are received. In equalization mode, there are two feed-back methods. In general transmissions, the feed-back bits are obtained from decisions, which is called as direct-decision mode. However, in this mode, decision error will be propagated and cause penalties. Besides, it is also possible to use known <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> as the feed-back bits. In this mode, error propagation could be avoided due to the known <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> at receiver. This mode is called as genie-aided mode. In practical system, the known <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> cannot be used to transmit message. Therefore, the genie-aided mode is only used to theoretical optimal performance evaluations.|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} algorithm allows suitable permutations to {{be designed}} that increase the minimum distance of irregular TCs. The <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> are now distributed along the frame {{in a way that}} they guarantee a good spread between the different groups, and the correlation effect between the pilot groups is reduced. This algorithm works very well for short block sizes [10]. For medium sizes and large blocks, the algorithm leads to a systematic search for an optimized interleaver in a wide domain of parameter values, due to the random selection introduced by parameter a. When the block size is some thousand bits, the algorithm may take an unacceptable computational time to find good interleavers, and we cannot be sure of detecting all the possible cases.|$|R

3000|$|... {{connections}} {{are added to}} the graph for every bit with degree d. These crossbars, of weight equal to 0, connect different interleaved data of the same information bit. Besides, the parameter 0 < α ≤ 1 is used to implement a random variation in the selection. The value α = 1 corresponds to the original Dijkstra's algorithm. We noticed that if we fix α = 1 in our algorithm, the obtained interleavers produce high values of girths but sometimes unacceptable values of minimum distances. The girth is the length of a shortest cycle contained in the graph. This criterion of selection was a priority for the author of [30]. In fact, his first purpose was to maximize the correlation girth while keeping an acceptable minimum Hamming distance. However, the minimum Hamming distance is our most important criterion of selection in order to improve the distance properties of irregular TCs. If the <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> are highly correlated, they may dramatically degrade error performance and even ruin the possible gain due to a large minimum distance. In order to reduce the auto-correlation effect, the interleaver should spread the <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> by increasing the correlation girth. However, the minimum distance can suffer since a long cycle has more probability to contain parity bits of the same data bit. Thus, we do not look for maximizing this criterion but only increasing the correlation girth and searching for higher minimum distances. Therefore, different values were tested for the parameter a, and we finally set a to 0.85, giving a reasonable space of search. Every time an interleaver is found, we estimate the minimum Hamming distance of the irregular TC using the all-zero iterative decoding algorithm [13]. Only interleavers that improve the asymptotic performance of irregular TCs are memorized.|$|R
30|$|An {{irregular}} TC {{consists of}} the concatenation of a non-uniform repetition, an interleaver and a RSC code. In fact, the introduced irregularity {{makes it possible to}} improve the performance of a TC by inserting some bits inside the RSC trellis with a degree d > 2. These high-degree bits are commonly called pilot bits: they have reliable forward and backward metrics in the decoding process, and they propagate on both directions and influence the other bits with degree d = 2. However, making the code irregular leads to an increase in the rate of the constituent codes. Therefore, for usual coding rate values, {{only a small fraction of}} information bits is repeated d > 2 times. Thanks to their higher degree, the <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> include d extrinsics instead of two and are thus extremely well protected.|$|R

40|$|Fixed-rate and rateless channel code constructions are {{designed}} for satisfying conflicting design tradeoffs, leading to codes that benefit from practical implementations, whilst offering a good bit error ratio (BER) and block error ratio (BLER) performance. More explicitly, two novel low-density parity-check code (LDPC) constructions are proposed; the first construction constitutes a family of quasi-cyclic protograph LDPC codes, which has a Vandermonde-like parity-check matrix (PCM). The second construction constitutes a specific class of protograph LDPC codes, which are termed as multilevel structured (MLS) LDPC codes. These codes possess a PCM construction that allows the coexistence of both pseudo-randomness {{as well as a}} structure requiring a reduced memory. More importantly, it is also demonstrated that these benefits accrue without any compromise in the attainable BER/BLER performance. We also present the novel concept of separating multiple users by means of user-specific channel codes, which is referred to as channel code division multiple access (CCDMA), and provide an example based on MLS LDPC codes. In particular, we circumvent the difficulty of having potentially high memory requirements, while ensuring that each user’s bits in the CCDMA system are equally protected. With regards to rateless channel coding, we propose a novel family of codes, which we refer to as reconfigurable rateless codes, that are capable of not only varying their code-rate but also to adaptively modify their encoding/decoding strategy according to the near-instantaneous channel conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed reconfigurable rateless codes are capable of shaping their own degree distribution according to the nearinstantaneous requirements imposed by the channel, but without any explicit channel knowledge at the transmitter. Additionally, a generalised transmit preprocessing aided closed-loop downlink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is presented, in which both the channel coding components as well as the linear transmit precoder exploit the knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). More explicitly, we embed a rateless code in a MIMO transmit preprocessing scheme, in order to attain near-capacity performance across a wide range of channel signal-to-ratios (SNRs), rather than only at a specific SNR. The performance of our scheme is further enhanced {{with the aid of a}} technique, referred to as pilot symbol assisted rateless (PSAR) coding, whereby a predetermined fraction of <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> is appropriately interspersed with the original information bits at the channel coding stage, instead of multiplexing pilots at the modulation stage, as in classic pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM).

40|$|Error {{correction}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in wireless system design as wireless links often suffer high bit error rate due {{to the effects of}} signal attenuation, multipath fading and interference. This paper presents a new cross-layer solution called LEAD to improve the performance of existing channel decoders. While the traditional wisdom of cross-layer design is to exploit physical layer information at upper-layers, LEAD represents a paradigm shift in that it leverages upper-layer protocol signatures to improve the performance of physical layer channel decoding. The approach of LEAD is motivated by two key insights. First, channel codes can correct more errors when the values of some bits, which we refer to as pilots, are known before decoding. Second, some header fields of upper-layer protocols are often fixed or highly biased toward certain values. These distinctive bit pattern signatures can thus be exploited as pilots to assist channel decoding. To realize this idea, we first characterize bit bias in real-life network traffic, and develop an efficient algorithm to extract <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> with assured prediction accuracy. We then propose a decoding framework to allow existing channel decoders to effectively exploit extracted pilots. We implement LEAD on GNURadio/USRP platform and evaluate its performance by replaying real-life packet traces on a testbed of 12 USRP links. Our results show that LEAD significantly improve wireless link performance, while incurring very low overhead. Specifically, LEAD reduces more than 90 % bit errors for 48. 9 % packets, and improves the end-to-end link throughput by 1. 43 x to 1. 93 x over existing error correction schemes...|$|R

30|$|Channel {{frequency}} response (CFR) for a used OFDM subcarrier {{is a necessary}} information for demodulation of data carried by that subcarrier. Conventionally, the transmitter needs to facilitate CFR estimation at the receiver by provision of <b>pilot</b> <b>bits</b> [15]. It is then {{reasonable to assume that}} once a receiver can successfully detect the data carried by the used OFDM subcarriers, it can also provide the CFR for the set of used OFDM subcarriers, i.e., the CSI, at no overhead. For localization, the CSI may be obtained, based on either uplink or downlink transmission, for sending to a localization processor. In this paper, we are only interested in localization with processor residing in the network infrastructure to avoid burdening the generally resource-limited MDs. In this case, uplink CSI estimated by a BS receiver may be sent to the processor at low cost via an existing non-radio connection. On the other hand, sending the downlink CSI estimated by a MD receiver to the processor inevitably requires some radio resource that can be costly. Reducing the cost of sending the downlink CSI to the processor may be done with a chunk-based scheme [16 – 18], where an average magnitude of CFR for a block of contiguous subcarriers is sent instead of the complex values of the CFR of all subcarriers within the block. However, AOA-based localization requires the CFR in complex form [9]. Therefore, strictly following [16 – 18] may not be appropriate for our problem. In this regard, we consider that a similar chunk-based scheme that sends an average complex CFR for the block instead of the average magnitude may be adopted for AOA-based localization. This is because the average CFR obtained by this scheme is essentially same as that obtained by a conventional subcarrier-based scheme with the same total bandwidth but larger subcarrier spacing. However, this scheme therefore provides CFR with less details along the frequency axis. Accordingly, the processor will perform worse on separating the direct path from reflection paths, leading eventually to lower performance.|$|R
