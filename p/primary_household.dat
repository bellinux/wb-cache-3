A main feature of the project is the component sharing model. The first component is responsibility of the communities, which receive technical assistance. The community develops and constructs <b>primary</b> <b>household</b> sanitary latrines, underground sewers and neighborhood collector sewers.

The OPP was very successful and about 100,000 households have developed their own sanitation systems in Orangi. The project was replicated by NGOs and CBOs in other Pakistani cities.

Research data was collected from 6 public and 2 private primary schools in Kastamonu in the 2011 - 2012 academic year. 789 families participated in {{this research}}. Research data was gathered from “Families’ <b>Primary</b> School Level <b>Household</b> Education Expenditure Detection Survey” developed by the researchers. Data analysis, descriptive statistics, Kruskal Wallis H test, Mann Whitney U test, t test, and ANOVA were used in this research. In the research it was observed that the <b>primary</b> school level <b>household</b> education expenditure of families in the 2011 - 2012 academic year is 11, 971. 34 TL (Turkish Lira) total for one student. This amount is approximately 1, 920. 15 TL for the families whose children are in public schools and 10, 051. 19 TL for the families whose children are in private schools. The <b>primary</b> school level <b>household</b> education expenditure of families differs according to school related factors of school type (public/private), education type (full time/ part time) and transportation type (walking/service/car). The <b>primary</b> school level <b>household</b> education expenditure of families differs according to some of the socio-economic status related factors such as with whom the child lives, the education level of the parents, the vocational status of the parents, the family income level, the number of family members, and the class level of the student, but it doesn’t differ according to the number of students in primary education...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This study {{examines}} whether financial assets {{can serve as}} effective instruments for hedging <b>primary</b> <b>household</b> risks such as income risk and whether those hedging-induced demand shifts influence prices of financial assets. We find that among the set of financial assets, the value-minus-growth (HML) portfolio serves as the most effective instrument for hedging income risk. Further, income hedging-induced demand predicts the future returns of value-minus-growth portfolios. The future aggregate value premium {{as well as the}} returns of state-level value-minusgrowth portfolios are higher when income hedging-induced demands are high. In economic terms, one standard deviation shift in hedging demand is associated with 1. 29 % higher HML return next month. This evidence of predictability weakens as the predictability horizon increases, which suggests that hedging-induced demand shifts only have short-term impact on asset prices...|$|E

Using <b>primary</b> <b>household</b> survey data, I find that households faced with the health shock-related expenditures, which were on average equal to two months of household income, are able to smooth consumption on food, housing, and festivals, with small reductions in education spending.
