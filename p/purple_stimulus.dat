40|$|Misalignment of {{the eyes}} can lead to double vision and visual confusion. However, these sensations are rare when {{strabismus}} is acquired early in life, because the extra image is suppressed. To explore the mechanism of perceptual suppression in strabismus, the visual fields were mapped binocularly in 14 human subjects with exotropia. Subjects wore red/blue filter glasses to permit dichoptic stimulation while fixating a central target on a tangent screen. A <b>purple</b> <b>stimulus</b> was flashed at a peripheral location; its reported color ("red" or "blue") revealed which eye's image was perceived at that locus. The maps showed a vertical border between the center of gaze for each eye, splitting the visual field into two separate regions. In each region, perception was mediated by only one eye, with suppression of the other eye. Unexpectedly, stimuli falling on the fovea of the deviated eye were seen in all subjects. However, they were perceived in a location shifted by the angle of ocular deviation. This plasticity in the coding of visual direction allows accurate localization of objects everywhere in the visual scene, {{despite the presence of}} strabismus. © 2012 the authors...|$|E
40|$|Following {{destruction}} or deafferentation {{of primary}} visual cortex (area V 1, striate cortex), clinical blindness ensues, but re-sidual visual functions may, nevertheless, persist without percep-tual consciousness (a condition termed blindsight). The study of patients with such lesions thus offers {{a unique opportunity to}} investigate what visual capacities are mediated by the extrastriate pathways that bypass V 1. Here we provide evidence for a crucial role of the collicular–extrastriate pathway in nonconscious visuo-motor integration by showing that, in the absence of V 1, the superior colliculus (SC) is essential to translate visual signals that cannot be consciously perceived into motor outputs. We found that a gray stimulus presented in the blind field of a patient with unilateral V 1 loss, although not consciously seen, can influence his behavioral and pupillary responses to consciously perceived stimuli in the intact field (implicit bilateral summation). Notably, this effect was accompanied by selective activations in the SC and in occipito-temporal extrastriate areas. However, when instead of gray <b>stimuli</b> we presented <b>purple</b> <b>stimuli,</b> which predominantly draw on S-cones and are thus invisible to the SC, any evidence of implicit visuomotor integration disappeared and activations in the SC dropped significantly. The present findings show that the SC acts as an interface between sensory and motor processing in the human brain, thereby providing a contribution to visually guided behavior that may remain functionally and anatomically segregated from the geniculo-striate pathway and entirely out-side conscious visual experience. ...|$|R
40|$|Temporo-nasal {{asymmetry}} {{in visual}} responses {{has been observed}} in many behavioural studies. These observations have typically been attributed to the anatomical asymmetry of fibres projecting to the Superior Colliculus (SC), even though this attribution is debated. The present study investigates temporo-nasal asymmetry in multisensory integration, and, by exploiting the absence of S-cone input to the SC, measures a behavioural response dependent strictly on {{the activity of the}} SC itself. We used a redundant signal paradigm for simple reaction times, with visual <b>stimuli</b> (red or <b>purple)</b> presented in either the temporal or the nasal hemifield. Participants responded more quickly to concurrent audio-visual (AV) stimuli than to either an auditory or a visual stimulus alone, an established phenomenon known as the Redundant Target Effect (RTE). The nature of this effect was dependent on the colour of the visual stimuli, suggesting its modulation by collicular circuits. When spatially-coincident audio-visual stimuli were visible to the SC (i. e. red stimuli), the RTE depended on a neural coactivation mechanism, suggesting an integration of multisensory information. When using stimuli invisible to the SC (i. e. <b>purple</b> <b>stimuli),</b> the RTE depended only on a simple statistical facilitation effect, in which the two sensory stimuli were processed by independent channels. Finally, we demonstrate that the multisensory integration effect was stronger for stimuli presented to the temporal hemifield than to the nasal hemifield. Taken together, these findings suggested that multisensory stimulation can be differentially effective depending on specific stimulus parameters...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{studies have}} shown that the {{superior}} colliculus (SC) is important for synthesising information from multiple senses into a unified map of space. Here, we tested whether the SC is a critical neural substrate for multisensory spatial integration in humans. To do so, we took advantage of neurophysiological findings revealing that the SC does not receive direct projections from short-wavelength-sensitive S cones. In a simple reaction-time task, participants responded more quickly to concurrent peripheral (extra-foveal) audiovisual (AV) stimuli than to an auditory or visual stimulus alone, a phenomenon known as the redundant target effect (RTE). We show that the nature of this RTE was dependent on the colour of the visual <b>stimulus.</b> When using <b>purple</b> short-wavelength <b>stimuli,</b> to which the SC is blind, RTE was simply explained by probability summation, indicating that the redundant auditory and visual channels are independent. Conversely, with red long-wavelength stimuli, visible to the SC, the RTE was relate d to nonlinear neural summation, which constitutes evidence of integration of different sensory information. We also demonstrate that when AV stimuli were presented at fixation, so that the spatial orienting component of the task was reduced, neural summation was possible regardless of stimulus colour. Together, these findings provide support for a pivotal role of the SC in mediating multisensory spatial integration in humans, when behaviour involves spatial orienting responses...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{was aimed}} at verifying {{the role of the}} {{superior}} colliculus (SC) in human spatial orienting. To do so, subjects performed two experimental tasks that have been shown to involve SC’s activation in animals, that is a multisensory integration task (Experiment 1 and 2) and a visual target selection task (Experiment 3). To investigate this topic in humans, we took advantage of neurophysiological finding revealing that retinal S-cones do not send projections to the collicular and magnocellular pathway. In the Experiment 1, subjects performed a simple reaction-time task in which they were required to respond as quickly as possible to any sensory stimulus (visual, auditory or bimodal audio-visual). The visual stimulus could be an S-cone stimulus (invisible to the collicular and magnocellular pathway) or a long wavelength stimulus (visible to the SC). Results showed that when using S-cone stimuli, RTs distribution was simply explained by probability summation, indicating that the redundant auditory and visual channels are independent. Conversely, with red long-wavelength stimuli, visible to the SC, the RTs distribution was related to nonlinear neural summation, which constitutes evidence of integration of different sensory information. We also demonstrate that when AV stimuli were presented at fixation, so that the spatial orienting component of the task was reduced, neural summation was possible regardless of stimulus color. Together, these findings provide support for a pivotal role of the SC in mediating multisensory spatial integration in humans, when behavior involves spatial orienting responses. Since previous studies have shown an anatomical asymmetry of fibres projecting to the SC from the hemiretinas, the Experiment 2 {{was aimed at}} investigating temporo-nasal asymmetry in multisensory integration. To do so, subjects performed monocularly the same task shown in the Experiment 1. When spatially coincident audio-visual stimuli were visible to the SC (i. e. red stimuli), the RTE depended on a neural coactivation mechanism, suggesting an integration of multisensory information. When using stimuli invisible to the SC (i. e. <b>purple</b> <b>stimuli),</b> the RTE depended only on a simple statistical facilitation effect, in which the two sensory stimuli were processed by independent channels. Finally, we demonstrate that the multisensory integration effect was stronger for stimuli presented to the temporal hemifield than to the nasal hemifield. Taken together, these findings suggested that multisensory stimulation can be differentially effective depending on specific stimulus parameters. The Experiment 3 was aimed at verifying the role of the SC in target selection by using a color-oddity search task, comprising stimuli either visible or invisible to the collicular and magnocellular pathways. Subjects were required to make a saccade toward a target that could be presented alone or with three distractors of another color (either S-cone or long-wavelength). When using S-cone distractors, invisible to the SC, localization errors were similar to those observed in the distractor-free condition. Conversely, with long-wavelength distractors, visible to the SC, saccadic localization error and variability were significantly greater than in either the distractor-free condition or the S-cone distractors condition. Our results clearly indicate that the SC plays a direct role in visual target selection in humans. Overall, our results indicate that the SC {{plays an important role in}} mediating spatial orienting responses both when required covert (Experiments 1 and 2) and overt orienting (Experiment 3). ...|$|R
