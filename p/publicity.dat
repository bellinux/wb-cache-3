5|$|Mansfield's <b>publicity</b> {{drive was}} one of the best in Hollywood. For <b>publicity</b> she gave up all privacy, keeping her doors always open to photographers. In 1954, the day before Christmas she walked into {{publicist}} James Byron's office with a gift and asked him to supervise her <b>publicity.</b> From that time till the end of 1961, Byron shaped much of her <b>publicity.</b> Byron appointed most people in her team— William Shiffrin (press agent), Greg Bautzer (attorney) and Charles Goldring (business manager), and constantly planted bits of <b>publicity</b> material in the media. She appeared in about 2,500 newspaper photographs between September 1956 and May 1957, and had about 122,000 lines of newspaper copy written about her during this time.|$|E

Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, {{rape and murder of}} a young woman; he maintained that the charges were orchestrated by Evans.

Taking a job with Marsham Tyres in 1937 enabled him to become an amateur cricketer.

5|$|In 1990 Myron entered Dewey into {{a charity}} pet {{photograph}} contest {{as a way}} to promote the library; Dewey won the contest after receiving more than 80% of the votes. Dewey's win was covered in The Des Moines Register, which led to increased local and state <b>publicity</b> in print and on television, and the library never again made an effort to increase Dewey's <b>publicity</b> outside of the local area. An appearance in the June/July 1990 issue of Country magazine took Dewey's story national, after which eleven people claimed to have been the person who left Dewey in the book drop {{as a way to}} protect him from the cold.|$|E

5|$|Mansfield {{attempted}} to defuse public concern by staging the London {{opening of the}} comedy Prince Karl as a charity performance, despite Stoker's warning that critics would view it {{as an attempt to}} obtain favorable <b>publicity</b> for the production. Although some press reports suggested that Mansfield stopped performing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in London because of the murders, financial reasons are more likely. Despite widespread <b>publicity</b> due to the murders and Mansfield's disputes with Bandmann, attendance was mediocre, and the production was losing money. On December 1, Mansfield's tenancy at the Lyceum ended. He left London, taking his company on a tour of England. In December they performed Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and other plays in Liverpool and Derby, then continued to other cities and performed other plays.|$|E

The members of the party's pre-poll alliance committee were M. Veerappa Moily, A. K. Antony, Jitender Singh, and Suresh Pachauri.
