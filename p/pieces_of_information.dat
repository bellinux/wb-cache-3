5|$|To decrypt Enigma messages, three <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> were needed: (1) {{a general}} {{understanding}} of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the plug connections on the plugboard).

5|$|Cockroaches {{appear to}} use just two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> {{to decide where}} to go, namely how dark {{it is and how}} many other {{cockroaches}} there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E
5|$|Kapena married Kahilipulu on September 2, 1846, in Honolulu, Oʻahu. Kapena {{was also}} {{married to a}} sister of Joshua Kekaulahao. She died before 1858. Kapena led the {{procession}} at the funeral of all six of her family members including her two brothers, nephew, cousin and father. It is not known if these two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> refer to the same person. Nothing beyond that is known about Kapena's marital status. In the Hawaiian tradition of hānai (a form of informal adoption), he adopted his nephew John Makini Kapena (1843–1887), the only son of Makini and Naʻawa, a relative of King Kalākaua. John Kapena {{went on to become}} an important government minister under the reign of Kalākaua in the 1870s. The younger Kapena also married Emma Aʻalailoa Malo (1846–1886), the only daughter of David Malo, the elder Kapena's Lahainaluna classmate.|$|E

5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her come across as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E
5|$|Two {{extensive}} espionage {{cases in}} Sweden during the Cold War involved Boden Fortress, both exposed in 1951. The Enbom case involved Fritiof Enbom, a former worker at the Swedish State Railways in Boden, {{and later the}} local editor for the communist newspaper Norrskensflamman. He was exposed by his own careless talkoften {{under the influence of}} alcoholto the owners of the house in Stockholm where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden. The family told the Swedish Security Service after the Christmas holidays of 1951, and Enbom was arrested on 16 February 1952. During interrogation, he confessed that hefrom February 1943 to April 1951had met with Soviet employers around 25 times. Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence, most of it from public sources, but also secrets, of which the armament of one of the forts in the fortress was one of the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that concerned Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications. He was sentenced to lifetime hard labour, but was released after ten years. The other case involved Ernst Hilding Andersson, who was arrested on 21 September 1951. He had carried out seven missions for the Soviets and had provided them primarily with information regarding the Swedish Navy, but also information on the fortifications along the Norrland coast, and an initiated report about Boden Fortress and the airforce unit located in Boden and Luleå, Norrbottens flygbaskår. Andersson was, like Fritjof Enbom, sentenced to hard labour for life.|$|E

25|$|Recall {{memory is}} active when a {{familiar}} sound triggers {{a feeling of}} pain from a past event, {{but most of the}} recall is shut out from traumatic event. It is similar to classical conditioning, when a dog hears a bell it begins to react to the noise rather than an exterior variable like food or an electric shock. The use of therapy is constructed for a person with this problem to help avoid the fear associated with sounds or objects, and be able to then recall other <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that happened during the event.|$|E

A study tested the {{hypothesis}} that cockroaches use just two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the Free University of Brussels and other European institutions created a set of tiny robots that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches' perception of critical mass. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real roaches.|$|E
25|$|The IDF {{designed}} the DOI system {{to provide a}} form of persistent identification, in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object {{to which it is}} associated. It also associates metadata with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with a social infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|In particular, {{associative}} learning, {{which is}} another type of episodic memory, is vulnerable {{to the effects of}} aging, and this has been demonstrated across various study paradigms. This has been explained by the Associative Deficit Hypothesis (ADH), which states that aging is associated with a deficiency in creating and retrieving links between single units of information. This can include knowledge about context, events or items. The ability to bind <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> together with their episodic context in a coherent whole has been reduced in the elderly population. Furthermore, the older adults’ performances in free recall involved temporal contiguity to a lesser extent than for younger people, indicating that associations regarding contiguity become weaker with age.|$|E

A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider {{their point of view}} and experience of the story.

Traditionally between ten and twenty questions, the quiz asks the players to identify the Mole and several <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> regarding the Mole, including the Mole's activity in challenges, biographical profile, their fashion and/or culinary choices during the show, etc. The player scoring lowest on the quiz (and taking the longest time to do so, {{in the event of}} tied scores) is eliminated from the game. The US version saw a format change from twenty questions to ten questions from Season 2 on, usually with all questions available to the public. Season 5 of the Australian series had contestants answer five questions about the Mole (not filmed), plus a further five questions for the live eliminations. On two separate occasions, the live elimination computer quiz system malfunctioned and didn't record some contestants' responses. The rules stated that if this were to happen the elimination would be based on the five questions answered before the live show.|$|E
