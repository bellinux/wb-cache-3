5000|$|George {{returned}} to Christchurch; by April 1886, his name {{appeared in the}} newspaper again as a Christchurch photographer. His business partner, Walton, retired and the firm was from then known as 'Eden George'. [...] George became embroiled {{in a series of}} legal cases between 1888 and 1890, starting with a wages dispute with Karl Gerstenkorn, whom he had met in Sydney in 1888 and hired as a <b>plate</b> <b>maker</b> for his business. Their legal battle escalated when George claimed his studio had been ransacked by an intruder; speculation attributed this either to Gerstenkorn, or rival photographers, or Eden himself seeking insurance compensation. George unwisely alleged Gerstenkorn's involvement in public and was successfully charged with slander. George sold his photography business to Wrigglesworth and Binns at the end of 1893. [...] He went to Australia and established new businesses in Sydney and Melbourne.|$|E
40|$|The {{detailed}} study of a battery <b>plate</b> <b>maker,</b> {{who had worked with}} cadmium for 36 years, showed that proteinuria, typical of renal tubular dysfunction, had been observed for 25 years and during the last 12 years of his life the patient had suffered increasing disability from gross bone disease. Several bone biopsies and detailed metabolic studies showed typical severe osteomalacia, which responded well initially to calcium and vitamin D treatment. Examination of the liver both in life and after death showed a gross excess of cadmium. This was also found in the kidneys after death. Previously unreported changes were present in the bones, especially the lumbar vertebrae which were probably more the result of gross bone deformity than cadmium deposition. The mechanism of development of the severe acquired Fanconi syndrome was thought to be a combination of dietary calcium and vitamin D deficiency and impaired calcium absorption from abnormal vitamin D synthesis, related to the cadmium deposition in the renal tubules, which also caused the defect in renal tubular reabsorption...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{vertebrate}} {{neural crest}} is formed {{at the border}} between the neural plate and nonneural ectoderm during neurulation and eventually gives rise to a variety of cell types, including neurons, glia, facial chondrocytes and osteoblasts, and melanocytes. Although several secreted molecules, such as BMP, Wnts, FGF, and Noelin, have been implicated in neural crest formation, {{little is known about the}} precise intracellular mechanism underlying neural crest induction and differentiation. Here, we have identified a novel NK- 1 class homeobox gene Nbx in Xenopus whose expression is correlated with neural crest formation. We also found that Nbx harbors an Eh 1 domain and is a transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of Nbx suppressed neural <b>plate</b> <b>makers</b> and caused enhanced expression of the neural crest maker Slug. In contrast, the overexpression of a dominant negative form of Nbx during neurula stages suppressed the expression of the neural crest marker Slug and expanded neural markers such as Otx 2 and Sox 2. Taken together, we propose that Nbx is an essential transcriptional repressor required to permit neural crest induction by inhibiting the neural fate...|$|R
