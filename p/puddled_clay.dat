5|$|Plans for the {{building}} of the reservoir were under discussion before the Second World War, and an Act of Parliament submitted by the Bristol Waterworks Company was passed in 1939. Following this, farms were bought by the company and farmed by the previous owners as tenancies. Farms and buildings still remaining in private hands were acquired by compulsory purchase. The sanction for construction was given in 1949 and the contract awarded to A.E. Farr, who employed 300 people on the site. The main dam was stabilised by injecting concrete into the cracks in the bedrock. The core of the dam was made of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> mixed with sand. This {{was the first time the}} gain in strength brought about by the use of sand drains had been quantified. The lake was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, with the unveiling of a commemorative stone and plaque, which can be seen from the dam, on 17 April 1956, although it was not full until 25 February 1958. Flowers were presented to the Queen at the opening of Chew Valley Lake by Judith Blair Brown, daughter of Kennedy Brown, who worked at Bristol Water Works at the time of construction of the lake.|$|E

500|$|Roman forts were {{normally}} {{accompanied by}} a civilian settlement, or vicus: at Reculver this lay outside {{the north and west}} sides of the fort, much of it in areas now lost to the sea, and was extensive, perhaps covering [...] "some ten hectares [...] in all." [...] In 1936 R.F. Jessup noted that [...] "a Roman building with a hypocaust and tesselated [...] stood considerably to the northward of the fort": this structure had been observed by the [...] 18th-century antiquarian John Battely, and was probably [...] "an external bath [...] relating to [...] the fort." [...] In the same area Battely described [...] "several cisterns" [...] between 10and 12feet (3–3.7m) square, lined with oak planks and sealed at the bottom with <b>puddled</b> <b>clay.</b> He believed that these were for storing rainwater, and noted that a Roman strigil, which would have been used in a bath house, had been found in a similar cistern at Reculver; he also observed that [...] "such a multitude [...] has been discovered, almost in our memory, as proves that the ancient inhabitants of the place were very numerous." [...] In the 20th century twelve wells of the Roman period were identified {{to the west of the}} fort, ten of which were square; all were cut into the hard layer of sandstone below the soft sandstone of the Thanet Beds, thus tapping into the water table. These and other 20th-century finds from the Roman period extend to [...] west of the fort, and date to a period between 170 and 360, roughly coinciding with the period of occupation at the fort itself.|$|E

50|$|Brindley's {{technique}} minimised {{the amount}} of earth moving by developing the principle of contouring. He preferred to use a circuitous route that avoided embankments, and tunnels rather than cuttings. Though this recognised the primitive methods of earth-moving available at the time, it meant that his canals were often much longer than a more adventurous approach would have produced. But his greatest contribution was the technique of <b>puddling</b> <b>clay</b> to produce a watertight clay-based material, and its use in lining canals. <b>Puddle</b> <b>clay</b> was used extensively in UK canal construction in the period starting shortly after his death. Starting about 1840 <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> was used more widely as the water-retaining element (or core) within earthfill dams, particularly in the Pennines.|$|R

60|$|After lunch Jim {{crossed the}} marsh with Jake and stopped where a ridge of higher ground broke {{off at the}} edge of a muddy creek. In the corner, partly {{sheltered}} by a bank of gorse, stood a small white house with a roof of rusty iron where the thatch had been. The whitewash had fallen off in places, exposing a rough, granulated wall, for the house was a dabbin, built of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay.</b> A window was broken and the door hung crookedly. Except for a few rows of withered potatoes, the garden was occupied by weeds. Three or four shellducks, hatched from wild birds' eggs, paddled about the creek.|$|E
60|$|A dairy {{was first}} to be made. This was {{partially}} {{cut out of the}} side of the slope, and lined with sun-baked bricks. Against the walls, which projected above the ground, earth was piled, to make them of a very considerable thickness. Strong beams were placed across the roof; over these rafters was nailed felt, whitewashed upon both sides to keep out insects. Upon this was placed a considerable thickness of rushes, and, over all, <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> was spread a foot deep. Ventilation was given by a wide chimney rising behind it, and light entered by two windows in front. The whole of the interior was whitewashed.|$|E
60|$|To be sure, the {{primitive}} savage, unversed {{as he was}} in pastes and glazes, in moulds and ornaments, did not pass his life entirely devoid of cups and platters. Coconut shell and calabash rind, horn of ox and skull of enemy, bamboo-joint and capacious rhomb-shell, all alike, no doubt, supplied him with congenial implements for drink or storage. Like Eve in the Miltonic Paradise, there lacked him not fit vessels pure; picking some luscious tropical fruit, the savoury pulp he chewed, and in the rind still as he thirsted scooped the brimming stream. This was satisfactory as far as it went, of course, but it was not pottery. He couldn't boil his joint for dinner in coco-nut or skull; he had to do it with stone pot-boilers, in a rude kettle of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|E

50|$|The name Barra da Tijuca can {{be roughly}} {{translated}} as 'Swamp Sandbank'. Barra means port entrance or sandbank, and Tijuca {{is a word}} originally from the Tupi ty-yúc and means putrid water, mud, swamp, <b>puddle,</b> <b>clay</b> or clay-pit.|$|R
60|$|Collective {{humanity}} owes a great debt {{of gratitude}} to the first potter. Before his days the art of boiling, though in one sense very simple and primitive indeed, was in another sense very complex, cumbersome, and lengthy. The unsophisticated savage, having duly speared and killed his antelope, proceeded to light a roaring fire, with flint or drill, {{by the side of}} some convenient lake or river in his tropical jungle. Then he dug a big hole in the soft mud close to the water's edge, and let the water (rather muddy) percolate into it, or sometimes even he plastered over its bottom with <b>puddled</b> <b>clay.</b> After that, he heated some smooth round stones red hot in the fire close by, and drawing them out gingerly between two pieces of stick, dropped them one by one, spluttering and fizzing, into his improvised basin or kettle. This, of course, made the water in the hole boil; and the unsophisticated savage thereupon thrust into it his joint of antelope, repeating the process over and over again until the sodden meat was completely seethed to taste on the outside. If one application was not sufficient, he gnawed off the cooked meat from the surface with his stout teeth, innocent as yet of the dentist's art, and plunged the underdone core back again, till it exactly suited his not over-delicate or dainty fancy.|$|E
50|$|Cob {{material}} is known by many names including adobe, lump clay, <b>puddled</b> <b>clay,</b> chalk mud, wichert, clay daubins, swish (Asante Twi), torchis (French), bauge (French), bousille (French mud with moss), and cat and clay.|$|E
50|$|In soils which lack natural clay, {{additional}} {{water loss}} to drainage and permeation is prevented by a liner. Pond liners are PVC or EPDM foils that are placed between {{the soil of}} the pond bed and the water. Liners can also be made from <b>puddled</b> <b>clay,</b> and ponds on free-draining soils can even be self-sealing with fine sediments washed into the pond.|$|E
50|$|The idea of damming the Ord {{was first}} {{mentioned}} over 100 years ago, when the Western Australia Commissioner of Tropical Agriculture, Adrian Despeissis, suggested, Substantial wooden dams constructed on a double row of jarrah piles {{driven into the}} bed of the river, with a core wall of <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> between, would appear to form suitable weirs.|$|R
50|$|It is 445 ft long, {{with four}} arches of 50 ft span, and 62 ft {{high above the}} surface of the river. According to {{measurements}} by John Rennie as the canal was nearing completion, there was around 3 ft of <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> {{at the bottom of the}} canal. The aqueduct was designed to carry a depth of 8 ft of water.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was formed}} by {{the construction of a}} continuous embankment on the floodplain of the River Lea at Chingford. An earth embankment divides the reservoir into two compartments that are connected by three large diameter culverts. The external grassed embankment consists of a central <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> core with shoulder filling comprising a mixture of river terraced gravels and alluvial deposits.|$|R
50|$|The {{excavated}} {{sides were}} almost perpendicular. To form the inverted arch or U-shape and prevent water permeating, the sides were constructed of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> lined with concrete mixed with rubble then altars (steps {{in the dry}} dock wall) of Lockyer Creek freestone. The 1887 excavation to extend the dock required only limited lining and the base was not concreted until 1901.|$|E
50|$|John Warner, {{brother of}} Patrick Warner of Ardeer {{supervised}} the construction. As developed by James Brindley and practiced elsewhere later, <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> {{was used to}} seal the canal; it brought in with difficulty by cart and took four months to build and cost the Stevenston Coal Company £4857/4s. The transport of coal along it cost 3d per ton and the transfer from barge to cart to boat cost a further 8d per ton.|$|E
50|$|At the {{geographical}} centre of Acton lies Acton Park, {{the location of}} the former Acton Hall. The central feature of the park is the lake. It was originally constructed using <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> in the 18th century but during the 1970s, the pond was drained and butyl lined. Fishing is popular on the lake with platforms provided for anglers. (The lake is closed for fishing during the Wildfowl nesting period). A wetland area exists and supports a diverse range of wildlife.|$|E
50|$|By 1812, {{progress}} {{was being made}} {{with the construction of}} the Grand Western Canal, but it was hampered by rock cuttings at Holcombe Rogus, from which springs of water gushed, and there was a need to line some sections with <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> to prevent leakage. Lime kilns were constructed to provide the materials, which can still be seen beside the canal, close to the Waytown Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The reservoir's dam was {{completed}} in 1904. It is an earth fill embankment dam, 22.5 m high, which required some 500,000 LT of earth to build. There is a vertical <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> core supported by zoned earth fill shoulders. The higher part of the upstream shoulder is faced in dry rubble pitching about 60 centimetres (2 ft) thick. The crest and downstream shoulder are grassed.|$|R
50|$|The Barton Aqueduct of 1761, and {{subsequent}} canal aqueducts in the United Kingdom, used {{large quantities of}} masonry and puddling to obtain watertightness. After the success of The Iron Bridge in 1789, however, cast iron was used by Telford on aqueducts such as Chirk and Pontcysyllte. Aqueducts built {{in the early part}} of the 19th century use either <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> or an iron trough in no particular pattern.|$|R
50|$|The dam extends 175 ft {{below ground}} to the solid rock {{underlying}} the valley. It was built of <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> with a central concrete core and faced with granite on the lake side. A 24 in diameter pipe through the dam leads to the pumping station while a larger one is used to remove silt collecting against the dam. A flow of water is maintained in the River Yeo through a compensation channel and an overflow weir and spillway take flood water downstream.|$|E
50|$|Poured and puddled adobe (<b>puddled</b> <b>clay,</b> piled earth) today called cob, is made {{by placing}} soft adobe in layers, rather than making by {{individual}} dried bricks or using a form. Puddle is a general term for a clay or clay and sand based material worked into a dense, plastic state. These are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the Americas until holes in the ground were used as forms and then later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the Spanish.|$|E
50|$|They {{are usually}} shallow, saucer-shaped and lined with <b>puddled</b> <b>clay,</b> chalk or marl on an {{insulating}} straw layer over a bottom layer of chalk or lime. To deter earthworms from their natural tendency of burrowing upwards, {{which in a}} short while would make the clay lining porous, a layer of soot would be incorporated or lime mixed with the clay. The clay is usually covered with straw to prevent cracking by the sun and a final layer of chalk rubble or broken stone to protect the lining from the hoofs of sheep or cattle.|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is formed}} by a continuous earthen embankment that encloses the basin. The embankments {{consist of a}} central <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> core with a selected material adjacent to the core forming a filter. The core is a maximum of 12 ft wide at the base and tapers to 5 ft wide at the crest. The core typically extends 3 ft into the London Clay to form a watertight cut off.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was created}} for the Weardale and Shildon District Waterworks Company, with construction of the dam between 1873 and 1879. The earth embankment dam was built across the valley of Waskerley Beck, and measures 1020 feet long and 82 feet high. It was constructed with a <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> core, which extended upward from the cut-off trench excavated into the rock foundation on the hillsides. A seven foot diameter draw-off tunnel in one abutment controls reservoir elevation.|$|R
25|$|Timber coffer dams were constructed; {{they were}} 76ft 6in by 29ft with two skins, {{the space between}} being filled with <b>puddle</b> <b>clay.</b> James Nasmyth had a novel design of steam pile driver; it had first been used in Devonport Docks in 1845; it could deliver 60 to 70 blows a minute; the cycle time with the hand {{operated}} pile drivers formerly in use was four minutes. The drop weight was 1½ tons and its stroke was 2ft 9in; one was purchased from Nasmyth.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} occupies 350 acre {{and holds}} 3,493 million imperial gallons (15,880,000 m3). Its maximum height above the {{original ground level}} is 56 ft. Like the other Lower Thames reservoirs, it is of traditional earthen dam construction, with a <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> core supported by ballast embankments built from materials excavated on site. It is entirely man-made, as the area had no natural topographical features that could be dammed off to create a reservoir. To make inspecting {{the integrity of the}} reservoir easier, Thames Water maintains a commercial flock of sheep on the reservoir banks to keep the grass on the reservoir banks close-cropped.|$|E
5000|$|From the 30 January 1867 until 5 November {{that year}} hourly checks were made {{until it was}} deemed safe to reopen the pit. Tomlinson {{describes}} a visit he made to the pithead during this time: [...] One shaft was filled up - chokeful of earth and rubbish the other had a wooden scaffold suspended by wire ropes, and let down about twenty yards. Upon this cage was first piled straw, &c., and then <b>puddled</b> <b>clay</b> so that, except a small aperture from a temporary iron pipe (which contains a valve to close or open the orifice at will), this shaft, also, was sealed up.|$|E
50|$|Close to Milefortlet 21 are {{the remains}} of the Elizabethan salt pans. It is thought that they were begun around 1630 and leased to Richard Barwise in 1634. On the beach was a water tank on a wooden scaffold, whose {{footings}} remain, from which sea water ran onto the Sleech in the Kinch. Sleech is the sand from the beach; the Kinch where it was piled up is the large pond, sealed by <b>puddled</b> <b>clay.</b> The remains of these salt pans can be clearly seen to date. The strong brine from the Kinch trickled down to the south. The brine was then boiled in iron pans to produce salt, which crystallised out of the brine.|$|E
50|$|A {{considerable}} number of early notable dams were built in that era and they are now {{sometimes referred to as}} the 'Pennines embankment' type. These dams are characterized by a slender vertical <b>puddle</b> <b>clay</b> core supported on both sides by earthfill shoulders of more heterogeneous material. To control under-seepage through the natural foundation below the dam, the Pennines embankments generally constructed a puddle clay-filled cutoff trench in rock directly below the central core. Later construction often used concrete to fill the cutoff trench.|$|R
50|$|To make <b>puddle,</b> <b>clay</b> {{or heavy}} loam is chopped with a spade and mixed {{into a plastic}} state with water and {{sometimes}} coarse sand or grit to discourage excavation by moles or water voles. The puddle is laid about 10 in thick at the sides and nearly 3 ft thick {{at the bottom of}} a canal, built up in layers. Puddle has to be kept wet in order to remain waterproof so it is important for canals to be kept filled with water.|$|R
25|$|Leakage was {{affected}} by springs breaking through the clay lining of the canal bed. In summer when the springs receded, water was lost through these holes at a rate greater than the available supply. In one of the attempts to rectify this problem, {{the size of the}} locks was reduced which resulted in their unusual double headed appearance. In a further attempt to prevent water loss, at King's Reach, the section immediately east of Sapperton Tunnel, the canal was lined with concrete rather than <b>puddle</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|R
