25|$|The {{show was}} put on by the Bangkok University Theatre Company in July, 2011. It was then <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> in Mongkol RCA Studio in June, 2014. In both productions, Hedwig was played by Chanudol Suksatit.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's been <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> y'reince, and by y'reince's own orders!", {{and other}} printed notices were {{submitted}} for inspection.|$|E
6000|$|Aur. Nay, put on, <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> sweet sir; {{why should}} you be {{uncovered}} before the fop your master, the wretched wight, the mortal of a grovelling soul? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Are {{you going}} out again without taking tea, Caleb?" [...] said Mrs. Garth, seeing that her {{absent-minded}} husband was <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> the hat {{which he had}} just taken off.|$|R
60|$|Old Goslin looked up, {{took off}} his spectacles, rubbed them, <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1974: The {{project is}} <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold <b>again</b> {{due to the}} {{construction}} of Space Mountain.|$|R
60|$|The {{clothes were}} soon unwound from the rope, and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> Captain Holland {{cut off all}} the slack of the rope, and made it into a coil.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm nearly well," [...] chirped a cricket, whose stiff tail {{had been}} pulled off by a naughty child and nicely <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> by a very skilful elf.|$|E
60|$|Still they conquered at last--for God {{was with}} them, and the Spirit of God; and they <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> {{and again the}} armour of God, AFTER they had cast it off {{for a while to}} their own hurt.|$|E
60|$|He {{peeled off}} his coat down to the elbows, and then he slowly <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
25|$|Afterwards, he reduced {{training}} {{and during the}} months preceding the Iraq War, Fischer began <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> weight <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{old lady}} smiled, {{took off her}} glasses, wiped them with her handkerchief, and <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|Without another word, she <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> {{the cloak}} she had thrown off, and a small, tight-fitting cap. Adam too {{put on his}} cap, and, after seeing that his {{revolver}} was all right, gave her his hand, and they left the house together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr Clennam,' {{returned}} the other, rising, taking his cap {{off in the}} flat of his hand, and so holding it, ready to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> 'you do me honour. You are welcome, sir;' with a low bow. 'Frederick, a chair. Pray sit down, Mr Clennam.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You get to {{hell out}} of that!" [...] said Fred. He had <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> his rough store suit {{in which he had}} come from Cahoga County, and there was a {{dangerous}} look about his big shoulders and his set jaw. And the waiter slunk back.|$|E
5000|$|What is the {{difference}} between the times you are able to keep weight off and the times when you <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Creed {{took off}} his spectacles, wiped them to help himself to see more clearly {{what he had to}} say, and <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why no,' {{replied the}} man, looking into his hat, {{throwing}} his handkerchief in at one dab, and <b>putting</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> 'That's pretty plain, that is.' ...|$|R
60|$|At {{a town of}} some size, {{where they}} halted for two days, relief was afforded by the wheels being taken off the wagons, and rough runners affixed, the wheels being placed on the carts, as {{that they could be}} <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> in case of a thaw.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after this}} the sultan expired. The attendants buried the body {{secretly}} {{on the island}} for fear of the Monguls. They washed it carefully before the interment, according to custom, and then <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> {{a portion of the}} same dress which the sultan had worn when living, having no means of procuring or making any other shroud.|$|E
60|$|Rather must we mourn {{over those}} human beings who, {{being made in}} the {{likeness}} of God, and redeemed again into that likeness by our Lord Jesus Christ, and baptized into that likeness by the Holy Spirit, <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> of their own will the likeness of the beasts which perish; and find too often, alas! too late, that the wages of sin are death.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{from behind}} {{the foot of the}} hill six {{horsemen}} dashed out. The lads had already taken the precaution of taking off their hats and <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> forage-caps <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|When he <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> it relapsed {{into that}} {{likeness}} of a half-shut accordion from which Lydia had rescued it; {{but she only}} saw the face under it.|$|R
60|$|They {{looked at}} each other, {{and up and down}} the street. The man on the coach-steps took his hat off, and <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> and whistled a little.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} dawned clear {{and cold and}} after a hearty breakfast the snow-shoes were brought forth. First Pat {{explained}} the tie in common use and showed just how to adjust the rawhide thongs to give free play to the ankles and yet prevent the toes from creeping forward to the crossbars. With the thongs properly adjusted the shoes could be easily kicked off or <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> without untying the knots.|$|E
6000|$|Kitty's humor had changed; {{she was now}} {{eager to}} see the doll's splendid clothes taken off and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "Come and look at it," [...] she said to Sydney; [...] "I want you to enjoy my {{birthday}} as much as I do." [...] Left by himself, Randal {{got rid of the}} parasol by putting it on a table near the door. Mrs. Presty beckoned to him to join her at the further end of the room.|$|E
60|$|Master Hansen {{then left}} the youths to strike off {{a couple of hundred}} sheets, after which they were to wash the types and re-arrange the letters in the {{compartments}} in order, whilst he returned to the stall. The customers requiring his personal attention were generally late ones. When all this was accomplished, and the pot <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> in preparation for supper, the lads might use the short time that remained as they would, and Hansen himself showed Ambrose a shelf of books concealed by a blue curtain, whence he might read.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{sorry to}} say that your landlord's wery bad to-night, Sir,' said Roker, setting down the glass, and {{inspecting}} the lining of his hat preparatory to <b>putting</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
50|$|Production {{eventually}} restarted at {{the plant}} in early 2008 but almost immediately had to be <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold <b>again,</b> for the repair of an underwater lift that moves fuel for reprocessing.|$|R
60|$|This the Captain said, {{reference}} and all, in one breath, and with much solemnity; {{taking off his}} hat at 'yes verily,' and <b>putting</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> when he had quite concluded.|$|R
60|$|Nor {{was this}} all. The name seemed to run like {{wildfire}} {{through all the}} Buttevantians there assembled; and no sound seemed to reach our hero's name but that of Sir Herbert, Sir Herbert. Everybody took hold of him, and kissed his hand, and pulled his skirts, and stroked his face. His hat was knocked off, and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> amid thousands of blessings. It was nearly dark, {{and his eyes were}} dazed by the coach lanterns which were carried about, so that he could hardly see his friends; but the one sound which was dinned into his ears was that of Sir Herbert, Sir Herbert.|$|E
60|$|The {{clothes were}} wrung {{until the last}} drop was {{extracted}} from them and then <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> They were still damp and cold, but Malchus and his companion had been accustomed to be drenched to the skin, and thought nothing of this. They were still too exhausted, however, to walk briskly, and therefore lay down among some thick bushes until they should feel equal to setting out on the long tramp to rejoin their companions. After lying {{for a couple of}} hours Malchus rose to his feet, and issuing from the bushes looked round. He had resumed his armour and sword. As he stepped out a sudden shout arose, and he saw within a hundred yards of him a body of natives some hundred strong approaching. They had already caught sight of him.|$|E
60|$|A {{hundred and}} fifty went up on the board off a square leg hit for two, which {{completed}} Pringle's half-century, and then Marriott faced the slow bowler, who had been <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>again</b> after lunch. The first ball was a miss-hit. It went behind point for a couple. The next he got fairly hold of {{and drove to the}} boundary. The third was a very simple-looking ball. Its sole merit appeared to be {{the fact that it was}} straight. Also it was a trifle shorter than it looked. Marriott jumped out, and got too much under it. Up it soared, straight over the bowler's head. A trifle more weight behind the hit, and it would have cleared the ropes. As it was, the man in the deep-field never looked like missing it. The batsmen had time to cross over before the ball arrived, but they did it without enthusiasm. The run was not likely to count. Nor did it. Deep-field caught it like a bird. Marriott had made twenty-two.|$|E
60|$|Oscar Fischer <b>put</b> <b>on</b> {{his glasses}} <b>again.</b> He {{did not answer}} for several moments.|$|R
25|$|In 2007, a fire on Sutton's {{property}} in Parrottsville led to firefighters discovering 650 gallons of untaxed alcohol there, {{for which he}} was convicted and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> probation <b>again</b> by Cocke County authorities.|$|R
60|$|The Count {{took one}} of his hands out of his belt {{and laid it on}} Sir Percival's shoulder. Sir Percival shook it off irritably. The Count <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again</b> with unruffled composure.|$|R
