With the logistics and requirements of modern <b>production</b> (<b>programmes</b> are often printed beyond a club's locality for example), the product has long been of little help in accuracy of the 'field of play' although the advent of squad numbers has at least ensured the likelihood of all names being present.

50|$|One {{controversial}} {{feature of}} Beaverbrook's tenure {{was the fact}} that the aircraft programs set bore little comparison to actually expected aircraft production. Beaverbrook deliberately inserted an extra margin of 15% over and above the very best that British industry could be expected to produce. The theory of inserting the extra margin was to provide an out of reach target to British industry so that it would push as hard as possible to increase production. It was not until the 'realistic' programme of 1943 that aircraft <b>production</b> <b>programmes</b> were actually brought back into line with actual levels of production that could be expected from British factories.|$|E

50|$|Plant {{protection}} {{strategy and}} activities have significant {{importance in the}} overall crop <b>production</b> <b>programmes</b> for sustainable agriculture. Variation of Bt gene expression in different cultivars over time and efficacy to bollworms are the main concern nowadays, studies undertaken on Earias spp proved the concerned. Similarly the efficacy of Bt cotton {{in the field is}} losing efficacy against the pink bollworm, survey conducted revealed high infestations in green bolls. Monitoring of lepidopterous pest population viz sex pheromone and light traps was carried out and forecast the increasing trend in all bollworms population. Studies on red and dusky cotton bugs continued and efforts are made to find bio agents for long term solutions. Seed treatment effect and development of natural on early and normal planting studies revealed that the population of jassid was more on early sown field than normal sowing also the natural fauna was recorded higher in the early sown. The distinct efforts of researchers of the section have proved meaningful in devising pest management strategies against common and new emerging insect pests through application of IPM. Studies are continued on host plant tolerance of CCRI, Multan and National Coordinated Bt. & non-Bt. Strains. The section also studied effect of different IPM strategies on insect pest for transgenic cotton. Screening of new insecticides was also conducted against major insect pests of cotton.|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} cleaner {{production programme}} requires the efficient collection {{and interpretation of}} data relating to a facility 2 ̆ 7 s activities, including information of pollutant emissions, wastes generated and raw materials consumed. Many of these data are required to be collected and reported under national Pollutant Release and Transfers Registers (PRTRs) which are an increasingly common environmental policy tool in the OECD countries. This article considers the relationship between cleaner production and PRTR reporting, and discusses whether cleaner <b>production</b> <b>programmes</b> can be enhanced {{by the use of}} PRTR data. A case-study of a fertiliser manufacturing facility reporting under the Australian National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) is used to analyse and illustrate the practical issues around linking cleaner production with PRTR reporting. PRTR reporting can assist in identifying cleaner production opportunities and in generating the data sets required to design, implement and monitor cleaner <b>production</b> <b>programmes.</b> There are, however, some limitations in PRTR data that need to be recognised. Specifically, these are issues around data quality and comparability (e. g. PRTRs rely heavily on default emissions factors rather than the monitoring data that are generally required for cleaner <b>production</b> <b>programmes)</b> and the different data sets required for PRTR reporting (which generally require reporting at the site level rather than at the individual process unit level that is required for cleaner production) ...|$|E
