The guitar solo and guitar rhythm sections were recorded in one take, while a four-track tape machine amplified them on the recording. Sound engineer Shelly Yakus remembers <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> the separate vocals, guitar and rhythm section into a master track, with the overdubbing occurring in that order.|$|E
5|$|The film's musical score, {{written by}} cellist Fred Katz, was {{originally}} written for A Bucket of Blood. According to Mark Thomas McGee, author of Roger Corman: The Best of the Cheap Acts, each time Katz was {{called upon to}} write music for Corman, Katz sold the same score {{as if it were}} new music. The score was used in a total of seven films, including The Wasp Woman and Creature from the Haunted Sea. Katz explained that his music for the film was created by a music editor <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> selections from other soundtracks that he had produced for Corman.|$|E

5|$|The {{most natural}} and {{convenient}} {{way to express}} the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences: sequences of objects (in this case groups) and morphisms (in this case group homomorphisms) between them such {{that the image of}} one morphism equals the kernel of the next. In general, this does not allow (co)homology groups of a space to be completely computed. However, because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds, simplicial complexes, or CW complexes, which are constructed by <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> very simple patches, a theorem such as that of Mayer and Vietoris is potentially of broad and deep applicability.|$|E

25|$|There were {{difficulties}} matching {{bones to}} one another due to the high amount of commingling of remains. Also, many bones in the body mature at different stages and therefore one individual may show maturation of some bones while still developing others.

Also, the sex of individuals was not clear since the entire skeletons {{were not able to}} be articulated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piecing</b> <b>together</b> landscapes {{requires}} a sometimes difficult union between natural and social sciences, {{close attention to}} geographic and temporal scales, {{a knowledge of the}} range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings {{in a way that is}} useful to researchers in many fields. Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from geography, biology, ecology, history, sociology, anthropology, and other disciplines. Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, ethnographic interviews, and landscape reconstructions.|$|E

Underwood counter-proposes to Tusk that they work together to fulfill both their interests, which Tusk accepts.

25|$|Archaeologists are <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> {{evidence}} that the earliest human settlements in North America were thousands of years before {{the appearance of the}} current Paleo-Indian time frame (before the late glacial maximum 20,000 plus years ago). Evidence indicates that people were living as far east as northern Yukon, in the glacier-free zone called Beringia before 30,000BCE (32,000BP). Until recently, it was generally believed that the first Paleo-Indian people to arrive in North America belonged to the Clovis culture. This archaeological phase was named after the town of Clovis, New Mexico, where in 1936 unique Clovis points were found in situ at the site of Blackwater Draw, where they were directly associated with the bones of Pleistocene animals.|$|E
25|$|As the Methodists {{started having}} {{problems}} <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> the necessary property, other civic leaders including J.C.

According to this plan the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and Kansas City Art Institute would be built north of Brush Creek around the estate of The Kansas City Star publisher William Rockhill Nelson and a private nonsectarian University of Kansas City (initially proposed as a junior college) would be built south of the creek. In addition, a hospital would be constructed around the estate of Kansas City Journal-Post publisher Walter S. Dickey. The hospital was never built.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{libretto}} is original. The main {{plots of}} acts {{two and three}} are the librettists' invention, {{with only a few}} passing references to incidents and characters in Murger. Most of acts one and four follow the novel, <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> episodes from various chapters. The final scenes in acts one and four—the scenes with Rodolfo and Mimì—resemble both the play and the novel. The story of their meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the novel, in which the two lovers living in the garret are not Rodolphe and Mimì at all, but rather Jacques and Francine. The story of Mimì's death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the novel, one relating Francine's death and the other relating Mimì's.|$|E

25|$|Voltaire's {{father died}} when he was four months old. At ten months old, Voltaire emigrated to New Jersey with his mother and sister and his mother remarried. However, he states that he did not enjoy {{residing}} there, stating he was a victim of bullying because of his heritage and strange hobbies and interests. At the age of ten, Voltaire was inspired by the films of Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad), and began animating on a super 8 camera. By <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> snippets of information from fanzines, he eventually was able to teach himself how to make foam rubber animation models and animate them. At the age of 17, he moved to New York City and got his first job as an animator with Parker Brothers. Voltaire says that he loves New York, and that the only other place he would be happy living is Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|Woman with a Horse was {{conceived}} {{in such a}} way that the viewer is obliged to contemplate the manifold surface of the painting for an extended period of time, <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> the recognizable forms, not just in space, but in time; due to the temporal evolution resulting from the act of moving around the subject (during the painting process). Only then do the more obscure structures become legible with the topological context of the multi-dimension space of the whole. The radical new concept based on non-conventional precepts of space and time transformed the canvas from something quasi-static to something that possessed dynamic evolutionary characteristics. No longer governed by Euclidean geometry (or classical Renaissance perspective), Metzinger's Woman with a Horse is composed of a series of ellipses, curvilinear and rectilinear structures and planes juxtaposed and distributed throughout the canvas in complex myriad combinations of abstract volumetric forms that suggest rather than define the underlying subject.|$|E
25|$|An opening batsman, Hathurusingha {{was most}} often {{one of the}} opening batsmen {{alongside}} Roshan Mahanama. A useful pace-bowler, Hathurusingha was not called into the Test side until an injury to Mahanama stopped him from playing. Hathurusingha started his career by <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> a trio of half-centuries in his first three matches. After a long layoff from the side when other players took over in the opening batsman position, and the subsequent discovery of Sanath Jayasuriya in just that position, Hathurusingha began to play once again, but this time as a strong middle-order batsman and medium-pace bowler. This was not to prove overly effective, though, and when Hathurusingha was not called upon {{to play in the}} Cricket World Cup in 1999, this brought about an end to his international career. He played once again in the Premier Tournament and became Player of the Tournament three seasons running (2001–02, 2002–03, 2003–04). His Twenty-20 career began in 2005–06. He has not played international cricket since 1999.|$|E

25|$|A lengthy weather delay {{forced a}} few pairings to {{complete}} their first round on Friday morning. It was clear though on Thursday that Robert Karlsson and Jeev Milkha Singh would share the 18-hole lead after shooting matching 68s. Sergio García, still looking for his first major championship, headed up a group of five that shot one-under 69s. Phil Mickelson shot an even-par 70 to place him in an eight-way tie for eighth. Retief Goosen appeared to be <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> a fabulous opening round when he birdied four of his first seven holes to get to -4. His fortunes would change, however, as he shot six-over {{the rest of the}} way to drop four strokes off the lead after the first day. Like Goosen, 2008 Open Champion, Pádraig Harrington, got off to a flying start by birdieing his first three holes. Unfortunately for him, he shot four-over {{the rest of the way}} to finish his round with a 71. Kenny Perry was forced to withdraw due to the effects of an eye problem that began plaguing him earlier in the week.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} {{to work on the}} Pequot insider trading investigation, collecting and <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> evidence, gaining information through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. In April 2008, he obtained a court order forcing the SEC to give him key records of its then closed Pequot investigation and later that year, he uncovered the evidence necessary to prove an insider trading charge against Pequot, founder Arthur Samberg and his former employee, David Zilkha On January 2, 2009, Aguirre sent a 16-page letter with the evidence to Christopher Cox, then SEC chairman. In it, he argued that there was sufficient evidence to reopen the case and he recommended that the U.S. Department of Justice open an investigation of Pequot, Samberg and Zilkha for possible witness tampering, bribery, obstruction of justice, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Because the SEC {{continued to}} stonewall, on May 26, 2010, Aguirre sought an order directing the SEC to release additional Pequot records to him. He argued that because the SEC had failed to file charges against Pequot or anyone else, under the FOIA, the SEC must turn over the records. The following morning, on May 27, 2010, using allegations that closely follow Aguirre's January letter, the SEC filed charges against Pequot, Samberg and Zilkha.|$|E
