25|$|Late {{learners}} of L2 perform worse on grammaticality judgment tasks or tests than native speakers {{or early}} acquirers, in that L2 learners {{are more likely}} to accept a sentence that is ungrammatical as grammatical. After the critical <b>period,</b> <b>age</b> of acquisition is no longer supposed to have an effect, and native-like performance is no longer supposed to be achievable. However, {{the idea that there is}} a critical period for the acquisition of syntactic competence, which is reflected by the ability to assess the well-formedness of a sentence, is controversial. On one view, biological or language-specific mechanisms become non-functional after a certain age. On another view, decreased L2 learning ability with age is not inevitable, and can be explained by factors such as motivation, learning environment, pressure, and time commitment. Although there is evidence that supports the claim that speakers outside the L2 mastery age range are not capable of acquiring native-like mastery of a language, there is also evidence supporting the opposite, as well as evidence for young learners not mastering an L2.|$|E
500|$|The {{games in}} the series focus on {{historical}} events throughout time. Age of Empires covers the events between the Stone Age and the Classical period, in Europe and Asia. Its expansion, , follows the formation and rise of the Roman Empire. [...] and its [...] follow Europe and Asia through the Middle Ages. The Age of Kings expansion pack, , is set during the same period, but also includes scenarios about the Spanish conquest of Mexico, El Cid, and Attila the Hun. Age of Empires III and its first expansion, , take place during the European colonization of the Americas.

The series' spin-off, Age of Mythology, and its expansion pack, , are set during the Bronze Age, but focus on mythology as their themes, rather than history.|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} that genetic influences have on personality characteristics can change across a five-year <b>period.</b> <b>Age</b> differences create more variables even within a family, {{so the best}} comparisons are found using twins. Twins typically share a family environment called a shared environment because they may share other aspects like teachers, school, and friends. A non-shared environment means completely different environment for both subjects. [...] "Biologically related children who are separated after birth and raised in different families live in non-shared environments." [...] Identical twins separated at birth and raised in different families constitute the best cases for heredity and personality because similarities between the two are due only to genetic influences. Vulnerability {{was a factor in}} this study that was taken into consideration regarding the issue of genetic influences on vulnerability. The study concluded that the monozygotic co-twins would be more similar than dizygotic co-twins in change over time. The data concluded that {{there were no significant differences}} for either variances between the monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins.|$|E
