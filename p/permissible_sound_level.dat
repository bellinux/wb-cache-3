40|$|Abstract. In this study, the {{investigations}} of the acoustic environments in the waiting areas in hospitals were conducted. The investigations were aimed on clarifying the actual conditions in two waiting areas in two hospitals in Kuala Lumpur. The investigations consist of both noise level measurements and questionnaire surveys, i. e. both physical and psychological aspects. Generally, physical aspects for both hospitals are strongly influenced by noise produced during general activities in waiting areas. Sound pressures data were collected approximately eight hours period in daytime and converted into different levels (LAeq and Leq, max). It {{was found that the}} maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> LAeq in all waiting areas measured exceeded the guideline for community noise recommended by World Health Organization (WHO). In psychological aspects, respondents were interviewed {{in the course of a}} questionnaires survey dealing with nuisance occasioned by noise at actual conditions.

Since 1984 several studies [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] showed that the test method, that had been in force with amendments since 1970, did no longer reflect the real life driving behaviour in urban traffic. In particular the contribution of tyre rolling noise to the total noise emission was underestimated in the test method. This fact was stated in official documents (e. g. the Green paper concerning the Future Noise Policy – 1996 [39]) {{and the development of a}} revised test method started in ISO TC 43 WG 42 “Measurement of noise emission (external) from {{road vehicles}}”. This resulted in 2007 in a new version of the standard ISO 362 [4]. The UN-ECE GRB (Groupe Rapporteur Bruit = Working Party on Noise) has published a new test method in 2007 based on the revised ISO standard with the purpose to monitor the application of this new method in parallel with the existing test method and to evaluate the qualities of the new method. During a period of three years the new method has been used for monitoring purposes. The monitoring period under UN-ECE Regulation No 51 lasted from 1 July 2007 until 1 July 2009, while the monitoring period under Directive 2007 / 34 /EC [3] started on 6 July 2008 and expired on 6 July 2010. During the monitoring periods the results of the current and of the new test method were submitted to the European Commission. By this procedure a database of parallel test results has been collected that offers a good opportunity to investigate the qualities of the new method and to quantify the differences between the results of the two methods. At the request of the European Commission, DG Enterprise and Industry, Unit Automotive Industry, TNO has executed a study into the differences between the current type approval test method A and the proposed new test method B. The goal of the study was to “assess the available noise data in relation to the draft new test protocol and to provide possible new limit values for each category of vehicles, as well as for the derogations currently granted for certain types of vehicles. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about {{monitoring}} {{the noise level}} at UMK Campuses. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine whether the noise level at UMK Campuses follow the standard noise level that been provided in guidelines by Department of Environment Malaysia. Noise pollution is an unwanted sound that could give negative effects to human behaviors especially in sensitive area such as educational area. Universiti Malaysia Kelantan has three campuses which are in Pengkalan Chepa, Bachok and Jeli. Each campus has one site selected for noise level monitoring. These selected sites were selected due to hotspot area. The noise level was determined by calculating the average of the A- weighing, dB(A) which was obtained from the data sampling. The data were recorded for day and night to obtain the continuous of instantaneous sound pressure level. The equipment that been used in this study is TM- 102 Sound Level Meter Auto Ranging for measure the noise level for each campus. The average of noise level recorded for each campus were compared with maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>sound</b> <b>Level</b> for development by the Department of Environment. Since Pengk:alan Chepa, Jeli and Bachok are categorized as urban areas, the average of noise level recorded were compared with level 60 dB for day time and 50 dB for night time. The higher noise level recorded for each campus during the first week of November during day time was 61. 22 dB at UMK Jeli, 65. 96 dB at UMK Pengkalan Chepa and 56. 62 dB at UMK Bachok. While at night time, the highest level of noise level recorded was 53. 04 dB at UMK Jeli, 64. 86 dB at UMK Pengk:alan Chepa and 53. 68 dB at UMK Bachok. The higher noise level recorded for each campus during the second week of November during day time was 55. 18 dB at UMK Jeli, 61. 02 dB at UMK Pengk:alan Chepa and 55. 52 dB at UMK Bachok. While at night time, the highest level of noise level recorded was 52. 68 dB at UMK Jeli, 51. 68 dB at UMK Pengk:alanChepa and 50. 16 dB at UMK Bachok. The higher noise level recorded for each campus during the third week of November during day time was 59. 98 dB at UMK Jeli, 67. 48 dB at UMK Pengk:alan Chepa and 55. 18 dB at UMK Bachok.

5000|$|... {{there are}} three levels of {{regulation}} for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad subjective immission control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an objective immission control that uses specific <b>levels</b> of <b>sound</b> {{considered to be a}} noise disturbance. Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum <b>Permissible</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>Levels</b> below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation. The concept that a potential violator should have fair warning that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address specific noise problems.

40|$|Cities in {{developing}} countries like Ghana experience severe environmental noise pollution resulting predominantly from a blend of exponential increase in road traffic volume, industrial, commercial and residential activities {{that are associated with}} thick population trends. High levels of noise pollution can have detrimental effects on human beings. Buildings that house noise sensitive activities such as recording studios in city centres need to be designed to provide protection from high ambient noise levels that may interfere with speech communication. Cities and towns in Ghana have about one hundred and eighty Frequency Modulation (FM) stations that are invariably sited in the Central Business Districts (CBD) that happen to be in very noisy environments. The study investigated prevailing <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> in the recording studio and associated spaces in an FM Station in Kumasi, the second largest city in Ghana.

There were three experiments conducted: a soundwalk in situ in Manchester (United Kingdom) city centre, listening tests in Salford (United Kingdom), and listening tests in Bandung (Indonesia). The listening tests used material recorded from four locations on the soundwalk route in Manchester.
