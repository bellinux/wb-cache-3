The {{effects of these}} two prob-lems are considered in this paper. The investigation of the CC in a two-branch orthogonal <b>polarization</b> <b>antenna</b> diversity system is ex-tended {{to the case of}} a general multibranch <b>polarization</b> <b>antenna</b> diversity system, and the CC is investigated together with APC by applying a network theory framework. Their effects on both the correlation and the mean power ratio among received signals are obtained. It is found that the effects of both kinds of couplings {{as well as that of}} the combining signal processing on the received sig-nals can be considered as a series of weightings. Two equivalent relations among APC, CC, and ADA are developed. Such equiva-lences reveal insights into CC from the point of view of antennas and provide additional degree-of-freedom for system optimization to improve the diversity performance. Furthermore, two kinds of compensation techniques are also developed to mitigate the APC and CC, as well as to enhance the diversity performance.

30|$|The plate antennas {{are popular}} and have many {{applications}} [27, 34, 38]; on-chip antennas are preferred for small and compact applications. Recently, many publications addressed wide-band and multi-band antennas. It {{has been proven}} that narrow-band antennas offer high energy conversion efficiencies but can only retrieve {{a limited amount of}} energy. On the other hand, wide-band or multi-band frequency antennas can retrieve more RF energy in space. However, the tradeoffs are low overall efficiency and large aperture. In [32], antennas with a resonance frequency of 4.9 and 5.9  GHz were designed with PCEs of 65.2 and 64.8 %, respectively. Further work by Lu et al. [26] on <b>polarization</b> <b>antennas</b> supports the assertion that expanding the bandwidth of an antenna leads to increasing the amount of power harvested. In this work, the demonstration of broadband <b>polarization</b> <b>antennas</b> with three separate modes allows the antenna to operate in a wider range of frequencies. One common mechanism in the aforementioned works is the control of the antenna configuration by switching the diodes on and off, thus altering its resonant frequencies. However, since it uses separate modes for different frequencies, this antenna is not able to simultaneously resonate at two frequencies. On the other hand, the antenna presented in [39] is capable of operating at 2.45 and 5.8  GHz, simultaneously, providing 2.6  V output with a PCE of 65 % and power density of 10  mW/cm 2.|$|R
