40|$|The guapuruvu is <b>pioneer</b> <b>specie</b> by {{fast growing}} of legume family with great {{importance}} in restoration projects. The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the genetic variability of offspring of Schizolobium parahyba through quantitative genetic parameters. The progeny test was installed in a randomized block design in three replications four plants per plot with 60 progenies. Was evaluated plant height, diameter at breast height with the ages: 2, 7, 14, 20 and 66 months and the percentage of survival at 66 months. For the estimates of genetic parameters, the data were analyzed by software SELEGEN. The heritability coefficients at individual level (ĥa 2) were higher by height (0. 318, 0. 012, 0. 247, 0. 390 and 0. 012) compared to DBH (0. 021, 0. 024 and 0. 015) in the 14, 20 and 66 months, respectively. The highest genetic correlation between characters and plant height DBH occurred in the period of 14 months (0. 85). The progenies studied, despite not show significant genetic variability, have the potential to initiate programs of forest breeding and for conservation genetics...|$|E
40|$|Black wattles {{can grow}} on several {{environmental}} conditions being a fast growing and short life <b>pioneer</b> <b>specie.</b> This work was established on Acacia mearnsii De Wild commercial plantations, belonging to TANAGRO Co., in Piratini, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, growing on different soil types, with plants {{from the same}} origin. In each of the five-soil type, a treatment to evaluate black wattle growth in DBH and height, and above ground biomass was considered. Soils had their surface horizons characterized morphological, chemical and physically, and nutritional status were measured in every plant compartment, tannin yield in plant bark, amount of lignin and total extractives were determined in commercial stem wood. Neossolo Litólico eutrófico (Entisol) showed the greatest commercial stem volumes and Neossolo Litólico álico (Entisol) was the least productive, especially due to soil fertility differences, mainly P level, base saturation and aluminum saturation. The amount of macronutrients returned, keeping harvesting residues (branches and crown) on soil surface, was greater than the amount exported in commercial stem and bark, attesting its efficiency on soil reclaiming, if the residues are not burned. In most productive soils in volume of commercial stems, the amount of calcium and magnesium exported was greater than the amount returned to soil. The amount of tannin in black wattle bark was greater in plants growing in adverse soil conditions (shallow and stony soils) ...|$|E
40|$|Hymenaea {{courbaril}} L. var. stilbocarpa (Hayne) Lee et Lang. é uma espécie clímax tolerante a sombra, ao passo que Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong. é uma espécie pioneira. O desenvolvimento destas espécies pode refletir a habilidade de adaptação aos diferentes fatores ambientais (luz, água e temperatura) {{no local}} em que estão crescendo. O suprimento inadequado de um desses fatores pode reduzir o vigor da planta e limitar seu desenvolvimento. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar os efeitos do nível de sombreamento no crescimento e a concentração de pigmentos fotossintéticos em duas espécies de leguminosas arbóreas, Hymenaea courbaril L. var. stilbocarpa (Hayne) Lee et Lang. e Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong. O experimento foi conduzido no Setor de Olericultura do Centro Universitário Luterano de Ji-Paraná (CEULJI/ULBRA) /Rondônia. Durante a formação das mudas, ambas as espécies foram expostas a quatro tratamentos de sombra: 0 % (controle - sol pleno); 30 %; 50 % e 80 %. Cada tratamento foi constituído com três repetições de cada espécie; o delineamento experimental foi inteiramente casualisado. Quatro meses após a semeadura, as seguintes análises foram realizadas: número de folhas, altura da planta, comprimento do sistema radicular, massa seca total e concentração de pigmentos fotossintéticos. O tratamento sob sol pleno afetou negativamente o crescimento de ambas as espécies. As mudas crescidas sob 50 % e 80 % apresentaram melhor desenvolvimento. Conforme o aumento do sombreamento houve um decréscimo na razão clorofila a/b e um aumento nas concentrações de clorofila total e carotenóides totais. Hymenaea courbaril L. var. stilbocarpa (Hayne) Lee et Lang. is a clímax shadow tolerant specie and Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong., {{by the other}} hand, is considered as a <b>pioneer</b> <b>specie.</b> The development of these species may reflect its adaptation ability to different environmental elements (light, water and temperature) at its growth site. An inadequate supply {{of some of these}} elements may reduce plant vigor and limit its development. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of shade intensity on the growth and photosynthetic pigment concentration of two arboreal legumes that are typical to northern Brazil, namely, the Hymenaea courbaril L. var. stilbocarpa (Hayne) Lee et Lang. and the Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong. The experiment was carried out at the Centro Universitário Luterano de Ji-Paraná (CEULJ/ULBRA) /Rondônia. During the formation of the seedlings, both species were exposed to four treatments of shade: 0 % (control - without shade); 30 %; 50 % e 80 %. Each treatment was carried out with three replications for each species; the experimental design was completely randomized. Four month after sowing, the following analyses were carried out: number of leaves, plant height, roots length, dry mass and photosynthetic pigment concentration. The treatment under 0 % shade impaired the seedling growth of both species. The most favorable treatments were 50 % and 80 % shade. According to the shade intensity, the chlorophyll a/b ratio decreased and the chlorophyll and carotenoids increased...|$|E
