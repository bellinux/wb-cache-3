40|$|Introduction. The study {{aimed at}} in vivo {{assessment}} {{of the impact of}} administered red blood cells (RBCs) concentrates on the plasma levels of K+, lactate, pH, Na+, Ca++ and glucose, depending on the volume and age of administered products. Biochemical changes occurring during the storage of these products were studied in vitro simultaneously. Materials and methods. Arterial blood samples were collected in vivo from patients before and after RBCs transfusion and plasma levels of biochemical parameters were determined. A group of 80 RBCs samples was analyzed simultaneously, with the samples being equally distributed throughout the recommended storage time of 1 – 35 days. Results. The age of RBCs concentrate results in increased <b>potassium</b> and <b>lactate</b> levels and decreased pH, sodium and glucose levels in the RBCs samples. The concentrations were in the following ranges: potassium 4. 0 – 40. 5 mmol/L; lactate 4. 1 – 28. 0 mmol/L; pH 7. 0 – 6. 65; sodium 137 – 116 mmol/L; glucose 29. 0 – 14. 0 mmol/L. A prospectively selected group of 46 patients were administered a total of 354 RBCs units. The mean age of RBCs concentrates was 16. 18 days. The number of administered RBCs units ranged from 2 to 38, a mean of 7. 7 RBCs units/patient. The administration of 1 RBCs unit was associated with a mean in vivo increase of the potassium level by 0. 07 mmol/L and lactate level by 0. 13 mmol/L. Conclusion. The administration of larger amounts of RBCs concentrates may lead to an increase in the patient’s plasma levels of <b>potassium</b> and <b>lactate.</b> This increase is proportional to the age and volume of RBCs...|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in name, sodium lactate is not chemically similar to lactose (milk sugar) and therefore {{need not be}} restricted by those with lactose intolerance. In general, lactates such as sodium, calcium, and <b>potassium</b> <b>lactate</b> are salts derived from the neutralization of lactic acid and most commercially used lactic acids are fermented from dairy-free products such as cornstarch, potatoes, or molasses.

Whey is made of up 6.5% solids of which 4.8% is solid lactose. Waste whey is infrequently used to produce lactic acid when the whey itself is produced as waste during the manufacture of certain dairy products. Such dairy-type lactic acid generally goes back into dairy products, such as ice cream and cream cheese, rather than into non-dairy products. Moreover, although the lactic-acid starter culture to ferment corn or beets may contain milk, sodium lactate does not contain milk protein and need not be restricted by someone avoiding milk or those with a milk allergy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPediatric {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass {{involves the}} creation of a large obligatory priming reservoir. Packed red blood cells are {{an essential part of the}} cardiopulmonary bypass priming solution in children. The storage media in packed red blood cells might cause significant acid-base, glucose, and electrolyte imbalances, which have been associated with severe complications. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of fresh (≤ 5 days) versus old (> 5 days) stored packed red blood cells added to the priming solutions of pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. MethodsBlood samples were drawn from cardiopulmonary bypass priming of 30 consecutive pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Fresh (≤ 5 days old) stored packed red blood cells were added to the priming solution in group 1, and old (> 5 days old) stored packed red blood cells were added to the priming solution in group 2. In each group blood samples were drawn from the packed red blood cells on arrival to the operating room and from the priming solution immediately after packed red blood cells were added and after 20 minutes of prime circulation. Samples were also collected at the beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass and after 30 minutes. The last sample was collected on arrival to the pediatric intensive care unit. The levels of <b>potassium,</b> glucose, and <b>lactate</b> and the acid-base balance were analyzed in each sample. ResultsThere was a linear increase in potassium levels in packed red blood cell samples with increasing packed red blood cell age, ranging from 5. 4 to 18. 4 mEq/L. Significant differences in the concentrations of <b>potassium,</b> glucose, and <b>lactate</b> and the acid-base balance were found when comparing old and fresh packed red blood cells in samples taken during the packed red blood cell and early prime time. Those differences resolved after 20 minutes of reconstitution of the priming solution. The age of the packed red blood cells had no effect on the samples taken during bypass and those taken in the pediatric intensive care unit. ConclusionThe significantly higher concentration of <b>potassium</b> and <b>lactate</b> and lower pH in old stored packed red blood cells has a minimal effect on the final constitution of priming solution before and during cardiopulmonary bypass in children undergoing corrective cardiac surgery...|$|R

In Frankfurter sausage with 0. 1 % sodium diacetate L. sake was not inhibited, but the development of L. monocytogenes was retarded. The increase of L. monocytogenes also slowed down when L. sake numbers reached 108 cfug- 1, probably as a result of lactic acid and/or bacteriocins production in those products.

Six males performed high intensity exercise after 48 h of controlled, high CHO (80 %) and low CHO (10 %) diets. Time to exhaustion was lower in the low compared to high CHO diet. The rate of increase in RPE was greater and the VO(2) slow component was lower in the low CHO diet than in the control. There was no significant condition effect for cortisol, insulin, pH, plasma glucose, <b>potassium,</b> or <b>lactate</b> concentrations. Multiple linear regression indicated that the total amplitude of VO(2) and perceived muscle strain accounted for the greatest variance in the rate of increase in RPE.

The levels of <b>Potassium</b> (P) and <b>lactate</b> dehydrogenate activity(LDH) were measured in plasma for determination of hemolysis. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) were studied in plasma for determination of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system, respectively. The measurement were performed at the day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33 and 35 of the storage. The levels of malondialdehyde and <b>Potassium</b> and <b>lactate</b> dehydrogenate activity increased (p< 0. 05) depending on storage time whereas Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) and Red Blood Cells decreased (p< 0. 05). The alterations of MDA, TAS, P, LDH and RBC in the measurement days were as follows: MDA, P and LDH significantly increased at the day 9, 5 and 5 whereas TAS and RBC decreased at the day 13 and 29, respectively. These results suggest that increased level of MDA and decreased level of TAS in the stored blood can not improve the vialibilty and longevity of RBC by increasing cell damage caused by free radicals at the day mentioned above. To improve the quality of stored blood is to supplement blood donors with antioxidants and vitamins at least one week before blood collection to keep and store the stored blood for longer time until using for transfusion. We conclude that increased level of MDA and decreased TAS in stored blood which can cause the beginning of hemolysis. It is therefore necessary to control these factors before blood transfusion...|$|R
30|$|All {{data are}} shown as median and {{interquartile}} range (IQR). The hemodynamics; plasma concentrations of creatinine, <b>lactate,</b> <b>potassium,</b> and cytokines; and blood gas variables were all analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test {{at a fixed}} time point (3 h after declamping), as notable time-dependent changes in these parameters were found in repeated measures ANOVA for all three groups. The Kruskal-Wallis {{test was used to}} compare the wet/dry ratio, cytokine mRNA expression, and TNF-α, IL- 6, and NF-κB scoring among the four groups. If the result from the Kruskal-Wallis test was significant, then the Mann-Whitney U test was similarly applied to analyze each pairing of groups. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R
