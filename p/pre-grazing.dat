40|$|A grazing {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} effect of maintaining three levels of <b>pre-grazing</b> herbage mass (HM) on dairy cow performance, grass dry matter (DM) production and output from perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) pastures. Cows were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three <b>pre-grazing</b> HM treatments: 1150 - Low HM (L), 1400 - Medium HM (M) or 2000 kg DM/ha - High HM (H). Herbage accumulation under grazing was lowest (P< 0. 01) on the L treatment and cows grazing the L pastures required more grass silage supplementation during the grazing season (+ 73 kg DM/cow) to overcome pasture deficits due to lower pasture growth rates (P< 0. 05). Treatment did not affect daily milk production or pasture intake, although cows grazing the L pastures had to graze a greater daily area (P< 0. 01) and increase grazing time (P< 0. 05) to compensate for a lower <b>pre-grazing</b> HM (P< 0. 01). The results indicate that, while <b>pre-grazing</b> HM did not influence daily milk yield per cow, adapting the practise of grazing low HM (1150 kg DM/ha) pasture reduces pasture DM production and at a system level may increase the requirement for imported feed...|$|E

Little is known about its use under grazing. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate regrowth process of forage peanut using an experimental protocol analogous to tropical forage grasses under rotational grazing. Treatments corresponded to two pre- (95 % and maximum canopy light interception – LI 95 % and LIMax) and two post-grazing (post-grazing heights of 40 and 60 % of <b>pre-grazing</b> height) conditions, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in a randomized complete block design (n = 4). Targets of LI <b>pre-grazing</b> affected  <b>pre-grazing</b> height and LI post-grazing. The residual sward LAI did not vary, resulting in similar grazing interval. Greater rates and total herbage accumulation were recorded for LIMax target, consequence of the greater accumulation of stolons at the lower strata of the swards. Greater percentage of leaflets was recorded for the LI 95 % target. Given the stoloniferous growth habit of forage peanut, stolon accumulation in the lower strata of the sward do not represent a limitation to leaf accumulation and morphological composition.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate tiller population density and {{the dynamics of the}} tillering process in marandu palisade grass subjected to strategies of rotational stocking management and nitrogen fertilization. Treatments corresponded to combinations between two targets of <b>pre-grazing</b> conditions (sward surface height of 25 and 35 cm) and two rates of nitrogen application (50 and 200 kg ha - 1 year - 1), and were allocated to experimental units according to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in a randomised complete block design, with four replications. The following response variables were studied: initial (TPDi), intermediate (TPDm) and final (TPDf) tiller population density as well as the rates of tiller appearance (TAR) and death (TDR) and the tiller population stability index (SI). TPDi was similar to all treatments, with differences in tiller population density becoming more pronounced as the experiment progressed, resulting in larger TPDf on swards managed at 25 cm <b>pre-grazing</b> height. Tiller death was larger on swards managed at 35 cm, with differences in tiller appearance being recorded only from February 2010 onwards. Stability of tiller population was higher on swards managed at 25 cm <b>pre-grazing</b> height. Overall, there was no effect of nitrogen on the studied variables, and the most adequate grazing strategy corresponded to the <b>pre-grazing</b> height of 25 cm, regardless of the nitrogen application rate used. </p...|$|E

Twenty 1 ha paddocks replicated over two blocks {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four treatments: Control (CON) at the recommended stocking rate (1. 68 AUM/ha in 2009 and 1. 64 AUM/ha in 2010), and three double stocked treatments supplemented with 60 % straw and 40 % WDGS (STRAW), 60 % hay and 40 % WDGS (LOW), and 70 % hay and 30 % WDGS (HIGH). Forty yearling steers were stratified by BW and assigned randomly to treatment paddocks, giving a total of five steers per treatment. Five paddocks on each block were rotationally grazed for each treatment once during the experimental period. Post-grazing standing crop was determined by clipping five 0. 25 m 2 quadrats from each paddock at the end of the grazing period. <b>Pre-graze</b> forage allowance was calculated by adding an estimated amount of forage intake to the amount of forage remaining in the paddocks at the end of the grazing period. Forage intake was estimated by the difference between <b>pre-graze</b> and post-grazing forage availability. During the first year of the study, there was no difference in ADG between CON and HIGH; steers supplemented with 60 : 40 blends of straw or hay with WDGS presented higher ADG than the other two treatments. During the second year, steers in the STRAW treatment achieved significantly lower ADG than steers in the other treatments. Forage intake was significantly higher for the CON steers and intake of range forage was reduced by 18 % to 22 % when the animals were supplemented with the mixes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} whether the defoliation frequency based on a fixed rest period would generate variable sward structural and physiological conditions at each subsequent grazing event. The relative importance of the physiological age was established in comparison with the chronological age in the determination of the forage nutritive value of Xaraes palisadegrass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst ex A. RICH.) STAPF. cv. Xaraes]. Two grazing frequencies were defined by light interception (LI) at initiation of grazing (95 % LI - ""target grazing"" [TG] or 100 % LI - ""delayed grazing"" [DG]) and one based on chronological time, grazing every 28 days (28 -d). Forage produced under the TG schedule was mostly leaves (93 %) with a higher concentration of crude protein (CP; 138 g/kg in the whole forage), a lower concentrations of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) in the stems (740 g/kg), and higher in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of the leaves (690 g/kg), compared to the other treatments. Lower grazing frequency strategies (DG and 28 -d) resulted in forage with higher proportions of stems (10 and 9 %, respectively). Strategies based on light interception did not produce <b>pre-graze</b> forage with a uniform nutritive value, as the indicators varied across grazing cycles.

In this study {{the first five}} years (1995 - 1999) of a long-term trial in <b>pre-grazing</b> distribution of herbage mass in bahiagrass pasture, utilised under the same repeated grazing management are shown. Herbage mass was non-destructively estimated with an electronic capacitance probe at 182, 50 by 50 cm locations along 2 permanent line transects. The changes in <b>pre-grazing</b> horizontal distribution of herbage mass during five grazing seasons were measured always on the same position on two transects just before the beginning of each grazing period (27 occasions). The <b>pre-grazing</b> herbage mass shows spatially heterogeneous distribution, as it was indicated by the coefficient of variation in the range from 0. 221 (August 1998) to 1. 107 (September 1995) for all measurement dates.

40|$|ABSTRACT:Italian {{ryegrass}} (Lolium multiflorum Lam) {{is one of}} {{the most}} cultivated temperate annual forage crop around the world. Despite that, there is little information about the process of stem elongation during its vegetative growth. This information would be useful for grazing management purposes. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the herbage accumulation and stem elongation rates in annual ryegrass pastures submitted to intermittent stocking. The experimental design used was a completely randomized 2 x 2 factorial with three replications. The treatments were defined by the combination of two <b>pre-grazing</b> heights (15 and 25 cm) associated with two post-grazing heights (4 and 8 cm). The herbage accumulation rates were higher in pastures with 25 cm <b>pre-grazing</b> associated with post-grazing heights of 8 cm. However, leaf production rate was only affected by post-grazing height, with higher values being recorded for stubbles heights of 8 cm, regardless of <b>pre-grazing</b> height. Stem elongation rates in annual ryegrass tillers increased rapidly when pastures reached around 18 cm, a condition where there was a relatively low competition for light, suggesting that; 1) <b>pre-grazing</b> heights of 18 to 20 cm in annual ryegrass could be used as a upper limit for grazing management purposes whether the objective is to minimize stem contribution in accumulated herbage and 2) It seems that stem elongation is as inevitable process (independently of competition for light) and that this could be related to the necessary strength of stems, pseudostems and sheaths to support larger and heavier leaves...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{milk and}} meat from animals with a pasture-based diet have higher {{proportions}} of CLA and C 18 : 3 and lower omega- 6 :omega- 3 ratios than products from animals with diets based on corn silage and concentrate. However, {{most of the}} published studies have evaluated fatty acid profiles in temperate climate grasses and the literature with tropical grasses is scarce. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the morphological and fatty acid compositions in the vertical strata of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) swards subjected to grazing heights (90 or 120 cm <b>pre-grazing</b> heights) and levels of defoliation (50 % or 70 % removal of the initial <b>pre-grazing</b> height). There were no interactions among <b>pre-grazing</b> height, the level of defoliation and grazing stratum. However, higher proportion of C 18 : 3 (58 % and 63 %) was found in the 90 -cm swards and in the half upper stratum. A higher proportion of C 18 : 3 was associated with a higher leaf proportion and crude protein content. Thus, the upper stratum of sward or a grazing management scheme (e. g. first-last stocking) resulting in a higher proportion of leaves and crude protein both provide higher proportions of C 18 : 3 to animals grazing in elephant grass swards...|$|E

Monaro and Alpine), {{zigzag clover}} (Trifolium medium; seed lines, Kentucky and Porters Pass) and white clover (Trifolium repens), were {{evaluated}} in a sheep grazing trial on a lowland medium fertility soil (Templeton silt loam) at Lincoln University, Canterbury. Each rhizomatous clover cultivar / seed line was sown (March, 1989) in plots with four rows 0. 75 m apart, 80 m long. There were three replicates of these plots (1. 5 m apart), each replicate arranged as randomised blocks. The site was oversown with Marsden high endophyte ryegrass (Lalium perenne) {{in the spring}} of 1992. Volunteer white clover Huia was present throughout the trial site. The 80 * 3 m plots were split into eight grazing plots 10 * 56 m rows in August 1993 by fencing, at right angles across the original plots. This resulted in 12 clover subplots in each main grazing plot. The eight main plots were divided into two replicates of four grazing treatments: two levels of grazing intensity (Lax (L) and Hard (H)) and two levels of grazing frequency (Set stocked (S) and Rotational grazing (R)). The four grazing treatments were first applied in September 1993, and then continued in early-February 1995 after having not been grazed since late December 1994. Set stocked lax pastures were grazed for 2. 5 days after an interval between grazing of 4. 5 days to maintain a pasture mass of about 1700 kg DM/ha. Hard set stocked pastures were maintained at between 600 to 800 kg DM/ha by grazing every 4. 5 days with a 2. 5 day interval between grazing. Hard rotational grazed treatments aimed to have a <b>pre-graze</b> herbage mass of between 1500 to 2000 kg DM/ha 25 days after grazing and a post herbage mass of 600 to 800 kg DM/ha after 5 days grazing. Lax rotational grazed paddocks were spelled for 25 days to achieve a <b>pre-grazed</b> herbage mass of 2000 to 3000 kg DM/ha then grazed for 3 to 4 days to a post-herbage mass of 1500 to 2000 kg DM/ha. Botanical analysis, clover morphology and grass characteristics were measured in all grazing treatments prior to grazing of the rotational grazed pastures in April, May, June and in early October after plots were grazed approximately every six weeks to a herbage mass of about 800 kg DM/ha. The intensity of the hard set stocking treatment was indicated by reduced ryegrass tiller populations, tiller weight and length by 50 % compared to the lax set stocked treatment. Infrequent grazing favoured ryegrass growth and tillering. The hexaploid Monaro Caucasian was the superior clover in the lax rotational grazed treatment covering 14. 3 to 29. 3 % of the subplots. Swards dominated by Monaro reduced other sward components. Hard set stocking of pasture reduced the percentage cover of all rhizomatous clover species; only white clover (8. 4 to 18 % cover) and weeds (16 to 24 % cover) increased under the extreme grazing pressure. Hexaploid Monaro Caucasian cover was superior to the diploid Caucasian cv. Alpine in cover and all growth characteristics. Hard rotational grazing treatments increased the number of clover growing points more than the other treatments for Caucasian and white clover species. Clovers in lax grazing treatments had longer petioles, but petiole growth potential may have been reduced by declining soil and air temperatures. Zigzgag clover generally had a very low cover and growing point populations, but lax infrequent grazing favoured zigzag most. An assessment of underground biomass in early August 1995, showed that the root weight of Monaro Caucasian (202 g DM/m³) far exceeded that of white clover (9 g DM/ m³). Rotationally grazed treatments had significantly (P< 0. 007) more Monaro underground biomass (330 g DM) than set stocked treatments (78 gDM/m³). This may reflect the preferential grazing of clover in reference to the high endophyte ryegrass. A supplementary study conducted on old seed plots beside the main trial site, was grazed to a herbage mass of 450 kg DM/ha on the 5 th of May and used to evaluate the regrowth of clover over 50 days. Monaro Caucasian clover and white clover produced far more growing points than any other of the clovers measured (5280 and 4790 growing points/m² respectively). Petiole length of all clovers increased during the 50 day period, particularly Monaro Caucasian and stoloniferous white clover (up to 73 mm). Growth of all but white clover slowed from 24 to 50 days indicating that the other rhizomatous species were becoming dormant due to low temperatures (Mean air temperature in May 9. 7 °C and June 6. 2 °C). Results from the experiment confirm the choice of hexaploid Caucasian clover for commercial pastoral development. Zigzag clovers were very low producing and uncompetitive with ryegrass under the range of treatments used. Alpine Caucasian (2 n) was less productive than Monaro (6 n). The reduced underground biomass of set stocked Monaro suggests that the rhizomatous habit may not be the ultimate response to continuous hard grazing and that some autumn spelling and or rotational grazing may be necessary to maintain root and rhizome reserves...|$|R

The main objective {{of the study was to}} compare a semiintensive Grange (standard) : system of suckler beef production with a more extensive REPS (Rural Environment Protection Scheme) compatible system. In the standard system the stocking rate was 0. 80 ha per cow unit (cow plus heifer and steer progeny to slaughter at 20 and 23 / 24 months of age, respectively, plus replacements or its equivalent), a nitrogenous fertiliser application rate of 210 kg per ha and two silage harvests each year amounting to the equivalent of 87 % of the total area harvested. The REPS system involved a 25 % lower stocking rate, an annual nitrogen fertiliser application rate of 90 to 100 kg per ha and one silage harvest (portion in late May to provide good silage for the progeny and the remainder in June to provide lower quality silage for cows) amounting to 58 % of the total area harvested. Between 1997 and 2000 the cow herd were Limousin x Friesians (LF) and Simmental x (Limousin x Friesians) (SLF). A herd of first calvers were introduced in 2001 and 2002 which in addition to LF and SLF included Limousin x (Limousin x Friesians), purebred Limousin and purebred Charolais. Charolais (or Simmental) sires were used on mature cows. Replacement heifers were bred to calve at 2 years of age using an easy calving Limousin bull. Concentrate inputs per animal were the same in the two systems. The main findings of the study were: • The mean nitrogenous application rates were 210 and 98 kg per ha in the standard and REPS systems, respectively. • Mean dry matter digestibility of the first-cut silages harvested early (May 19 to May 29), late (June 5 to June 13) and the second cut silage in the standard system (harvested in July/early August) were 716, 690 and 674 g/kg, respectively. • When averaged throughout two grazing seasons there was no difference between the standard and REPS systems in pregrazing or post-grazing sward heights. When examined over one grazing season the only major difference between the grazing areas was that the pasture crude protein content was higher in the standard system in both the <b>pre-grazed</b> (205 and 159 g/kg) and post-grazed (172 v 141 g/kg) swards.

Early regrowth was characterized by low photosynthetic potential (10. 4 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1) and for paddocks under the 100 % LI treatment, leaf photosynthesis was 3. 3 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1, which may require plants to draw on organic reserves during the early phases of the process. Half way through regrowth, leaf photosynthetic rates increased to 26 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 in all treatments. Paddocks under the 95 % LI treatment (shortest mean regrowth periods; 22 days), sustained <b>pre-graze</b> photosynthetic rates at 26. 1 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1.

Under the highest grazing frequency (95 % LI), the short rest period and the low mean LAI (2. 08) allowed for more light penetration into the canopy.

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{variables}} {{in the structure of}} the sward with the most influence on the short-term herbage intake rate by grazing ruminants is the canopy height. The objective of this study was therefore to characterise the effect of the canopy height on short-term herbage intake rate using Sorghum bicolor cv BR 501. as a reference. Two experiments were conducted at Research Station of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, between December 2009 and April 2010. The treatments in experiment 1 were used to determine the influence of the <b>pre-grazing</b> canopy height on the short-term herbage intake and consisted of six canopy heights (30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 cm). The treatments in experiment 2 used the <b>pre-grazing</b> canopy height from experiment 1 that maximised the short-term herbage intake rate to evaluate the influence of the severity of grazing down (16, 33, 50, 67 and 84 %) on the herbage intake. Both experiments used a completely randomised block design, with two replicates in experiment 1 and three replicates in experiment 2. Four heifers (24 ± 2 months and 306 ± 56. 7 kg) were used in experiment 1. Three of these animals were used in experiment 2, which were then 26 ± 2 months and 339 ± 45. 5 kg. The short-term herbage intake rate was measured by weighing the heifers pre- and post-grazing, corrected for insensible weight losses. The number of grazing jaw movements (biting and non-biting) was counted automatically using an IGER Behaviour Recorder. In both experiments, the sward measurements included the pre- and post-grazing canopy height, the <b>pre-grazing</b> herbage mass and the vertical distribution of morphological components. In experiment 2, the post-grazing herbage mass was also measured. The results showed that the grazing canopy height that maximised the short-term herbage intake rate was approximately 50 cm. The grazing down protocol showed that the short-term herbage intake rate was constant until the depletion of 40 % of the optimal <b>pre-grazing</b> canopy height. After this level of depletion, there was a marked reduction in the short-term herbage intake rate. The results show that the best target management height in a Sorghum cv. BR 501 pasture, allowing for high levels of the short-term herbage intake rate, is 50 cm. With intermittent stocking, this level should be considered as the <b>pre-grazing</b> canopy height, and the level of herbage depletion should not exceed 40 %...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the "above-" and "below-ground" components of the phosphorus (P) cycle {{was carried out in}} the North Island hill country of New Zealand. The effect of P fertiliser rate and degree of land-slope on pasture P uptake, faecal P return and changes in soil P fractions was examined over a three year period. Plant P uptake was found to decrease with increasing slope and increase with increasing rate of P fertiliser. The changes in plant P uptake were a function of changes in both dry matter yield and pasture P concentration. Pasture on campsites which initially had a high Olsen P status (> 30) showed an unexpected apparent P response in both dry matter yield and plant P uptake. This response results from an artefact of the trial design whereby P fertiliser was applied to whole paddocks. The resulting improved nitrogen status of slopes at high rates of P fertiliser created abnormally high soil nitrogen levels on campsites, leading to very high levels of production. These findings are of significance in relation to soil fertility field trials conducted on individual slopes in hill country. Over the three year period of the trial seasonal plant P uptake followed the order: spring ≥ summer > autumn > winter, irrespective of slope category, fertiliser rate or grazing regime. The distribution of faecal material was found to be markedly affected by slope and approximately 60 % of the material deposited in each paddock was returned to campsites. In the remainder of the paddock, faecal P return decreased by at least 50 % with each 10 ° increase in slope. Paddock faecal P concentration (FP%) was predicted from the <b>pre-grazed</b> pasture P concentration (PP%) (calculated on a paddock basis) using the relationship: FP% = 3. 19 PP% - 0. 09 (r = 0. 94). Net P balance calculations for various slope group categories showed that deficits between plant P uptake and faecal P return increased with increasing slope but were little affected by increasing P fertiliser rate and consequent increase in stocking rate. This finding verifies the use of a single animal loss factor for a given topography, irrespective of sheep stocking rate, in the Ministry of Agriculture's (MAF's) Computerised Fertiliser Advisory Scheme (CFAS) for P. Measurements of faecal distribution in this trial suggested the use of a lower animal loss factor (0. 5 kg su- 1 of P) for "Easy" hill country than that used currently (0. 7 kg su- 1 of P) in the CFAS model. Independent studies on the rate of P cycling from faeces were conducted. The study investigating breakdown of faecal material revealed that physical disintegration of faecal material is likely to occur before chemical decomposition. In winter conditions faecal material disintegrated within a month; in summer conditions disintegration took approximately three months. In both seasons material on campsites disintegrated more rapidly than that on steeper slopes. A further study using radioisotopes in the field found that the shortterm plant availability of inorganic faecal P was approximately half that of monocalcium phosphate fertiliser over a two month period in the spring. In a study on the "below-ground" components of the P cycle total soil P was found to increase with increasing rate of P fertiliser. The magnitude of these increases decreased with increasing slope and depth. Increases in organic P were found to be higher on campsites than steeper slopes. On campsites, the extent of increase in organic P decreased with increasing rate of P fertiliser. Inorganic P increased with increasing rate of P fertiliser on all slopes; the magnitude of the increase decreased with increasing slope. At low rates of P fertiliser a decrease in inorganic P was measured on steep-slopes over time indicating that P inputs were not balancing P outputs. A change in the non-occluded P fraction accounted for the greatest proportion of the change in inorganic P on most slopes. The fact that calcium-bound P accumulated on all slopes, and that large increases were evident at high rates of P fertiliser suggested that this fraction was not playing an active part in the P cycle but was accumulating as an insoluble residue from superphosphate. The plant availability of soil P fractions was investigated in a glasshouse study. Total plant P uptake was found to be highly correlated with initial levels of total P (r = 0. 92),non-occluded P (r = 0. 82), inorganic P (r = 0. 91), Olsen P (r = 0. 93) and water-extractable P (r = 0. 97). Levels of organic P, occluded P and calcium-bound P were found to be essentially unchanged by plant growth over the eleven month trial period. Changes {{in the size of the}} cycling soil P pool were examined by combining results from the field trial with those from the glasshouse study. At low rates of P fertiliser (10 kg ha- 1), increases in occluded P and calcium-bound P (i. e., unavailable inorganic P) in the 0 - 15 cm depth were occurring at the expense of available P. At a high rate of P fertiliser (100 kg ha- 1) approximately two thirds of the P applied remained in the available form. On an annual basis, Olsen P increased with an increasing rate of P fertiliser and decreased with increasing soil depth and slope. Over the period of the trial Olsen P decreased significantly at the lowest rate of P fertiliser (10 kg ha- 1) and increased significantly at the highest rate (100 kg ha- 1) on the two slope groups studied. This indicated that these areas were not at "equilibrium" as defined by a stable Olsen P. At moderate rates of P fertiliser (20 and 30 kg ha- 1) it was not possible to determine whether or not equilibrium conditions existed as the annual variability in Olsen P was too high. An attempt was made to determine soil P losses (as defined by the CFAS model) at the trial site. Despite intensive and careful soil sampling Olsen P could not be used to determine "equilibrium" conditions which are a pre-requisite for measurement of soil P loss. This finding prevented validation of soil loss factors on this hill-country site. Data generated from the large field trial for "above-" and "below-ground" components of the P cycle enabled recommendations to be made on the location of suitable soil sampling sites and also on the location of priority areas for application of P fertiliser in grazed hill country...|$|R

Effect of <b>pre-grazing</b> herbage mass on grazing behaviour, grass {{dry matter}} intake and milk production of dairy cows. Proceedings of the New Zealand Society of Animal Production, 71, 28 - 32. The main objectives of this thesis were {{to investigate the}} effects of grazing severity, treading damage, re-growth interval and <b>pre-grazing</b> herbage mass (HM) on sward and animal performance in four experiments during 2009 and 2010 in Ireland. Experiment 1 investigated three post-grazing sward heights ranging from 3. 6 to 4. 9 cm during the main grazing season. Herbage accumulated and harvested (11. 3 and 11. 2 t dry matter (DM) /hectare (ha), respectively) were not significantly affected by grazing severity but there were sward morphological and structural differences. Experiment 2 quantified the effects of treading damage during two seasons, ranging from light to severe damage (3. 3 to 13. 3 -cm hoof-print depths, respectively). Treading damage in a perennial ryegrass (PRG) sward on a well-drained soil did not reduce annual grass DM production. Treading in a creeping bent-dominated sward on a poorly-drained soil resulted in 14 to 51 % reductions in cumulative yields depending on frequency and season. Experiment 3 {{examined the effects of}} 2 -, 3 - or 4 -week re-growth intervals on herbage production, characteristics and tissue turnover of a PRG sward using marked tillers (n = 240) under a cutting regime. Cumulative HMs were 6. 7, 9. 1 and 10. 4 t DM/ha for the 2 -, 3 - and 4 -week re-growth treatments, respectively. The number of leaves appearing per tiller during the re-growth period was only optimum for the 4 -week treatment. Experiment 4 also used marked tillers (n = 360) in a grazing dairy cow experiment during the main grazing season under three target <b>pre-grazing</b> HMs (945, 1, 623 and 2, 360 kg DM/ha > 4 cm). The number of leaves appearing per tiller during the re-growth period was 1. 0, 1. 9 and 2. 4 for low (L), medium (M) or high (H) <b>pre-grazing</b> HM treatments, respectively. Cows grazing L, M or H <b>pre-grazing</b> HM produced 343, 342 and 330 kg milksolids, respectively. Low pre-grazing-HM cows grazed for 90 min/day more than M and H pre-grazing-HM cows but {{there was no difference in}} individual intake (16. 0 and 15. 8 kg DM/cow/day in June and August, respectively). Post-grazing sward height, treading damage, re-growth interval and pregrazing HM can have a significant impact on the sward and on animal performance.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{evaluation}} of productive potential {{is not the}} only factor used to determine grazing management efficiency; it is also necessary to know the structural characteristics of the canopy. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of two management styles on Marandu palisade grass pastures under rotational stocking with respect to the herbage mass, morphological composition, and structural characteristics of the pasture. The treatments under consideration were a) a fixed rest period of 30 days (RP 30) or b) a rest period based on the time necessary for the canopy to reach 95 % light interception (LI 95). The experimental design was a completely randomized block with two blocks and three replicates within the blocks. Animals were placed in the paddocks when the grass reached the established management criteria, which were maintained for three days to reach 25 cm in stubble height. Shorter grazing intervals (22. 8 vs. 30 days), lower <b>pre-grazing</b> heights (35. 9 vs. 42. 3 cm), and lower forage masses (4, 411 vs. 5, 290 kg/ha. cycle) were observed in LI 95 pastures. The LI 95 treatment had a higher leaf percentage (48. 3 vs. 41. 1) and the lowest percentage of dead forage (19. 0 vs. 25. 4) in the <b>pre-grazing</b> forage mass of the pasture in relation to that of RP 30. Performing pasture management based on RP 30 throughout the season is harmful to the pasture structure because it reduces the leaf percentage and increases the stem and senescent material in the available forage. The lower <b>pre-grazing</b> forage mass observed under LI 95 management is offset by more grazing cycles within the rainy season...|$|E

This study focused on two areas of grazing management, the first {{an assessment of the}} indicators leaf stage, <b>pre-grazing</b> yield and grazing residual. In summary, 49 % of measured paddocks were grazed too soon based on leaf stage, 62 % were grazed outside the recommended <b>pre-grazing</b> yield, and 48 % of measured paddocks were not grazed to a desirable height. The second part of the study provided an insight into farmer decision making at an operational level of grazing management with three key components identified. These were: 1) The recruitment of paddocks into a grazing plan; 2) The shuffling of the paddock grazing sequence within the grazing plan; and 3) The management of individual grazing events before, during and after the event. An improved understanding by rural professionals of grazing management decision making would result in extension strategies which generate increased farmer engagement, adoption of grazing management technologies and improved on-farm productivity. falseonline at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate tiller population density and {{the dynamics of the}} tillering process in marandu palisade grass subjected to strategies of rotational stocking management and nitrogen fertilization. Treatments corresponded to combinations between two targets of <b>pre-grazing</b> conditions (sward surface height of 25 and 35 cm) and two rates of nitrogen application (50 and 200 kg ha- 1 year- 1), and were allocated to experimental units according to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in a randomised complete block design, with four replications. The following response variables were studied: initial (TPDi), intermediate (TPDm) and final (TPDf) tiller population density as well as the rates of tiller appearance (TAR) and death (TDR) and the tiller population stability index (SI). TPDi was similar to all treatments, with differences in tiller population density becoming more pronounced as the experiment progressed, resulting in larger TPDf on swards managed at 25 cm <b>pre-grazing</b> height. Tiller death was larger on swards managed at 35 cm, with differences in tiller appearance being recorded only from February 2010 onwards. Stability of tiller population was higher on swards managed at 25 cm <b>pre-grazing</b> height. Overall, there was no effect of nitrogen on the studied variables, and the most adequate grazing strategy corresponded to the <b>pre-grazing</b> height of 25 cm, regardless of the nitrogen application rate used. O objetivo deste experimento foi avaliar a densidade populacional e a dinâmica do perfilhamento em capim-marandu submetido a estratégias de pastejo rotativo e adubação nitrogenada. Os tratamentos corresponderam à combinação de duas metas de altura pré-pastejo (25 e 35 cm) e duas doses de aplicação de nitrogênio (50 e 200 kg ha- 1 ano- 1) em arranjo fatorial 2 x 2 alocadas às unidades experimentais segundo delineamento de blocos completos casualizados, com quatro repetições.

The effect of GRL and HA on animal and pasture data were analysed as a randomised block design, including the fixed effects of GRL, HA, week, and the interaction between GRL and HA. At the beginning of the experiment, <b>pre-grazing</b> herbage mass, platemeter height, and OMD of the pasture were similar between treatments and averaged 2, 233 kg DM/ha, 9. 3 cm, and 0. 89, respectively.

This {{study was conducted to}} determine differences in cattle utilization among experimental lines of forage kochia and relate them to forage quality and morphological attributes. The utilization of forage kochia was also compared to 2 ̆ 7 Ladak 2 ̆ 7 alfalfa [Medicago saliva (L.) ] and two entries of winterfat [Krashnennikovia species (Guldenstaedt) ]. Cattle utilization was determined by calculating a biomass consumed value and a percent biomass consumed value. Dry weights for each plant were taken after grazing and subtracted from a <b>pre-grazing</b> dry weight (predicted using a quadratic regression equation) that produced the biomass consumed value. The percent consumed value was calculated by dividing biomass consumed by <b>pre-grazing</b> dry weight. Ocularly estimated utilization scores (OU) were also used to measure utilization. Forage quality traits were analyzed on each entry using near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Morphologic and phenological characteristics potentially related to utilization were made by physical measurements and visual evaluations. There were significant differences among forage kochia accessions for all traits evaluated. Four entries, including Immigrant and Ladak alfalfa, were significantly higher in percent herbage consumed than the other entries. These same entries were consistently high in OU ratings, forage quality analyses, and most morphological characteristics. <b>Pre-grazing</b> dry weight (r = - 0. 96, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001), stem length (r = 0. 67, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001), and branch density (r = 0. 63, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) were all highly correlated with utilization. Crude protein (partial R 2 = 0. 253, P ≤ 0. 0001) was the only forage quality trait associated with utilization using a stepwise regression to predict utilization. From this study we conclude that some forage kochia accessions are very palatable.

Here, the combined effect of genotypic and environmental variation conditions on anthesis date and the <b>pre-grazing</b> period in durum wheat, triticale and barley was analysed to define a developmental ideotype for their dual-purpose use. The extensive variation for the Haun stage reached at the time of apex emergence from the soil surface was associated with variation in the final leaf number, regardless of environment, species and cultivar. The timing of the terminal spikelet stage was the best predictor of apex emergence. The durum wheats tillered poorly, whereas the barleys and the triticales performed comparably in three of the four environments. In general, the higher the final leaf number, the higher the number of leaves and tillers produced by the time of apex emergence, the higher the number of leaves which emerges subsequently. The development of a high number of leaves both before and after apex emergence is advantageous, provided that anthesis is not overly delayed such that flowering and grain fill occur within a period where stressful conditions are likely to occur. Barley developed many leaves and had a low phyllochron, so was identified as the species with the development best suited for dual-purpose cropping.

40|$|Grass {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{important}} crop grown in Ireland. Well-managed grassland supports high levels of animal performance, and the production of high quality produce. Grazed grass is a relatively cheap feed source for beef production (O'Kiely, 1994). Grazed grass does not always match feed requirements in efficient beef production systems. Supply tends to exceed demand in the late spring and summer whereas deficiencies in feed supply occur in late autumn and during the winter and early spring. The objective of the present series of experiments was to examine the potential to increase the utilization of grazed grass in beef production systems. There are two aspects to this: one relates to the utilization of grass in situ; the second relates to the strategic approach to grass utilization, i. e. matching feed requirements with supply of grazed grass and silage conservation during the year. The first two experiments presented in this report examine the utilization of grass in situ.

Two stocking systems were tested, in which cattle were allowed to graze: (1) after grazing cycles of 30 days (T 30 d); or (2) when the sward reached a <b>pre-grazing</b> height of 70 cm (T 0. 7 m). Five grazing cycles, each consisting of a sward recovery period followed by 2 days of grazing, were evaluated in each stocking system using a completely randomized block design and repeated measures with 2 repetitions per stocking system (each composed {{of a set of}} sixteen 4000 m 2 paddocks grazed sequentially). Four 1 m× 1 m sward patches were collected, constituting one sample per paddock, which was used to evaluate <b>pre-grazing</b> herbage mass, leaf, stem and dead matter (dry mass per area), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDFom), acid detergent fiber (ADFom) and hemicellulose (HEM). Cows received daily supplementation of 4 kg concentrate. Stocking rate, milk production and composition were evaluated in each grazing cycle. The T 30 d stocking system produced higher (P= 0. 0014) <b>pre-grazing</b> height than T 0. 7 m (0. 83 vs 0. 69 cm), had higher (P= 0. 0071) light interception (94 vs 91 %) and higher (P= 0. 0233) leaf area index (5. 2 vs 4. 5). In addition, T 30 d exhibited larger (P= 0. 0204) herbage mass than T 0. 7 m (7276 vs 6187 kg MS/ha), higher (P= 0. 0243) leaf dry mass per area (2618 vs 2294 kg/ha) and higher (P< 0. 0001) stocking rate (6. 2 vs 5. 7 animal/ha). The grazing cycle affected sward composition, with T 30 d producing higher (P= 0. 0060) leaf NDFom. Milk production and composition was not affected by the stocking systems, as follows (T 30 d vs T 0. 7 m) : 20. 12 vs 20. 94 kg milk production per cow/day; 31. 4 vs 31. 9 gfat/kg, 29. 9 vs 30. 2 gprotein/kg, 43. 7 vs 44. 6 glactose/kg, 114. 8 vs 116. 5 g/kg total solids and 12. 85 vs 12. 86 mg/dL ureic nitrogen. Stocking system therefore affects the nutritive value of sward. Stocking management allowing a 30 -day grazing cycle for Guinea grass sward (T 30 d) produces higher forage mass, supporting a higher stocking rate and thereby increasing productivity in dairy farm...|$|E

Marandu palisade grass swards subjected to year-round grazing by crossbred heifers were evaluated. Three stocking systems were tested: 1) a grazing cycle of 28 days (T 28 d); 2) when the sward reached a <b>pre-grazing</b> height of 30 cm (T 0. 3 m), and 3) when the sward reached a <b>pre-grazing</b> height of 30 cm under irrigation (T-irrig 0. 3 m). Heifers from treatments T 28 d and T 0. 3 m were supplemented with dry matter at 1 % of BW during winter. Statistical was a completely randomized block split-plot design. The light interception was higher (P< 0. 001) for T-irrig 0. 3 m during winter. A lower leaf area index (P< 0. 001) was found for T 28 d, and T 0. 3 m during winter and for T 0. 3 m during autumn. There was an effect of stocking systems (P= 0. 0055), season (P< 0. 001) and interaction (P< 0. 0001) on weight gain (WG), stocking rate and productivity. The lowest WG was obtained in winter for the T-irrig 0. 3 m treatment. The mean WG was 0. 45, 0. 49 and 0. 43 kg/day for T 28 d, T 0. 3 m and T-irrig 0. 3 m, respectively. Lower productivity (P= 0. 0155) was observed for T 28 dwhen compared to T 0. 3 m and T-irrig 0. 3 m. The productivity rates were 662. 2, 741. 7 and 758. 3 kg WG/ha, per season for T 28 d, T 0. 3 m and T-irrig 0. 3 m, respectively...|$|E
