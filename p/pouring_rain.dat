In <b>pouring</b> <b>rain,</b> the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot, existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets. Forbes felt so humiliated {{by the events}} that he retreated from command in all but name, surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff. In leading the column back to Bulawayo, Raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from the Anglo-Zulu War to ensure {{the survival of the}} haggard men. He avoided several Matabele ambushes, and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day, wasting much of their ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in <b>pouring</b> <b>rain.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prix formula {{was changed}} again in 1938, abandoning the {{previous}} system of weight restrictions and instead limiting piston displacement. Mercedes-Benz' new car, the W154, proved its abilities at the French Grand Prix, where von Brauchitsch won ahead of Caracciola and Lang {{to make it}} a Mercedes 1–2–3. Caracciola won two races in the 1938 season: the Swiss Grand Prix and the Coppa Acerbo; finished second in three: the French, German and Pau Grands Prix; and third in two: the Tripoli and Italian Grands Prix, to take the European Championship for the third and final time. The highlight of Caracciola's season was his win in the <b>pouring</b> <b>rain</b> at the Swiss Grand Prix. His teammate Seaman led for the first 11laps before Caracciola passed him; he remained in the lead {{for the rest of the}} race, despite losing the visor on his helmet, severely reducing visibility, especially given the spray thrown up by tyres of the many lapped cars.|$|E

When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats.

5|$|Three {{weeks after}} Cao Qin's failed uprising, the Mongol leader Bolai, {{who had been}} staging raids into {{northern}} China, sent an embassy into China to request formal tribute relations and {{to serve as a}} vassal to the Ming. News of this rebellion reached the Joseon court of Korea by September 9, while the Korean official in charge of the report perhaps embellished the level of gore and violence by stating that tens of thousands had died and the three days of <b>pouring</b> <b>rain</b> following the rebellion flooded even the Forbidden City with streams of blood and rain. A native rebellion would not threaten the capital city again until the fall of Beijing to the army of Li Zicheng in 1644, marking the end of the dynasty and, shortly after, the beginning of Manchu conquest. Until the conquest of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, Chinese officials continued to show a large degree of apprehension over Mongols in military service to the Ming, and still favored relocation schemes. However, Cao's rebellion marked the last event when Ming Mongols were of great importance to court affairs; although many Mongol officers retained hereditary titles of noble lineage, the nobility within the military command structure declined as a whole while men from more humble origins eventually displaced them.|$|E

After the rainy spring of 2014, marked by five waves of <b>pouring</b> <b>rains</b> which caused floods and water bogging on crops, the rainy period also {{continued}} in the summer months reaching its peak in July. Air temperature which has been cool in some interval, but close to normal led to some gradual delays in June and July, and only in August some gradual enforcements brought the crops to a normal stage. The most intense rainfall of the summer was registered in the interval 27 - 31 July 2014.

40|$|Studies on the {{influence}} of hydrological and meteorological events to leaching of NO 3 -, NH 4 + and PO 4 3 - were carried out in the years 2009 and 2010, in a small agricultural catchment near Bialystok. The results of measurements of weather conditions, rate of flow and chemical composition of the flow were presented in the work. It was found that a sudden rainfall is a critical period for courses in the agricultural landscape. The concentration of dissolved substances increases during the increased flow of water in the watercourse, whereas it decreases during the low water levels. In the year 2009, during the summer of a small stream of water transported about 365 kg load of nitrate, 12 kg of ammonium ions and about 5 kg of phosphate.
