60|$|Rokoff {{could not}} move. His knees trembled. His voice broke in inarticulate shrieks. With a last <b>piercing</b> <b>wail</b> he sank to his knees--and then Sheeta sprang.|$|E
60|$|As {{the terrified}} shriek of the sorry monarch rang through the {{interior}} of the desolate ruin another sound mingled with it, half-drowning the <b>piercing</b> <b>wail</b> of terror.|$|E
60|$|Bradley {{fired at}} the {{vanishing}} menacer of their peace and safety; but whether he scored a hit or not, none could tell, though, following the shot, there was wafted back to them the same <b>piercing</b> <b>wail</b> that had on other occasions frozen their marrow.|$|E
60|$|Through {{the open}} door of the small bedroom {{opposite}} her, Rilla saw Mrs. Anderson lying on the untidy bed; and Mrs. Anderson was dead. There was no doubt of that; neither was there any doubt that the big, frowzy, red-headed, red-faced, over-fat woman sitting near the door-way, smoking a pipe quite comfortably, was very much alive. She rocked idly back and forth amid her surroundings of squalid disorder, and paid no attention whatever to the <b>piercing</b> <b>wails</b> proceeding from a cradle in the middle of the room.|$|R
6000|$|Again their {{companionship}} suffered eclipse in {{the distraction}} which the customs inspectors of all countries bring to travellers; and again they were united {{during the long}} delay in the waiting-room, which was also the restaurant. It was full of strange noises and figures and odors--the shuffling of feet, the clash of crockery, the explosion of nervous German voices, mixed {{with the smell of}} beer and ham, and the smoke of cigars. Through it all <b>pierced</b> the <b>wail</b> of a postman standing at the door with a letter in his hand and calling out at regular intervals, [...] "Krahnay, Krahnay!" [...] When March could bear it no longer he went up to him and shouted, [...] "Crane! Crane!" [...] and the man bowed gratefully, and began to cry, [...] "Kren! Kren!" [...] But whether Mr. Crane got his letter or not, he never knew.|$|R
60|$|Now {{every living}} being whom {{they could find}} was slain, and the Romans drew back, bearing their spoil with them. But the {{remainder}} of the Jews, to the number of some thousands, escaped by the bridges, which they broke down behind them, across the valley into the Upper City, whence that <b>piercing,</b> sobbing <b>wail</b> echoed without cease. Miriam watched till she could bear the sight no longer. The glare blinded her, the heat of the incandescent furnace shrivelled her up, her white dress scorched and turned brown. She crouched behind the shelter of her pinnacle gasping for breath. She prayed that she might die, and could not. Now she remembered the drink that remained in the leathern bottle, and swallowed it to the last drop. Then she crouched down again against the pillar, and lying thus her senses left her.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the guards}} seized {{the three of}} them to lead them away, and the frightened babe set up a thin, <b>piercing</b> <b>wail,</b> while the Bishop and his companions, preceded by one of the monks bearing the candle--it was that Ambrose who had choked Emlyn--marched in {{procession}} down the hall to gain the great door.|$|E
60|$|As we {{drew near}} the canoe, it was plain, {{that the loss}} of their sire had again for the instant {{overcome}} the survivors. Raising hands, they cursed us; and at intervals sent forth a low, <b>piercing</b> <b>wail,</b> peculiar to their race. As before, faint cries were heard from the tent. And all the while rose and fell on the sea, the ill-fated canoe.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{the only}} mourners here," [...] said Leonard, and as he spoke once more the low and <b>piercing</b> <b>wail</b> thrilled upon the air. Just then the cloud passed, the {{moonlight}} shone out brilliantly, and they saw who it was that cried aloud in this desolate place. For there, not twenty paces from them, {{on the other side}} of the ravine, crouched upon a stone and rocking herself to and fro as though in an agony of despair and grief, sat a tall and withered woman.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the single}} {{received}} favorable reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic chose the song as an album highlight. Echoing this thought, Steve Beebee of rock magazine Kerrang! added that it [...] "develops into a searching, soulful hook, ranging high {{among the best}} material this band has ever recorded." [...] Digital Spys Lewis Corner labelled the recording as a track to consider downloading, further writing that [...] "'My Heart Is Broken' would strongly beg to differ, with a dashing piano riff skittling over growling guitar strums serving as a backdrop for her emotive alto-soprano." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote, [...] "On 'My Heart Is Broken', a gorgeous piano intro rises alongside Lee's vibrant vocal delivery as Will Hunt's airtight drumming propels the tune into another realm." [...] Tom Goodwyn of NME praised [...] "My Heart Is Broken", saying that it [...] "sounds quite {{a lot like a}} Disney ballad, beginning with Amy Lee cooing 'I will wander until the end of time' over a piano line straight off Powers Ballad Vol.12. It gets heavier at the end though, don't worry." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters concluded that the song was [...] "bluntly titled", while The Hollywood Reporters Sophie Schillaci called it a [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] ballad. Describing the song as [...] "fiery", Chad Grischow of IGN noted that in [...] "My Heart Is Broken", [...] "Lee's siren-esque vocals shine, [...] the band takes a few interesting chances late in the album." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe called the single [...] "a banshee howl of defiant, [...] self-lacerating rage." [...] Billboard magazine's Christa Titus wrote that Lee's voice was [...] "powerful and flexible as ever, as heard in her <b>piercing</b> <b>wails</b> on hit-in-waiting 'My Heart Is Broken'." [...] Serene Dominic of The Arizona Republic confessed that, [...] "Really, when your heart is broken, you want a song that's as idea driven as 'My Heart is Broken' to carry you through and that's what she [...] delivers." [...] Additionally, Arwa Haider of Metro commented, [...] "Standard romantic rock bluster from Evanescence. Frontwoman Amy Lee still sounds like she’d tear strips off any would-be lothario." ...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the series, Ridley has {{undergone}} a variety of changes in appearance. In the original Metroid title, he was roughly {{the same size as}} protagonist Samus Aran and sported a more alien appearance (particularly in official artwork, which depicted him with eight eyes running down the length of his head and a small, lamprey-like mouth). In Super Metroid, he is larger than in the original title several times over, sporting purplish-brown skin, glowing yellow eyes, chameleonic abilities (possibly explaining his inconsistent skin tone across different games and even within different parts of Super Metroid), and an overall body shape that heavily resembles a European dragon. Later games depict him as larger still, and Other M departs from previous depictions by giving him a bulky, muscular form in contrast with his skeletal appearance in previous games, along with completely purple skin and flattened jaws resembling a pointed duck bill with a noticeable underbite. Ridley's vocalizations were first depicted in Super Metroid and took the form of a predatory screech; later 2D titles instead gave him <b>piercing,</b> high-pitched <b>wails,</b> while 3D installments such as the Prime games and Other M had him perform monstrous roars. His cybernetic form during the events of the Prime series is referred to as Meta Ridley and incorporates various ballistic weapon systems, while a robotic duplicate, Ridley Robot, appears as the final boss in Zero Mission.|$|R
5000|$|Many music critics complimented the band's {{change of}} sound. NME gave the song a very {{positive}} review, saying [...] "'Believe' proves that the Mumfords know exactly what they're doing. Twinkling synths herald its arrival, as Marcus softly deals with weighty matters of the heart. [...] "I don't even know if I believe/everything you're trying to say to me," [...] he croons, as the song keeps relatively light on its feet over its first half, as languid keys do calmly flirt {{with the idea of}} becoming a string section, but then think better of it. It's all change at two minute mark though, when Winston Marshall, finally free from the shackles of the banjo, lets rip a <b>piercing</b> electric guitar <b>wail</b> as the song rockets skywards. From here on in its a steady race to epic heights. [...] "Say something like you love me," [...] implores Marcus against increased riffage courtesy of Winston, in what's easily the first stadium-worthy song of 2015". In a positive review, The Independent commented on the lack of banjo in the song, [...] "Synthetic sounds can sometimes create a flatness to a tune, but the Mumfords have managed to use them {{to create a sense of}} power and energy that’s hard to resist. The banjo is dead, long live electric". Maud Deitch of Pitchfork Media said in a review of Wilder Mind, [...] "Songs like 'Believe' are so lumbering that they are almost vulgar", criticizing Mumford for using his [...] "best Chris Martin-soft-voice".|$|R
60|$|There came a day {{in early}} spring. All night long the guns had never ceased. It sounded like the tireless barking of ten {{thousand}} giant dogs. Behind the hills, the whole horizon, like a fiery circle, was ringed with flashing light. Shapeless forms, bent beneath burdens, passed in endless procession through the village. Masses of rushing men swept like shadowy phantoms through the fitfully-illumined darkness. Beneath that everlasting barking, Joan would hear, now the <b>piercing</b> <b>wail</b> of a child; now a clap of thunder that for the moment would drown all other sounds, followed by a faint, low, rumbling crash, like the shooting of coals into a cellar. The wounded on their beds lay with wide-open, terrified eyes, moving feverishly from side to side.|$|E
6000|$|The chief draws {{back and}} gives {{directions}} to his indunas, his thinkers, his wise ones, men distinguished from their fellows {{by the absence}} of shield and plume; the indunas pass on the orders to the captains, and at once the so-called dance begins. First they manoeuvre a little in absolute silence, and changing their position with wonderful precision and rapidity; but as their blood warms there comes a sound as of the hissing of ten thousand snakes, and they charge and charge again. A pause, and the company of [...] "greys" [...] on our right, throwing itself into open order, flits past us like so many vultures to precipitate itself with a wild, whistling cry on an opposing body which rushed to meet it. They join issue, they grapple; on them swoops another company, then another and another, until nothing is to be distinguished except a mass of wild faces heaving; of changing forms rolling and writhing, twisting and turning, and, to all appearances, killing and being killed, whilst the whole air is pervaded with a shrill, savage sibillation. It is not always the same cry; now it is the snorting of a troop of buffaloes, now the shriek of the eagle as he seizes his prey, anon the terrible cry of the [...] "night-prowler," [...] the lion, and now--more thrilling than all--the <b>piercing</b> <b>wail</b> of a woman. But whatever the cry, the cadence rises and falls in perfect time and unanimity; no two mix with one another so as to mar the effect of each.|$|E
6000|$|But by far {{the most}} finished, complete, and truly {{inspired}} pieces of Burns are, without dispute, to be found among his Songs. It is here that, although through a small aperture, his light shines with the least obstruction; in its highest beauty, and pure sunny clearness. The reason may be, that Song is a brief and simple species of composition: and requires nothing so much for its perfection as genuine poetic feeling, genuine music of heart. The Song has its rules equally with the Tragedy; rules which in most cases are poorly fulfilled, in many cases are not so much as felt. We might write a long essay on the Songs of Burns; which we reckon {{by far the}} best that Britain has yet produced; for, indeed, since the era of Queen Elizabeth, we know not that, by any other hand, aught truly worth attention has been accomplished in this department. True, we have songs enough [...] "by persons of quality;" [...] we have tawdry, hollow, wine-bred, madrigals; many a rhymed [...] "speech" [...] in the flowing and watery vein of Ossorius the Portugal Bishop, rich in sonorous words, and, for moral, dashed perhaps with some tint of a sentimental sensuality; all which many persons cease not from endeavoring to sing: though for most part, we fear, the music is but from the throat outward, or at best from some region far enough short of the Soul; not in which, but in a certain inane Limbo of the Fancy, or even in some vaporous debatable land {{on the outside of the}} Nervous System, most of such madrigals and rhymed speeches seem to have originated. With the Songs of Burns we must not name these things. Independently of the clear, manly, heartfelt sentiment that ever pervades his poetry, his Songs are honest in another point of view: in form as well as in spirit. They do not affect to be set to music; but they actually and in themselves are music; they have received their life, and fashioned themselves together, in the medium of Harmony, as Venus rose from the bosom of the sea. The story, the feeling, is not detailed, but suggested; not said, or spouted, in rhetorical completeness and coherence; but sung, in fitful gushes, in glowing hints, in fantastic breaks, in warblings not of the voice only, but of the whole mind. We consider this to be the essence of a song; and that no songs since the little careless catches, and, as it were, drops of song, which Shakspeare has here and there sprinkled over his plays, fulfil this condition in nearly the same degree as most of Burns's do. Such grace and truth of external movement, too, presupposes in general a corresponding force and truth of sentiment, and inward meaning. The Songs of Burns are not more perfect in the former quality than in the latter. With what tenderness he sings, yet with what vehemence and entireness! There is a <b>piercing</b> <b>wail</b> in his sorrow, the purest rapture in his joy: he burns with the sternest ire, or laughs with the loudest or slyest mirth; and yet he is sweet and soft, [...] "sweet as the smile when fond lovers meet, and soft as their parting tear!" [...] If we farther take into account the immense variety of his subjects; how, from the loud flowing revel in Willie brew'd a peck o' Maut, to the still, rapt enthusiasm of sadness for Mary in Heaven; from the glad kind greeting of Auld Langsyne, or the comic archness of Duncan Gray, to the fire-eyed fury of Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled, he has found a tone and words for every mood of man's heart,--it will seem a small praise if we rank him as the first of all our song-writers; for we know not where to find one worthy of being second to him.|$|E
5000|$|NME writer Jamie Milton {{said the}} song is [...] "an enraged, viciously snarling return, so fury-filled it's capable of leaving you {{physically}} shaken," [...] while praising Rowsell's delivery, saying: [...] "Across just two minutes, she howls, grunts and cackles between words. The last thing you hear is a <b>piercing</b> <b>wail,</b> like she's screaming directly into a loudspeaker placed next to your ear. 'Yuk Foo' packs rage and angst like sardines in a box, crushed together into a bullet-shaped attack. It's the sound of Wolf Alice making a serious step up." [...] Similarly, Dork magazine stated that [...] "Ellie Rowsell is growling, screaming even, her voice straining at the edges as it rips itself apart - equal parts unrelenting attitude and red hot fury. The spite {{is as good as}} another instrument as she calls out the world in increasingly vicious terms," [...] saying that {{the song is}} [...] "the all the sass of a militant wing of the Spice Girls inducted into a Nine Inch Nails inspired death cult. Its eyes are set firm, its grin unnervingly fixed. It's absolutely fucking glorious." ...|$|E
