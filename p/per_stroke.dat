25|$|While a {{four-stroke}} {{piston engine}} completes one combustion <b>stroke</b> <b>per</b> cylinder for every two rotations of the crankshaft (that is, one-half power <b>stroke</b> <b>per</b> crankshaft rotation per cylinder), each combustion chamber in the Wankel generates one combustion <b>stroke</b> <b>per</b> driveshaft rotation, i.e. one power <b>stroke</b> <b>per</b> rotor orbital revolution and three power <b>strokes</b> <b>per</b> rotor rotation.

This meant that it was no longer essential to have staff on site 24 hours a day. The decorative chimney was shortened in the 1960s.

50|$|As {{the engine}} was {{designed}} to run slowly, the pumps had a capacity of over 300 gallons <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> of the pistons.

50|$|At a given engine speed, {{a longer}} stroke {{increases}} engine friction (since the piston travels a greater distance <b>per</b> <b>stroke)</b> and increases {{stress on the}} crankshaft due to the higher peak piston acceleration. The smaller bore also reduces the area available for valves in the cylinder head, requiring them to be smaller or fewer in number. Because these factors favor lower engine speeds, undersquare engines are most often tuned to develop peak torque at relatively low speeds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wildland fires {{attributed}} to lightning ignitions in Victoria, Australia, are examined systematically {{through the use}} of lightning occurrence data. Lightning stroke data were obtained by a network of ground-based lightning detection sensors over a 9 -year period. Characteristics of these fires are examined including the temporal variability in the average chance of fire occurrence <b>per</b> lightning <b>stroke</b> and the time period from lightning ignition of a fire until the fire grows large enough to be first observed, as well as distributions of fire duration and total area burnt. It is found that the time of day that lightning occurs does not have a significant influence on the chance of fire <b>per</b> lightning <b>stroke,</b> in contrast to the time of year, for which a significant annual variation occurs. Regional variability is examined by discussing the results for Victoria, Australia, in relation to results of studies {{from other parts of the}} world...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionIntravenous tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (IV tPA) is a globally recommended treatment for acute ischemic stroke patients. We examined IV tPA use among patients aged 18 - 64 years with a primary diagnosis acute ischemic stroke in the US and inpatient costs per hospitalization by IV tPA use status among these patients. MethodsUsing 2010 - 2013 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Inpatient Data, we identified 39, 149 hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. We verified those with and without IV tPA by ICD- 9 procedure code 99. 10. We estimated trends in IV tPA use by applying logistic regression. The average inpatient costs <b>per</b> acute ischemic <b>stroke</b> hospitalization were assessed for sub-populations. We examined costs <b>per</b> acute ischemic <b>stroke</b> hospitalization using multivariate regression models controlling for IV tPA status, age, gender, urbanization, geographic region, Charlson Comorbidity Index, length of hospital stays (LOS) and discharge status. Results 2, 546 hospitalizations (6. 5 %) used IV tPA. IV tPA use increased over time (2010 vs. 2013; odds ratio 1. 50). Average inpatient costs <b>per</b> acute ischemic <b>stroke</b> hospitalization was $ 20, 331 ($ 31, 369 for IV tPA group, $ 19, 563 for non-tPA group). From multivariate analyses, higher costs <b>per</b> acute ischemic <b>stroke</b> hospitalization were associated with longer LOS, non-home discharge destination, and IV tPA use, which might be correlated with severity of stroke. ConclusionsFindings suggest that IV tPA use increased recent years while the inpatient costs <b>per</b> acute ischemic <b>stroke</b> hospitalization using IV tPA are substantial. Those findings are useful in better understanding the overall economic burden of stroke, short-term cost implications of using IV tPA, and for estimating the accurate cost-effectiveness of stroke treatments.
