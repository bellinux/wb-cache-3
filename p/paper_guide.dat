You will not, indeed, be able, if you attend {{properly}} to your coloring, to get anything like the quantity of form you could in a chiaroscuro sketch; nevertheless, {{if you do not}} dash or rush at your work, nor do it lazily, you may always get enough form to be satisfactory. An extra quarter of an hour, distributed in quietness {{over the course of the}} whole study, may just make the difference between a quite intelligible drawing, and a slovenly and obscure one. If you determine well beforehand what outline each piece of color is to have, and, when it is on the <b>paper,</b> <b>guide</b> it without nervousness, as far as you can, into the form required; and then, after it is dry, consider thoroughly what touches are needed to complete it, before laying one of them on; you will be surprised to find how masterly the work will soon look, as compared with a hurried or ill-considered sketch. In no process that I know of--least of all in sketching--can time be really gained by precipitation. It is gained only by caution; and gained in all sorts of ways; for not only truth of form, but force of light, is always added by an intelligent and shapely laying of the shadow colors. You may often make a simple flat tint, rightly gradated and edged, express a complicated piece of subject without a single retouch. The two Swiss cottages, for instance, with their balconies, and glittering windows, and general character of shingly eaves, are expressed in Fig. 30 with one tint of gray, and a few dispersed spots and lines of it; all of which you ought to be able to lay on without more than thrice dipping your brush, and without a single touch after the tint is dry.|$|E

5000|$|The Royal Futura 800 was {{the most}} popular, most feature-full, and most {{expensive}} model. It had a 44-key (48 character) keyboard.

The 800 also came equipped with a plastic, custom-fitted dust cover and internal felt lining to mute typing noise. Behind the paper table was a retractable V-shaped <b>paper</b> <b>guide</b> that allowed for easy viewing of work in progress. The 800 came in several different two-tone colors: [...] "Periwinkle Blue", [...] "Meadow Green", [...] "Mist Gray", and [...] "Cocoa" [...] (often referred to as Salmon-Pink).

50|$|Creating {{centered}} headers {{is possible}} on a typewriter, {{even if the}} font is proportional. The typist can left-justify the header and then use the space bar to {{count the number of}} spaces {{from the end of the}} text to the right margin. In addition, the IBM Executive and Selectric have a kerning key that would give a more accurate measure of the whitespace. Once this number is determined, halving it gives the number of leading spaces for a centered header. The same centering will be achieved on different occasions if the paper is inserted flush to the <b>paper</b> <b>guide,</b> and the same count of spaces is applied. For an example of multiple centered lines produced using a proportionally spaced typewriter font, see the third page of the contemporary annual history of Bush's Alabama guard unit.|$|E

40|$|Objectives – The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were the following: 1) To determine the existence of a formal promotion or marketing strategic plan for e-books in academic libraries. 2) To identify the marketing and promotion tools being used for e-book marketing. 3) To understand the role of faculty in promoting e-books. 4) To explore the issues and challenges that the libraries are facing in promoting e-books. 5) To investigate the future plans for the promotion of e-books. Design – Qualitative study involving individual interviews followed by thematic analysis. Setting – The research setting was seven academic libraries with various sizes of e-book collections (~ 9, 000 to ~ 500, 000) and ranging from research leading to teaching focused universities. Subjects – The interviews were conducted with 25 academic librarians, including 19 subject librarians, 4 e-resources librarians, 1 collection development manager, and 1 acquisition and metadata officer. Methods – Using a multiple case approach, the researchers interviewed 25 librarians from 7 academic libraries. The interviews were digitally recorded. The interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. The researchers recorded information about the type and size of the university, number of e-books, and the role of interviewees, and then conducted a semi-structured interview. The following questions were asked: 1) “Do you have a promotion/marketing strategy for e-books (or e-resources) ? If not, is there a need for one? 2) What are the marketing and promotion tools you use for e-books? 3) What are the issues and challenges in promoting e-books?” (p. 629) Main Results – While none of the cases had a formalized marketing strategy, most participants (19 out of 25) acknowledged the importance of developing one. Those who did not find it necessary argued that their users had good knowledge of library e-resources, thus, marketing was unnecessary. Although {{there was a lack of}} a marketing strategic plan across all the cases, some of the participants were practicing e-book marketing and promotion to some extent. The interviewees mentioned a total of 20 different promotional tools. The most frequently used promotional tools were library websites, information literacy sessions, OPACs, and e-mails. Participants also noted marketing using online help tutorials and various events. The least frequently mentioned promotional tools were announcement boards, a library representative, blogs, bulletins, the display screen, and a marketing campaign. The marketing campaign was only mentioned by librarians from one library. According to some respondents, there are faculty and course instructors who contribute in promotion of e-books dependently or independently from the library. Some recommend e-books as course reading materials, some add links to e-books on the virtual learning environment (VLE) reading lists, and some even go beyond that and provide instructions on how to use e-books. Not all librarians were aware of the use of e-books by faculty. The authors also investigated the future plans anticipated by the participants. There was only one library that has appointed a marketing officer and intends to develop a marketing strategy. All other cases plan to improve on current marketing practices or expressed innovative approaches in marketing by “development of an information literacy project, use of online chat, promotion of e-books in course committee meetings, provision of a <b>paper</b> <b>guide</b> for e-books,” CD case display of available e-books, and other strategies (p. 633). Marketing a new service comes with its own issues and challenges. The most frequently mentioned issues and challenges that librarians were facing were time constraints, raising users’ expectations, and e-book availability in the library. Also, accessibility was of concern to some participants. Conclusion – This study underlines the importance of marketing a library’s new resources, particularly e-books, and it confirms the lack of a strategic approach to marketing in academic libraries. Some participants recognize the importance of a strategic plan, and practice e-book marketing using a variety of tools. However, most tools are not marketing specific, but are either communication tools or part of service delivery. The authors stated that most interviewees had a reflective approach to marketing, since they were trying to improve the current marketing practices by innovative means or by adapting successful practices from other colleagues. The authors recommend that establishing a well thought-out strategic approach would help overcome several issues and challenges raised by participants. It would help manage the tension between service delivery and promotion. Also, it would provide clear guidelines for developing a budget allocation plan for e-book purchasing. In addition, internal marketing would help establish a culture of user-centred service in the library, and highlights the importance of new services among library staff. Libraries are always dependent on publishers’ decisions concerning the availability of and licensing agreements for e-books. They are considered as “intermediaries in the information or document supply chain” (p. 638). The authors suggest future studies to understand the role of libraries in managing links between licensing issues and service delivery. One interesting observation in this study was the absence of Web 2. 0 tools as promotional tools. It seems that libraries do not fully take advantage of new technology for marketing. Another interesting finding was the inaccurate or indirect reference to the notion of word-of-mouth by respondents. In this study, word-of-mouth was mentioned as a marketing tool by only a few participants. No one perceived the role of academic faculty in promoting e-books by word-of-mouth. While word-of-mouth is considered to be an invaluable marketing strategy because it is a tailored recommendation by consumers to consumers (Alire, 2007), it was neglected by most respondents in this study. Overall, the lack of knowledge of marketing strategies and users’ information seeking behaviour among academic librarians is evident...|$|E
