40|$|Tax-effect {{accounting}} {{has been}} controversy since its origin in allocation {{has generally been}} adopted the subject in the 1940 s. Tax across the English speaking world, even though underlying basic issues have not been resolved. A {{review of the literature}} shows that issues such as: whether income tax is an expense; whether the <b>provision</b> for deferred <b>income</b> tax is a liability and whether the <b>provision</b> for future <b>income</b> tax benefit is an asset have not been resolved because of differing opinions as to what is an expense, liability or an asset. The development of a conceptual framework in Australia, which provides definitions of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, has provided an opportunity to reexamine some of the unresolved issues mentioned above. Since the conceptual framework, in SAC 4, defines an expense in terms of whether it increases a liability or reduces an asset the re-examination was directed at ascertaining whether the <b>provision</b> for deferred <b>income</b> tax satisfies the definition and recognition criteria for a liability. The results were inconclusive. However, it was possible to conclude that the <b>provision</b> for deferred <b>income</b> tax does not readily satisfy the criteria in SAC 4. An empirical investigation was then undertaken to ascertain whether selected user groups treat the <b>provision</b> for deferred <b>income</b> tax as a liability. The investigation surveyed investment houses, company secretaries, auditors and the parties to trust deeds. Evidence gathered suggest that investment houses and company secretaries treat the <b>provision</b> for deferred <b>income</b> tax all a liability. Auditors appear to regard the <b>provision</b> for <b>income</b> tax as a deferred credit; not a liability. No evidence was found that the parties to trust deeds treat the <b>provision</b> for deferred <b>income</b> tax In a systematic way. It is concluded that the parties to trust deeds do not consider the nature of the <b>provision</b> for deferred <b>income</b> tax when negotiating borrowing limitation ratio. It is hoped that the finding of this investigation will be highly relevant to any review of the standards on tax-effect accounting in Australia...|$|R

But introducing inequality motivates more productive agents to exert higher efforts and help the group to coordinate on equilibria with less free-riding. As a result, less able agents may benefit from initially disadvantageous inequality. Moreover, the more inequity averse the agents, the more inequality should be imposed even by an egalitarian social planner. public goods, inequality, inequity aversion, social welfare, voluntary <b>provision,</b> <b>income</b> distribution, heterogeneity...|$|R

Considerable attention has been drawn towards the loan loss provisioning practices of managers and how transparent the banking industry actually is. The Islamic banking industry represents a sector of the banking industry which is very dynamic and unique since {{it is based on the}} teachings of the Quran and Islamic laws (Shari’ah). A sample of 23 Islamic banks from 12 diverse countries was used to examine the use of loan loss provisions for capital management and income smoothing purposes by Islamic banks over the period 2006 - 2012. Investigations were also specifically conducted to determine their provisioning practice during the 2007 - 2009 global financial crisis. Interestingly, the results of the tests specifically conducted to test the provisioning practice of Islamic banks during the global financial crisis revealed that Islamic banks used loan loss <b>provisions</b> for <b>income</b> smoothing but not for capital management. In contrast, the general analysis conducted to examine their provisioning practice before, during and after the crisis provided strong evidence of the use of loan loss provisions for capital management by Islamic banks but not for income smoothing.

40|$|Developments in risk-transfer {{instruments}} and risk management techniques {{in the last}} two decades have fundamentally changed how banks manage their assets and liabilities. In this document we show that, for all three sectors of German universal banks (private commercial banks, savings banks, and cooperative banks), asset-liability dependency declined over the period 1994 - 2007, the decline was strongest for those banks that use more than sector-average amounts of derivatives. Only in the case of private commercial banks, we do find that lower regulatory capital has coincided with higher asset-liability dependencies. Over our sample period, the difference has diminished since poorly-capitalized private commercial banks have reduced their asset-liability dependencies more intensively than their well-capitalized counterparts. Moreover, we find that profitability matters for the asset-liability dependency but not in the same way for all three sectors. Asset-liability dependency is lower for private commercial banks with higher <b>provision</b> <b>income,</b> savings banks with lower ROE volatilities and cooperative banks with higher ROEs.

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-person Cournot game of voluntary contributions {{to a public}} good with identical individual preferences, and examine equilibrium aggregate welfare under a separable, symmetric and concave social welfare function. Assuming the public good is pure, Itaya, de Meza and Myles (Econ. Letters, 57 : 289 - 296; 1997) have shown that maximization of social welfare precludes income equality in this setting. We show that their case breaks down when the public good is impure: there exist individual preferences under which maximization of social welfare necessitates exact income equalization. Even if the public good is pure, any given, positive level of income inequality can {{be shown to be}} socially excessive by suitably specifying individual preferences. Thus, sans knowledge of individual preferences, one cannot reject the claim that a marginal redistribution from the rich to the poor will improve social welfare, regardless of how small inequality is in the status quo.

40|$|An {{essential}} {{ingredient in}} the evaluation of policies concerning health services is knowledge of the impact of health services and other factors on the health of the population. One method of obtaining this information is from the regression analysis of international cross-section data on mortality rates, health service <b>provision,</b> <b>income</b> levels, consumption patterns, and other variables hypothesised to affect population health. The investigation of the determinants of population health is in many ways akin to the estimation of production functions which describe the relationship between the output of goods or services and the mix of inputs used in their production. The purpose of our paper is to use this analogy to discuss, and provide examples of, the problems which arise with the statistical investigation of mortality rates. Issues raised include simultaneous equation bias, multicollinearity, selection of explanatory variables, omitted variable bias, definition and measurement of variables, functional forms, lagged relationships and temporal stability. These problems are illustrated by replication and re-analysis, using new data, of the well known study by Cochrane, St Leger and Moore. mortality regression analysis production function...|$|R
