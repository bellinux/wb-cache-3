The enteral route involves absorption of medication across enteric membranes which line the alimentary canal from the oral cavity, through the digestive tract, ending in the rectum. This route includes medications that are either swallowed, absorbed through the mucosa of the oral cavity, or inserted rectally. The <b>parenteral</b> <b>route</b> involves the administration of sedative drugs other than absorption across enteric membranes (outside of the alimentary canal). These methods include intravenous, inhalation, intramuscular, and submucosal administration, among others.|$|E

Hepatitis A {{can be transmitted}} by the <b>parenteral</b> <b>route,</b> but very rarely by blood and blood products. Food-borne outbreaks are not uncommon, and ingestion of shellfish cultivated in polluted water {{is associated with a}} high risk of infection.About 40% of all acute viral hepatitis is caused by HAV. [...] Infected individuals are infectious prior to onset of symptoms, roughly 10 days following infection. The virus is resistant to detergent, acid (pH 1), solvents (e.g., ether, chloroform), drying, and temperatures up to 60 °C. It can survive for months in fresh and salt water. Common-source (e.g., water, restaurant) outbreaks are typical. Infection is common in children in developing countries, reaching 100% incidence, but following infection, lifelong immunity results. HAV can be inactivated by chlorine treatment (drinking water), formalin (0.35%, 37 °C, 72 hours), peracetic acid (2%, 4 hours), beta-propiolactone (0.25%, 1 hour), and UV radiation (2 μW/cm2/min).|$|E

40|$|As {{the disease}} caused by Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} {{continues to be}} a burden, there is a concerted effort to find new vaccines to combat this problem. One of the important vaccine strategies is whole bacterial vaccines. This approach relies on multiple antigens and built-in adjuvanticity. Other mycobacterial strains which share cross-reactive antigens with M. tuberculosis have been considered as alternatives to M. bovis for vaccine use. One such strain, “Mycobacterium w”, had been evaluated for its immunomodulatory properties in leprosy. A vaccine against leprosy based on killed M. w is approved for human use, where it has resulted in clinical improvement, accelerated bacterial clearance, and increased immune responses to Mycobacterium leprae antigens. M. w shares antigens not only with M. leprae but also with M. tuberculosis, and initial studies have shown that vaccination with killed M. w induces protection against tuberculosis in Mycobacterium bovis BCG responder, as well as BCG nonresponder, strains of mice. Hence, we further studied the protective potential of M. w and the underlying immune responses in the mouse model of tuberculosis. We analyzed the protective efficacy of M. w immunization in both live and killed forms through the <b>parenteral</b> <b>route</b> and by aerosol immunization, compared with that of BCG. Our findings provide evidence that M. w has potential protective efficacy against M. tuberculosis. M. w activates macrophage activity, as well as lymphocytes.

40|$|Dissertação de mestrado em Biotecnologia Farmacêutica, apresentada à Faculdade de Farmácia da Universidade de CoimbraDiabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a chronic}} metabolic disorder with epidemic proportions which {{is characterized by}} chronic high blood glucose levels {{as a result of}} the inefficient insulin action. It is classified in different types, such as type 1 and type 2, and its development depends on several factors, such as lifestyle and genetic factors. For insulin-dependent diabetics the administration of insulin is the only available therapy. Insulin therapy, as other protein therapies, is challenging due to protein properties, such as susceptibility to physical and chemical degradation and short in vivo half-life, and, therefore its delivery has to be made by <b>parenteral</b> <b>route.</b> Since it began, insulin therapy has evolved trying to better mimic the physiological profile of insulin action in healthy individuals. As some limitations still compromise the efficiency of insulin therapy, encapsulation of insulin has been proposed in order to improve its long-term delivery by <b>parenteral</b> <b>route.</b> In the present thesis a brief review of the evolution of insulin therapy since its beginning will be made. It is intended to identify the main disadvantages of current insulin therapy. Also, the potential application of nanotechnology in insulin delivery will be addressed.

Other groups of rabbits were immunized with combinations of the Merck vaccine {{and each of}} the two toxoids. Antitoxin responses were monitored in each group of rabbits before livecell challenge of each animal by the ligated intestinal loop assay. Inaba and Ogawa strains of Vibrio cholerae were used for challenge experiments. Basically, the data indicate that the toxoids were equivalent in antigenic potency and antitoxin responses were unaffected by combination of the toxoids with the whole-cell vaccine. The 50 microgram doses of each toxoid as well as the 4 X 10 (9) cells of the bivalent vaccine provided the same magnitude of protection against live-cell challenge with either Inaba or Ogawa vibrios. Immunization with either toxoid in combination with the bivalent vaccine resulted in a synergistic protective response against live-cell challenge of intestinal loops with V. cholerae.
