40|$|Organic {{coatings}} play {{a prominent}} economical role for protection of steel against corrosion. The driving forces {{for the development}} and application of water based coatings for corrosion protection are the challenges of increasing environmental requirements and the compliance with legislative regulations. In terms of these requirements, anti-corrosive coatings, based on <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions,</b> e. g. acrylates and acrylate co-polymers, may offer best preconditions since they have further advantages concerning toxicity and work hygiene. Up to now <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> show intrinsic weaknesses in anti-corrosive behaviour. Especially in contrast to coatings, based on two-pack EP binders, coatings with <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> reveal low performance under salt spray conditions, according to corrosivity categories {{greater than or equal}} to C 3. One objective of this study is the search for the causes of these weaknesses, in order to find out principles or criteria for selecting <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> with a high anticorrosive potential for coatings. The other approach is to study specific contributions and synergies of fillers and anticorrosive pigments. Functional additives and their structure/property-relationships with <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> for significantly improving the barrier properties of coatings are studied as well. Derived from the frequently occurring failure modes, i. e. blistering and undercreepage due to cathodic delamination, another focus of this work is on the question, how to block the pathways for water, electrolytes and oxygen through the coating film and along the interface between coating film and steel surface, to improve the lateral barrier against cathodic delamination. This could be done via means of better modelling of the polymer to/on the steel surface topography. Also under consideration is the role of electrolytes, trapped as traces in polymer films, as an inherent weakness of <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions,</b> originating from the polymerization process. Within this work a screening with over ten different <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions,</b> based on styrene acrylates, formulated in three variants, is performed. The formulated coatings are applied to blasted steel surfaces. After standardized drying, the coated samples are tested with standard short-time corrosion tests, under salt spray and condensation-water atmosphere. The undercreepage on defined scribes, respectively the extent of blistering on the coating surface, were evaluated as a function of polymer dispersion type, pigmentation, anticorrosion pigment, film thickness, and single or two layer systems. Studies of water and electrolyte penetration through the polymer film to and along the interfaces between steel and organic coating with EIS, SKP and sorption kinetics measurements will give insights into the start, progress and extent of the corrosion process and are a measure for the estimation of the corrosion protection performance of the system. These results can help to identify the main factors of <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> influencing the anti-corrosion properties of coatings, and, in addition, important indications for paint producers and suppliers of <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> can be derived...|$|E
40|$|Dental caries, mainly {{caused by}} the {{adhesion}} of Streptococcus mutans to pellicle-coated tooth surfaces, is an important public health problem worldwide. A synthetic peptide (p 1025) corresponding to residues 1025 â€“ 1044 of the adhesin can inhibit this binding. Peptides are particularly susceptible to the biological environment; therefore, a p 1025 peptide-loaded liquid crystalline system (LCS) consisting of tea tree oil as the oil phase, polyoxypropylene-(5) -polyoxyethylene-(20) -cetyl alcohol as the surfactant, and water or 0. 5 % polycarbophil <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> as the aqueous phase was employed as a drug delivery platform. This system exhibited anticaries and bioadhesive properties and provided a protective environment to p 1025 {{at the site of}} action, thereby modulating its action, prolonging its contact with the teeth, and decreasing the frequency of administration. LCSs were characterized by polarized light microscopy (PLM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and rheological, texture, and bioadhesive tests. PLM and SAXS revealed the presence of hexagonal liquid crystalline phases and microemulsions. Rheological analyses demonstrated that the addition of <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> favored characteristics such as shear thinning and thixotropy, hence improving buccal application.

Especially electrosteric stabilization offers different possibilities to decorate latex particles. By variation of the polyelectrolyte block length {{it is possible to}} prepare either 'porcupine' or 'crew cut' particles. Statistical polyelectrolyte copolymers lead to particles decorated with 'ringlets'. The different kinds of stabilization result in different properties of <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions.</b> The colloidal stability against added electrolytes increases in the order electrostatic, steric, electrosteric if the latter is realized by polyelectrolyte chains forming a corona around the particle core which is extended {{more than half of the}} core radius ('porcupine particles'). 'Porcupine particles' show a qualitatively different rheological behaviour than electrostatically stabilized dispersions. In case of the latter it is possible to use the QUEMADA-equation to describe the zero shear viscosity dependence of the particle concentration. Statistical Copolymers consisting of charged and uncharged sequences are very effective stabilizers for emulsion polymerizations. However, the resulting <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> are very sensitive to added salt.

The polymers used were sodium alginate (SA), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (SCMC), and methylcellulose (MC). The results showed that SA, SCMC, and MC could induce flocculation of MAS by a polymer-bridging mechanism, leading to the changes in the zeta potential of MAS and the flow properties of the <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions.</b> The microscopic morphology and size of the flocculates was dependent on the molecular structure of the polymer, especially ether groups on the polymer side chain. The residual MAS from the flocculation could create a three-dimensional structure in the SAâ€“MAS and SCMCâ€“MAS dispersions, which brought about not only an enhancement of viscosity and thixotropic properties but also an improvement in the ACT flocculating efficiency of polymers. The use of polymerâ€“MAS dispersions provided a higher degree of flocculation and a lower redispersibility value of ACT suspensions compared with the pure <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions.</b> This led to a low tendency for caking of the suspensions. The SCMCâ€“MAS dispersions provided the highest ACT flocculating efficiency, whereas the lowest ACT flocculating efficiency was found in the MCâ€“MAS dispersions.

These findings suggest that the polymerâ€“MAS dispersions show good potential for use as a flocculating/suspending agent for improving the rheological properties and physical stability of the suspensions...|$|E
40|$|A {{large group}} of industrially {{important}} polymerization processes is carried out in dispersed systems. These processes differ {{with respect to their}} physical nature, mechanism of particle formation, particle morphology, size, charge, types of interparticle interactions, and many other aspects. <b>Polymer</b> <b>dispersions,</b> and polymers derived from polymerization in dispersed systems, are used in diverse areas such as paints, adhesives, microelectronics, medicine, cosmetics, biotechnology, and others. Frequently, the same names are used for different processes and products or different names are used for the same processes and products. The document contains a list of recommended terms and definitions necessary for the unambiguous description of processes, products, parameters, and characteristic features relevant to polymers in dispersed systems...|$|E
30|$|Information on the {{investigated}} {{treated articles}} and active substances {{is given in}} TablesÂ  1 and 2. The paints were all waterborne and either based on acrylates (paint A and C) or <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersions</b> (paint B). Paints A and B are the paints for wood, whereas paint C is a roof paint. Mixtures of active substances were added to commercially available paints by producers {{according to the requirements}} of this study. Therefore, liquid formulations were used although a number of modern paints now contain microencapsulated active substances. The textile was treated in an industrial procedure by the producer using an impregnation material that contains biocides. The contents of the active substances were confirmed by chemical analysis of the product.|$|E
50|$|In {{water-borne}} coatings, an aqueous <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{creates a}} {{film on the}} substrate once the solvent has evaporated. Surface functionalization of the polymer particles is {{a key component of}} a coating formulation allowing control over such properties as dispersion, film formation temperature, and the coating rheology. Dispersing aids often involve steric or electrostatic repulsion of the polymer particles, providing colloidal stability. The dispersing aids adsorb (as in a grafting onto scheme) onto latex particles giving them functionality. The association of other additives, such as thickeners shown in the schematic to the right, with adsorbed polymer material give rise to complex rheological behavior and excellent control over a coating's flow properties.|$|R
40|$|PEDOT {{nanowires}} {{of different}} size and morphology were successfully synthesized {{in aqueous solution}} via lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition (LPNE) {{in order to establish}} a direct relationship between the synthesis conditions and the properties. Optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are utilized to characterize the size, morphology and electrochemical properties of the resulting PEDOT nanowires. Optical microscopy and AFM show that the various electrodeposition parameters (deposition methods, deposition voltage, deposition time, template size, etc.) have a great impact on the materials properties of the prepared nanowires. EIS measurement demonstrates that those nanowires exhibit exceptional capacitive property compared to that of commercial capacitors and <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersion</b> capacitors...|$|R
40|$|Aromatic {{disulfide}} dynamic {{structures were}} incorporated as chain extenders in waterborne organic-inorganic polyurethane hybrids {{in order to}} provide autonomic healable characteristics. The synthesis was carried out following the acetone process methodology and the influence of the introduction of the healing agents in the <b>polymer</b> <b>dispersion</b> stability was analyzed. After the crosslinking process at room temperature, organic-inorganic hybrid films, which presented autonomic healing characteristics, were obtained. These features were evaluated by means of stress-strain tests and the films showed repetitive healing abilities. Thus, the optimum healing time at room temperature (25 Â°C) as well as the influence of different parameters in the healing efficiency, such the aromatic disulfide concentration or the physical properties of the polymer matrix were analyzed...|$|R
