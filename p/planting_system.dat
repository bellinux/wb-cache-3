5000|$|Many {{different}} methods to control nematodes {{have been tried}} over the years. Some have proven more successful and others have not. Some of these methods include nematicides, cover crops, crop rotation, genetically modified plants and seed treatments. In soybeans, Essex is a tolerant cultivar whereas Forrest is sensitive. Essex has a higher yield in fields that are infested with the nematode. The plots in this study by Koenning were treated with aldicarb, carbofuran, and fenamiphos and had less nematodes 40 days post planting then the areas that were not treated. The plots that were planted with Forrest which is the sensitive cultivar and treated with carbofuran had a higher yield than untreated control plots. Damage threshold levels have not been well established but using fumigated plots has shown significant increases in yield. [...] In Brazil, many crops are planted under the no tillage <b>planting</b> <b>system.</b> This typically causes of buildup of polyphagous species of nematodes like P. brachyurus. [...] If a no till system is being used, planting cover crops that would decrease {{the density of the}} nematodes may be needed. The problem with that is there is contradictory information regarding P. brachyurus and which plants are poor or good hosts. Due to this very same reason, farmers would {{have to be very careful}} in choosing a crop rotation schedule as well.

40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain {{production}} in the Central Highlands of Mexico occurs under rainfed conditions. Traditionally this crop has been planted by conventional means in solid stands combined with heavy tillage and lack of ground cover. These practices have been leading to soil erosion in the sloping lands, frequent drought stress, and water logging after occasional heavy rainstorms in the low lands. To ameliorate those constrains, farmers have started to replace the traditional <b>planting</b> <b>system</b> by the <b>planting</b> <b>system</b> on narrow raised beds. However, information on N management and varieties is needed. This 5 -yr study was conducted from 1999 to 2003 to test a set of eight wheat genotypes using a raised-bed system to evaluate their performance as affected by N fertilizer management. Three N rates (40, 70 and 100 kg N ha − 1) were applied at planting, {{at the end of}} tillering-early jointing, and split at planting {{and at the end of}} tillering-early jointing. Treatments included an unfertilized check plot. Results indicated that the optimum N fertilizer rate for wheat grain production varies from 0 to 40 kg N ha − 1) depending upon the variety. Nitrogen timing practices had no effect on grain yield but on N use efficiency (NUE). The split application of 40 kg N ha − 1 increased the NUE. Higher N rates reduced the NUE irrespective of the N timing practice. According to the differential performance among varieties, this study showed that the <b>planting</b> <b>system</b> on narrow raised beds is a variety-specific technology.

All the companies are in the early stage of the trial and, therefore, the focus of investigation is limited to trial preparation and timber harvesting {{with the aim of}} describing the real practices and various problems faced in the field. It is found that the productivity of each activity in preparation and timber harvesting in the Indonesian Strip Curing and <b>Planting</b> <b>System</b> (A) is lower than those in the Indonesian Selective Cutting and <b>Planting</b> <b>System</b> (B). The comparison of several productivities are as follows : (I) Felling: 47 cu. m/day forA and 85 cu. m/day for B: (2) Skidding : 37 cu. m/day for A and 85 cu. m/day for B; (3) Loading-unloading : 55 cu. m/day for A and 150 cu. m/day for B; (4) Hauling :. 50 cu. m/trip forA and 64 cu. m/trip for B.
