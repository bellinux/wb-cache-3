Fracture mechanics models of cracks in unidirectional laminates, embedded <b>plies</b> and outer <b>plies</b> are developed to determine the onset and direction of propagation for unstable crack growth.

It {{is necessary to}} understand the influence of assembled <b>plies</b> on deformation and energy absorption before using textile composite cellular structures in engineering design. In this paper, effects of <b>ply</b> assembly, outer <b>ply</b> material, outer <b>ply</b> thickness, and loading area on energy absorption and deformation of the applied structure including cellular structure and face sheet <b>plies</b> are investigated. Three-dimensional finite element analyses are carried out employing orthotropic mechanical properties of the applied materials, textile composite, wood, E-glass, aluminium alloy 2024 -T 3 and unidirectional fiber-epoxy composite T- 300. The predicted results show that deformation and distributed strain energy density of both outer and inner surfaces of the applied structure are significantly affected by <b>ply</b> assembly, outer <b>ply</b> material, outer <b>ply</b> thickness, and loading area...|$|R

Sometimes, the yarns being <b>plied</b> are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé.

5000|$|In {{the textile}} arts, plying {{is a process}} {{used to create a}} strong, {{balanced}} yarn. It is done by taking two or more strands of yarn that each have a twist to them and putting them together. The strands are twisted together, in the direction opposite that in which they were spun. When {{just the right amount of}} twist is added, this creates a balanced yarn, one which has no tendency to twist upon itself. Almost all store-bought yarns are balanced, plied yarns.

50|$|Nail {{clippers}} {{are usually}} made {{of stainless steel}} but can also be made of plastic and aluminium. Two common varieties are the <b>plier</b> type and the compound lever type. Most nail clippers usually come with another tool attached, {{which is used to}} clean dirt out from under nails. A nail clipper often has a miniature file fixed to it to allow rough edges of nails to be manicured. A nail file allows for removal of any excess nail that is jagged or has been missed. Nail clippers occasionally come with a pocket knife or a nail catcher; the multi-purpose nail clipper was invented by Hungarian inventor David Gestetner. The nail clipper consists of a head which may be concave or convex. Specialized nail clippers which have convex clipping ends are intended for trimming toenails, while concave clipping ends are for fingernails. The cutting head may be manufactured to be parallel or perpendicular to the principal axis of the cutter. Cutting heads which are parallel to the principal axis are made to address accessibility issues involved with cutting toenails.|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is {{a leading}} cause of human {{diseases}} such as pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and otitis media. Pneumolysin (<b>Ply)</b> is an important virulence factor of S. pneumoniae and a promising future vaccine target. However, the expansion of clones carrying <b>ply</b> alleles with reduced hemolytic activity has been observed in serotypes associated with outbreaks of invasive disease and includes an allele identified in a highly virulent serotype 1 isolate (<b>ply</b> 4496). The virulence of Ply-deficient and <b>ply</b> allelic-replacement derivatives of S. pneumoniae D 39 was compared with that of wild-type D 39. In addition, the protective immunogenicity of <b>Ply</b> against pneumococci with low versus high hemolytic activity was also investigated. Replacement of D 39 <b>ply</b> with <b>ply</b> 4496 resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction of virulence. However, both native Ply- and <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing strains were significantly more virulent than a Ply-deficient mutant. While the numbers of both Ply- and <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing isolate cells were higher in the blood than the numbers of Ply-deficient mutant cells, the growth of the <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing strain was superior to that of the wild type in the first 15 h postchallenge. <b>Ply</b> immunization provided protection regardless of the hemolytic activity of the challenge strain. In summary, we show that low-hemolytic-activity <b>Ply</b> alleles contribute to systemic virulence and may provide a survival advantage in the blood. Moreover, pneumococci expressing such alleles remain vulnerable to Ply-based vaccines. Richard M. Harvey, Abiodun D. Ogunniyi, Austen Y. Chen, and James C. Pato...|$|R
