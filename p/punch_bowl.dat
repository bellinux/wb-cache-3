5|$|On 17 November 1901, Illinois was {{presented}} with a silver service dining set provided {{by the state of}} Illinois and presented by Senator William E. Mason. It consisted of a large and small <b>punch</b> <b>bowl,</b> two candelabra, an ornamented fruit dish, a small fruit dish, two epicurean dishes, a large centerpiece and a ladle. Each item featured engravings of the crest of Illinois and an ear of corn. In 1943, the silver service was transferred to the Illinois Executive Mansion.|$|E

25|$|Hogarth {{included}} numerous {{elements in}} the painting. The scene is probably the great cabin of Graham's latest command, and the sails of ships are visible through the line of windows on {{the left of the}} painting. The furniture and objects are luxurious and the room is richly panelled and decorated. The chaplain holds a ledger and at his feet is a large famille-rose <b>punch</b> <b>bowl,</b> the <b>punch</b> <b>bowl</b> being an invitation to the viewer to join the levity at the table. He is separated from Graham across the table by a salt-cellar, possibly symbolising their social difference. His presence at the captain's table for this informal occasion nevertheless indicates that he is a privileged member of Graham's entourage.|$|E
25|$|The {{village is}} served by the A287, between Hook and Haslemere, and the A333, a stretch of the former A3 that links the village south to the new bypass. The section of the old A3 north of Hindhead and {{alongside}} the Devil's <b>Punch</b> <b>Bowl</b> has been returned to tree-interspersed heathland.|$|E
25|$|Known as Sewell's Point at the time, an 1821 {{map shows}} the Great Dam, Brighton Road (Brighton Ave and Commonwealth Ave), and <b>Punch</b> <b>Bowl</b> Road (now Brookline Ave) {{intersecting}} at Kenmore {{which was now}} connected to the mainland to the west, {{in addition to the}} southern connection shown in 1777.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 17th century, {{changing}} taste led to {{the replacement}} of apothecary pots, paving tiles and large dishes by polite tablewares, delicate ornaments, <b>punch</b> <b>bowls,</b> teapots, cocoa pots and coffee-pots.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 17th {{changing}} taste led to {{the replacement}} of apothecary pots, tiles and large dishes by polite tablewares, delicate ornaments, <b>punch</b> <b>bowls,</b> teapots, cocoa pots and coffee-pots. The decoration became lighter and more informal. Changing taste was also reflected in chinoiserie decoration and greater use of a polychrome palette.|$|R
25|$|Punch {{is a wide}} {{assortment}} of drinks, both non-alcoholic and alcoholic, generally containing fruit or fruit juice. The drink was introduced from India to the United Kingdom in the early seventeenth century, and from there its use spread to other countries. Punch is typically served at parties in large, wide <b>bowls,</b> known as <b>punch</b> <b>bowls.</b>|$|R
25|$|Significant landscapes in Surrey include Box Hill {{just north}} of Dorking; the Devil's <b>Punch</b> <b>Bowl</b> at Hindhead and Frensham Common. Leith Hill south west of Dorking in the Greensand Ridge is the second highest point in {{south-east}} England. Witley Common and Thursley Common are expansive areas of ancient heathland south of Godalming run by the National Trust and Ministry of Defence. The Surrey Hills are an area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB).|$|E
25|$|Baring-Gould wrote many novels, {{including}} The Broom-Squire {{set in the}} Devil's <b>Punch</b> <b>Bowl</b> (1896), Mehalah and Guavas, the Tinner (1897), {{a collection}} of ghost stories, a 16-volume The Lives of the Saints, and the biography of the eccentric poet-vicar of Morwenstow, Robert Stephen Hawker. His folkloric studies resulted in The Book of Were-Wolves (1865), {{one of the most}} frequently cited studies of lycanthropy. He habitually wrote while standing, and his desk {{can be seen in the}} manor.|$|E
25|$|The Red Lion in Whitehall {{is close}} to the Palace of Westminster and is {{consequently}} used by political journalists and Members of Parliament. The pub is equipped with a Division bell that summons MPs back to the chamber when they are required {{to take part in a}} vote. The <b>Punch</b> <b>Bowl,</b> Mayfair was at one time jointly owned by Madonna and Guy Ritchie. The Coleherne public house in Earls Court was a well-known gay pub from the 1950s. It attracted many well-known patrons, such as Freddie Mercury, Kenny Everett and Rudolph Nureyev. It was used by the serial-killer Colin Ireland to pick up victims.|$|E
50|$|When {{the results}} of the {{election}} were announced, a mob entered the White House, damaging the furniture and lights. Adams escaped through the back and large <b>punch</b> <b>bowls</b> were set up to lure the crowd outside. Conservatives were horrified at this event, and held it up as a portent of terrible things to come from the first Democratic president.|$|R
50|$|Queen′s Canyon is a {{moderate}} hiking trail which crosses Glen Eyrie private property {{on the west}} side of Colorado Springs, near the North entrance to Garden of the Gods park. The trail is known for Dawson Falls and five granite pools filled with mountain water, known collectively as the <b>punch</b> <b>bowls.</b> The first half of this trail is a wood-planked path that hugs walls of the gorge.|$|R
50|$|A bowl is a round, open-top {{container}} used in {{many cultures}} to serve hot and cold food. Bowls are also used for drinking, {{as in the case}} of caffè latte. Bowls used for storing non-food items range from small bowls used for holding tips at a coffee shop to large bowls used for storing DVDs or CDs. Bowls are typically small and shallow, {{as in the case of}} bowls used for single servings of soup or cereal. Some <b>bowls,</b> such as <b>punch</b> <b>bowls,</b> serving bowls, fruit bowls and salad bowls are larger and often intended to serve many people.|$|R
25|$|After passing Claygate, the motorway-standard section has {{junctions}} {{with the}} A244 between Esher and Oxshott, then the A245 between Cobham and Hersham. The road's Wisley Interchange with the M25 enables a flyover still with a 70mph (112km/h) speed limit. It bypasses Wisley, Ockham, Ripley (and Burpham {{which is a}} suburb of Guildford) before cutting through the major town itself as a dual carriageway and changing to a 50mph (80km/h) speed limit. It returns to 70mph (112km/h) at the A31 and A246 junction before bypassing Godalming and Milford. It continues through a tunnel at Hindhead (constructed in 2011 to improve capacity and bypass the Devil's <b>Punch</b> <b>Bowl)</b> before leaving Surrey.|$|E
25|$|This {{area was}} notorious for highwaymen. In 1736, Stephen Phillips, a robber tried and convicted at the Old Bailey, {{admitted}} to the Newgate chaplain to having stolen 150 guineas in gold on the road towards London. In 1786, three men were convicted {{of the murder of}} an unknown sailor on his way from London to rejoin his ship, a deed commemorated by several memorials in the area. The perpetrators were hung in chains to warn others on Gibbet Hill, a short walk away on top of the Devil's <b>Punch</b> <b>Bowl.</b> With an increase in traffic and opening of the London to Portsmouth railway line removing much of the road transport of freight, such incidents reduced during the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unknown}} whether {{the idea for}} the setting came from Graham or Hogarth, though Hogarth had already {{produced}} a similarly composed conversational piece for John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, entitled Lord Hervey and His Friends. Hogarth reworked the concept for a naval setting, though he probably also drew inspiration from a 1732 painting by Bartolomeo Nazari. Nazari produced a similar cabin scene showing Lord Boyne and his companions during a voyage to Lisbon from Venice. A number of elements, such as the hanging compass, <b>punch</b> <b>bowl,</b> and the presence of animals, were included in Hogarth's work. Nazari's work had been popular, resulting in a large number of copies, and Hogarth knew Boyne, having painted his portrait.|$|E
50|$|The punch, which {{contains}} rum, cognac, and peach brandy, is potent, {{so it is}} normally diluted with cold black tea, a common mixer for this particular punch, or with seltzer water. Some <b>punch</b> <b>bowls</b> may not {{be large enough to}} accommodate the large ice block called for, and though the block is a classic part of this recipe, it can, of course, be simply served in a pitcher over ice cubes.|$|R
5000|$|A popular {{use of the}} tea is in cocktails {{where the}} {{showmanship}} of the cocktail making incorporates the instantaneous color change {{in front of the}} patron that ordered the drink. Other uses included cocktails or <b>punch</b> <b>bowls</b> where the tea is frozen into ice cubes, causing the drink to change color as the ice cube dissolves leading to what has been labeled as a [...] "mood ring cocktail".|$|R
50|$|Stephen Wäkevä, Russian {{silversmith}} of Finnish origin, Fabergé workmaster. Born in Säkkijärvi in the Viipuri Province of the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1833, apprentice in St. Petersburg in 1847. His workshop supplied Fabergé with silverware, mostly tea-services, tankards and <b>punch</b> <b>bowls.</b> His hallmark was {{the letters}} S.W in a circle. His two sons (Alexander Wäkevä and Konstantin Wäkevä) {{also worked for}} Fabergé, taking over his father's workshop at his death in 1910.|$|R
500|$|The {{nautical}} {{theme is}} {{continued in the}} silver-gilt Wine Cistern, {{also known as the}} Grand <b>Punch</b> <b>Bowl,</b> which is cast as a giant oyster shell. It weighs , is [...] tall, [...] long and [...] wide, and can hold 144 bottles of wine on ice. It was made in 1829 for GeorgeIV but completed after his death. Weighing almost a quarter of a ton, it is the heaviest surviving piece of English banqueting plate. In 1841, the cistern was re-purposed as a <b>punch</b> <b>bowl</b> by Queen Victoria, {{with the addition of a}} ladle. The ivory-stemmed ladle is [...] long and has a silver-gilt bowl in the form of a nautilus shell.|$|E
500|$|As the McKinley High junior prom approaches, Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) are front-runners to be crowned prom {{king and}} queen. Contender Noah [...] "Puck" [...] Puckerman (Mark Salling) learns that his {{relationship}} with Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) has damaged his bad boy reputation, and resolves to restore it by spiking the prom <b>punch</b> <b>bowl.</b> Meanwhile, Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) intensify their election efforts with their anti-bullying group, the Bully Whips.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, Stanley {{purchased}} what {{is frequently}} {{described as a}} decorative <b>punch</b> <b>bowl,</b> but which silver expert John Culme identified as a rose bowl, made in Sheffield, England, and sold by London silversmith G. R. Collis and Company (now Boodle and Dunthorne Jewellers), for ten guineas, equal to ten and a half pounds sterling, US$48.67, which is equal to $ in [...] dollars. He had the words [...] "Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup" [...] engraved {{on one side of}} the outside rim, and [...] "From Stanley of Preston" [...] on the other side.|$|E
50|$|The {{silver plate}} itself - in reality {{more of a}} bowl than a plate - is now {{displayed}} in the Baltimore Museum of Art, and {{was made by the}} Annapolis silversmith John Inch (1721-1763). <b>Punch</b> <b>bowls</b> were popular as racing trophies in the 18th century. It is the oldest surviving silver object made in the state of Maryland, the oldest horseracing trophy in North America and the second oldest trophy of any kind on the continent.|$|R
50|$|Hilario Alejos Madrigal is a Mexican potter from a {{small town}} in the state of Michoacán, known for his “pineapple” ceramic wares. The name comes from the {{original}} form created by his mother, potter Elisa Madrigal Martinez, who created <b>punch</b> <b>bowls</b> in the shape of pineapples. Alejos Madriga’s variations include bowls, candelabras and more, with the version done in a green glaze be best known. Alejos Madrigal has won awards for his work, which is featured on the cover of large reference book Grandes Maestros del Arte Popular Mexicano by Fomento Cultural Banamex.|$|R
25|$|In Santa Fe de la Laguna, {{a number}} of potters make glazed ware in popular shapes with black or green glaze {{covering}} most of the piece and the rest in average quality transparent glaze. Black glazed is generally used on large pieces such as water or fruit <b>punch</b> <b>bowls</b> with lids and decorated with raised leaves or roses. Many of these are made by Matias Jerónimo. Carmen Gaspar makes tableware with designs of animals or fish in white slip under green glaze. There has also been experimentation with new glaze colors, such as blue and mauve.|$|R
500|$|Adam Eckfeldt had a {{taste for}} {{horticulture}} and owned rural property in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, which was inherited by his two sons after his death. He was {{the first president of}} the Good Will Fire Company, holding that office for nearly all of his adult life, and designed a system of levers for use in fire engines. A member of Concordia Lodge No. 67 of the Masonic Order from 1795 to 1806, he served as lodge master in 1803; a Chinese export porcelain <b>punch</b> <b>bowl</b> with his name and Masonic symbols survives in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. A biographical sketch of Eckfeldt, published in 1897, describes him: ...|$|E
500|$|The college's {{collection}} of silverware includes a silver-gilt <b>punch</b> <b>bowl,</b> presented by Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn in 1732. The bowl, which weighs more than [...] and holds , was used {{at a dinner}} held in the Radcliffe Camera in 1814, to celebrate {{what was supposed to}} be the final defeat of Napoleon. Those present at the dinner included the Tsar, the King of Prussia, Blücher, Metternich, the Prince Regent, the Duke of York and the Duke of Wellington. There is a college tradition that the bowl will be presented to anyone who can meet two challenges. The first is to put arms around the bowl at its widest point; the second is to drain the bowl of strong punch. The bowl measures [...] at its widest point, and so the first challenge has only been accomplished rarely; the second challenge has not been met.|$|E
500|$|Panum Crater is {{the northernmost}} volcano in the {{sequence}} and {{is a good example}} of both a tuff ring and a rhyolite dome. Its structure is twofold; an outer tuff ring (forming a classic crater) and an inner plug, or dome of rhyolite, pumice and obsidian created from lavas. In this case, heat from the magma feeding Panum flashed groundwater to steam to create the tuff ring before lava reached the surface. Other Mono Craters also were formed in this manner, but their plug domes grew larger than their tuff ring craters. The domes have steep sides and are flanked by slopes of scree consisting of large angular and glass-rich rocks. Devil's <b>Punch</b> <b>Bowl,</b> located south of the main dome complex, stopped forming at an earlier stage of development. It is a [...] wide and [...] deep explosion pit with a much smaller glass dome on its floor.|$|E
5000|$|At first Alejos Madrigal made {{utilitarian}} items, {{but when}} he became interested in participating in competitions, he began to adapt his mother’s pineapple motifs. He became known for green glazed “pineapple” wares, designed to be pots, <b>punch</b> <b>bowls,</b> candelabras and other wares. In addition to green, he also makes pieces in yellow and blue, all requiring skill and dexterity to create their detailed decorations. The best known types of pineapple pieces are those called biznaga (barrel cactus) and conchita (small shell). The former is {{like a cross between}} a cactus and a pineapple and the latter is named from the tiny shell-shaped pieces of the pineapple “skin.” ...|$|R
5000|$|American glass {{factories}} {{were founded}} first in New York in 1732 {{and then in}} South Jersey by Caspar Wistar in 1739. The 1730s saw an increasing variety of products. Boston merchants advertised wine glasses, jelly glasses, syllabubs, decanters, sugar pots, barrel cans, <b>punch</b> <b>bowls,</b> bird fountains, and candlesticks. Merchants also offered japanned glassware. [...] "For those who did buy taste in the newest styles, drinking glasses were the inverted baluster type (popular in England from 1720 to about 1735) or the later drawn stem glass (1730-1745)." [...] Both types {{have been found in}} Virginia. Wealth and fashion did not dictate an elaborate collection of glass, for the Reverend Ebenezer Thayer who died in nearby Roxbury {{less than a year later}} had £137 worth of silver. But his only glass was some salts in the parlor.|$|R
50|$|After going undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft Claiborne {{signed with}} the St. Louis Rams of the NFL.
