50|$|Until {{the opening}} of the Gotthard Road Tunnel in 1980, the Swiss Federal Railways offered {{piggyback}} services for cars and trucks through the Gotthard Tunnel. Today, that service exists as the rolling highway from the German to the Italian border and aims to reduce truck traffic on Swiss expressways. An improvisational <b>piggyback</b> <b>service</b> from Göschenen to Airolo was offered during the two-month closure of the Gotthard Road Tunnel in 2001.|$|E
5000|$|In 1952, the CPR {{became the}} first North American railway to {{introduce}} intermodal or [...] "piggyback" [...] freight service, where truck trailersare carried on flat cars. Containers later replaced most <b>piggyback</b> <b>service.</b> In 1996, the CPR introduced a scheduled reservation-only short-haul intermodal service between Montreal and West Toronto called the Iron Highway; it utilized unique equipment that was later replaced (1999) by conventional piggyback flatcars and renamed Expressway. This service was extended to Detroit with plans to reach Chicago however CP was unable to locate a suitable terminal.|$|E

50|$|While {{the modern-day}} Crab Orchard & Egyptian Railroad has been {{operating}} common carrier services across Williamson County since the 1970s, the 1980s did see {{a big difference in}} the way things were done with the railroad. Intermodal <b>piggyback</b> <b>service</b> started winding down in 1982 and was eventually phased out four years later due to deregulation within the railroad industry. The CO&E's entire roster of freight cars were also sold off early in the decade with the growing popularity of independently and privately owned freight car shippers, many of such were sold to other shortlines for leasing purposes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, Hurricane Agnes {{destroyed}} {{many miles}} of track and related assets, especially in southwestern New York State. The main line between Hornell and Binghamton was abandoned as {{not worth the}} high cost of rebuilding it. The cost of what repairs were done, and the loss of revenue, forced the company into bankruptcy, filing for reorganization under Section 77 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on June 26. [...] The completion of the Interstate 80 highway across Pennsylvania and New Jersey by 1971 added to the Erie Lackawanna's financial problems, as it diverted piggyback traffic previously garnered from less than truckload shipping companies such as Navajo and Cooper-Jarrett. On the flip-side, EL was able to land large contracts with UPS because of its ability to move piggyback traffic between Chicago and Metro New York more reliably, although not faster than Penn Central (and formerly, New York Central). For example, in 1971, the Penn Central advertised a 24 and 1/2 hour <b>piggyback</b> <b>service</b> from Metro New York to Metro Chicago in the Official Guide of the Railways, while the EL's Employees Timetable Number 3, New York Division, showed its fastest comparable schedule to be 28 hours and 45 minutes. By 1973, the Penn Central's fastest <b>piggyback</b> <b>service</b> between these points was shown in the Official Guide to be 26 hours and 15 minutes, while the EL's Employees Timetable Number 4 showed that the EL's fastest comparable schedule was 29 and 1/2 hours.|$|E
50|$|By 1980, {{though still}} a sick company, the B&M started turning around thanks to {{aggressive}} marketing and its {{purchase of a}} cluster of branch lines in Connecticut. The addition of coal traffic and <b>piggyback</b> <b>service</b> also helped. In 1983 the B&M emerged from bankruptcy when it was purchased by Timothy Mellon's Guilford Transportation Industries for $24 million. This {{was the beginning of}} the end of the Boston & Maine corporate image, and the start of major changes, such as the labor issues which caused the strikes of 1986 and 1987, and drastic cost cutting such as the 1990 closure of B&M's Mechanicville, New York, site, the largest rail yard and shop facilities on the B&M system.|$|E

50|$|At {{one time}} there were {{actually}} 3 different Companies (the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, Port Townsend and Western, and the Port Angeles and Western) controlling the lines which ran from west of Sekiu, Washington. and west of Lake Crescent east to Port Townsend with a spur that went south toward the Hood Canal. The consolidated Peninsula Line {{was part of the}} Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific RR (MILW), which at one time was the longest electrified railroad in the world (the Peninsula portion was not electrified). A long bankruptcy and abandonment process for the Milwaukee created service and maintenance issue throughout the system. Seattle based private entrepreneurs purchased this section of railroad from the Milwaukee's bankruptcy court. As the new carrier started, an extended period of weak markets for the pulp, paper, plywood and lumber markets, produced on the Peninsula, seriously weakened the enterprise. New efforts to improve the rail freight loadings were met with stiff competition from a barge-to-rail service (Puget Sound Freight Lines) and <b>Piggyback</b> <b>services</b> to the main-line rail carriers (Union Pacific and Burlington Northern) proved overwhelming to the highly leveraged new company. Steadily increasing maintenance costs, after years of neglect by the prior operator, finally caused a complete service shutdown followed by abandonment in 1984. The rails, ties and equipment were removed in 1987. Many adjoining property owners and public land holding agencies sought a legal end to the right-of-ways on the majority of the Line. This also included Pier 2 in Seattle's Elliott Bay, key to the Port of Seattle's expansion plan.|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-1930s, the Chicago Great Western Railway {{and then}} the New Haven Railroad began [...] "piggyback" [...] service (transporting highway freight {{trailers}} on flatcars) limited to their own railroads. [...] The Chicago Great Western Railway filed a US federal patent in 1938 on their method of securing each trailer to a flatcar using chains and turnbuckles. [...] Other components included wheel chocks and ramps for loading and unloading the trailers from the flatcars. [...] By 1953, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois, and the Southern Pacific railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of <b>piggyback</b> trailer <b>service.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All was not {{necessarily}} lost after this incident when only four months later, the Illinois Central Gulf sold the CO&E Railroad its trackage and property altogether after they discontinued freight service along the entire route. With this new advantage in hand, the railroad's first common carrier freight services would commence soon afterwards and the first revenue train was pulled behind 2-4-2 #5 on [...] These changes in operation immediately took off successfully as freight customers started growing rapidly with CO&E's new locally owned and operated service. <b>Piggyback</b> <b>service</b> was also eventually added in [...] when a large fleet of more than 200 new flatcars and 600 highway trailers painted for the CO&E Railroad were delivered. A new engine was acquired {{at the same time}} to help switch cars around when a small Davenport 35-Ton switcher arrived on the property in 1978. Not long afterwards, the first test run of the 2-8-0 steamer finally occurred on [...] after an extensive four-year overhaul and quickly became the primary power of choice by July.|$|E

Containers later replaced most <b>piggyback</b> <b>service.</b> Beginning in the 1960s, the railroad started to discontinue much of its passenger service (particularly on its branch lines). Passenger service ended on its line through southern British Columbia and Crow's Nest Pass in January 1964. The Dominion was dropped in January 1966. On October 29, 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to Via Rail, a new federal Crown corporation now responsible for intercity passenger services in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presided over major cuts in Via Rail service on January 15, 1990. This ended service by the Canadian over CPR rails, and the train was rerouted on the former Super Continental route via Canadian National without a change in name. Where both trains had been daily prior to the January 15, 1990 cuts, thesurviving Canadian was (and is) a thrice-weekly operation.The CPR was in a powerful position during the First World War.Canadian Pacific Railway currently operates three commuter services under contract. The West Coast Express comprises ten daily trains running into downtown Vancouver on behalf of TransLink, a regional transit authority. CNCP was created as {{a joint venture between}} Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway in 1967, replacing the different networks used by the two companies. CN Telegraph interchanged traffic with the Postal Telegraph Cable Company in the US, while CPR Telegraphs networked with Western Union. The two networks—former rivals—had been cooperating increasingly since the 1930s. By 1980, CNCP was no longer a telegraph company and emerged as an early telecom company. A 40 percent stake was acquired by Rogers Communications in 1984, and CP acquired CN's stake. The network was dissolved in 1988, and Rogers renamed the company Unitel Communications Incorporated in 1989.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A {{comparison}} of alternative pharmacy fee systems {{in a community}} hospital was studied. A retrospective analysis of FY 80 financial reports for an 83 bed community hospital was used. This data base {{was used to determine}} the economic impact of various pharmacy charging systems in a typical community hospital and to ascertain if any relationship exists between charges and work standards at the study hospital. Pharmacy revenue under the traditional and flat per diem fee system generated considerable revenue, but the revenue did not reflect a relationship to the work standards used in the study hospital. Pharmacy in-patient service units (primarily products) were underpriced while I. V. <b>piggyback</b> <b>service</b> units were overpriced in relationship to suggested revenue by work standards. This analysis reaffirms the criticism that pharmacy fees do not reflect work standards and are in need of change.
