5|$|<b>Poisoned</b> <b>bait</b> is {{a common}} method for {{controlling}} rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food attractant for the target species and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets.|$|E
500|$|Many {{remedies}} {{have been}} tried {{in the search for}} control of the major pest species of cockroaches, which are resilient and fast-breeding. Household chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) have been suggested, without evidence for their effectiveness. Garden herbs including [...] bay, catnip, mint, cucumber, and garlic have been proposed as repellents. <b>Poisoned</b> <b>bait</b> containing hydramethylnon or fipronil, and boric acid powder is effective on adults. Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. Alternatively, insecticides containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective. In Singapore and Malaysia, taxi drivers use pandan leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The coyote {{is roughly}} the North American {{equivalent}} to the Old World golden jackal. Likewise, the coyote is highly versatile in its choice of food, but is primarily carnivorous, with 90% of its diet consisting of meat. Prey species include bison, deer, sheep, rabbits, rodents, birds, amphibians (except toads), lizards, snakes, fish, crustaceans, and insects. Coyotes may be picky over the prey they target, as animals such as shrews, moles, and brown rats do not occur in their diet in proportion to their numbers. More unusual prey include fishers, young black bear cubs, harp seals and rattlesnakes. Coyotes kill rattlesnakes mostly for food (but also to protect their pups at their dens) by teasing the snakes until they stretch out and then biting their heads and snapping and shaking the snakes. In Death Valley, coyotes may consume great quantities of hawkmoth caterpillars or beetles in the spring flowering months. Although coyotes prefer fresh meat, they will scavenge when the opportunity presents itself. Excluding the insects, fruit, and grass eaten, the coyote requires an estimated [...] of food daily, or [...] annually. The coyote readily cannibalizes the carcasses of conspecifics, with coyote fat having been successfully used by coyote hunters as a lure or <b>poisoned</b> <b>bait.</b> The coyote's winter diet consists mainly of large ungulate carcasses, with very little plant matter. Rodent prey increases in importance during the spring, summer, and fall.|$|E

50|$|Feral cats {{have proven}} more {{difficult}} to completely remove from islands. Of the 48 islands feral cats have been completely removed from in the past half century, only 10 have been on islands larger than 10km2. Similar to goat eradications, the most effective cat eradication technique is to combine several approaches including hunting, live trapping, <b>poisoned</b> <b>bait</b> stations, and even releasing feline viruses amongst cat populations. On smaller islands, cat eradication is more straightforward, but it can prove extremely difficult on larger islands with human populations. Due to {{the high level of}} interaction between humans and feral cats on these islands, <b>poisoned</b> <b>bait</b> stations and feline viruses have to be used sparingly or not at all.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Damage by Belding's ground {{squirrel}} (Spermophilus beldingi) to alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and the efficacies of various poisoning regimes to reduce damage were evaluated during March-July, 1976 and 1977. Regimes examined {{were designed to}} measure the effect of 3 variables on damage to alfalfa caused by squirrels including; timing of application, in early or late spring; the number of applications, 1 or 2; and {{the inclusion of a}} border strip around the field on which <b>poison</b> <b>baits</b> are also applied. Neither single nor multiple applications of <b>poisoned</b> <b>baits</b> resulted in significant (P > 0. 1) control of {{ground squirrel}} damage to alfalfa in 1976. However, significant (P < 0. 05) reductions of damage were obtained in 1977 with multiple applications and when both the field and a 60 m wide border were treated with <b>poisoned</b> <b>baits.</b> Belding’s ground squirrels caused an average of 46 percent loss of the first harvest of alfalfa in untreated fields. Maximum application of <b>poisoned</b> <b>baits</b> reduced this loss to an average loss of 25 percent. Control of ground squirrel damage achieved between different fields and treatments was highly variable, and was directly related to the number of times poison was applied and whether or not a border strip was treated...|$|R
