Moreover, we evaluate the impact of Parker's rating and whether this quality information is revealed. Other variables of interest are wine age, brands, regional origin, and the 1855 classification. We estimate a main model and two subsets (with <b>page</b> <b>counter,</b> initial bid equal 1). Our hedonic estimation of the full sample reveals that relative to Sundays, wine auctions ending on Fridays resulted in significantly higher prices (about 9 %). Thus, we cannot confirm a weekend effect. Time of day effects are insignificant relative to the base period (21 h- 22 h CET), except when auctions end in the morning (8 h- 12 h CET) or late evening (22 h- 23 CET) and prices are 11 % lower. We observe a small auction length effect (+ 2 %). Seller reputation showed no {{significant impact on the}} final auction price except when the initial bid is 1. The number of bids showed a significant but small impact on final prices (+ 1. 7 %). The private auction effect (hidden bidder identity) is also significant at 5 %. Moreover, Parker points carry an elasticity of 3. 6 and disclosing them in the auction (information disclosure effect) results in a premium of 12 %. Château (brand) effects are highly significant ranging up to 150 % (Châteaux Pétrus and Margaux). Appellation premiums may exceed 90 % (Pomerol). 1855 classifications are significant and in correct order except for Quatrièmes Crus.

JC eventually meets with Illuminati leader Morgan Everett and learns that the Gray Death virus was intended to be used for augmentation technology, but Majestic 12, led by trillionaire businessman and former Illuminatus Bob Page, was able to steal and repurpose it into its current viral form. Everett recognizes that without VersaLife's universal constructor, Majestic 12 can no longer create the virus, and will likely target Vandenberg Air Force Base, where X-51, a group of former Area 51 scientists, have built another one. After aiding the base personnel in repelling a Majestic 12 attack, JC meets X-51 leader Gary Savage, who reveals that Daedalus is an artificial intelligence (AI) borne out of the ECHELON program. Everett attempts to gain control over Majestic 12's communications network by releasing Daedalus onto the U.S. military networks, but <b>Page</b> <b>counters</b> by releasing his own AI, Icarus, which merges with Daedalus to form a new AI, Helios, with the ability to control all global communications. After this, Savage enlists JC's help in procuring schematics for reconstructing components for the UC that were damaged during Majestic 12's raid of Vandenberg. JC finds the schematics and electronically transmits them to Savage. Page intercepts the transmission and launches a nuclear missile at Vandenberg to ensure that Area 51 (now Majestic 12's headquarters), will be the only location in the world with an operational UC. However, JC is able to reprogram the missile to strike Area 51. JC then travels there himself to confront Page.|$|R

Summon is a web-scale discovery service which allows discovery of all of thematerials the library owns or has access to from a simple search box on the library’sweb <b>page.</b> Methods – <b>COUNTER</b> statistics {{were used to determine}} database, e-journal, and ebookstatistics, including database search statistics (DR 1) from the COUNTERDatabase Report 1, full-text article downloads from the COUNTER Journal Report 1 (JR 1), and successful section search requests from the COUNTER Book Report 2 (BR 2) for electronic resources. Sirsi, the University of Manitoba’s integrated library system,provided statistics on checkouts for the libraries’ circulating print monograph andserial collections. The percentage change from the pre-Summon implementationperiod to the post-Summon implementation period was calculated and these numberswere used to determine whether usage had increased or decreased for both print andelectronic collections. Results – As expected, searches in citation databases decreased because searches wereno longer being carried out in the native database as the metadata from the databaseis included in Summon. E-journal usage increased dramatically and e-book usage alsoincreased for four of six providers examined. Print usage decreased, but the resultswere inconclusive.

40|$|The {{presentation}} from Wikiconference 2011 {{discusses the}} problems of non-encyclopedic significance and importance of Wikipedia, focusing on {{the problems of}} Wikipedia in terms of measuring and evaluating the significance of topics in society through measurement and evaluation Wikipedia’s encyclopedic content, non-encyclopedic content and also the outputs of tools and services that work with Wikipedia’s content. First, encyclopedic versus non-encyclopedic pages of Wikipedia are briefly introduced (see slide 3). As encyclopedic pages are meant the pages of the main namespace; it means the articles of encyclopedic entries. As non-encyclopedic pages of Wikipedia are meant the pages of other namespaces, and also other special pages. Slide 4 deals with the ratio of the number of non-encyclopedic and encyclopedic pages in selected language versions of Wikipedia and also the significance of non-encyclopedic pages of Wikipedia in general. The primary significance of non-encyclopedic pages of Wikipedia is support of improving the content of encyclopedic pages, it means maintenance of Wikipedia; and also the measurement and evaluation of the “trend from quantity towards quality” of individual language version of Wikipedia or the project of Wikipedia as a whole. As possible secondary significance of the non-encyclopedic pages of Wikipedia is mentioned the possibility of measuring and evaluating the significance of topics in society. The following slide discusses the problems of internal tools and services that work with the contents of Wikipedia (see slide 5). These includes in particular pages of the namespace called “Special”. These pages are automatically generated by the MediaWiki software, and includes various statistics, lists, etc. The primary significance of the internal tools and services that work with the contents of Wikipedia is the maintenance of Wikipedia again. As possible secondary significance of these tools is mentioned the possibility of measuring and evaluating the significance of topics in society. The following slide discusses the problems of external tools and services that work with the contents of Wikipedia (see slide 6). These includes in particular Semantic Web services, search engines and various counters (such as counters of edits of <b>pages,</b> <b>counters</b> of edits of users, visit rate of Wikipedia’s pages, etc.). Even in this case the question about the possible importance of these tools and services in terms of identifying, measuring and evaluating the significance and / or interconnection of topics in society and / or users / people / groups, etc., is mentioned. Slide 7 introduces the problems of significance of Wikipedia in terms of the significance of topics in society. A published article, which mentions the possibility of measuring and evaluating the current significance of topics in society according {{to the size of the}} articles about these topics and the number of edits of these articles, is mentioned. Slides 8, 9 and 10 provide the results of own quantitative measurement, evaluation and comparison of the significance of topics in society through selected non/encyclopedic contents and services and tools that work with the contents of Wikipedia on the example of Wikipedia’s article "Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk," and the article "Pokémon" in the Czech language version of Wikipedia. The total score in terms of judging the significance of topics “Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk”, and “Pokémon" in the Czech society in the early 21 st century in terms of representation of these topics and visit rate of the contents about these topics in the Czech Wikipedia ultimately falls slightly in favour of the topic "Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk," in the ratio 5 : 4 (see slide 10). Finally the main result of own quantitative measurement is the finding that although the current interest in the topic of "Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk" in the Czech society in the early 21 st century purely theoretical (and exclusively based on quantitative and selected above - of course very limited - scales) is almost comparable to the interest in the topic "Pokémon", in any case this result does not reduce the historical significance of the topic "Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk," not only for the Czech society in the early 21 st century. In conclusion, the main result of the presentation as a whole is finding that while Wikipedia can through quantitative measurements of its non/encyclopedic content and outputs of tools and services that work with the contents reflect the current interest in specific topics in society, but not (at least for now) their historical significance...|$|R
40|$|Def Doc is {{the result}} of my {{experience}} with both TEX and Lisp. The conceptual foundations of TEX, specifically the ability to define macros to simplify repetitive formatting and the beautiful final product, are immensely useful and desirable. 1. 1 TEX Unfortunately, the syntax, the overall document model, even after being extended by L ATEX, and the memory model often keep the ideals of TEX unrealizable in practice. 1. 1. 1 Syntax For example, the lack of abstraction in the syntax prevents most people, including me, from really understanding how to write macros that do non-trivial processing of their contents. Furthermore, the design of TEX as primarily a document markup language makes writing code for these macros very confusing and aesthetically unpleasing, in the opinions of many. 1. 1. 2 Document Model The document model of TEX is very primitive. It is simply a nested sequence of vboxes and hboxes, which gets the job done very well, but some ability to define specialized types of these boxes instead of simply adding properties to them would be desirable. Instead of using a macro system to extend the document model, we could have the option of using a type system for the cases where it is more suitable. 1. 1. 3 Memory Model The memory model used by TEX is essentially a large, statically-allocated set of arrays for each of the various data structures. For linked lists, there is a 2 Def Doc Overview <b>Page</b> 3 reference <b>counter</b> and the list cells have type tags to indicate what exact kind of list they are part of. The sizes of the arrays is fixed at compile-time, so if your document is too large or complex for the sizes fixed in your executable, you must modify the source and increase the defined constants. This process can become very cumbersome for a novice computer user who just {{wants to be able to}} publish a book. 1. 2 Lisp to the rescue For each of these problems, Lisp has a solution...|$|R
5000|$|First {{recorded}} performance: {{the entry}} in the Stationers' Register in July 1602 states that the play was [...] "latelie Acted by the Lo: Chamberleyne his servantes." [...] The title page of Q1 states {{that it had been}} performed in London, at Cambridge and Oxford universities, [...] "and else-where." [...] However, there is no record of any of these performances. The first definite performance of the play took place on a ship called the Red Dragon, anchored off the coast of Africa, on 5 September 1607. The evidence for this comes from Thomas Rundall's Narratives of Voyages Towards the North-East: 1496-1631 (1849). Rundall includes extracts from the journal of Captain William Keeling, {{who was in charge of}} three ships sponsored by the East India Company that left England for India in March 1607, but were almost immediately separated. The Red Dragon, Keeling's flagship, was beset by storms and anchored off what is now Sierra Leone for six weeks. According to Keeling, the crew performed Hamlet on the nights of 5 September and [...] "31 September" [...] (presumably 1 October), and Richard II on the night of 30 September. There has been some argument as to the authenticity of Keeling's journal entry. Prior to Rundall's book, Keeling's journal had been published in 1625, but the references to Hamlet and Richard II were not included by the editor, Samuel Purchas. In his 1898 book, Life of Shakespeare, Sidney Lee claimed the entire Red Dragon episode was probably a forgery by John Payne Collier, and in 1950, Sydney Race revealed that the relevant pages were missing from the original journal and argued that a ship's crew would be incapable of mastering two of Shakespeare's most difficult plays. However, William Foster pointed out that the entire journal had been missing since at least 1900, not just the relevant <b>pages,</b> and he <b>countered</b> Race by arguing that the crew probably performed truncated and edited versions of each play. The general feeling amongst scholars today is that the record is genuine. The earliest recorded performance of the play in the United Kingdom took place at court over Christmas 1619.|$|R
