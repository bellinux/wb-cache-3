5|$|Oliver Cromwell, {{who led the}} {{uprising}} and declined invitations to be made king, became Lord Protector of England in 1657. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested {{with many of the}} traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown. A crown, perhaps saved from the melting <b>pot</b> <b>in</b> 1649, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.|$|E
5|$|The debtors' section {{consisted}} of a brick barracks, a yard measuring , a kitchen, a public room, and a tap room or snuggery, where debtors could drink as much beer as they wanted, at fivepence a <b>pot</b> <b>in</b> 1815. Philpotts reports that, by the early 19th century, most debtors spent only months in the prison; on 19 April 1826 it held 105 debtors, 99 {{of whom had been}} there for less than six months and the other six for less than a year.|$|E

25|$|The most {{unexpected}} discovery at Gnyozdovo was a Kerch amphora with the earliest inscription attested in the Old East Slavic.

The dating of the inscription to the mid-10th century suggests a hitherto unsuspected popularity of the Cyrillic script in pre-Christian Rus.|$|E

25|$|Horses play {{a larger}} role in Brotherhood, not only used as a means of {{transport}} (inside the city for the first time) but as a component of acrobatic sequences and advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. Brotherhood also introduces various types of horse-related assassinations, featuring horse-to-horse assassinations. There are environmental objects like the flower <b>pot</b> <b>in</b> Assassin's Creed II to move faster inside the city (a system of tunnels around the city allow fast travel), as well as new objects such as merchandise lifts to quickly climb up high buildings or structures.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a section}} {{dedicated}} to piñatas, most made with cardboard {{and covered in}} crepe paper, although more traditional ones with a clay <b>pot</b> <b>in</b> the center can still be found. Designs range from traditional stars to those based on recent figures from popular movies and television shows. The busiest time of year for {{this section of the}} market is December, before Christmas, when a tradition called “Las Posadas” often involves the breaking of one or more piñatas. While traditional to that season, the breaking of piñatas is no longer confined to December and can be found at various types of celebrations year round, which helps to support this section’s permanent presence.|$|E
25|$|The NFL sent a {{confidential}} and detailed memo to all 32 teams detailing its findings. It {{revealed that the}} Saints had not only targeted Warner and Favre during the 2009 playoffs, but had also targeted Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton during the 2011 regular season. According to that memo, Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma offered $10,000 cash to any teammate who knocked Favre out of the NFC Championship Game. Another source told CBSSports.com's Mike Freeman that Reggie Bush's agent at the time, Michael Ornstein, was closely involved in the scheme from the beginning.

25|$|The game {{is divided}} {{into a series of}} hands (deals); at the {{conclusion}} of each hand, the pot is typically awarded to one player (an exception in which the pot is divided between two or more is discussed below). A hand may end at the showdown, in which case the remaining players compare their hands and the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can be held by more {{in the case of a}} tie. The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand occurs when all but one player have folded and have thereby abandoned any claim to the <b>pot,</b> <b>in</b> which case the pot is awarded to the player who has not folded.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} session of the final O'Sullivan won the first frame with a break of 86.

The sixth frame had lasted 36 minutes, when O’Sullivan stroked in the pink to a distant balk pocket before clipping in a tricky black for 5–1 lead. McCulloch won the next to bring the score to 5–2 in O'Sullivan's favour {{at the end of}} {{the first session}}. In the second session O'Sullivan took the first two with breaks of 66 and 104. O'Sullivan won two of the next three to bring the score to 8–4, before missing a relatively straightforward <b>pot</b> <b>in</b> the 13th, which allowed McCulloch to take the frame.

25|$|Many {{types of}} gear {{have been used}} to catch blue crabs along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Initially people used very simple {{techniques}} and gear, which included hand lines, dip nets, and push nets among a variety of other gear types. The trotline, a long baited twine set in waters 5–15 feet deep, was the first major gear type used commercially to target hard crabs. Use of commercial trotlines is now mostly limited to the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In the Gulf of Mexico, trotline use drastically declined after invention of the crab <b>pot</b> <b>in</b> 1938. Crab pots are rigid boxlike traps made of hexagonal or square wire mesh. They possess between two and four funnels that extend into the trap, with the smaller end of the funnel inside of the trap. A central compartment made of smaller wire mesh holds bait. Crabs attracted by odorant plumes from the bait, often an oily fish, enter the trap through the funnels and cannot escape.|$|E
25|$|Greek pottery also {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the daily life of prostitutes. Their representation can generally be grouped into four categories: banquet scenes, sexual activities, toilet scenes and scenes depicting maltreatment. In the toilet scenes the prostitute frequently has a less than perfect body; sagging breasts, rolls of flesh, etc. There is a kylix showing a prostitute urinating into a chamber <b>pot.</b> <b>In</b> the representation of sexual acts, {{the presence of a}} prostitute is often indicated by a purse, which underscores the financial nature of the relationship. The position most frequently shown is the leapfrog—or sodomy; these two positions being difficult to visually distinguish. The woman is frequently folded in two with her hands flat on the ground. Sodomy was considered degrading for an adult and it seems that the leapfrog position (as opposed to the missionary position) was considered less gratifying for the woman. Finally, a number of vases represent scenes of abuse, where the prostitute is threatened with a stick or sandal, and forced to perform acts considered by the Greeks to be degrading: fellatio, sodomy or sex with two partners.|$|E

[...] It insults kids to suggest that simply watching Characters Behaving Badly onscreen means they'll take that as permission to do the same themselves. [...] And it's set in high school, meaning it's about a journey not just to college and career but to identity and conviction, the price of popularity, the compromises we must make between what we want and what we need.|$|E
500|$|In the quarter-finals Lee {{defeated}} O'Sullivan 5–4 in a {{match that}} lasted 3 hours and 32 minutes. O'Sullivan came from 2–3 down to lead 4–3 before Lee leveled the match. In the final frame O'Sullivan led 36–0, before Lee made a 46 break and fluked a snooker that {{enabled him to}} claim victory. O'Sullivan said his performance was very poor, while Lee said he was quietly confident. White defeated Robertson 5–3 to reach his third semi-final of the season. White led 4–1 and was 56 points ahead in the sixth but missed a straightforward green, allowing Robertson to win on the black with a 67 break. Robertson took the next frame before a risky long <b>pot</b> <b>in</b> the eighth allowed White to win the match. White—who last won a ranking title 12 years ago prior at this event—said, [...] "Everyone knows I've been in front {{so many times in}} the past and tossed it away so I was having nightmares out there". Drago quickly won the first four frames of his match against Hann, conceding the fifth, before completing a 5–1 victory, after which he said the crowd support helped him. Maguire caused an upset when he beat Higgins 5–3, a match that saw Maguire lose the first two frames before winning the next four.
