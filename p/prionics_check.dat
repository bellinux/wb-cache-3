40|$|International audienceScrapie, a {{neurodegenerative}} disease of {{sheep and goats}} and one of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and monitored in EU through has been subject to mandatory active surveillance since 2002. Regulation EC/ 999 / 2001 on TSE surveillance requires that each Member State's National Reference Laboratory for TSE periodically verifies diagnostic standards and methods by comparative testing. In 2007 the Italian Reference Centre carried out the first ring trial for classical scrapie {{on a set of}} 21 negative and 9 positive homogenated brainstems, the latter consisting of 3 replicates of an ARQ/ARQ scrapie positive sample diluted 1 : 10, 1 : 20 and 1 : 50. The {{purpose of the study was}} to verify the interlaboratory agreement in term of Cohen's (k) of the rapid systems currently used by the 25 national rapid test laboratories (RTLs) [laboratories: Biorad TeSeE (17 laboratories), Enfer TSE version 2. 0 (4 laboratories), Idexx Herd chek BSE-scrapie antigen kit (3 laboratories) and <b>Prionics</b> <b>check</b> LIA SR (1 laboratory) ]...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{assurance}} of rapid BSE tests is a challenging and constantly interesting issue and well characterised reference materials {{are the key}} for an objective and meaningful quality control of all rapid BSE tests. The Institute for Reference Materials and Measurement (IRMM) of the European Commission has therefore developed several types of reference materials suitable for all currently EC approved rapid BSE tests; Three types of dilutions of stable homogenates are available: (i) ¿Generic homogenates¿: several dilutions of brainstem of BSE positive cattle in negative brainstem tissue and water; (ii) ¿Bio-Rad specific homogenates¿: several dilutions of brainstem of BSE positive cattle in negative brainstem tissue; 20 % tissue homogenates in test specific buffer (for Bio-Rad TeSeE test); (iii) ¿Prionics specific homogenates¿: several dilutions of brainstem of BSE positive cattle in negative brainstem tissue; 10 % tissue homogenates in test specific buffer (for <b>Prionics</b> <b>check</b> LIA and Western blot). The homogenates were initially calibrated against brains of BSE-infected bovine transgenic mice and are subjected to regular stability testing. The materials are widely used by test developers and National Reference Laboratories for e. g. quality control or proficiency testing. JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|E
40|$|Background: Routine {{rapid testing}} for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) has {{highlighted}} {{some problems with}} BSE rapid test performance, the most significant being the number of initially reactive samples and the false positive results on autolyzed tissue. This point is important for BSE active surveillance in risk populations, because tissue autolysis is often unavoidable in routine cases. A robust test suitable for use on field material is therefore needed. To date, very limited information regarding the effect of autolysis on the robustness of rapid tests has been documented; therefore, the National Reference Centre for Animal Encephalopathies (CEA) rapid test laboratory selected 450 autolyzed and negative brain stem samples from fallen stock bovines older than 24 months to assess the specificity of four tests approved for BSE active surveillance: Biorad TeSeE, Enfer TSE version 2. 0, <b>Prionics</b> ® <b>Check</b> LIA, and IDEXX Herd Check BSE Antigen Kit EIA. The samples were graded according {{to the degree of}} autolysis and then dissected into five portions, four of which randomly assigned to processing by rapid tests and one to be available for confirmatory Western blot analysis. Findings: The specificity of the four systems was 100 % for all three grades of autolysis, while the percentage of initially reactive results was 0. 00 (95 %CI 0. 00 - 0. 82), 0. 22 (95 %CI 0. 006 - 1. 23), 0. 44 (95 %CI 0. 05 - 1. 60), and 0. 89 (95 %CI 0. 24 - 2. 26) for the Biorad TeSeE, the <b>Prionics</b> ® <b>Check</b> LIA, the IDEXX Herd Check BSE and the Enfer TSE tests...|$|R

No association with the degree of autolysis could be drawn. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that the four rapid tests can be considered well-running diagnostic tools regardless of tissue quality; nevertheless, the number of initial reactive samples reported for some systems must not be underestimated in routine testing. Furthermore the compliance with the reported performance can be guaranteed only when an ongoing high careful batch quality control system is in place. </p...|$|R
