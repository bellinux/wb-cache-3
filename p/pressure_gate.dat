40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of intensification <b>pressure,</b> <b>gate</b> velocity, and intermediate shot velocity on the internal quality of aluminum die castings. An experimental design was developed to analyze two levels of intensification pressure, two levels of gate velocity, and four levels of intermediate shot velocity. These parameters were chosen because of the ease of their manipulation on the manufacturing floor in an effort to develop an optimum process for a given die design. ^ Internal casting quality is measured by the density of the casting produced as compared to the theoretical density of the alloy being molded. The study also included monitoring of the biscuit length of the samples collected. A statistical analysis was conducted to determine any correlation between or among any of the independent variables or the other parameter monitored. ^ The results of this study indicate that there is a statistical significance among and between the independent variables that were controlled in this experiment. The results also indicated a significant positive relationship between biscuit length and the density of the resultant castings. ...|$|E

Increasing pressure progressively constricted the afferent arteriole (- 0 · 26 ± 0 · 02 % mmHg− 1, n= 21, r= 0 · 97). Gadolinium (10 μM), a mechanosensitive cation channel blocker, abolished this myogenic constriction.

40|$|Injection molding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and most {{important}} methods of processing thermoplastic polymers. Analysis of injection molding is difficult because of the non-Newtonian flow of the polymer melt. This non-Newtonian flow also influences the physical properties of the solidified part. An optical access mold was designed and built to allow viewing of the melt during the molding of a rectangular plaque. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the midplane velocity field of STYRON 615 APR during mold filling. The <b>gate</b> <b>pressure,</b> flow front shapes and front propagation velocities were also measured. These measurements were compared to Moldflow simulations. Moldflow was found to be accurate for the bulk of the flow, with an average vector orientation error of 1. 7 degrees. The ratio of cavity-averaged PIV velocity magnitudes to Moldflow average magnitudes had a mean of 0. 998 and a standard deviation of 0. 25. This deviation was due to problem areas near the cavity walls and the flow front. Moldflow also had difficulty predicting realistic flow front shapes. A power-law model of the flow was developed and was used to predict the <b>gate</b> <b>pressure.</b> The model and the measured <b>gate</b> <b>pressure</b> were used to estimate the power-law parameters of the melt. The power-law exponent was found to be 0. 4063, within 0. 4 % of the value measured by capillary rheometer. The power-law coefficient was found to be 2659 Pa-s^n, within 9. 5 % of the measured value. Velocity fields during packing were also measured. The random component of the flow was initially 10 - 20 % and grew to 60 - 80 % after 2. 5 seconds of packing. The random component increased as the packing pressure was decreased. The mass flow during packing was modeled analytically as a combination of compressibility and solidification effects.

Ultimately, the solidified part is ejected from the mold without damage. The successful operation of an {{injection molding}} machine requires control of the process variables during each of the consecutive stages in addition to correctly identifying the points of transition from one stage to the next.

From the practical point of view, it is necessary to consider simultaneously hydraulic pressure, nozzle pressure, and the distribution of pressure in the cavity. Control of each phase of the injection molding process is best achieved by controlling one or a combination of the above pressure parameters. The present work describes a comprehensive study of the dynamics and control of pressure during each stage of the injection molding cycle.

40|$|MnAu_ 2 is a spin-spiral {{material}} with in-plane ferromagnetic Mn layers that form a screw-type pattern around a tetragonal c axis. The spiral angle θ was shown using neutron diffraction experiments to decrease with pressure, and in later studies {{it was found}} to suffer a collapse to a ferromagnetic state above a critical pressure, although the two separate experiments did not agree on whether this phase transition is first or second order. To resolve this contradiction, we use density functional theory calculations to investigate the spiral state {{as a function of}} pressure, charge doping, and also electronic correlations via a Hubbard-like U. We fit the results to the one-dimensional J_ 1 - J_ 2 - J_ 3 - J_ 4 Heisenberg model, which predicts either a first- or second-order spiral-to-ferromagnetic phase transition for different regions of parameter space. At ambient pressure, MnAu_ 2 sits close in parameter space to a dividing line separating first- and second-order transitions, and a combination of pressure and electron doping shifts the system from the first-order region into the second-order region. Our findings demonstrate that the contradiction in pressure experiments regarding the kind of phase transition are likely due to variations in sample quality.

40|$|Flexible metal-organic {{frameworks}} (MOFs) are {{class of}} porous crystalline materials that show a structural change upon external stimulus. Understanding this behaviour underpins {{the design of}} new responsive porous materials that can target specific applications such as gas separation, molecular sensing, catalysis and drug delivery. Most flexible MOFs undergo well-defined crystallographic transitions between open and closed-pore forms known as “breathing”. By contrast, continuous flexible behaviour is rare and detailed characterisation is very limited. Here we report a continuous breathing mechanism that can be followed by single-crystal diffraction in a MOF with a diamondoid network, (Me 2 NH 2) [In(ABDC) 2] (ABDC = 2 -aminobenzene- 1, 4 -dicarboxylate) (1). The mechanism is highly solvent-dependent and desolvation from different pore-solvent content enables access to two polymorphic desolvated forms with very different pore openings. These two forms exhibit markedly different gas adsorption capacities and different CO 2 vs CH 4 selectivity. Partial desolvation introduces a <b>gating</b> <b>pressure</b> associated with CO 2 adsorption, absent in the desolvated forms, leading {{to a combination of}} stepped and continuous breathing of the framework...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the seismic design of lock gates. When such {{structures}} are submitted to an earthquake, the water contained in the chamber is responsible for an additional hydrodynamic pressure acting on the gate. This one {{is the sum of}} three different parts, respectively called the convective, rigid and flexible contributions. The two first ones have already been extensively studied in the literature, but the flexible part is more difficult to assess as it is largely influenced by the coupling occurring between the fluid and the gate. To overcome this difficulty, it is of course possible to use finite elements software, but doing so is not always convenient. This is why some research have been undertaken to provide a rapid way for approximating the flexible <b>pressure</b> on lock <b>gates.</b> This is achieved by applying the analytical approach that is shortly presented in this paper. As a matter of validation, the results obtained through this simplified procedure are compared to numerical solutions. The agreement between both of them is found to be satisfactory. 1...|$|R
