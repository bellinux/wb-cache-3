5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and <b>prognosis</b> <b>for</b> traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The <b>prognosis</b> <b>for</b> low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the <b>prognosis</b> <b>for</b> esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E

Severe cerebellar hypoplasia is associated with growth and speech delays, as well as hypotonia and general growth deficiencies.|$|R

40|$|Road Safety Outlook 2020; Interim report phase 1. In 2008 the Strategic Road Safety Plan 2008 - 2020 (SPV) was formulated. This plan is {{the basis}} of the {{biannual}} Action Programmes, among other things. It has been decided that the SPV will be reviewed every four years to assess whether its implementation will meet the targets in 2020 and whether the SPV must possibly be revised. This report is meant as a tool for this review. It deals with <b>prognoses</b> <b>for</b> the number of fatalities and serious road injuries in 2020 with implementation of the SPV; they are defined as reference prognoses. Before drawing up the prognoses, it was studied whether the points of departure of the SPV are still applicable. Modification in the points of departure has been accounted for in the formulation of the prognoses. The prognoses have been drawn up in two stages. In the first place, the development in risk from the past (1995 - 2009) has been extrapolated to the future (2020) for various groups of casualties. The ‘forecasting model’ developed by SWOV has been used for this purpose. The expected risks are multiplied by mobility or population prognoses derived from the Welfare, Prosperity and Quality of the Living Environment (WLO) study from 2006. The total number of casualties in 2020 has been estimated by adding the <b>prognoses</b> <b>for</b> the various subgroups. These first reference <b>prognoses</b> <b>for</b> the total number of fatalities and the total number of serious road injuries have next been revised for adjustments in road safety policy. Taken into account are the a number of ‘current measures’ that may be expected to have less or, rather, more effect on road safety and a number of ‘new measures’ in the SPV that are expected to have extra effect...|$|R

25|$|Seen another way, {{patients}} with heart, liver, lung, or kidney failure have a dismal <b>prognosis</b> <b>for</b> survival, so the toxicity associated with immunosuppression is warranted (the benefits of graft survival outweigh {{the risks associated}} with the medications). But for the subset of {{patients with}} diabetes and preserved kidney function, even those with long-standing and difficult-to-control disease, the <b>prognosis</b> <b>for</b> survival is comparatively much better. In addition to the immunosuppressive toxicities, other risks are associated with the islet transplant procedure itself, including intra-abdominal hemorrhage following the transplant, and portal vein thrombosis. The fact that there is already a good alternative to islet transplantation (i.e. the modern intensive insulin regimen) forces us to regard any newer, riskier interventions with a critical eye.|$|E
