50|$|One {{noteworthy}} {{advantage of}} this moderator type is that temperatures of approximately 370 °C can be obtained at low system pressure - {{in the range of}} 240 kPa (2.4 bar). Low system pressure reduces sealing and gasket problems and allows the use of thin walls on pressure vessels and piping, significantly reducing manufacturing costs. Also, at low operating pressure the reactor contains less potential energy. This means that a ruptured pipe cannot cause extensive damage (i.e. <b>pipe</b> <b>whip)</b> or cause the release of appreciable quantities of radioactivity.|$|E
40|$|Finite element {{analyses}} {{have been}} performed to investigate behaviour of postulated cracks in the longitudinal weld of a 90 ° pipe elbow in the reactor coolant line of a German PWR. At the extrados a <b>pipe</b> <b>whip</b> restraint is welded on the outer surface of the elbow {{in order to prevent}} <b>pipe</b> <b>whip</b> for the postulated double-ended rupture. However, this arrangement significantly increases the effort for non-destructive testing (NDT) during in-service inspections. Moreover, weld sections of about 80 mm to 160 mm length cannot be accessed by NDT from outside. According to the German RSK (Reactor Safety Commission) Guideline, cracks postulated in areas of restricted access for NDT or in non-examinable zones should not cause a catastrophic failure of the reactor coolant line. To assure the safety of the pipe elbow against crack initiation and unstable propagation, numerical stress and crack driving force calculations are carried out taking into account the real geometry of the <b>pipe</b> <b>whip</b> restraint. Both Service Level A Loadings and Service Level D Loadings (e. g. earth quake, plane crash) are investigated. For comparison purposes the same elbow geometry without restraint is analysed. The material Ji value and the slope dJ/da of the measured JR-curve are employed as criteria for crack initiation and instability. The result suggest the critical length of a through crack (2 c) at initiation to be of some 800 mm which is considerably larger than the length of the non-examinable zone. Furthermore, by comparing the s lope of the Jappl(2 c) curve with the material resistance curve, a conclusion can be drawn that no crack instability may occur for any crack size below the length of the <b>pipe</b> <b>whip</b> restraint. The restraint arrangement considerably increases t he carrying capacity and residual strength of the elbow...|$|E

Description of the Internal Structures The descriptive information including plans and sections of the various internal structures is reviewed to establish that sufficient information is provided to define the primary structural aspects and elements relied upon to perform the safety-related functions of these structures. In order to perform the safety-related functions, these structures must be capable of resisting loads and load combinations to which they may be subjected and should not become the initiator of a {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA).

Both experimental studies and modelling using analytical and FE methods have been carried out and they show that, for a good estimate of the “hazard zone” when unconstrained <b>pipe</b> <b>whip</b> motion could occur, a large displacement analysis is essential. The classical, rigid plastic, small deflection analysis (e. g. see [2] and [8]), is valid for estimating the initial failure mechanisms, however it is insufficient for describing the details and consequences of large deflection behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MIng (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 One of the {{requirements}} of a safe nuclear power plant design is the postulation of the dynamic effects of a steam pipe rupture. The dynamic effects are the discharging fluid and <b>pipe</b> <b>whip</b> on structures, systems or components. A pipe rupture can be caused in the steam pipe system where a defect such as a crack exists. Multiple factors contribute to the initiation of pipe cracks during the plant’s life. Cracks may start microscopically small and over time, {{with the assistance of}} cyclic operation, fatigue may elongate the crack. When a steam pipe is cooled by water during an accident, steam condensate may accumulate and form slugs of water. This water will {{have an effect on the}} system termed condensation induced water hammer. The cause of the pipe rupture is not addressed in this dissertation. Pipe rupture can be considered to be either a circumferential or longitudinal break. For the purpose of this dissertation only a circumferential break will be considered. This research is based on the development of a <b>pipe</b> <b>whip</b> restraint structure to protect the plant environment during a steam pipe rupture event in a nuclear power plant. It focuses on a structural component required to restrain the dynamic energy to an acceptable level. Whip restraints used in the nuclear industry are typically honeycomb, U-bar and crush pipe types. In this dissertation only the U-bar and crush <b>pipe</b> <b>whip</b> restraints will be considered. The plant environment, with regards to pipe layout, plays a large role in determining the type of restraint to be used, whether it is U-bar or crush pipe. A whip towards the wall/structure will favor a crush pipe; a whip away from the wall/structure will favor a U-bar restraint. In this project the crush pipe is selected where the whip is towards a wall/structure. The crush pipe also represents a simpler design. First-order analysis is performed using the energy method to determine the conceptual geometry of the whipping component and the restraint geometry. Second-order analysis includes finite element analysis to verify the first-order results. In this dissertation the concept validation is done using LS-PrePost. for the pre- and post-processing while the analysis is performed using LS-DYNA ®. During the second-order analysis it was demonstrated that the energy is successfully absorbed by the crush pipe and thus the first-order analysis is considered adequate. Master...|$|E
40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} is the {{transient}} analysis of a Group Distribution Header (GDH) following a guillotine break {{at the end of}} the header. The GDH is the most important component of reactor safety in case of accidents. Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) piping is connected to the GDH piping such that, during an accident, coolant passes from the GDH into the ECCS. The GDH that is propelled into motion after a guillotine break can impact neighboring GDH pipes or the nearest wall of the compartment. The cases of GDH impact on an adjacent GDH and its attached piping are investigated {{in this paper}}.

Both experimental and theoretical results are presented concerning the dynamic elastic-plastic behaviour of cantilever pipes subjected to a transverse force pulse at the free end. Comparisons between experimental data and theoretical predictions are made for mild-steel pipes with outer diameter-to-thickness ratios of 19. 5, 28 and 32. It is demonstrated that, for these geometries, the whipping pipes display three characteristically different responses, viz. elastic, plastic hardening behaviour for thick pipes, elastic, plastic hardening-softening behaviour for moderately thick pipes and elastic, plastic hardening-softening-collapse behaviour for thinner pipes. The experimental data taken from a series of high-speed films are compared with the predictions of the instantaneous shapes of the whipping pipes derived from both a rigid, perfectly-plastic, large deflection, dynamic beam model and a more comprehensive model which incorporates the effects of elasticity and plastic hardening and softening, the details of which are presented in the paper...|$|E

Moreover, it had been demonstrated that the previous dynamic models, which largely ignored the internal flow effects and interactions between the flow and the structure, normally produced a large error and are inapplicable to the analysis of many practical situations.

40|$|Some code {{improvements}} {{have been}} made {{during the course of}} this study. One immediately obvious need was for more flexibility in the constitutive representation for materials in shell elements. To remedy this situation, a model with a tabular representation of stress versus strain and rate dependent effects was implemented. This was required in order to obtain reasonable results in the IED cylinder simulation. Another deficiency was in the ability to extract and plot variables associated with shell elements. The <b>pipe</b> <b>whip</b> analysis required the development of a scheme to tally and plot time dependent shell quantities such as stresses and strains. This capability had previously existed only for solid elements. Work was initiated to provide the same range of plotting capability for structural elements that exist with the DYNA 3 D/TAURUS tools. One of the characteristics of these problems is the disparity in zoning required in the vicinity of the charge and bubble compared to that needed in the far field. This disparity can cause the equipotential relaxation logic to provide a less than optimal solution. Various approaches were utilized to bias the relaxation to obtain more optimal meshing during relaxation. Extensions of these techniques have been developed to provide more powerful options, but more work still needs to be done. The results presented here are representative of what can be produced with an ALE code structured like ALE 3 D. They are not necessarily the best results that could have been obtained. More experience in assessing sensitivities to meshing and boundary conditions would be very useful.

40|$|NUCLEAR PLANT HIGH ENERGY PIPING: PIPE BREAK AND <b>PIPE</b> <b>WHIP</b> RESTRAINT DESIGN AND VERIFICATION METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH Summary Restraints {{design is}} {{conceived}} {{in order to}} protect structures, systems and components from the anticipated rupture and whipping phenomena of high energy lines in nuclear power plants and guarantee the safe shutdown itself. It is therefore compelling for the plant safety to investigate these topics accurately. Various research programs have been conducted in many countries to develop analytical methods and to verify the validity of these methods. In this thesis work a nonlinear dynamic Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is conducted using ANSYS-LS DYNA program in order to simulate the smashing of a whipping pipe against its own restraint. Break locations will be identified, the thrust force will be computed, plastic hinge formation evaluated, stress-strain curve outlined. The task reproduces two JAERI tests performed between 1979 and 1982 under BWR LOCA conditions for a 6 ” and 4 ” pipe. Modelling High Energy Pipe Break phenomena covers deep accuracy in sizing components and structures involved; their stiffness and mass, thicknesses and mostly material properties. The study analyzes different material behaviors under impact starting from ANS 58. 2 recommendations, and furtherly exploiting different properties embedded within ANSYS LS-DYNA such as the bilinear kinematic stress-strain trend and finally the multi-linear plasticity law, suggested as the most suitable. The other important aspect is that of inputting to the Code a well-defined thrust force trend; this has been done following the regulations and later on with a transient blowdown analysis using RELAP 5 Code. The two are proven to be consonant but mainly too conservative specially in the rise time of the force. Anyway a procedure to deal with HEPB phenomena has been built and tested and has been practiced for a real case analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is proposed {{to simulate the}} large deflection dynamic behaviour of an elastic-plastic, hardening-softening cantilever beam with an attached end mass subjected to a suddenly applied force pulse at its free end. The model is a development of a previous one by the present authors {{which was based on}} a small deflection formulation. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effects of the softening parameter, a, the ratio of the end mass to the mass of the beam and the intensity of the force pulse on the dynamic réponse of a beam. The changes in shape of the beams, the growth of the softening region and the possible onset of local collapse are examined. The model, though applicable generally to beams with elastic-plastic hardeningsoftening characteristics, was developed primarily to describe the phenomenon of <b>pipe</b> <b>whip,</b> the large deflection behaviour of a high-pressure piping system following a sudden rupture of the pipe. During the motion and deformation of a whipping pipe, softening can occur in the local bending characteristic and this in turn can lead to severe localization of the deformation, i. e. the formation of a 'kink'. Following initial elastic behaviour, the local bending behaviour of the pipe involves sequential hardening and softening phases as the pipe deforms plastically. This results from the interaction between the material properties of the pipe and the ovalization of its cross-sections as it undergoes large plastic deformations. It has been demonstrated recently that the model can accurately predict the transient deformation of the centre lines of freely whipping pipes. The practical issues associated with applying the theory to tubular beams (pipes) and the mesh sensitivity of the numerical solution of the governing equations are discussed herein. However, the main aim of the paper is to add to the range of beam models available for the solution of dynamic structural plasticity problems. © 1998 The Royal Society...|$|E
40|$|A windowed {{collocation}} method, {{based on}} a moving least squares reproducing kernel particle approximation of functions, is explored for spatial discretization of the strongly non-linear system of partial differential equations governing large, planar whipping motion of a cantilever pipe subjected to a follower force pulse (the blow-down force) normal to the deflected centreline at its tip. This problem was discussed by Reid et al. [An elastic–plastic hardening–softening cantilever beam subjected to a force pulse at its tip: a model for <b>pipe</b> <b>whip.</b> Proc R Soc London A 1998; 454 : 997 – 1029] where a space–time finite difference discretization was employed to solve the governing partial differential equation of motion. It was shown that, despite the deflected shape predictions being accurate, numerical solutions of these equations might exhibit problematic (possibly spurious) steep localized gradients. The resolution of this problem {{in the context of}} structural mechanics is novel and {{is the subject of this}} paper. In particular, it is demonstrated that it is possible to reduce significantly such spurious and localized numerical instabilities through a windowed collocation approach with a suitable choice of the window size. The collocation procedure presently adopted is based on the moving least squares reproducing kernel particle method. Material and structural non-linearity in the beam (pipe) model is incorporated via an elastic– plastic hardening– softening moment–curvature relationship. The projected ordinary differential equations are then integrated in time through a fifth order, explicit Runge–Kutta method with adaptive step sizes. The whipping motion of a pipe is often associated with the formation of one or more so-called moving plastic ‘hinges’ (regions). Depending on the magnitude and duration of the follower load pulse, plastic hinges may form at intermediate positions along the pipe. In such cases numerical solutions, especially those for curvatures and their derivatives, obtained through central difference or classical finite element methods may exhibit considerable fluctuations in space and time and may even ‘blow up’ following the formation of a kink at the location of the plastic hinge. However, it is shown that the presently adopted windowed collocation strategy has a far superior numerical performance, arresting these fluctuations to a great extent. Indeed, as demonstrated in this paper, there is a band of window sizes for which such fluctuations may nearly vanish...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} of the effect of flowing medium on the transient response of a pipe due to dynamically applied loading. The topic is very important in many industrial and military applications including offshore structures, oil and gas, power stations, petrochemical and defence industries where critical pipe components transporting a gas or liquid can be subjected to impact loading due to an accident. In many previous studies, such effects were largely ignored, simplified or considered negligible. The conducted study demonstrated that in many practically important cases, the influence of flowing medium on transient response is not small and has to be taken into consideration. In the current work, the classical Bernoulli-Euler beam theory is adopted to describe the dynamic behaviour of an elastic pipe and a governing equation of a slender pipe transporting gas or liquid was derived. This governing equation incorporates the effects of inertia, centrifugal and Coriolis forces due to the flowing medium. This equation can be normalised to demonstrate that only two non-dimensional parameters govern the static and dynamic responses of the system incorporating a pipe and flowing medium. Therefore, these non-dimensional parameters can be utilised to investigate various dynamic phenomena using reduced size or scale physical models. Such scale models would be adequate if the values of these parameters were kept the same for the scale model and the real system. This is expected to result in substantial benefits if the experimental approach is adopted for {{the investigation of the}} problem under consideration. The main effort in this thesis is devoted to the development of an analytical procedure utilising the perturbation method and numerical approach adopting a central finitedifference scheme to analyse the dynamic response of the system due to impulsively applied loadings. This is then followed by a validation study against previously published data as well as between both approaches, analytical and numerical. Further, a detailed investigation was carried out on the effects of the flowing medium on the transient response. It revealed two principally different types of behaviour of a pipe subjected to impulse loading: stable decay and unstable associated with so-called <b>pipe</b> <b>whip.</b> Special attention is given to the above phenomena, pipe and flow characteristics, which cause growing unlimited displacements of the pipe regardless of how small the value of the applied loading is. Experiments were also conducted to support the theoretical results and were found to follow the theoretically predicted tendencies. The developed theoretical methods provide a framework for analysis of many other dynamic problems of pipes with flowing media subjected to arbitrary boundary and loading conditions. Lastly, the overall conclusion of the conducted research was provided and future work was identified for further investigations, which follows from the obtained results. Thesis (Ph. D.)
