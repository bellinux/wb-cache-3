The created {{vision system}} captures image {{sequences}} from the digital camera and it first detects static hand <b>poses</b> <b>in</b> every single frame {{due to a}} doubleactive contour classification. The tracking of the hand <b>pose</b> <b>in</b> a short sequence allows to detect ”modified poses”, like diacritic letters of polish alphabet. Finally, by tracking hand <b>poses</b> <b>in</b> a longer image sequence, this pose sequence ic classified in terms of gestures (words). Hidden Markov Models and Viterbi search are applied for word modelling and recognition at this stage. ...|$|R

5|$|Henry {{tried to}} {{maintain}} a sophisticated household that combined hunting and drinking with cosmopolitan literary discussion and courtly values. Nonetheless, Henry's passion was for hunting, for which the court became famous. Henry {{had a number of}} preferred royal hunting lodges and apartments across his lands, and invested heavily in his royal castles, both for their practical utility as fortresses, and as symbols of royal power and prestige. The court was relatively formal in its style and language, possibly because Henry was attempting to compensate for his own sudden rise to power and relatively humble origins as the son of a count. He opposed the holding of tournaments, probably because of the security risk that such gatherings of armed knights <b>posed</b> <b>in</b> peacetime.|$|E

5|$|The 1967 film An Evening in Paris {{is mostly}} remembered because it {{featured}} Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{as the first}} Indian actress to wear a bikini on film. She also <b>posed</b> <b>in</b> a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked a conservative Indian audience, but it also {{set in motion a}} trend carried forward by Zeenat Aman in Heera Panna (1973) and Qurbani (1980), Dimple Kapadia in Bobby (1973), and Parveen Babi in Yeh Nazdeekiyan (1982).|$|E
5|$|The dried London foot, first {{mentioned}} in 1665, {{and transferred to}} the British Museum in the 18th century, was displayed next to Savery's Edwards's Dodo painting until the 1840s, and it too was dissected by Strickland and Melville. It was not <b>posed</b> <b>in</b> a standing posture, which suggests that it was severed from a fresh specimen, not a mounted one. By 1896 it was mentioned as being without its integuments, and only the bones are believed to remain today, though its present whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{appeared}} in a bikini in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress. She also <b>posed</b> <b>in</b> a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through {{a reversal of the}} state of modesty, which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films.|$|E

5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question <b>posed</b> <b>in</b> 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
5|$|When Saldívar {{became a}} {{business}} associate, their relationship began to deteriorate. In September 1994, Selena met Ricardo Martinez, {{a doctor who}} lived in Monterrey, Mexico. Selena wanted to expand the number of boutiques by opening a Selena Etc. store in Monterrey. Martinez said he had contacts in Mexico who could help her grow her business. Martinez became a business adviser to Selena, though her family said he was simply a fan who <b>posed</b> <b>in</b> several pictures with her. Saldívar became envious of Selena's dependency on Martinez. He began sending flowers to Selena's hotel room. Saldívar warned the singer that Martinez might have unprofessional intentions. Selena began visiting Monterrey more frequently, often in disguise. Sebastian D'Silva, Martinez's assistant, would pick up Selena at the airport; he said he noticed she was wearing wigs and using her husband Chris Pérez's surname so others would not identify her. According to Martinez, he had lent several thousand dollars to Selena because she was short on cash.|$|E
5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be <b>posed</b> <b>in</b> it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E
