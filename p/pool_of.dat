50|$|Park's work explores {{visualizing}} emotive {{states and}} the subconscious. In Eunoia and Eunoia II, she controlled <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> water with her brain-waves. This was accomplished by having electroencephalography (E.E.G.) data to create sound-waves which were pushed through <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> water, causing them to ripple. Park sat in the center <b>of</b> the <b>pools</b> as this occurred. For Eunoia, Park separated the E.E.G. data into five emotions, each of which fed into one <b>of</b> five <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> water. For Eunoia II, she expanded her conception of brain activity to cover forty-eight <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> water, matching the forty-eight emotions described by philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Also, while Park strove to control her emotions in Eunoia {{in order to keep}} the <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> water still, she changed her approach in Eunoia II to focus on expressing emotions.|$|R
5|$|A Private act, {{passed in}} September 1881, allowed the {{construction}} of more private horse tramways and additional acts were passed authorising more line construction and services by more companies. Most of the companies operated double-decker tram, although some were single level cabs with many built by John Stephenson Co, Duncan & Fraser of Adelaide, and from 1897 by the A at Kensington. The trams ran at an average speed of , usually two horses pulling each tram from a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> four to ten.|$|E
5|$|A cold-core low, {{also known}} as an upper level low or cold-core cyclone, is a cyclone aloft which has an {{associated}} cold <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> air residing at high altitude within the Earth's troposphere. It is a low pressure system that strengthens with height {{in accordance with the}} thermal wind relationship. If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans, it is called a subtropical cyclone. Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, can occur near the center of cold-core lows. Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts, such as polar lows, and Von Karman Vortices. Cold lows can lead directly to the development of tropical cyclones, owing to their associated cold <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> air aloft or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development.|$|E
