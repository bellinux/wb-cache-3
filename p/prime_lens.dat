5|$|According to Rajamouli, {{the film}} unit {{consulted}} a 3D {{video of the}} storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording procedures were done with simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a <b>prime</b> <b>lens,</b> and Scorpio and Strada cranes {{were used for the}} principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E
500|$|Since 1954, Panavision {{had been}} working on a new {{widescreen}} process commissioned by MGM. The resulting system used a 65mm film camera in conjunction with the APO Panatar lens, which was an integrated anamorphic lens (as opposed to a standard <b>prime</b> <b>lens</b> with an anamorphoser mounted on it). This created a 1.25x anamorphic squeeze factor. Movies using the process had an astounding potential aspect ratio of 2.76:1 when exhibited with 70mm anamorphic projection prints. Introduced as MGM Camera 65, the system was used on just a few films, the first of which was Raintree County (1956). However, the film was released only in 35mm anamorphic prints because the circuit of 70mm theaters was booked with Around the World in Eighty Days (1956), shot with the competing, nonanamorphic Todd-AO system. [...] In January 1959, the posters for the 70mm release of Disney's Sleeping Beauty carried the notation [...] "Process lenses by Panavision" [...] next to the Super Technirama 70 logo. [...] The first film to be presented in 70mm anamorphic—Ben-Hur—was released by MGM in 1959 under the trade name MGM Camera 65. Panavision also developed a nonanamorphic widescreen process called Super Panavision 70, which was essentially identical to Todd-AO. Super Panavision made its screen debut in 1959 with The Big Fisherman, released by Disney's Buena Vista division.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Polaroid Corporation {{announced}} the Polaroid x530, a compact camera with a 1408×1056×3, 1/1.8" [...] sensor. The camera received a limited release in 2005 but was recalled {{later in the}} year for unspecified image quality problems. Sigma announced a prototype of their own Foveon-based compact camera in 2006, the Sigma DP1, using the same 14 MP sensor as the SD14 DSLR. A revised version of the prototype was exhibited in 2007, and the camera was eventually launched in Spring 2008. Unlike the Polaroid x530, the DP1 had an APS-C-sized sensor, with a 28mm equivalent <b>prime</b> <b>lens.</b> The camera was subsequently revised as the DP1s and the DP1x. In 2009, the company launched the DP2, a compact camera using the same sensor and body as the DP1, but with a 41mm-equivalent f/2.8 lens.|$|E
50|$|All {{perspective}} control and tilt/shift <b>lenses</b> are manual-focus <b>prime</b> lenses; most are quite expensive compared to regular <b>prime</b> <b>lenses.</b> Some medium format camera makers, such as Mamiya, have addressed {{this problem by}} offering shift adapters that work with the maker’s other <b>prime</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of full frame manual focus <b>prime</b> <b>lenses</b> without any electronics is relatively easier and less costly than the {{construction of}} electronic full frame autofocus lenses of any kind. Additionally, the E-mount Sony α7 series are the only full frame mirrorless cameras and have more electronic aids for manual focusing than full-frame DSLRs. Both these facts have encouraged lesser known lens companies to construct full frame <b>prime</b> <b>lenses</b> with E-mount. Numerous affordable sharp full-format manual <b>prime</b> <b>lenses</b> with big apertures are available with E-mount.|$|R
50|$|These {{are high}} quality (mostly <b>prime)</b> <b>lenses</b> with the lens housing made of metal. They {{usually have a}} wider maximum {{aperture}} compared to zooms but narrower as compared to other <b>prime</b> <b>lenses.</b> This is a compromise as DA Limited lenses are usually made {{to be much more}} compact than other <b>primes</b> <b>lenses.</b> In August 2013 the DA Limited lenses were upgraded with Pentax new HD coating, replacing the previous smc coating. The new HD lenses are also available in both silver and black, as opposed to only black.|$|R
