However, information about laboratory and chairside polishing methods is still scarce. PURPOSE The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine the effects of laboratory and chairside polishing methods on the surface roughness (SR) and surface free energy (SFE) of PEEK, an autopolymerizing poly(methyl methacrylate), and a veneering composite resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS For each of the 3 materials, 80 specimens were prepared (N= 240) and divided into 7 polishing groups and 1 control group (n= 10). The 7 groups were split into 4 laboratory protocols: <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> (Abraso), a second <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> (Opal L), silicone polisher (Ceragum), and diamond grinder (Diagen-Turbo grinder). The other 3 groups were chairside protocols: rainbow technique (Super-Snap kit), <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> (Prisma gloss), and a polishing system (Enhance finishing). Machine polishing with SiC P 4000 served as the control treatment. The protocols' average SRs and SFEs were measured, and their surface topographies were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The logarithmically transformed data were analyzed using covariance analysis, 2 -way and 1 -way ANOVA, and partial correlation (α=. 05). RESULTS The polishing protocol exerted the highest influence on SR and SFE values (P<. 001; SR: partial eta squared ηP(2) =. 970; SFE: ηP(2) =. 450), followed by material group (P<. 001, SR: ηP(2) =. 319; SFE: ηP(2) =. 429). The interaction effect of the binary combinations of the 2 independent parameters (polishing protocol and material group) was also significant (P<. 001, SR: ηP(2) =. 681; SFE: ηP(2) =. 365).

30|$|The G is just adopted for {{approximately}} evaluating the graphitization, {{but not the}} exact graphite content in the diamond film, due {{to the neglect of}} different sensitivities of the Raman signal to the different carbon phases [44]. It is known that for the diamond films, especially for the MCD films with low initial graphite contents, the graphitization is obvious under some other polishing conditions. However, in the AFM process, the polished surface of the diamond coated milling cutter can only contact with the <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> made of the colloidal resin carrier, diamond particles, lubricant and the adherent agent, which hardly have catalytic function for the graphitization like the iron-group elements. Furthermore, because the interaction between the <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> and polished surface is not as severe as those in some other traditional polishing processes, so the grinding force of AFM is relatively small. Consequently, the temperature of the polished surface, which is measures as 30 ‒ 150  °C, is far below the graphitization temperature of the diamond film and the polishing temperatures in other techniques, such as thermo-chemical polishing, in which the temperature of the polished surface should be controlled as 450 ‒ 900  °C.|$|E

30|$|Also due to {{the above}} reasons, the {{required}} cycle times for polishing the surfaces of the different diamond coated milling cutters to thresholds are distinctive. Just adopting the flank face as the example, for the UMCD film with the largest grain size, the highest initial Ra value, the extremely high diamond purity and hardness, it takes almost 75 cycle times to reduce the Ra value to the threshold. Owing to the refinement of the diamond grain caused by the boron doping and the slight reduction of the initial Ra value, 60 cycle times of AFM can reduce its Ra value to the threshold. The change of the grain size from micro to nano, along with the subsequent reduction of the initial Ra value, diamond purity and hardness, contribute much to the polishing efficiency of the nano-sized surfaces. As a result, such the required cycle time for {{the three types of}} diamond films is 25. In addition, it is found that for any of the diamond coated milling cutter, the required cycle time for the rake face is generally less than that for the flank face, because the grinding force provided of the <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> restricted in the spiral groove is relatively larger than that provided by the <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> around the flank face.|$|E

The actual advantages that nano-sized fillers can provide to the surface smoothness and luster have not been supported yet by sufficient evidence. Effective polishing protocols presenting the fewest number of steps are demanded by clinicians {{in order to avoid}} waste of operative time. <b>Polishing</b> <b>pastes</b> have a better ability to reach irregular areas of restorations in comparison to semi-rigid rotating instruments. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the effectiveness of two simplified polishing systems with diamond abrasive pastes applied onto the surface of two nanohybrid composites. Materials and methods. Two nanohybrid resins were selected for the present experimentation, namely Filtek Supreme XT (3 M ESPE) and Herculite XRV Ultra (Kerr). Thirty discs per material were fabricated by pouring the resin into silicon molds with a height of 2 mm and a diameter of 4 mm, covering it with a Mylar strip and applying 60 s light cure with a halogen lamp at 600 mW/cm 2. For each material, the specimens were randomly allocated to a control unpolished group (n= 10) and two experimental groups (n= 10), which underwent finishing with 1200 P sandpaper. The experimental groups were subjected to further polishing with either one-step (Unigloss paste) or two-step (Diamond Polish Mint, Ultradent) diamond <b>polishing</b> <b>pastes.</b> Three linear roughness measurements (Ra) were performed on the surface of each specimen. Statistical analysis was carried out by non-parametric tests. The surface of polished specimens was assessed by means of scanning electron microscopy. Results. Under all experimental conditions, the surface roughness of the tested resins never exceeded the threshold to inhibit bacterial adhesion (0. 20 μm) and polished specimens exhibited surface smoothness that was similar to controls. The one-step system polished more efficiently the composite Herculite XRV Ultra than Filtek Supreme XT (p< 0. 05) and was more effective than the two-step system only when applied to Herculite XRV Ultra (p< 0. 001).

The present study aims to individuate a polishing protocol for a microhybrid composite using abrasive pastes with decreasing grit. Methods: Sixty composite discs (Filtek Z 250, 3 M ESPE, USA) were assigned to six experimental groups (n= 10), each one established to be the sequential step of a polishing protocol based on abrasive pastes (Diamond ACI, ACII and Excel, FGM, Brazil) : G 1, simulated finishing with 40 μm diamond bur; G 2, as G 1 + 75 - 80 μm paste; G 3, as G 2 + 30 - 35 μm; G 4, as G 3 + 2 - 4 μm; G 5 a, as G 4 + felt wheel; G 5 b, as G 4 + resin coating (Seal Coat Fast, DEI Italia, Italy) and felt wheel. The profilometric superficial parameter Sa was taken into account as measure of the roughness on the treated surfaces. Non-parametric statistical {{analysis was used to}} assess differences among groups (α= 0. 05).

When comparing the five different restorative materials, no significant difference was observed between FiltekP 60 and FiltekZ 250, and these materials demonstrated significantly less color change than Quadrant LC and the nanohybrid materials (Grandio, Filtek Supreme). The posterior (Filtek P 60) and universal (Filtek Z 250) composite resin restorative materials, which do not contain tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), were found to be less stainable than the nanohybrid (Grandio, Filtek Supreme) and universal (Quadrant LC) composite resins, which contain TEGDMA. The use of diamond <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> after polishing with polishing discs significantly decreased staining when compared to the groups that used polishing discs alone, for all restorative materials tested. The highest color change values were obtained for the specimens that were polished with the Biscover liquid polish system (PdB and PdPB groups) ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of different polishing techniques on the surface roughness of dental porcelains. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-five cylindirical specimens (15 x 2 mm) were prepared for each feldspathic (Vita VMK 95, Ceramco III) and low-fusing dental porcelain (Matchmaker). Fifty-five specimens of machinable feldspathic porcelain blocks (Vitablocs Mark II), (12 x 14 x 18 mm) were cut into 2 -mm-thick slices (12 x 14 mm) with low speed saw. The prepared specimens were divided into 11 groups (n= 5) representing different polishing techniques including control ((C) no surface treatment), glaze (G) and other 9 groups that were finished and polished with polishing discs (Sof-Lex) (Sl), two porcelain polishing kits (NTI (Pk), Dialite II (Di)), a diamond <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> (Sparkle) (Sp), a zirconium silicate based cleaning and polishing prophy paste (Zircate) (Zr), an aluminum oxide <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> (Prisma Gloss) (Pg), and combinations of them. The surface roughness of all groups was measured with a profilometer. The data were analyzed with a 2 -way analysis of variance, and the mean values were compared by the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test (a= 0. 05). RESULTS: For all porcelain material groups, the lowest Ra values were observed in Group Gl, Group Sl, Group Pk, and Group Di, which were not significantly different from each other (p> 0. 05). When comparing the 4 different porcelain materials, the machinable feldspathic porcelain block group (Mark II) demonstrated statistically significantly less Ra values than the other porcelain materials tested (p< 0. 05). No significant difference was observed between the VMK 95 and Ceramco III porcelain groups (p= 0. 919), also these groups demonstrated the highest Ra values. CONCLUSION: Subjected to surface roughness, the surfaces obtained with polishing and/or cleaning-prophy paste materials used alone were rougher compared to the surfaces finished using Sof-lex, Dialite, and NTI polishing kit. Polishing kits and discs were found more effective than the polishing pastes used alone or combined use with Sof-lex discs, thus improving surface smoothness...|$|E
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Surface-finishing {{protocols}} have {{a mechanical}} impact on ceramic surfaces that could eventually affect surface topography and light scattering. An optimum protocol {{is needed to}} avoid damaging the optical properties of ceramics. PURPOSE The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effects of different surface-finishing protocols on the surface roughness, color change, and translucency of ceramic and metal ceramic restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS Standardized disk-shaped specimens (1. 5 × 10 mm, n= 128) were fabricated from 3 different ceramic core materials (aluminum oxide [Al 2 O 3]-AL, zirconium oxide [ZrO 2]-ZR, lithium disilicate [Li 2 Si 2 O 5]-LIT), veneered (V) with dentin ceramics (n= 32 per group), and placed in the following groups: ALV, ZRV, and LITV. The metal ceramic group acted as the control (n= 32). Four different surface-finishing methods were tested. Airborne-particle abrasion with 50 μm Al 2 O 3, polishing with adjustment kit, polishing with adjustment kit plus diamond <b>polishing</b> <b>paste,</b> and autoglazing (n= 8 subgroup) were applied on the veneering ceramics. The specimens were analyzed with a profilometer for surface roughness, and color change and translucency were measured with a clinical spectrophotometer. Statistical analyses were performed with 1 -way ANOVA and the Tukey honest significant difference tests (α=. 05). RESULTS Specimens treated with the airborne particle abrasion method showed significantly higher mean profilometer for surface roughness values in all groups (P. 05). With the diamond <b>polishing</b> <b>paste</b> method, lower surface roughness values were achieved in the ZRV and metal ceramic groups acted as the control groups. Different surface-finishing methods affected the color change of the ceramic systems, except for ZRV. Surface-finishing protocols significantly affected the translucency values of the ALV, LITV, and metal ceramic groups (P<. 05). CONCLUSIONS No single surface-finishing protocol can be recommended to obtain the smoothest surface and the least color change without affecting translucency for the ceramics tested. The airborne-particle abrasion protocol created rougher surfaces and decreased translucency, and color change in zirconia was not affected by the finishing protocols...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} prophylactic <b>polishing</b> <b>pastes</b> on the roughness and translucency of lithium disilicate ceramic. Sixty specimens were obtained from e. max CAD blocks. After ground finishing, each specimen was glazed and randomly divided into one of five groups, including one control group. They were then polished with one of four types of prophylactic paste. Group A: Nupro coarse, group B: Nupro medium, group C: Nupro fine, and group D: Cleanic. Specimens were <b>polished</b> with these <b>pastes</b> for 2 minutes with a prophy cup mounted on the handpiece under a constant load of 400 gr at 3, 000 rpm. After polishing, the specimens were cleaned ultrasonically in distilled water and dried. The surface roughness (Ra, μm) was then measured using a surface profilometer. The translucency analysis was carried out on the glazed (control group) and polished specimens using a dental spectrophotometer. For each specimen, measurements were made once with a white and once with a black background. Group A showed significantly less surface roughness compared with the control group and groups B, C, and D. The control group showed significantly higher translucency compared with the other groups (P <. 05). Despite the good abrasion resistance of e. max CAD lithium disilicate ceramic, prophylactic pastes produced a reduction in translucency. Surface roughness varied depending on the <b>paste</b> used. <b>Polishing</b> procedures should be carried out with caution to not compromise the esthetics achieved with prosthetic restorations...|$|R
