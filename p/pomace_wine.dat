Grape pomace by-products, from wine-making, have some beneficial antioxidant compounds left in them after vinification and could be a cheap source of these compounds for value added products. One of the most common antioxidant groups found in grapes are the phenols. These antioxidants have the potential to reduce cardiovascular disease, prevent some cancers, have chemoprotective roles, reduce signs of skin aging, aid in glucose transport, and prevent other diseases such as iron storage disease (ISD). In this research, five Missouri red <b>wine</b> <b>pomace</b> samples were evaluated; Chambourcin, Grenache, Michigan, Norton and Vincent varieties. They were analyzed for total phenolic content using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, total condensed tannin content using the Vanillin-HCl assay, procyanidin degree of polymerization using normal-phase HPLC, iron-binding potential using the iron-binding phenolic capacity assay, and antioxidant activity using the ABTS and ORAC assays. The results showed that the vinification method applied to the grape variety greatly affected the pomace properties and composition.

Five pyrazines were successfully identified, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine being the most abundant. Although 2 -ethyl- 5 -methylpyrazine was in lower levels, it presented the highest odor units, due to its low threshold. RWPS enhanced the formation of the five identified pyrazines (2. 1 times), without relevant changes in the proportion between them. The highest increase was observed for 2 -ethyl- 6 -methylpyrazine (3 times higher than in control). These results were corroborated by electronic nose analysis, presenting RWPS beef patties higher odor intensities. Mechanisms to explain these effects are also proposed in the present work, and the high content of polyphenols seems to be the major cause of the observed results.
