50|$|The same year, a new African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) was presented, {{in order}} to build and {{strengthen}} African capacities for managing and resolving conflicts on the continent.

As associate members, PanWise includes the Forum of Former African Heads of State, the Association African Ombudesmen and Mediators (AAOM), national infrastructures for peace, national mediation councils, etc., as well as relevant African mediation associations/ institutions.When appropriate to {{the agenda of the}} PanWise, the AU Chairperson as well as African mediators Special Envoys, Special Representatives, Chief Mediators and their Mediation Teams shall be invited to participate in network activities. The establishment of the “Pan African Network of the Wise” is not prejudicial to the independence of each Panel, the confidentiality required of them as they perform their roles within their respective home organisations, as well their latitude in choosing partners, donors and other stakeholders. In conducting its activities, the “Pan African Network of the Wise” is at all times cognizant that its members may be actively engaged in preventive diplomacy, mediation and related activities with parties engaged in a dispute or conflict, and therefore discretion, respect for confidentiality and careful consultation with members on deliberations is observed. The successful establishment of the PanWise is a significant contribution to the Golden Jubilee of the OAU celebrated this year under the theme “Pan-Africanism and African Renaissance”. Indeed, it emphasizes and puts into practice the ideals of the Forefathers of the OAU, Pan-Africanism, solidarity and unity of purpose.|$|E

The paper first highlights the relevant provisions of the peace and security protocol of the African Union and then presents perspectives and proposals on the strategic and institutional dimensions of mediation...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the return}} to {{democratic}} governance in 1999, violent conflicts around identities including religion, ethnicity, indigene/settler differentiation and resource control remain a challenge to peace in Nigeria. Thus far, responses of government lack a normative framework to motivate consistent intervention and foster peace. While the 1999 Constitution identifies peace as a common aspiration, there is a deficit of a non-adversarial institutional mechanism to address violent identity related conflicts in Nigeria. Despite its limited relevance, the visible institution for conflict management is the court. This article argues {{the need for the}} establishment of a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wise,</b> a conflict and peace intervention mechanism, as an “essential” for Nigerian constitution. It then explores key considerations in terms of the composition, functions and legal status of intervention of the proposed panel for the management of violent conflicts associated with identity and fostering peace in Nigeria.

40|$|The African Union's <b>Panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wise</b> {{was inaugurated}} on 18 December 2007. The {{prospects}} of the Panel as a conflict prevention and peace and security promotion tool in the AU Peace and Security architecture may remain dim unless its concept is understood and the Panel is effectively operationalised. To this end therefore, the objectives {{of this study are}} as follows: (1) To examine the need for the Panel in the AU Peace and Security Architecture. (2) To examine the institutional design of the Panel. (3) To explore the prospective roles for the Panel in the AU Peace and Security Architecture. (4) To identify how the Panel can promote the internalisation of peace and security in Africa. The study will propose key strategies to improve the relevance of the Panel as a tool of the PSC in facilitating peaceful interventions and promotion of peace and security in Africa.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how the African Union (AU) has handled Africa's {{peace and security}} challenges since 2002, defines what has been successful and what remains aspirational. It does so by examining how the AU has responded, from using sanctions against coups, to deploying peacekeeping missions and mediating in conflicts. An African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) has developed since 2002, including a Peace and Security Council, an African Standby Force, a Continental Early Warning System and a <b>Panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wise.</b> This sounds impressive, but the operationalization record is patchy: AU-deployed missions have been fully dependent on external donors; harmonization is a major problem; serious questions remain over AU capacity; {{and some of the}} Regional Economic Communities (RECs) are developing at a quicker pace than the AU. Given these circumstances and its internal capacity deficit, the AU will likely struggle to exercise oversight of regional processes, including the development of regional standby force arrangements. APSA is clearly based on a liberal peace model, yet democratic systems, respect for human rights and good governance aren't always in place in African countries, and the self-interest of elites continues to be a constraint on APSA and its success. Over the last decade the AU has found a voice and, despite some setbacks, it has shown through AMISOM in Somalia that it is capable of conducting a successful peacemaking operation. Its biggest challenge is not making the decision to intervene or deploy forces, but the capacity of most African states to deploy effectively. APSA's dependence on external partners needs to diminish over the next decade if better African solutions are to be found to peace and security challenges in the continent. Yet, the internationalized nature of crises such as the one in Mali in 2012 – 13 requires international partnerships. Not all of Africa's security problems can be solved by Africa alone, but APSA does provide a vision framework for African and external partnership...|$|E
