5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefit</b> and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.|$|E

He can be {{contacted}} at michael. miller@drake. eduKnowledge about <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits</b> is necessary for consumers to choose appropriate health benefits plans in a consumer-directed health plan market. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe employees' knowledge of their <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> A one-group, cross-sectional survey of full-time university employees with a tiered pharmacy benefit was performed. Correct responses to knowledge questions were described individually and as an aggregate index score. Respondent understanding of pharmacy benefits was low to moderate. Specifically, knowledge of pharmacy benefits was most limited with respect to formulary management, cost sharing, and financial implications of out-of-network use and the selection of a branded or generic medication. Future research should refine methods for assessing knowledge of pharmacy benefits, explore knowledge of pharmacy benefits in diverse samples, and assess the consequences associated with variations in knowledge of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> Copyright 2005 by Medicom International.

25|$|Since its {{relaunch}} in 2001, the Alliance {{has been}} very active politically. It fought against the Republican-endorsed Medicare <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefit</b> in 2005, and President George W. Bush's Social Security privatization-reform plan in 2004. The Alliance endorsed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009, and protested against Rep.

25|$|In the House, Cardin was {{involved}} with fiscal issues, pension reform, and health care. His legislation {{to increase the amount}} individuals can store in their 401k plans and IRAs was passed in 2001.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{estimate}} {{a structural}} demand model for <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits</b> by Medicare beneficiaries {{using data from}} the Medicare HMO program. I then use the utility parameter estimates to explore other questions of interest relating to the elderly's demand for <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> In Chapter 1, I study the question of how much Medicare beneficiaries value <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> Using data from the Medicare HMO program, I find that Medicare beneficiaries are willing to pay $ 33 to increase their brand-name coverage limit by $ 100. I also estimate marginal cost for each HMO and regress it on <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> I find that raising brand-name coverage by $ 100 costs $ 30. These estimates suggest that Medicare HMO enrollees are less than average <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> users and the results give a lower bound for the welfare derived by the elderly from <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> Chapter 2 addresses the question of how Medicare HMOs' choices of premiums and benefits affect selection. Changes in demographic factors (a measure of risk based on beneficiaries' characteristics) and risk scores (a measure based on beneficiaries' inpatient diagnoses) in the fee-for-service sector are regressed on changes in premiums and benefits in the HMO sector. The results show that increasing premiums and lowering benefits raise the demographic factor but have no effect on the risk score, suggesting that beneficiaries in more expensive demographic categories switch out of HMOs when premiums rise and benefits fall but these beneficiaries are healthy for their demographic category. (cont.) Chapter 3 measures the welfare loss from the withdrawals from the HMO program following the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, using the utility parameter estimates from Chapter 1. The changes to the Medicare HMO program in the Balanced Budget Act triggered many plan withdrawals from the program. The welfare and costs are calculated under two counterfactual scenarios. The results show that the Medicare HMO program generates more welfare than costs and that the withdrawals resulted in a net loss for society. The estimates of the loss range from $ 4. 3 billion to $ 16. 6 billion. by Anne Elizabeth Hall. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Economics, 2005.

40|$|Medicare {{had tried}} to {{incorporate}} outpatient <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> into their <b>benefits</b> regime for many years. Medicare <b>Prescription</b> <b>Drug,</b> Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 is the most recent success after the repealed Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. There {{have been a lot}} of discussion and concerns about the effect of the <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> legislation about whether it creates big windfall profits for the private sectors. This thesis uses event study to investigate the economic effect of the Medicare legislations of 1988 and 2003 on two types of industries—pharmaceutical and health insurance. The event study uses daily stock return data from CRSP and analyzes the abnormal returns associated with important information about the <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> The empirical results suggest no evidence that the <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> legislation of covering outpatient drugs has led to expectations of windfall profits from the pharmaceutical and health insurance companies that significantly boost their stock prices. As far as abnormal returns are concerned, the cross-sectional analysis indicates that larger firms and better leveraged firms withstood the impact of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> legislation better than their smaller and heavily debt financed peers. The empirical results also suggest that whether the <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>benefits</b> are administered privately or publicly can influence the relevant industries differently. ...|$|R
