40|$|One of {{the most}} vital parts of the beekeeper's work is the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> for outdoor wintering. No other phase of {{beekeeping}} has so direct an influence on the honey crop of the following season. The apiary should be located in a protected place and the colonies should not be moved {{at the time of}} packing. Directions are given in this bulletin for the proper arrangement of the apiary to prevent confusion due to the shifting of hives. The amount and character of the packing materials and the most economical type of packing cases are discussed. A schedule of dates for packing and unpacking the hives is presented for all parts of the United States, and the amount and character of winter stores are indicated. It is important that none of the factors of good wintering be omitted, and several tests are given so that the beekeeper may determine whether his bees are wintering properly. " [...] p. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{detailed}} {{protocol for}} chemical clearing of bee specimens is presented. Dry specimens {{as well as}} those preserved in liquid media can be cleared using this protocol. The procedure consists of a combined use of alkaline solution (KOH or NaOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), followed by the boiling of the cleared specimens in 60 – 70 % EtOH. Clearing is particularly useful for internal skeletal morphological research. This procedure allows for efficient study of internal projections of the exoskeleton (e. g., apodemes, furcae, phragmata, tentoria, internal ridges and sulci), but this process makes external features of the integument, as some sutures and sulci, readily available for observation as well. Upon completion of the chemical clearing process the specimens can be stored in glycerin. This procedure was developed and evaluated for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> and other Apoidea, but modifications for use with other insect taxa should be straightforward after some experimentation on variations of timing of steps, concentration of solutions, temperatures, and the necessity of a given step. Comments on the long-term storage, morphological examination, and photodocumentation of cleared specimens are also provided...|$|E

40|$|In food industry, {{especially}} among the brewers, using of natural ingredients is increasingly growing demand. Beer {{is one of the}} most popular beverages in the world with evident positive effects on the overall health condition. It can be used as a base for developing a variety of products with specific physiological activity. Bee pollen is considered to be one of the possible sources of active ingredients for that purpose. Activity of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in bee pollen can contribute to the antioxidant potential of beer. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of different types and content <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> pollen on the antioxidant properties of malt beverages and to compare phenolic and flavonoid profiles. The technological process <b>of</b> malt beverages <b>preparation</b> with addition <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> pollen was also verified. It was found out that all beverages enriched with bee pollen had higher polyphenol, flavonoid content and antioxidant potential than control sample – pure wort. The higher antioxidant activities of all extracts was measured in sample R 2 - wort with 0. 6 % of dry rapeseed pollen and sample R 4 - wort with 0. 6 % of frozen rapeseed pollen. The higher phenolic content than in other samples was measured in sample M 4 - wort with 0. 6 % of frozen poppy pollen and sample M 1 - wort with 0. 256 % of dry poppy pollen. Higher total flavonoid content was found out in sample M 2 - wort with 0. 6 % of dry poppy pollen and M 4 - wort with 0. 6 % of frozen poppy pollen.

The geographical races can be discriminated by morphomertrical differences and for an exact analysis of their characters (Gromisz and Przychodzen 1981). Bee glands {{play an important role}} in bees life particularly for food material products 9 Dade, 1962). The hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands produce important proteins rich food in honey bee works as royal jelly. The hypopharyngeal glands <b>of</b> old <b>bees</b> produced digestive enzymes for honey ripping process (Nour, 1986). The development and physiological activity of the food glands vary with the work <b>of</b> the <b>bees,</b> the glands being fully functional when the worker is serving in the hive as a nurse bee feeding larvae and queens (Snodgrass, 1956). Graham (1992) stated that healthy bees are able to perform their normal activities including bee milk, enzymes and venom products. Varroa mite infesting worker bees caused severe damage to hypopharyngeal, mandibular and head salivary glands (Zakaria, 2002). Measurements of the hypopharyngeal glands are often used to describe the physiological status <b>of</b> honey <b>bee</b> workers and consider arbitrary scale classification and have been estimated by different methods, such as acinus size (Wang and Moeller, 1971 & Hrassning and Crailsheim, 1998).
