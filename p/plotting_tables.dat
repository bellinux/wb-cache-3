5|$|Initially, the {{operations}} room at RAF Uxbridge was disturbed by {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Most of the <b>plotting</b> <b>tables</b> were bare, save for a few plots indicating German reconnaissance machines. Most of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) were relaxing, in spite of Churchill’s presence (he had ordered that they not behave any differently). However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile. The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the south that 40-plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace.|$|E
50|$|Observers at {{the coast}} post of Dymchurch {{identified}} {{the very first}} of these weapons and within seconds of their report the anti-aircraft defences were in action. This new weapon gave the ROC much additional work both at posts and operations rooms. Eventually RAF controllers actually took their radio equipment to the two closest ROC operations rooms at Horsham and Maidstone, and vectored fighters direct from the ROC's <b>plotting</b> <b>tables.</b> The critics who had said that the Corps {{would be unable to}} handle the fast-flying jet aircraft were answered when these aircraft on their first operation were actually controlled entirely by using ROC information both on the coast and at inland.|$|E
50|$|This {{new weapon}} gave the ROC much {{additional}} work, both at posts and control centres. RAF fighter controllers temporarily moved their radio equipment into the operations rooms of ROC control centres at Horsham and Maidstone {{in order to}} direct fighters to intercept V-1 flying bombs using information displayed on ROC <b>plotting</b> <b>tables.</b> Critics who had earlier claimed that the ROC {{would be unable to}} assist the new fast-flying Gloster Meteor jet aircraft were answered when these aircraft, on their first operational combat sorties to intercept V-1s, were controlled entirely using ROC derived information. The optimism shown by the then Commandant ROC, Air Cdre Crerar, that the ROC would cope with this new technology was well and truly vindicated.|$|E

50|$|Initially, entry was {{confined}} to the few service trades then open to women, namely MT Driver, Equipment Assistant, Cook, Clerk and Mess and Kitchen Staff. A small number of fabric workers were also employed. By August 1939, the following additional trades were authorised: Teleprinter Operators, Telephone Operators and Plotters. It was in these latter trades that women’s natural temperament gave them a clear advantage over men, and in which they made {{a significant contribution to}} the Battle of Britain. Hardly a photograph or film of those days, showing the WAAF manning the radar stations and <b>plotting</b> <b>tables</b> could fail to evoke memories of those brave women, most of whom would have been recruited and trained as original part-time pre-war auxiliaries, including some who worked on the balloon squadrons as fabric workers or, later in the war, handling the balloons themselves.|$|E
5000|$|In larger {{ships and}} submarines, fire control calculators gave a wider {{engagement}} envelope. Originally, <b>plotting</b> <b>tables</b> (in large ships), combined with specialised slide rules (known in U.S. service as the [...] "banjo" [...] and [...] "Is/Was"), reconciled the speed, distance, and {{course of a}} target with the firing ship's speed and course, together {{with the performance of}} its torpedoes, to provide a firing solution. By the Second World War, all sides had developed automatic electro-mechanical calculators, exemplified by the U.S. Navy's Torpedo Data Computer. Submarine commanders were still expected to be able to calculate a firing solution by hand as a backup against mechanical failure, and because many submarines existing {{at the start of the}} war were not equipped with a TDC; most could keep the [...] "picture" [...] in their heads and do much of the calculations (simple trigonometry) mentally, from extensive training.|$|E

50|$|The {{system had}} some weaknesses. The line was {{composed}} {{of a series of}} contiguous boxes. The boundaries were defined by Würzburg radar. The awkwardness of the plotting system used within each box prior to 1942 and the absence of an air-mounted IFF (Identification Friend or Foe), meant that only one fighter at a time could be controlled from the ground. One Würzburg controlled the fighter, the other tracked the bomber. The two plots were not represented on a single radarscope; they came from two different individual operators, each of whom projected a different coloured circle on a <b>plotting</b> <b>table.</b> The controller radioed directions to the fighter on the basis of data provided by the <b>plotting</b> <b>table.</b> Until IFF became available, blips could not be identified.|$|R

50|$|The {{system was}} based upon signals {{radiated}} by the FuG25 and picked up by two Freya stations. The operator of the first Freya plotted {{the course of the}} bomber and the second Freya took over for the final bomb/flare release run. Operators transmitted information by Morse code using terminology borrowed from the night fighter force. Prior to take-off crews were given a course and height to the target. The height was rigidly adhered to since it could not be checked by ground control. After take-off the FuG25 was switched on and the first Freya plotted the aircraft's course using the single letter recognition code transmitted from the bomber. The range and bearing was passed by the Freya operators to the <b>plotting</b> <b>table.</b> The <b>plotting</b> <b>table</b> was a transparent map of the operations area laid on a glass screen. The bomber was represented by a red spot from a projector connected to the Freya. The pathfinder's course could be observed and corrected. Course correction instructions were picked up in the aircraft through a FuG16 set.|$|R
