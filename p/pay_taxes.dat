5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the {{original}} draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer was to learn {{that he was a}} Native American, and would try to exploit it to not have to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes.</b> The idea had been going well for a few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes.</b> When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas.|$|E

5|$|Major issues {{brought up}} during the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's stimulus plan, which Tedisco did not take a stance on {{until late in the}} race. Murphy supported it while Tedisco eventually opposed it. Tedisco portrayed Murphy's support of the plan as a potential cause of the AIG bonus scandal. Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> on a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.|$|E

5|$|After his {{conquest of}} Bulgaria, Basil II {{prevented}} revolts and discontent by retaining {{the rule of}} the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> in gold, allowing them to be paid in kind instead. He also allowed the Bulgarian Patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status and all its dioceses, but reduced it to an archbishopric. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qassam's militia grew when it {{was joined}} by another militia based in the {{mountains}} {{following the death of}} its commander Umar al-Bitar. However, as the French tightened their control of the area, they were able to successfully pressure several of Jableh's major landowners to drop their financial support for al-Qassam and <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> to the French Mandate government. This further isolated al-Qassam who decided to flee Mount Sahyun for Aleppo in May 1920. There he and his fighters joined ranks with Ibrahim Hananu who was leading attacks against the French Army until the latter captured Jisr ash-Shugur in July. As a result of this French victory and the impending capitulation of Aleppo, al-Qassam and members of his unit fled past French Army lines with forged passports to Tartus.|$|E

Prior to his election as attorney general, railroads had never paid taxes in the state of West Virginia. White instituted proceedings to tax all the railroads within the state. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company obtained an injunction against the levying of the taxes, leading to a judicial test case. White argued the case first in the lower courts, and then before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, which ruled in White's favor. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the ruling of the state supreme court, which compelled the railroads to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> to the state.|$|E

The Force Publique, the colonial gendarmerie, used force against the rioters—at least 49 people were killed, and total casualties may have been as high as 500. The nationalist parties' influence expanded outside the major cities for the first time, and nationalist demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over the next year, bringing large numbers of black people from outside the évolué class into the independence movement. Many blacks began to test {{the boundaries of the}} colonial system by refusing to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> or abide by minor colonial regulations.

The voting right became tied to a property qualification; to be eligible to vote, a noble had to own or lease land and <b>pay</b> <b>taxes,</b> or be closely related to another who did. Some 300,000 out of 700,000 otherwise eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure. A document from 1792 lists only 47 sejmiks.|$|E
