40|$|There {{are nearly}} 200 cyclist road {{deaths a year}} in the Netherlands. They are, therefore, the largest group of {{so-called}} vulnerable road users. The Netherlands has with 18 %, therefore, also the highest European Union percentage cyclist road deaths of all road deaths. Where motor vehicles are the crash opponent of cyclists, 80 % of these opponents are cars. The most common collision type is the crash in which the cyclist is hit in the flank by the front of a car. This study has concentrated on this collision type. For this study, the summons form was used to supplement the data from the standard <b>police</b> <b>registration</b> <b>form.</b> The accident analysis used the data of 209 crashes in which 10 cyclists were killed and 199 were in-patients. The number of analyzed summons forms was 32. In many cases, nothing was known {{about the nature of the}} cyclists' injuries, but it became clear that the cyclist's head was often injured. Head injury was more common among those killed than among the in-patients; the contact place was often the windscreen and the car roof. In general, cyclist casualties usually hit the windscreen and the roof in crashes on roads with a speed limit of 80 km/h and higher. A literature study confirmed these findings. In addition, it illustrated that pedestrians more often strike the bonnet with the head than the windscreen and its frame as is the case for cyclists. This report also discusses the requirements that, from 2005, will be valid for new cars. These requirements are based on collisions of motor vehicles and pedestrians, and not on those between motor vehicles and cyclists. The vehicle parts that are often hit by cyclists (the windscreen and its frame) are, however, not covered by the new requirements. With regard to these new requirements, we recommend additional research of the contacts with the windscreen and its frame. A proposal to evaluate the new requirements by means of EU research is supported inasmuch as it is not limited it to collisions with pedestrians, but also includes collisions with cyclists. In order to reduce the severity of collisions with cyclists (and pedestrians), what is needed is not only intervention in the construction of the vehicle front, but also measures to reduce the driving and, thus, the collision speeds. A collision speed of 30 km/h provides cyclists (and pedestrians) with a good chance of not incurring any severe injury. The layout of the infrastructure, and (in due time) the installation of locally controlled in-vehicle speed limiters, can result in a driving speed of 30 km/h...|$|E
40|$|The 'TRIPOD' {{method has}} been {{developed}} for analysing safety on the industrial shop floor. This paper discusses whether the 'TRIPOD' method {{can also be used}} to analyse traffic accidents. This method considers accidents as end results of causal chains of events. The 'TRIPOD' philosophy is that: (1) latent errors are the most fundamental causes of accidents; and (2) a safety strategy should be directed at these causes. This study used 50 accident descriptions. These consisted of the original Dutch Road Accident <b>Registration</b> (VOR) <b>forms,</b> and of the official police reports. The results show that the largest source of traffic accidents are: (I) road design errors; (II) bad traffic measures; and (III) the presence of errors inducing circumstances, for instance errors due to the layout of the road traffic system that insufficiently takes the functioning of older people into account. The results of the study suggest that the application of the 'TRIPOD' method to both <b>police</b> <b>registration</b> <b>forms</b> and official <b>police</b> reports causes a lot of reliability problems. However, the method can be a useful tool to analyse accidents, provided that additional data are collected and the required expertise is obtained via team work...|$|R
40|$|In 2006 {{the number}} of road deaths in the {{province}} of Zeeland suddenly increased when compared with the previous years. This increase was reason for the Regional Road Traffic Safety Authority of Zeeland to request SWOV to analyse the available data to find out how this could have happened, and to make policy recommendations based on these results. Two types of analysis were carried out. The first was an analysis of the <b>police</b> road crash <b>registration</b> BRON as processed by the Transport Research Centre of the Ministry of Transport. The second analysis was an in-depth analysis using the completed <b>police</b> <b>registration</b> <b>forms</b> and summonses for serious crashes in Zeeland in 2006. In the in-depth analysis 281 crashes were studied. First of all, a rough analysis was made to determine which crash types, with regard to origin and course, were the most frequent, and which road users were involved. We then analysed the course of the most important crash types: which factors contributed to the crashes coming about and why didn't the road users involved intervene? The two most common crash types in Zeeland were those in which a driver/rider lost control of the vehicle (30 %) and those in which no access or priority was given to another road user (25 %). The first type of crashes is the most serious: 18 % of these were fatal. The policy recommendations are based on the in-depth analysis of the most common crash types, with regard to their origin and course. Effective measures that the province can take are mainly in the fields of infrastructure, local regulations, enforcement, and the road users themselves. Some of these measures have already been taken in Zeeland, or are already being tested...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a preliminary study into the bicycle features' {{influence on the}} incidence and outcome of road accidents in the Netherlands. Two monographs were carried out: (1) a series of measurements to assess the quality of bicycles in use (so-called quality measurements) including a market exploration of new bicycles; and (2) a dossier study into accident <b>registration</b> <b>forms.</b> The quality measurements were {{carried out in the}} form of about 100 extensive measurements (involving the rider) and approximately 500 abbreviated measurements. The bicycles' quality and maintenance assessment was performed by comparing the study objects with the equivalent bicycle in new condition. The results indicate a series of quality and maintenance problems. Lighting scored relatively poorest, while the frame scored relatively highest. Regarding newly sold bicycles, statistical data contributed by the Netherlands Association of Bicycle and Automobile Industry (RAI) /Stichting Fiets was used. An aim was to determine the distribution, according to type and the associated development. The dossier study took place using copies of the 1990 and 1991 <b>police</b> accident <b>registration</b> <b>forms.</b> These forms did not offer the anticipated further information about bicycles to a sufficient degree. Further study should be performed using the Consumer Safety Institute Private Accident Registration System (PORS) file...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{the first phase of}} {{research}} into the outcome of road accidents in which a car end up in the water. Accident and injury data for 1983 - 2000 from the road accident registration of the Basic Data Department of the Transport Research Centre (AVV-BG) was analysed. This to determine the present size, nature, and severity of such accidents. According to the 1997 - 2000 data there were 50 injury accidents a year in which a car ended up in deep water. There was an average of 22 deaths a year. There was an average of 750 injury accidents in which a car ended up in a ditch or gulley, resulting in an average of 40 deaths a year. Based on the <b>police</b> accident <b>registration</b> <b>forms,</b> it is estimated that in this annual total of 62 road deaths, drowning was the cause of death in more than 30 cases. This number is confirmed by the Cause of Death statistics of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). During the whole period of 18 years (1983 - 2000) there was a decrease of circa 20 % of the number of fatal accidents ending up in deep water. This decrease is less than the general, national decrease of circa 35 % in the total number of road deaths from car accidents during the same period. In comparison with the average car accident, accidents in which cars end up in deep water have a greater severity, occur more on rural roads and on 80 km/h roads, and occur much more often in certain provinces and municipalities than in others. Accidents in which cars end up in deep water or a ditch/gulley occur more often during weekends, hours of darkness, in winter, and during periods of snow and fog. They are more often single vehicle accidents, i. e. no other road users were involved. The drivers of cars ending up in deep water or a ditch/gulley are more often young, more often male, and more often while driving under influence. The victims of these accidents are also more often male and young. For part II see C 25603 (ITRD E 206740) ...|$|R
