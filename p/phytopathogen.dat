40|$|Antagonistic fungus i. e. Trichoderma viride {{was tested}} in vitro against seven <b>phytopathogens</b> viz., Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, Macrophimina phaseolina, Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, Paecilomyces varoti and {{sclerotium}} rolfsii. Trichoderma viride exhibited the antagonistic effect against these <b>phytopathogens.</b> Under dual culture the hyphal {{growth of the}} <b>phytopathogens</b> was inhibited at the zone of contact with the hyphae of the antagonist. Microscopic examination revealed that hyphal tips of <b>phytopathogens</b> swelled and become curved. The advancing hyphae of T. viride covered the entire petriplates after 6 - 7 days of incubation. The <b>phytopathogens</b> could not be reisolated from {{any part of the}} overgrown plates. Two type of mechanism of action is seen i. e. mycoparasitism and antibiosis. Trichoderma viride showed strong mycoparasitism against A. niger A. fumigatus and F. oxysporum, whereas medium intensity of mycoparasitism was shown against P. varioti, F. soloni and M. phaseolina. Trichoderma viride also showed antibiosis against S. rolfsii. Among the seven <b>phytopathogens</b> tested A. niger, A. fumigatus and F. oxysporum were found to be more sensitive to R. viride and were completely inhibited followed by P. varioti, F. solani, M. phaseolina and S. rolfsii.

50|$|Fasciation can {{be caused}} by {{hormonal}} imbalances in the meristematic cells of plants, which are cells where growth can occur. Fasciation can also be caused by random genetic mutation. Bacterial and viral infections can also cause fasciation. The bacterial <b>phytopathogen</b> Rhodococcus fascians has been demonstrated as one cause of fasciation, such as in sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) plants, but many fasciated plants have tested negative for the bacteria in studies, hence bacterial infection is not an exclusive causation.|$|E

The Bacillus cereus group (consisting of B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. mycoides, and B. anthracis) was found to contain nine genes homologous to the AiiA gene that encode AHL-inactivating enzymes, with the catalytic zinc-binding motif conserved in all cases. In the <b>phytopathogen</b> A. tumefaciens, AiiB lactonase acts as a fine modulator that essentially delays the release of lactone OC8-HSL and the resultant number of tumors produced by the pathogen.

The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocontrol of Xanthomonas vesicatoria) Alternaria solani) by the epiphytic bacteria Paenibacillus macerans and Bacillus pumilus. Tomato plants were previously sprayed with epiphytic bacteria, benzalkonium chloride and PBS buffer and, after four days, they were inoculated with A. solani and X. vesicatoria. To determine the phytopathogenic bacteria population, leaflet samples were collected from each treatment every 24 hours, for seven days, and plated on semi-selective medium. The effect of epiphytic bacteria over <b>phytopathogens</b> was performed by the antibiosis test and antagonistic activity measured by inhibition zone diameter. The epiphytic and benzalkonium chloride drastically reduced the severity of early blight and bacterial spot {{in comparison to the}} control (PBS). In detached leaflets, the epiphytic bacteria reduced in 70 % the number of phytopathogenic bacteria cells in the phylloplane.

50|$|Although most mycoviruses {{often do}} not seem to disturb their host’s fitness, this does not {{necessarily}} mean they are living unrecognized by their hosts. A neutral co-existence might just be the result of a long co-evolutionary process. Accordingly, symptoms may only appear when certain conditions of the virus-fungus-system change and get out of balance. This could be external (environmental) as well as internal (cytoplasmic). It is not known yet why some mycoviruses-fungus-combinations are typically detrimental while others are asymptomatic or even beneficial. Nevertheless, harmful effects of mycoviruses are economically interesting, especially if the fungal host is a <b>phytopathogen</b> and the mycovirus could be exploited as biocontrol agent. The best example is represented by the case of CHV1 and C. parasitica. Other examples of deleterious effects of mycoviruses are the ‘La France’ disease of Agaricus biporus and the mushroom diseases caused by Oyster mushroom spherical virus and Oyster mushroom isometric virus.|$|E

The laboratory tests showed that the minimal inhibitory concentration, on aver-age, was equal to 2. 5 mg mL- 1 of total polyphenols expressed as caffeic acid. The trials per-formed by placing the polyphenols in contact with the bacterial cultures showed that the phe-nolic compounds reacted with the protein of the bacterial cells wall disrupting them. The SDS-PAGE analysis performed with crude extracts of X. campestris confirmed that the phe-nolic compounds of the OMWW are able to react with the bacterial proteins, producing a very strong protein-cross-linking and protein-denaturing effect. The disinfection trials of cauliflower seeds used for greenhouse plant production showed that the OMWW are able to control completely the seed-borne <b>phytopathogen</b> X. campestris without damaging the ger-minability of the crucifer seeds and the metallic greenhouse structures.
