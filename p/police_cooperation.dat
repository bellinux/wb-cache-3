The police serve as border guards for the outer border of the Schengen Area. The busiest are Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which has 130 man-years tied to it, Storskog on the Russian border and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. These are the only borders with designated border employees—all other are manned with regular officers. The police is not responsible for customs, which {{is the responsibility of}} the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities. Norway participates in a series of international <b>police</b> <b>cooperation,</b> such as Interpol, Europol, the Schengen Information System, Frontex, and the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime. Norway also has a close cooperation with the other Nordic police forces. The Norwegian Police Service occasionally participates in international operations.|$|E
5|$|The National Police Directorate, {{located in}} Downtown Oslo, {{is the central}} {{administration}} for the Norwegian Police Service. It conducts management and supervision of the specialist agencies and police districts, including organizational development and support activities. The directorate {{is led by the}} National Police Commissioner, who, since 2012, has been Odd Reidar Humlegård. The National Criminal Investigation Service is a national unit which works with organized and serious crime. It both works as an assistant unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, in addition to being responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for international <b>police</b> <b>cooperation,</b> including participation in Interpol and Europol. The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime is responsible for complex cases of economic crime and acts as a public prosecutor for those cases. The National Police Immigration Service registers and identifies asylum seekers and returns those which have their applications rejected. The National Mobile Police Service is based in Stavern and operates throughout the country. Their primary role is as highway patrol and manages the police reserves, although they also assist police districts in extraordinary events where extra manpower is needed or where they are in the vicinity.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} four EU member statesBulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romaniaare {{obliged to}} eventually join the Schengen Area. However, before fully implementing the Schengen rules, each state must have its preparedness assessed in four areas: air borders, visas, <b>police</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and personal data protection. This evaluation process involves a questionnaire and visits by EU experts to selected institutions and workplaces {{in the country}} under assessment.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{approach}} level, meaning, purpose and benefit of personal data protection in their processing within <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> in the EU. In the introduction the fundamental issues of personal data protection {{in the context of}} the EU and the Czech republic are defined, focusing on terminology and explanations of current issues, particularly the area of biometric data and data retention. Extra attention is also given to the conflict of the right to privacy, and the related right to personal data protection and protection of public interests and safety. After that the thesis deals with a performing of <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> in the EU through specific subjects, in particular Europol and Eurojust.

40|$|Globalization {{presents}} an important opportunity for police and justice officials {{around the world}} to cooperate with one another to bring offenders of serious transnational organized crime to justice. Numerous trends and developments are emerging in Europe—especially in the cross-border Meuse–Rhine Euregion, where the three countries of Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany meet. Indeed, the police and justice officials of the Meuse–Rhine Euregion are acknowledged as the “pioneers” of routine cross-border <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation,</b> and due to various factors, their work is arguably among the most long-standing, advanced, and intense in the world. Despite an expanding legal framework, however, operational problems still arise in practice. Therefore, one question becomes: how may international <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The Meuse–Rhine Euregion frames this multi-site case study, which uses the Organizational Behavior (OB) approach to examine the state-of-the-art. Specifically, the analysis of scholarly literature, international law, and in-depth personal interviews with 44 English-speaking police detectives, senior police commanders, prosecutors, and examining magistrates from 21 organizations across the three countries in this Euregion provides the data to answer this study’s four main research questions, namely: (1) What is the status quo with respect to international <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; (2) How does the process of international <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion operate in practice, according to police and justice officials?; (3) What variables affect (facilitate/impede) international <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; and (4) How can international <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The findings of this study may help improve international <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, and inspire similar cooperative efforts around the world...|$|R

2500|$|Europol has {{its origins}} in TREVI, a forum for {{security}} cooperation created amongst European Community interior and justice ministers in 1976. At first, TREVI focused on international terrorism, but soon started to cover other areas of cross-border crime within the Community. At the European Summit in Luxembourg on 28–29 June 1991, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called {{for the creation of a}} European police agency similar to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)—thus sowing the seeds of <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> across Europe. At the Summit, the European Council agreed to establish [...] "a Central European Criminal Investigations Office (Europol) by 31 December 1993 the latest." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of the}} Luxembourg Summit {{was further}} {{elaborated}} at the European Council in Maastricht on 9–10 December 1991, a meeting to draft the Maastricht Treaty. The European Council agreed to create [...] "a European police office (Europol) the initial function {{of which would be}} to organize exchange of information on narcotic drugs". The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office. On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed: Member States shall regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs cooperation, in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the Schengen Information System was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of Jürgen Storbeck and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in World War II by police and intelligence agencies and after the War manned by the Dutch State Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.|$|E
40|$|Policing is {{regarded}} as an important mechanism for maintaining cooperation in human and animal social groups. A simple model providing a theoretical overview of the coevolution of <b>policing</b> and <b>cooperation</b> has been analyzed by Frank (1995, 1996 b, 2003, 2009), and this suggests that policing will evolve to fully suppress cheating within social groups when relatedness is low. Here, we relax some of the assumptions made by Frank, and investigate the consequences for <b>policing</b> and <b>cooperation.</b> First, we address the implicit assumption that the individual cost of investment into policing is reduced when selfishness dominates. We find that relaxing this assumption leads to policing being favored only at intermediate relatedness. Second, we address the assumption that policing fully recovers the loss of fitness incurred by the group owing to selfishness. We find that relaxing this assumption prohibits the evolution of full policing. Finally, we consider the impact of demography on the coevolution of <b>policing</b> and <b>cooperation,</b> in particular the role for kin competition to disfavor the evolution of policing, using both a heuristic "open" model and a "closed" island model. We find that large groups and increased kin competition disfavor policing, and that policing is maintained more readily than it invades. Policing may be harder to evolve than previously thought...|$|R

40|$|<b>Policing</b> and {{judicial}} <b>cooperation</b> across international borders {{is now an}} expectation, with strategies to combat terrorism, organized and serious crime, as well as domestic crime problems, increasingly incorporate the exchange of forensic information and intelligence between nations. While networks of <b>policing</b> <b>cooperation</b> are not novel, their powers and capabilities have been growing {{in recent years and}} bilateral and multi-lateral agreements to exchange data between countries continue apace. With increasing demand for, and mechanisms enabling the extra-territorial exchange of evidence under mutual legal assistance, as well as direct law enforcement exchange of data there are increasing numbers of criminal investigations where evidence may have been collected, examined, or interpreted in a different country. Since the Prum Treaty of 2005, the exchange of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data (fingerprints) and vehicle registration data has become both automated, and mandatory across the EU. This exchange of evidence, highlights some of the wider issues raised by the exchange of scientific evidence for use in criminal proceedings undertaken in a different jurisdiction from that where the evidence emanated. Such exchange mechanisms raise not just technical issues, but questions of principle that need consideration as the international exchange of forensic information and intelligence is set to increase exponentially...|$|R
