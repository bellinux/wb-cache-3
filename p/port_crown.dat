The abundant water of this stream provides power for large corn mills and several factories, and also supplies the town, with its numerous fountains and irrigated gardens. Blida is surrounded by a wall of considerable extent, pierced by six gates, and is further defended by <b>Port</b> Mimieh, <b>crowning</b> a steep hill on the left bank of the river.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of federation, to allay fears {{that it would have}} too much {{influence}} in the federal government, New South Wales had agreed to surrender territory for the federal capital and to allow it access to the sea.

In 1915 the jurisdiction over the Jervis Bay Territory was also surrendered to the Commonwealth. [...] NSW also granted to Commonwealth permission to build a rail corridor linking the two territories but this was never implemented.|$|R
50|$|The crown {{sought to}} control trade and {{emigration}} to its overseas territories via the House of Trade (Casa de Contratación), based in Seville. Officials in Seville registered ships’ cargoes and passengers {{bound for the}} Indies (as the crown {{to the end of}} the colonial era called its territories) and upon arrival in New World <b>ports,</b> other <b>crown</b> officials inspected cargo and passengers. In Mexico, the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz, New Spain's oldest Spanish city and main port, and the Pacific coast port of Acapulco, the terminus of the Manila Galleon were busy when ships were in port, but they did not have large numbers of Spanish settlers in large part due to their disagreeable tropical climate.|$|R
40|$|This picture {{represents}} the barnyard of the Commissary Department of the Japanese Army before Port Arthur. Here were kept the few ducks which {{on special occasions}} furnished an extra dish for the highest officers, who generally had the same fare as the officers and men. This place was {{not far from the}} shore where the tiny stream emptied into the sea, thus avoiding the soiling of the water by the ducks, where it was needed for drinking and cooking purposes. The bare trees indicate that this picture was taken in the fall. At the left in the background looms one of the hills around <b>Port</b> Arthur, <b>crowned</b> with a Russian fort.

50|$|The island {{supports}} {{a population of}} about 750, growing at 3.1% per year. The main settlement is Makata. The principal economic activity is subsistence agriculture. The GDP of the island is $457 per capita. Unlike the surrounding islands populated by Melanesians, Emae and Makura are Polynesian outliers. The island's language, also called Emae, is in the Futunic language family, which includes most of the outliers. North Efate, one of the other languages of the archipelago, is used as a second language. Many of the islanders now live in <b>Port</b> Vila. The <b>crowning</b> of four Emae chiefs in 2004 occurred there, and many of the tribal chiefs live there.|$|R
60|$|There {{are three}} islands so little distant from each other, that they appear but one; for which reason the Chinese, in their language, call them Samceu; a word {{composed}} of sam, which signifies three, and ceu, {{which is to}} say an island. The chief of these islands, which the Portuguese have named Sancian, has a convenient and safe <b>port,</b> all <b>crowned</b> with mountains, and forming a semicircle on that side, which looks towards Macao. It has few inhabitants who are natives, almost no provisions, and is so barren of itself, so uncultivated and so wild, that it seems rather a place of banishment than of commerce. The Chinese had permitted the Portuguese to trade thither, to buy their commodities, and sell their own to them, without breaking their fundamental law, of suffering no stranger to set foot within their country; so that the Portuguese durst come no nearer the main land, for fear of hazarding their lives, or at least their liberty. Neither was it permitted them to build solid houses in the isle; they were only allowed to set up slight cabins, covered with mats, and dressed about with boughs of trees, that they might not always be shut up within their vessels.|$|R
50|$|The crown {{corporation}} held {{a monopoly}} on uranium prospecting and development in Canada until 1948. Together with a discovery of the Port Radium deposits, the Eldorado company opened the Beaverlodge Mine at Uranium City, Saskatchewan. It entered production in 1953. In the 1960s the nature of sales changed when the United States military ceased purchasing of Canadian uranium ores {{for the purpose of}} atomic weapons, and from then on uranium was produced for power plants. During this period the name of the company was changed to Eldorado Nuclear Limited, with Eldorado Aviation Limited operating flights to <b>Port</b> Radium. The <b>crown</b> corporation was dismantled in 1988 and merged with assets of the Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation (SMDC) to become Cameco Corporation. The old records of the company are housed in the National Archives of Canada.|$|R
50|$|In their {{inquiries}} the inquisitors {{discovered that}} for a long time many converts had met with their Jewish relatives to celebrate Jewish holidays and even attend synagogues. This convinces them that they will not be able to put an end to crypto-Judaism if converts continue to maintain contact with the Jews, for example: what they ask the kings to be expelled from Andalusia. These approve and in 1483 give a period of six months for the Jews of the dioceses of Seville, Cordoba and Cadiz to go to Extremadura. There are doubts as to whether the order was strictly enforced since at the time of the final expulsion in 1492 some chroniclers speak of the fact that eight thousand families of Andalusia embarked in Cadiz and others in Cartagena and in the <b>ports</b> of the <b>Crown</b> of Aragon. On the other hand, the expulsion of the Jews of Saragossa and Teruel was also proposed, but in the end it was not carried out.|$|R
5000|$|On July 18, 2006 at {{approximately}} 3:30 pm ET, one hour after departing her last {{port of call}} in <b>Port</b> Canaveral, the <b>Crown</b> Princess reported [...] "listing" [...] or making [...] "heavy turns". [...] The U.S. Coast Guard was contacted shortly after and crews arrived within minutes to assist the troubled vessel. The cruise ship {{was on its way}} home to New York City, and {{the decision was made to}} return to Port Canaveral due to what was initially thought to be a malfunction in the steering equipment which caused a severe tilting of the ship, and injuries. However, the NTSB found that the second officer, the senior watch officer on the bridge, disengaged the automatic steering mode of the vessel’s integrated navigation system after it put the ship into what the officer felt was an unusually hard turn to port and took manual control of the steering. The second officer turned the wheel first to port and then from port to starboard several times, eventually causing the vessel to list even more, to a maximum angle of about 24° to starboard. The severe listing tumbled passengers, crew members, pool water, and everything else not secured about the decks.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Trained entrances {{of coastal}} rivers can {{significantly}} alter the hydraulic behaviour and sedimentation processes {{both within the}} estuaries and along the adjacent coastlines (NSW Government, 1990). As a consequence, accretion of the submerged land within and near river entrances can affect tidal flow, water quality and navigation. Submerged land, defined by the area between mean high water mark and the State's territorial limit which extends 3 nautical miles (5. 5 km) out to sea, is generally Crown land. The Department of Lands is responsible for submerged Crown land which includes most coastal estuaries, many large riverbeds and some coastal wetlands. The Department of Lands is also responsible, under the NSW Government’s Minor Ports and River Entrance Programs, for the management and maintenance of important coastal infrastructure (i. e. breakwaters, training walls and minor <b>ports)</b> located on <b>Crown</b> Land. Dredging of river entrances has historically been undertaken by government to maintain safe navigation for the transportation of people and produce along our coastal waterways and for local commercial fishing fleets operating out of small regional fishing ports. However, over the last decade, population growth in coastal areas, increased ownership of recreational boats and {{a shift in the}} commercial boating sector from fishing to tourism and adventure related activities has placed an unprecedented demand on the use of our coastal waterways. These and other issues have created new challenges for river and port entrance managers. For the dredging of entrances to trained rivers and minor ports the Department of Lands is coordinating a strategic approach that is merit based to ensure any available funds are applied in a manner to achieve multiple outcomes for the benefit of all people of NSW. This paper discusses the main aspects of the management approach adopted by th...|$|R
