5000|$|Maral Rahmanzade {{was born}} on July 23, 1916 in Baku. In 1930-1933, she studied at the Azerbaijan State Technical School of Arts. In 1934-1940, she {{continued}} her education at the Moscow State Institute of Arts. Her most productive area was the graphic genre. Rahmanzade created series of easel paintings of patriotic content during the Great Patriotic War. One of the series {{is dedicated to the}} Soviet women during the wartime, including [...] "People's volunteer corps", [...] "Women in the ranks", [...] "Partisan's daughter", and [...] "Radio operator". Other series, consisting of 19 lists, were dedicated to the work of people and the home front: “Work on the farm”, “Social activists”, and “The artists performing for the front-line soldiers”. Women working at machines in factories are depicted in “Wives substitute husbands”. The paintings were made by the artist in the art of black watercolors with following elaboration with coal. In 1940s, Rahmanzade worked on illustration of belles-lettres. In 1945, she designed the books “Dehname” by Khatai and [...] "The land of fires" [...] by Zohrabbeyov. More successfully. she worked on poetic images of women in [...] "Dehname". Rahmanzade portrayed poet Khatai, the author of the book, in two illustrations: on one of them his portrait is in profile and on the other the poet is portrayed with a pen in hand in a poetic atmosphere of night. Rahmanzade portrayed circumstances, landscape, architecture, and costumes on numerous illustrations of “The land of fires” novel, following the literary description. Riders were portrayed on the first illustration, {{on the left side of}} a list. A pictorial panorama of a bay and a mysterious tower to which landlady they were going opened in front of their eyes. During these years Maral Rahmanzade created illustrations to Jafar Jabbarly's [...] "Maiden tower" [...] and [...] "Gulzar" [...] works. In post-war period Rahmanzade intensively worked in the sphere of easel graphic. In 1947, series of [...] "Petroleum" [...] autolithography consisting of 10 lists which showed the history of petroleum land was exhibited on jubilee exhibition for the first time. The series beginning with [...] "Fire worshippers" [...] composition representing a scene of worship to eternal fire. Other lists of these series are [...] "A new enterprise", [...] "On the oilrig", [...] "Jack-pump", [...] "Fountain hammered to a pipe". In 1948, M.Rahmanzade finished series called [...] "Socialistic Baku", consisting of 10 lists. It included industrial and urban landscapes, and also such genre compositions as [...] "Shift of a vigil", [...] "Day of a vigil", [...] "In construction of a new house". Journeys to [...] "Oil rocks" [...] were productive for the artist. Maral Rahmanzade was the first artist who went to work in [...] "Oil rocks". Being among oilmen, overseeing their working days, their everyday life, she painted field landscapes of the Caspian Sea, construction of scaffold bridges, oil tanks, towers, <b>pouring</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> On a report exhibition she presented drawings and watercolor paintings, portraying more typical episodes of working life of oilmen of the Caspian Sea. Besides the citizens of Baku, workers of [...] "Oil rocks" [...] also saw these paintings, as they were dedicated to them. Rahmanzade created series of autolithographs called [...] "Here-in the Caspian Sea". An album, consisting of 15 colorful lithographs from these series was published in Moscow. Verticals of towers, steel scaffold bridges, shining mirror-like surface of the sea were described on [...] "In the open sea" [...] lithograph. The artist portrayed hard life of workers, distinctive life of oilmen on [...] "On-duty boat", [...] "The food is brought", [...] "To a storm-zone" [...] paintings. These series of lithographs brought a broad fame to Rahmanzade and they were exhibited on the All-Union and foreign exhibitions for many times.|$|E
40|$|In earlier times, the <b>pouring</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> {{into the}} sea {{is said to have}} been done {{deliberately}} in order to forestall rough seas. Although oil may be highly effective at calming troubled waters, we know that seafarers would not rely on this ancillary technique alone. Instead, they tried to engineer strong ships capable of breaking waves on their own. In Australia, there are two distinct types of remedies available to a litigant when seeking judicial review through constitutional means. First, the writs of mandamus, certiorari and prohibition which are called ‘constitutional writs’. Second, injunctions and declarations which are ‘equitable remedies’. The constitutional writs are often criticised for being only obtainable through archaic processes and governed by technical rules. Accordingly, equitable remedies, which are available in the field of public law precisely because of the inadequacies of the constitutional writs, have played a critical part in shaping modern Australian administrative law. However, mainly due to their different historical backgrounds, the constitutional writs and the equitable remedies operate in a fundamentally different manner. It has been proposed by some Australian legal minds that equitable remedies will have a “knock-on” effect for the other remedies by refocusing judicial review. However, it will be suggested by the author of this text that administrative lawyers should not rely too heavily upon the capacity of equitable remedies to become the forefront of judicial review. Instead of trying to pour oil on troubled waters, focus should be shifted to the constitutional writs, which have the innate potential of fulfilling the constitutional mandate of Section 75 (v) as intended...|$|E

25|$|Anointing is {{the ritual}} act <b>of</b> <b>pouring</b> {{aromatic}} <b>oil</b> over a person's head or entire body.

Scented oils are used as perfumes and sharing them {{is an act of}} hospitality.

50|$|Sometimes {{the term}} {{refers to the}} oil in the lamps that burn before the shrines of saints or the water that flows from the wells near their burial places, or the oil and the water which have in some way {{come in contact with}} their relics.

In the days of the St. Paulinus of Nola (d. 431) the custom prevailed <b>of</b> <b>pouring</b> <b>oil</b> over the relics or reliquaries of martyrs and then gathering it in vases, sponges, or pieces <b>of</b> cloth.

According to the testimony of of Pétrigeux (wrote about 470) in Gaul this custom was extended also to the relics of saints that did not die as martyrs, especially to the relics of St. Martin of Tours (Paulini Petricordiae Carmen de vita S. Martini, V, 101 sq. in Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, XVI, 111).
