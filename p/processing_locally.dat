McMahon and Francis Filloux {{compared}} {{information processing}} skills in non-retarded autists and controls:"The performance of non-retarded autistic children was {{compared with that}} of two matched control groups, one with Tourette Syndrome and the other developmentally normal. Autistic subjects performed as well as controls on tasks requiring global-local processing and inhibition of neutral responses."Laurent Mottron, Jacob A. Burack, Johannes E. A. Stauder and Philippe Robaey (1999) conclude that: [...] "Contrary to expectations based on the central coherence and hierarchisation deficit theories, our findings indicate intact holistic processing among persons with autism."In 2003 they did another study which confirmed their earlier findings and in which they conclude:"Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with other reports of superior performance in detecting embedded figures (Jolliffe & Baron-Cohen, 1997; Shah & Frith, 1983), but typical performance in global and configural processing (Mottron, Burack et al., 1999; Ozonoff et al., 1994) among persons with high-functioning autism. Thus, the notions of local bias and global impairment that are part of WCC may need to be reexamined."Also in 2003 Beatriz López, Susan R. Leekam conclude their study:"Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that children with autism do not have a general difficulty in connecting context information and item information as predicted by weak central coherence theory. Instead the results suggest that there is specific difficulty with complex verbal stimuli and in particular with using sentence context to disambiguate meaning."Natasja van Lang gives the following explanation for these contradictory results: [...] "Results in which central coherence skills are measured with perceptual or verbal-semantic tasks revealed that autistic individuals have a tendency for fragmented perception (Jarrold & Russell, 1997; Happé, 1996), and that they benefit less from the context of meaning in sentences, narratives and memory tests (Happé, 1994b; Jolliffe & Baron-Cohen, 1999). However, some studies failed to replicate these findings (Brian & Bryson, 1996; Ozonoff et al., 1991; Ropar & Mitchell, 1999). This inconsistency may be explained on the basis of how weak central coherence was measured in terms of an inability to process globally versus the preference for <b>processing</b> <b>locally.</b> Recent studies suggest that people with autism are able to process globally when they are instructed to do so, however they process information locally when no such instructions are offered (Mottron et al., 1999; Plaisted et al., 1999; Rinehart et al., 2000)."Autistic people have also questioned the theory of WCC. One of the criticisms is that the 'context' deemed universal by the researchers might not at all be so universal from a rational point of view.In her blog Alyric devotes an article to Central Coherence:"There are differences in the kinds of ‘big picture’ here obviously. One refers to systems and the others, of the kind that Frith and Happe automatically assumed to be universal, have an essential social element."Naja Melan claims that neurotypical people are often biased to overemphasize one context and neglecting all other contexts. This he states is an expression of WCC, as compared to autists who have the possibility of consciously focusing on multiple contexts if deemed appropriate by them or requested.|$|E

The various components of your paper [title, text, heads, etc. ] are already defined on the style sheet, {{as illustrated by}} the portions given in this document. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a distributed information processing system with the capabilities of sensing, wireless communication and data processing. Individual sensor modules of such a network sense the environment, perform data <b>processing</b> <b>locally</b> and cooperate with other sensors via communication. One very important issue in the deployment of a wireless sensor network is the problem of optimizing energy consumption as these networks may be deployed in places where energy supply are not readily available such as in a seaport container terminal and they are required to work with a long lifespan. The main objective of our research is to develop an algorithm for controlling the power consumption of sensor modules in a wireless sensor network for mobile object tracking. The algorithm determines the actions of an individual sensor module to enter a low power state to conserve energy while maintaining its functionality to track objects and to optimize the lifespan of the entire sensor network by reducing overall power consumption. A control framework and corresponding algorithms for controlling the actions of a sensor is designed and experimentation is done to show its efficiency in controlling power consumption of a sensor network. © 2010 IEEE. published_or_final_versionThe 2010 International Conference on Green Circuits and Systems (ICGCS 2010), Shanghai, China, 21 - 23 June 2010.

40|$|With the {{advancement}} {{in science and}} technology numerous complex scientific applications can be executed in heterogeneous computing environment. However, the bottle neck is efficient scheduling algorithms. Such complex applications can be expressed in the form of workflows. Geographically distributed heterogeneous resources can execute such workflows in parallel. This enhances the workflow execution. In data-intensive workflows, heavy data moves across the execution nodes. This causes high communication overhead. To avoid such overheads many techniques have been used, however in this thesis stream-based data processing model is used in which data is processed in the form of continuous instances of data items. Data-intensive workflow optimization is an active research area because numerous applications are producing huge amount of data that is increasing exponentially day by day. This thesis proposes data-intensive workflow optimization algorithms. The first algorithm architecture consists of two phases a) workflow partitioning, and b) partitions mapping. Partitions are made {{in such a way that}} minimum data should move across the partitions. It enables heavy data <b>processing</b> <b>locally</b> on same execution node because each partition is mapped to one execution node. It overcomes the high communication costs. In the mapping phase, a partition is mapped on that execution node which offers minimum execution time. Eventually, the workflow is executed. The second algorithm is a variation in first algorithm in which data parallelism is introduced in each partition. Most compute intensive task in each partition is identified and data parallelism is applied to that task. It reduces the execution time of that compute intensive tasks. The simulation results prove that proposed algorithms outperform from state of the art algorithms for variety of workflows. The datasets used for performance evaluation are synthesized as well as workflows derived from real world applications. The workflows derived from real world applications include Montage and Cybershake. Synthesized workflows were generated with different sizes, shapes and densities to evaluate the proposed algorithms.

40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} and sustainability of an anaerobic green gas production pathway was evaluated, taking into account five biomass feedstocks, optimization of the green gas production pathway, replacement of current waste management pathways by mitigation, and transport of the feedstocks. Sustainability is expressed by three main factors: efficiency in (Process) Energy Returned On Invested (P) EROI, carbon footprint in Global Warming Potential GWP(100), and environmental impact in EcoPoints. The green gas production pathway operates on a mass fraction of 50 % feedstock with 50 % manure. The sustainability of the analyzed feedstocks differs substantially, favoring biomass waste flows over, the specially cultivated energy crop, maize. The use of optimization, {{in the shape of}} internal energy production, green gas powered trucks, and mitigation can significantly improve the sustainability for all feedstocks, but favors waste materials. Results indicate a possible improvement from an average (P) EROI for all feedstocks of 2. 3 up to an average of 7. 0 GJ/GJ The carbon footprint can potentially be reduced from an average of 40 down to 18 kgCO(2) eq/GJ. The environmental impact can potentially be reduced from an average of 5. 6 down to 1. 8 Pt/GJ. Internal energy production proved to be the most effective optimization. However, the use of optimization aforementioned will result in les green gas injected into the gas grid as it is partially consumed internally. Overall, the feedstock straw was the most energy efficient, where the feedstock harvest remains proved to be the most environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, transport distances of all feedstocks should not exceed 150 km or emissions and environmental impacts will surpass those of natural gas, used as a reference. Using green gas as a fuel can increase the acceptable transportation range to over 300 km. Within the context aforementioned and from an {{energy efficiency}} and sustainable point of view, the anaerobic digestion process should be utilized for <b>processing</b> <b>locally</b> available waste feedstocks with the added advantage of producing energy, which should first be used internally for powering the green gas production process.

40|$|The {{wireless}} visual {{sensor network}} is an emerging field which is formed by deploying many visual sensor nodes {{in the field}} and in which each individual visual sensor node contains an image sensor, on board processor, memory and wireless transceiver. In comparison to the traditional wireless sensor networks, which operate on one dimensional data, the wireless visual sensor networks operate on two dimensional data which requires higher processing power and communication bandwidth. Research focus within the field of wireless visual sensor networks has been on two different extremes, involving either sending raw data to the central base station without local processing or conducting all <b>processing</b> <b>locally</b> at the visual sensor node and transmitting only the final results. This research work focuses on determining an optimal point of hardware/software partitioning at the visual sensor node as well as partitioning tasks between local and central processing, based on the minimum energy consumption for the vision processing tasks. Different possibilities in relation to partitioning the vision processing tasks between hardware, software and locality for the implementation of the visual sensor node, used in wireless visual sensor networks have been explored. The effect of packets relaying and node density on the energy consumption and implementation of the individual wireless visual sensor node, when used in a multi-hop wireless visual sensor networks have also been explored. The lifetime of the visual sensor node is predicted by evaluating the energy requirement of the embedded platform with a combination of the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and the micro-controller for the implementation of the visual sensor node and, in addition, taking into account the amount of energy required for receiving/forwarding the packets of other nodes in the multi-hop network. Advancements in FPGAs have been the motivation behind their choice as the vision processing platform for implementing visual sensor node. This choice is based on the reduced time-to-market, low Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) cost and programmability as compared to ASICs.

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} regarding {{the impact of}} fossil fuel use upon {{the environment and the}} cost of production have led to a growth in the interest of obtaining energy from biomass. 1 st and 2 nd generation biomass types, however, are often criticised for their high energy requirements and environmental impacts. Algal biomass is considered a 3 rd generation biomass which does not require arable land for cultivation, typically has a high productivity and can be converted {{to a wide variety of}} energy carriers. Despite research on the concept of producing energy from algal biomass dating back to the 1960 s there has been limited commercial development and the environmental advantages are still in doubt. This thesis investigated the potential of algal biomass as a source of bioenergy feedstock by considering the cultivation and processing of localised species of algae and applying life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to algal biofuel production systems. Experiments were conducted to examine the productivity of a wild algal species in wastewater and the potential recoverable bioenergy yields. The LCA studies drew together data from external studies, commercial databases, industrial reports and experimental work to assess the environmental impacts and the energy balance for each system considered. The thesis investigated the generation of biofuel from both freshwater algal biomass and marine algal biomass. For both cases, the current state of research was examined and the gaps determined. Existing studies suggest the high intensity of microalgal biomass production (fertiliser requirements, high energy harvesting) greatly reduces the overall sustainability. Part of this thesis therefore investigated the possibility of a low input system of microalgal cultivation. A recommended approach was suggested using local species cultivated in wastewater as the nutrient source and a conversion strategy based on the characteristics of the dominant species. The practicality and effectiveness of cultivating and <b>processing</b> <b>locally</b> grown algal biomass under low input conditions was determined by experiments that were conducted in the laboratory. Algal biomass was collected locally and cultivated in the laboratory using agricultural effluent as the nutrient source. The productivity of the algae was monitored alongside the uptake of nutrients.

40|$|New market {{opportunities}} are now providing a still largely unexploited niche for smaller-scale food processing. These lie between the hive {{of activity in}} the informal sector and the large private or public African businesses, based on imported industrial technology. Whereas urban processors have undoubted advantages, especially their proximity to large markets, the backers of smaller enterprises often find advantage in setting up businesses in the industrial areas of large rural centres or in small towns. The conditions needed {{for the development of}} private businesses in the modern sector are still far from being satisfied in many ACP countries. These conditions include more or less stable and open markets; fixed regulations and rules within which businesses can operate; simultaneous presence of the competing and complementary modern and informal sectors; availability of credit and access to technical and commercial know-how. The additional problems of lack of infrastructure, water and electricity, need to be overcome in order for businesses to be set up outside the main urban areas (see Spore No 60 - What has rural life to offer). The tremendous opportunities for food processing do, however, offer many possibilities for setting up smaller plants in the rural areas, even though the potential for adding value to local resources through the processing of fruits, cereals, milk, oilseeds and fish depends very much on the locality. These 'village industries' contribute greatly {{to the development of the}} rural economy They provide added income to the small farmers who supply raw materials and create job opportunities for many other people. These industries also generally improve the quality of the raw material and reduce post-harvest losses. Making use, by definition, of local resources, they supply products in high demand, reduce the need for imports and contribute to the overall national economy Food processing industries already contribute considerably to African national economies. One of the conclusions of a workshop held in April, 1996 in Stuttgart in Germany under the auspices of Food-Net/RESAA (a network of NGOs and European institutions that promote appropriate technology) was that 'Food processing accounts for some 40 % of the value added by all manufacturing industries. ' These activities, which are 'for the most part small or informal businesses are a major source of rural employment because they create jobs and income for about 60 % of the sub-Saharan African labour force, most of whom are women, who thereby earn the money needed to support their families. ' This strong emphasis on women is a characteristic of the sector but may act as a brake on small business development in so far as women unfortunately also tend to have less access to improved technology, extension services and credit. Informal and urban markets The rapidly expanding urban areas and the informal urban food sector, provide opportunities for consumption of a large proportion of rural production. The difficulties of gaining access to profitable but highly competitive markets thus constitute a first set of problems. These limit the growth potential of food processing businesses that are not within the immediate neighbourhood of the major urban conurbations. Whilst already a long way from being negligible, the opportunities will increase as the proportion of the total population living in urban areas also increases. A perspective study by the Club du Sahel, the African Development Bank and CILSS estimates that 270 million of the expected total of 430 million people in West Africa in 2020 will be living in 6, 000 urban areas of more than 5, 000 people and that there will be more than 300 large centres with populations in excess of 100, 000 inhabitants. These will provide just as many opportunities for marketing rural products and will certainly be easier to access than the very large clues. Whether managed by an individual or a small group, a small business might well decide to start operations in the catchment area of a secondary urban zone. In addition to the necessary basic services, such a zone can potentially provide a profitable outlet for production. Initially demand may be limited but this need not be an impediment provided that the supply does not exceed the demand. By improving its technical ability, by broadening its range of products and by producing a variety of items from a single primary product (pasteurized milk making butter, yoghurt and cheese, for example) a small enterprise can expand its business in the local market. Capturing new and more distant but larger markets, possibly in the capital city or abroad, will then determine the rate of expansion of the business. This type of progression faces many obstacles but the chances of success are increased in relation to the nearness of the primary resources which it utilizes and which provide a comparative advantage over business competition located in the major towns. Advantages of rural processing A significant advantage can be gained by <b>processing</b> <b>locally</b> a highly perishable product and reducing losses through early treatment. Milk and fruit offer the best advantages and are much better for processing than, for example, cereals which store better as grain than as flour. Cassava also supplies a whole downstream chain of businesses which, while being largely informal in nature, are very active. It is thus logical that milk, fruit and cassava processing are now the main ventures of the modern food processing sector outside the major cities. Distance is certainly a handicap when it comes to gaining an awareness of, adapting to, and manipulating the market. This can be overcome to a large extent by organizing delivery and achieving savings in the cost of raw materials. For example, five small businesses in Haiti that produce guava and pineapple jam could triple the size of their businesses without any marketing problems if they were able to find sufficient supply (see Spore 61 - Fruit processing in Haiti). With the exception of the large export-oriented and intensively managed plantations, smaller scattered plantations are now facing considerable losses. Thus, for example, 80 % of the mangoes of the Bio Guinea Company at Kindia to the north of Conakry simply rot where they have fallen due to lack of a market. Building a processing plant near to the production site provides impetus for proper harvesting regimes, whose effect is enhanced if the processing enterprise pays at least part of the purchase price at the time of delivery. Using the products as collateral for credit Smaller businesses are limited by lack of funds and an almost total absence of credit. Even when only limited investment is needed to buy processing machinery, heavy operating costs must still be financed. Customer allegiance, which is a basic tenet of efficient modern marketing, demands that the products (fruit juices or jam, for example) be available on shop shelves at all times. To be able to fulfil this demand, and to provide goods throughout the year in spite of the seasonal nature of the primary product, a business and its partners must build up a stock of finished products at harvest time. Financing these stocks is a further heavy burden which is added to by the need for appropriate storage. Motorized pulper Providing a guarantee of payment to a potential lender is a basic condition for obtaining credit. In order to overcome the problem of restructuring the cereal markets PRMC (Programme de restructuration du marché céralier) established a system in Mali in 1982, that linked management of food aid with provision of credit to the large and small private businesses which took over cereal marketing from the state organization. With the exception of emergency assistance, food aid is sold to commercial businesses, which then further sell on the open market. The nominal value of the cereals and some external financing provide the collateral which, in the absence of any concern by the banking system, is needed for the merchants to obtain credit. As a guarantee the merchants' stocks are maintained in independent storage (which is paid for) under good conditions of hygiene and are released in blocks as and when the loan is repaid. Although it is restricted to cereals this system, known as 'third party storage', proves that a Government can stimulate efficient private sector activity through close collaboration with the businesses that it wants to promote. Market studies and business management Among factors limiting the activities of small-scale food processing businesses the FoodNet/RESAA workshop noted the lack of adequate market information and problems associated with selling the finished product. Many countries do, however, have universities or professionals that would be able to provide such information. The cost of procuring information and marketing might induce several businesses to group together to finance them, along with some national and international assistance. In order to remain close to the production base while marketing their finished product in distant markets, small businesses may seek some advantageous arrangement with a large wholesaler. In this way the final added value must be shared. For this to be equitable, the processor must have accurate information on the retail price and the real costs incurred by the wholesaler. The FoodNet/RESAA workshop proposed, however, an alternative and less dependent strategy which several small businesses could adopt by joining together to market their products communally. The proposal was to form an organization, which must as far as possible, be under the control of the processors and be paid for by charging a percentage of the final sale price. The need for public involvement Relieved of the need for routine business management by economic liberalization and privatization, governments now, more than ever, have the responsibility of ensuring that policies and legal frameworks encourage development of the private sector. There are several ways in which the public sector can act. To improve the advantages of processing plants being close to the production site and to encourage business investment, local authorities can offer a range of incentives. One such is to provide land free-of- rent and another is to reduce, or even eliminate, local taxes for these businesses for a short or long period. As yet, there has not been sufficient research on the ways by which the traditional processing methods of many smaller businesses may be improved. An expert in this field is Mathurin Coffi Nago of the National University of Benin, who emphasizes that 'improved processing methods can lead to reductions in losses of the primary product while improving the efficiency of labour' (see Spore 63 - Small business opportunities are there for the taking). Ultimately, the economic performance of small businesses will also vary with the amount of tax they have to pay. In Uganda, for example, there is no tax on industrial machinery whereas in Burkina Faso it is in the range of 50 - 80 %. Is local development likely to be encouraged when, as for example in Mauritania, a plant for processing camel milk into cheese has to pay 30 % import duty on its packaging material, whereas the same packaging on imported European cheese which competes with it is taxed at only 10 %? (see Spore 55 - Curds and why?) Equipment for juice extraction Whether supportive or discouraging, it is legal frameworks and sectoral policies that largely determine the success of a private business: applied correctly, they can help the development of the food processing industries on which the national economy and the rural areas are in so much need. New {{market opportunities}} are now providing a still largely unexploited niche for smaller-scale food processing. These lie between the hive of activity in the informal sector and the large private or public African businesses, based on [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{contexts}} {{allow us}} to find relevant information more easily. Learning such contexts has been proposed to depend upon either global processing of the repeated contexts, or alternatively processing of the local region surrounding the target information. In this study, we measured {{the extent to which}} observers were by default biased to process towards a more global or local level. The findings showed that the ability to use context to help guide their search was strongly related to an observer's local/global <b>processing</b> bias. <b>Locally</b> biased people could use context to help improve their search better than globally biased people. The results suggest that the extent to which context can be used depends crucially on the observer's attentional bias and thus also to factors and influences that can change this bias...|$|R

The most common method of <b>processing</b> herring <b>locally</b> is hot smoking to give either soft, moist and cooked product or a dry, brittle product with very low moisture content. The author describes a curing method intended to add variety to the types of products that can be obtained from local herring. It is only mildly preservative, the product cannot be kept more than 24 hours without refrigeration. Particular attention is paid to the source and quality of the raw material used, and the processing method is detailed with attention to washing, splitting, brining, smoking, and the application of the Torry fish smoking kiln to the process...|$|R

Because of the extreme complexity of both issues, we have adopted an underlying economic paradigm for both problems.
