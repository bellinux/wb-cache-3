40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} different types of <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> cores on the final color of the IPS-Emperss 2 crown. Methods: Five types of <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> cores (Cerapost with Empress cosmo, Cerapost with composite resin, gilded Ni-Cr alloy, gold alloy and Ni-Cr alloy) were made. The shifts in color of three points of IPS-Empress 2 crown surface (cervical, middle and incisal) with different <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> cores was measured with a spectroradiometer (PR- 650). Results: The L* a* b* values of zirconium oxide and gilded Ni- Cr alloy <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> cores with ceramic crown were the highest. The L* a* values of zirconium oxide posts composite cores were higher while the b* values were lower. The L* a* b* values of Ni-Cr alloy were lower than that of gold alloy and were the lowest. Conclusion: In combination with IPS- Empress 2 crown, zirconium oxide posts are suitable for routine use in the anterior dentition, and gilded Ni- Cr alloy <b>and</b> gold alloy <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> cores can be recommended for clinical practice. Ni-Cr alloy <b>posts</b> <b>and</b> cores can not be recommended for clinical practice...|$|R
