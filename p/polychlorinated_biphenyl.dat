5|$|After its retirement, 4859 was {{purchased}} in for $13,000 by the Harrisburg {{chapter of the}} National Railroad Historical Society and donated to the Harrisburg Redevelopment Authority. It {{was sent to the}} Pennsylvania Railroad Museum in Strasburg in the early 1980s, where restoration of 4859 was carried by the workshops of the nearby Strasburg Rail Road. The body and chassis were sandblasted, primed and repainted back to its original 1938 appearance. The main transformer was removed and drained of the hazardous <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> (PCBs) used as coolant.|$|E
5|$|Reef {{environments in}} Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species {{richness}} and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007. A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which {{makes it harder for}} them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on blue whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E

40|$|This {{volume of}} the IARC Monographs {{provides}} evaluations of the carcinogenicity of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> and polybrominated <b>biphenyls.</b> <b>Polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> are a class of aromatic compounds comprising 209 congeners, each containing 1 to 10 chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl nucleus. Technical products, which were manufactured to obtain {{a certain degree of}} chlorination, are mixtures of numerous congeners. These products were widely used as dielectric fluid in capacitors and transformers, {{and to a lesser extent}} in building materials. Although their production and use has been banned in most countries, these compounds are ubiquitous environmental pollutants, including in polar regions and the deep ocean, because they are persistent and bioaccumulate. Worldwide monitoring programmes have shown that <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> are present in most samples of human milk. An IARC Monographs Working Group reviewed epidemiological evidence, animal bioassays, and mechanistic and other relevant data to reach conclusions as to the carcinogenic hazard to humans of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls,</b> of the subclass of dioxinlike <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls,</b> and of polybrominated biphenyls...|$|R

5|$|Baleen whales {{can also}} be {{affected}} by humans in more indirect ways. For species like the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates {{through some of the}} world's busiest shipping lanes, the biggest threat is from being struck by ships. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Combined with spreading and acoustic shadowing effects, {{the result is that the}} whale is unable to hear an approaching vessel before it has been run over or entrapped by the hydrodynamic forces of the vessel's passage. A 2014 study noted that a lower vessel speed correlated with lower collision rates. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, notably in the blue whale which produces the loudest vocalization, which makes it harder for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Poisoning from toxic substances such as <b>Polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> (PCB) is generally low because of their low trophic level. Some baleen whales can become victims of bycatch, which is especially serious for North Atlantic right whales considering its small number. Right whales feed with a wide-open mouth, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaw, flippers and tail. Some are able to escape, but others remain entangled. If observers notice, they can be successfully disentangled, but others die over a period of months. Other whales, such as humpback whales, {{can also be}} entangled.|$|E

25|$|Salmon is {{a popular}} food. Classified as an oily fish, salmon is {{considered}} to be healthy due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D content. Salmon is also a source of cholesterol, with a range of 23–214mg/100g depending on the species. According to reports in the journal Science, farmed salmon may contain high levels of dioxins. PCB (<b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyl)</b> levels may be up to eight times higher in farmed salmon than in wild salmon, but still well below levels considered dangerous. Nonetheless, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the benefits of eating even farmed salmon still outweigh any risks imposed by contaminants. Farmed salmon has a high omega 3 fatty acid content comparable to wild salmon. The type of omega-3 present may not be a factor for other important health functions.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, the Navy {{discovered}} nine metals, two semi-volatile {{organic compounds}} and a <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> in Ford Island's soil, groundwater and marine sediment.

An investigation suggested covering the contaminated areas with clean soil. In 1994, the Navy considered removing the contaminated soil and installed six wells to monitor groundwater, but decided to follow the original recommendation in 1995 and capped the contaminated soil with topsoil and erosion-resistant vegetation (including Bermuda grass). The containment system was completed in 1996.|$|E
