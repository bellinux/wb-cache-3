50|$|A central {{services}} ICC controls integration across the enterprise. It carries {{out the same}} processes as the other models, but in addition usually has its own budget and a charge-back methodology. It also offers more support for development projects, providing management, development resources, data profiling, data quality, and unit testing. Because a {{central services}} ICC is more involved in development activities than the other models, it requires a <b>production</b> <b>operator</b> and a data integration developer. The staff in a central services ICC does not necessarily {{need to be a}} central location and may be distributed geographically; the important distinction is that the staffs have a solid-line reporting relationship to the ICC Director. The size of these teams can vary and may be as large as 10%-15% of the IT staff in an organization.|$|E

Respondents were given questionnaire booklets containing questions that were divided into five sections; demographic background; understanding about punishment; affective dimension; cognitive dimension and behavioral dimension. Score frequency analysis and Spearmanâ€™s Correlation Coefficient had been employed to analyze the data. The research findings showed that the respondentsâ€™ understanding was at medium level to high level whereby the relationship between punishment and attitude dimensions was weak. There were significant relationships between punishment and cognitive and behavioral dimensions. No significant relationship was found between punishment and affective dimension...|$|R

40|$|Today the ISO 14001 {{system is}} used within a rather wide {{spectrum}} of firms and industries, even if the early adopters of the standard mainly where organizations in the heavy industry and manufacturing sectors (Peglaue and Baxter, 2007). Many of those early adopters have now been certified for over 10 years, and during the years several surveys and case {{studies have been conducted}} to pinpoint the motives, benefits and challenges for why organizations chose to implement and maintain the system (Massoud, 2010; Jiang and Bansal, 2003). However, one issue with research about ISO 14001 up until now is that most studies have focused upon a managerial perspective where the managers´ attitudes have been in focus rather than the employees (Boiral, 2007). Therefore, this case study set out to explore how the employees, the <b>production</b> <b>operators,</b> inside one certified organization are involved in ISO 14001 through a Grounded Theory approach. The results of the study showed that the <b>production</b> <b>operators</b> relied upon different strategies in order to legitimize their involvement in ISO 14001. Further on, the study shows that the <b>production</b> <b>operators</b> where involved in ISO 14001 at a level which was required {{in order to keep the}} certification. However, they could not obtain enough legitimacy to motivate an involvement in ISO 14001 which extended what was required in order to keep the certification. Grounded in the discovery of the different strategies used by the employees, this study argues that environmental awareness could be seen as an internal barrier and as a source for unsatisfied employees. Something which risks emphasizes a feeling of being involved in a rational myth (Boiral, 2007) ...|$|R

The <b>production</b> <b>operator</b> is derived from an effective Lagrangian model that contains all the degrees of freedom known {{to contribute to the}} elementary process. Using the framework of DWIA, the matrix elements of this operator are evaluated using relativistic bound state wave functions. Final state interactions are accounted for via a pion-nucleus optical potential. The effects of in-medium modifications of the <b>production</b> <b>operator</b> are discussed.

40|$|Coherent pion photoproduction, d(γ,π 0) d, is {{calculated}} in a coupled channels approach in momentum space using an elementary <b>production</b> <b>operator</b> that includes Born terms, vector meson exchange and M 1 /E 2 ∆-resonance excitation. The final state interaction is {{treated in the}} KMT multiple scattering approach that describes πd elastic scattering well. Differential cross sections are found to agree well with existing (γ,π 0) data. The polarization observables Σ,iT 11 and the tensor analyzing powers are predicted for forthcoming experiments. A number of transparent relationships between polarization observables and the elementary <b>production</b> <b>operator</b> is derived. Finally, calculations are performed for coherent eta photoproduction, d(γ,η) d, in the threshold region which agree well with a very recent Mainz experiment...|$|E
40|$|We {{survey the}} recent {{developments}} in the reaction NN → NNπ in effective field theory. We show that the proper construction of the <b>production</b> <b>operator</b> needs a careful separation of irreducible pieces from reducible ones. The result of this consideration is a complete cancellation of all loops in the <b>production</b> <b>operator</b> at NLO. Moreover, we show that this procedure brings the leading Weinberg-Tomozawa vertex on-shell, thus enhancing the corresponding contribution to the transition amplitude {{by a factor of}} 4 / 3 as compared to the commonly used value. We also discuss the role of the ∆(1232) for the s-wave pion production. Being relatively sizable individually the direct and rescattering mechanisms of the ∆ excitation at NLO cancel each other to a large extent. Thus, we conclude that the net effect of the ∆ at NLO is very small. ...|$|E

40|$|Offshore oil {{exploration}} and <b>production</b> <b>operators</b> in high latitude regions recognize icing as a seasonal challenge. Icing is often accepted as an inconvenience, but that tolerance can rapidly become a safety hazard that requires solutions. This report evaluates the superstructure and atmospheric icing hazard on offshore platforms and supply boats with location and operation on the structure. It also explains {{the potential impact}} of icing on these locations and operations by icing type: sea spray, snow, glaze, rime, frost, and sleet. Fourteen ice protection technology categories are identified for anti-icing, deicing, and ice detection. These technologies include chemicals, icephobic coatings, structure design, expulsive techniques, heat, high-volume water, air and steam, infrared energy, manual deicing, piezoelectric methods, pneumatic boots, vibration and covers, and as separate categories windows, cables, and ice detection methods. Each technology category is described with regard to products available, current use, engineering design, technology readiness levels, capability at the current level of development for the marine environment, possible use in the marine environment to improve safety, and indications of development necessary to transfer the technology to offshore use. Examples of technology sources are also provided. Suggestions are made with regard to the application of technologies to solve icing safety threats on platforms and supply boats. Technology readiness levels are also summarized. The goal is to provide a technology resource for offshore oil and <b>production</b> <b>operators</b> with icing-related safety requirements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{explore the}} role of soft gluon {{exchange}} in heavy quarkonium production at large transverse momentum. We find uncanceled infrared poles at NNLO that are not matched by conventional NRQCD matrix elements. We show, however, that gauge invariance and factorization require that conventional NRQCD <b>production</b> <b>operators</b> be modified to include non-Abelian phases or Wilson lines. With appropriately modified operators, factorization is restored at NNLO. We also argue that, {{in the absence of}} special cancellations, infrared poles at yet higher orders may require the inclusion of additional nonlocal operators, not present in the NRQCD expansion in relative velocity...|$|R
