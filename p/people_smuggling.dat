25|$|Laws criminalising <b>people</b> <b>smuggling</b> {{were passed}} by the Indonesian {{parliament}} in 2011, and impose penalties of between five and 15 {{years in prison for}} those convicted. The laws include penalties for corrupt officials, and for failing to report officials, smugglers and asylum seekers guilty of immigration violations. The same year, Australia contributed three patrol boats to assist Indonesian law enforcement officials in combatting the trade. The Australian government also agreed to accept a further 400 asylum seekers from Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} {{came under}} strain in August 2001 during the Tampa affair, when the Australian government refused permission for the Norwegian freighter ship MV Tampa to enter Australian waters while carrying Afghan asylum seekers {{that it had}} rescued from a distressed fishing vessel in international waters. The Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency did not immediately respond to requests from Australia to receive the vessel. When the ship entered Australian territorial waters after being refused permission, the Australian government tried without success to persuade Indonesia to accept the asylum seekers. Norway also {{refused to accept the}} asylum seekers and reported Australia to international maritime authorities. The incident prompted closer coordination between Indonesian and Australian authorities, including regional conferences on <b>people</b> <b>smuggling,</b> trafficking in persons and other trans-national crime.|$|E

Funnell's five-year term as CAS was the longest since that of Air Marshal George Jones, who served ten years in the post from 1942 to 1952. In 1993, Funnell became Director of the National Defence College project. From 1994 until 1998, he served as the inaugural Principal of the Australian College of Defence and Strategic Studies, which subsequently evolved into the Australian Defence College.

Funnell served as Deputy Chair of the Council for Immigration Services and Status Resolution (CISSR) from 2009 to 2011, and became Deputy Chair of the Federal Minister's Council on Asylum Seekers and Detention (MCASD) in 2012.

50|$|Fearing that Dutch {{exposure}} to Allied radio programming {{would turn the}} Dutch against them, the Nazis called for the confiscation of all radio transmitters soon after the country was occupied in May 1940. By May 1943, they had confiscated nearly 80 percent of Dutch radios, amounting to just over one million sets. With the Nazi grip on the media tightening, many Dutch households hid their radios, receiving illegal broadcasts from the BBC and Radio Oranje (Radio Orange) that kept them {{up to date on}} Allied forces and their accomplishments on the war front - and in some cases messages that helped them resist Nazi rule. Allied radio broadcasts were so important to the Dutch people that many people began building crystal radios. Crystal radios were fairly easy to build and could be made quickly in large quantities. Their main advantage was that they required no batteries and could only be heard by those operating them but were very hard to control or tune. During the Dutch famine (Hongerwinter) of 1944, many <b>people</b> <b>smuggled</b> crystal radios to farmers in exchange for fresh produce.|$|R

They become victims of human trafficking and they should not be neglected anymore by the EU and its Member States. However, all EU proposals lack of concreteness as Member States do not want to support and host migrants at sea on their territories. They are reluctant to launch solidarity between each other as requested by the Lisbon Treaty and by doing this, they are indirectly {{responsible for the death of}} many migrants at sea and for the abuse of their human rights. This article proposes alternatives to explore that could change the situation if Member States show their willingness to cooperate with each other...|$|R
