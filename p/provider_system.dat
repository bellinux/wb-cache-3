50|$|After {{his success}} with Kinpo, Barry Lam wanted Quanta {{to be more}} than a {{contract}} manufacturer. His vision was for Quanta to be a design manufacturer, a partner with its clients rather than just a supplier. As an SSDMM <b>Provider,</b> <b>System</b> Solution Design Manufacturing and Move, Quanta is very involved in engineering design for its clients. For Lam, Quanta's ability in combining designing power and functionality into lightweight packages has been the key to its success. Quanta offers combinations of features for each of its products which its clients can choose from. Once the design is agreed on, the next step is to get new, high-quality models into volume production quickly. These two steps, design capability and outstanding supply-chain management ensure profitability for customers and long-term relationships for Quanta.|$|E

Under a collaborative and coordinated decision-making model, UPMC oversees all clinical activity, including a consolidated physicians' practice plan consisting of university faculty, while the University of Pittsburgh remains the guardian of all academic priorities, particularly faculty-based research. UPMC's 24-member Board of Directors equally splits representation between three groups: the University of Pittsburgh, the community at-large, and individuals historical involved in the governance of its system's hospitals. UPMC is composed of three major operating components: Provider Services, Insurance Services, and International and Commercial Services. The later two divisions include the for-profit health insurance company (UPMC Health Plan) and a for-profit International and Commercial Services Division that seeks to bring health care, management, and technologies to market throughout the world.

40|$|Abstract. Since {{more and}} more {{interactions}} take place between humans and different user-adapted applications in daily life, there is the great opportunity to acquire a lot of knowledge about a user and use {{it in order to}} reach a better adaptation. A common vision states that user model should be interoperable and shareable across user-adaptive applications in different contexts and environments. The core idea of our approach is that the interoperability of user model data lets to reach more effective adaptation results only if the exchanged data are reliable. In this paper we discuss how this goal can be achieved by a semantic annotation of the exchanged data, providing the requestor with the possibility to evaluate i) the reliability of the exchanged value and ii) the reputation of the <b>provider</b> <b>system.</b> To do this, we propose a User-Adapted System Meta-Description which identifies a user-adapted system enriched with a set of semantic meta-information regarding the <b>provider</b> <b>system,</b> the exchanged value, the reasoning strategies used to define the value...|$|E

The prediction of the bandwidth consumption {{is one of the}} factors that support the planning for an efficient internet service <b>provider</b> <b>system.</b> Bandwidth consumption is predicted using ANN. ANN is an information processing system which has similar characteristics as the biological neural network. ANN is chosen to predict the consumption of the bandwidth because ANN has good approachability to non-linearity. The variable used in ANN is the historical load data. A bandwidth consumption information system was built using neural networks with a backpropagation algorithm to make the use of bandwidth more efficient in the future both in the rental rate of the bandwidth and in the usage of the bandwidth.
