Several member of the Blues' signed contracts with teams in the UA despite being subject to the reserve clause: including star players McCormick, Dunlap, and Jack Glasscock.

In equilibrium, each owner has a dominant strategy to reward his manager with a contract combining own <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> competitor's <b>profits.</b> Contrary to the received literature, {{the case where}} there is no ex-ante commitment over any type of contract that each owner offers to his manager is also examined. In equilibrium, each type of contract is an owner's best response to the competing owner's choice. Oligopoly; Managerial delegation; Endogenous contracts...|$|R

5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} <b>profit</b> <b>and</b> loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E

KFC expanded internationally in the 1970s and 80s, particularly in Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Miles also lured Sanders back, and listened to his recommendations for the business.

Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis's exactions and abuse of his monks.|$|E

5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility under the Empire, both upward and downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to <b>profit</b> <b>and</b> exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E
5|$|Even though Salomy Jane didn't {{return a}} profit (likely due to second-string {{distribution}} channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton {{that his wife}} could challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford.

Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. Mignon, The Lily of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed to turn a <b>profit,</b> <b>and</b> a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given {{until the end of the}} year to be completed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} relationship between earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> retained earnings and the feasibility of reconciliation of the two accounts by outside corporate investors. Deductive conclusions are based on data derived from publicly available literature, seventeen earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> studies prepared by selected certified public accounting firms, and {{an interview with a}} representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ Ninety-two potential transactional differences between earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> retained earnings are analyzed and classified as resulting in no differences, timing differences, or permanent differences between the accounts. Corroborative inferences are drawn from the data developed from the seventeen earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> studies <b>and</b> from the interview with the representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ This dissertation concludes that earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> retained earnings (1) only in extremely rare situations are equal in amount and (2) cannot be reconciled using publicly available information. In addition, the inference is drawn that retained earnings is not a valid surrogate for earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits.</b> The consequences of these conclusions and inference are that outside investors are not receiving useful information about earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> cannot generate that information. ^ The dissertation recommends that the United States Congress define earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits,</b> that the Internal Revenue Service require calculation of the account by all corporate taxpayers on an annual basis, and that the Financial Accounting Standards Board consider the issue of reconciliation of earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> retained earnings. In addition, recommendations for future research in this area are offered. ...|$|R

Darwin proposed to edit these reports, writing his own forewords and notes, and used his contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book. When a Treasury grant of ¬£1,000 was allocated {{at the end of}} August 1837, Darwin stretched the project to include the geology book that he had conceived in April 1832 at the first landfall in the voyage. He selected Smith, Elder & Co. as the publisher, and gave them unrealistic commitments on the timing of providing the text and illustrations. He assured the Treasury that the work would be good value, as the publisher would only require a small commission <b>profit,</b> <b>and</b> he himself would have no profit. From October he planned what became the multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle on his collections, and began writing about the geology of volcanic islands.|$|E

NSB stated that if a new Oslo‚ÄìStockholm service was to be introduced, it would require state grants. In September, SJ's CEO Jan Forsberg stated that the problems lay with the infrastructure in Norway. While the speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in Sweden and to Copenhagen, the slow lines in Norway made services to Norway unprofitable. Linx had by then transported 1.3 million passengers, and Forsberg stated that had the company transported 1.7 million people, it would have been profitable.|$|E

5|$|One of Treloar's duties {{throughout}} much of the war was to compile and edit service annual books, which were compilations of articles written by military personnel and published by the AWM. He first proposed this in mid-1941 as an equivalent of The Anzac Book, which was a collection of anecdotes written by Australian soldiers during the Gallipoli Campaign. The first of these books, entitled Active Service, was printed during late 1941 and early 1942 and eventually sold 138,208 copies. Seventeen service annual books were produced during and after the war, with combined sales of 1,907,446 copies. These books were sold at a <b>profit</b> <b>and</b> earned the Memorial large amounts of money. Treloar's editorial role came on top of his full-time duties as head of the MHS {{and was one of the}} main causes of his exhaustion and anxiety in the final years of the war.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{first entered}} into the {{electronic}} accounting market with the acquisition of a Boston-based accounting software developer in 1960. The software division was doing well in the 1970s, but its products were out-of-date by the 1980s. At the time, data could not be shared between departments and only one user was allowed on the system at a time. Each computer came {{at a cost of}} more than $100,000. Even as the computer division grew, the company's overall business revenue declined due to paper business forms becoming obsolete. In 1986, the company acquired Arnold Corporation, which increased Reynolds' revenues 50 percent and expanded its market presence to other industries besides car dealerships. The head of the computers division, David Holmes, was appointed CEO in 1989. He led the company's first large-scale lay-off in the printing division, cutting headcount and manufacturing space in half. The employees resisted the changes he incorporated. According to Forbes, this move was necessary and led to increases in <b>profit</b> <b>and</b> revenues.|$|E
5|$|The total tonnage of coal {{produced}} by the coalfield increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79 separate collieries and production was 1,250,000tons per annum. The peak years for production were 1900 to 1920. However decline took hold {{and the number of}} pits reduced from 30 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century to 14 by the mid-1930s, 12 at nationalisation when the National Coal Board was created on 1 January 1947, under the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, 5 in 1959 and none after 1973. Despite some investment in new infrastructure, particularly at Norton Hill, thin seams made production expensive, limiting <b>profit</b> <b>and</b> investment. The conversion of Portishead power station from coal to oil and reduced national demand together with competition from more economical coalfields led to the closure of the last two pits, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, in September 1973.|$|E
