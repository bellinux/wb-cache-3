50|$|The <b>pre-stopped</b> nasals /bm/, /dn/, /ɟɲ/ and /gŋ/ {{contrast}} with /m/, /n/, /ɲ/ and /ŋ/ {{in the final}} syllable position, resulting in the need to distinguish between these consonants in the orthography. The unaspirated stops were initially used to represent the <b>pre-stopped</b> nasals but the reader was unable to decode the word. Eventually, a garand were written above the oral stops representing /bm/, /dn/, /ɟɲ/ and /gŋ/. Writing in this manner allows the reader to recognize the consonant cluster as {{the representation of the}} <b>pre-stopped</b> nasal.|$|E

In particular, in the coastal dialects of North Sami (known as Sea Sami), several archaisms have been attested, including a lack of <b>pre-stopping</b> of geminate nasals, a lack of -vocalization, and a reflex /e/ of [...] in certain positions. These likely indicate an earlier Eastern Samic substratum.|$|R

50|$|Around 1550, {{with the}} Lutheran Reformation, the {{introduction}} of printing and the consequent translation of the Bible, modern Icelandic was definitively formed. Compared to other Scandinavian and Germanic languages (with the partial exception of Faroese and German), Icelandic certainly remained at an earlier evolutionary stage {{in terms of its}} morphology, but this should not imply that the language did not change; the phonological developments of the language from the ancient to the modern language are enormous. A conservative writing system, rich inflectional morphology and a lexicon that is resistant to loanwords (instead preferring neologisms formed from native material) obscures the true nature of modern Icelandic, which is a modern language like any other; Russian, Polish and Hungarian, as examples, have a morphological system at least as complex as that of Icelandic, and Hungarian, moreover, behaves exactly like Icelandic in terms of its acceptance of most loanwords. As is often said of Icelandic people, they have no difficulty in reading works of medieval literature, but to speak to their ancestors they would probably need an interpreter. The most consistent changes have been that to the vowel system, which followed the segmental phonological quantity in the 16th century or perhaps as early as the 14th century, and the consequent development of diphthongs. In the consonant system there have also been notable changes, for example the desonorization of plosives, the rise of a correlative sonorant for nasals and liquids (<b>pre-stopping)</b> and preaspiration.|$|R

40|$|Production and {{perception}} studies {{were conducted to}} investigate coarticulatory vowel nasalization in VNC sequences in Saudi Arabic. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the degree and pattern of vowel nasalization is influenced by the context in which the nasal and the neighboring vowel occur. The current study aims at investigating the effect of the postnasal consonant in the vowel-nasal-consonant sequence (VNC) on the production {{and perception}} of vowel nasalization in Saudi Arabic. The production experiment provided acoustic analysis of the influence of the postnasal consonant manner on vowel nasality and the temporal interplay between the coarticulatory source (the nasal consonant) and the coarticulatory effect (vowel nasalization). In order to achieve this goal, vowel nasality, and temporal extent of the nasal consonants were measured in three different contexts: the pre-fricative context (VNC 2 ̆ 2 fricative 2 ̆ 2), <b>pre-stop</b> context (VNC 2 ̆ 2 stop 2 ̆ 2), and nasal context (VN). The analysis of acoustic and temporal results provided evidence for the cross-context variation in the degree of nasality on vowel and the duration of the nasal consonant, indicating a temporal interplay between the extent of coarticulatory source, nasal consonant, and that of its effect, vowel nasalization. The cross-context variation in the nasality degree on the vowel and the duration of nasal source was attributed to aerodynamic properties of the postnasal consonant, such as the presence of frication noise, which result in differences in the temporal alignment of the nasal gesture with the vowel gestures. The perception experiment was designed to confirm the findings of the production study. A forced-choice preference task tested listeners 2 ̆ 7 preference for the large and small size of overlapping between the nasal and the vowel in VNC words in order to find whether listeners would be able to identify the following nasal based on the nasality on vowel. The results revealed a bias for the VNC words with increased vowel nasalization (i. e. large overlapping between N and V). This finding suggests that coarticulatory vowel nasalization can be beneficial for the listeners and facilitate the process of speech perception...|$|R
40|$|Babbitt {{has long}} been used as the lining {{material}} in hydrodynamic sliding bearings. However, with the new operating conditions imposed on hydro-electric power plants due to grid frequency regulation, the power plants undergo more frequent starts and stops which increases {{the need for an}} alternative material with better friction characteristics at start-up compared to conventionally used white-metal (Babbitt). Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) based materials have potential to provide significant improvements in hydrodynamic sliding bearings through their compliant and breakaway characteristics under loading. However, while pure PTFE can provide excellent performance, it is somewhat limited in extreme loading situations. This study is therefore aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics at the initiation of sliding (breakaway friction) of several polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) based materials including virgin PTFE, PTFE filled with 25 % black glass, PTFE filled with 40 % bronze, PTFE filled with 25 % carbon, and PTFE filled with 20 % glass fibre and 5 % Molybdenum disulphide, as well as standard Babbitt material in lubricated sliding contact with a steel counter-face. Experiments were carried out using a reciprocating tribo-meter in the block on plate configuration with the specific goal of determining the friction characteristics at breakaway under various conditions. Apparent contact pressures of 1 to 8 MPa were applied with oil temperature levels of 25 ° to 85 °C. Bronze- and carbon-filled PTFE and virgin PTFE were found to provide generally lower and more stable breakaway friction over the course of testing than the other materials. Breakaway friction tests after an extended stop under loading showed a maximum change in breakaway friction of 0. 07 for bronze filled, carbon filled, and virgin PTFE whereas Babbitt produced an increase of 0. 32 in the first cycle after the extended stop, reaching the friction level of more than three times of those of PTFE based composites. Breakaway friction for the four tested materials after an extended stop returned to the <b>pre-stop</b> values after 1 stroke. The effect of materials on the steel counter face was also examined using an optical profilometer finding that only glass filled composites (black glass filled PTFE, and glass fiber and MoS 2 filled PTFE) produced significant polishing of the steel surface under high loads. No measurable polishing was detected for other tested materials. Validerat; 20110224 (anonymous...|$|R
50|$|A <b>pre-stopped</b> {{consonant}} behaves phonologically as {{a single}} consonant. That is, like affricates and trilled affricates, the reasons for considering these sequences to be single consonants lies primarily in their behavior. Phonetically they are similar or equivalent to stops with a nasal or lateral release.|$|E
5000|$|The {{consonant}} {{inventory of}} Kaurna {{is similar to}} that of other Pama-Nyungan languages (compare with Adnyamathanha, in the same Thura-Yura grouping).

50|$|Kaytetye is phonologically {{unusual in}} a number of ways.

This paper provides the first quantitative data on the phonetic realization of contrastive pre-stopping for any Australian language. It also provides data on the hitherto unreported non-contrastive pre-stopping of laterals in Kaytetye. The findings demonstrate that contrastive nasal pre-stopping and non-contrastive lateral pre-stopping differ on three parameters: (a) the conditioning on the distribution of plain vs. <b>pre-stopped</b> realizations; (b) the comparative overall durations of <b>pre-stopped</b> realizations compared to plain realizations; and (c) the duration of pre-stopping. 19 page(s...|$|E
