5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used this <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.|$|E

5|$|Many {{poisonous}} or distasteful {{animals that}} advertise their presence with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, skunks, salamanders and monarch butterflies all have high contrast patterns that display their outlines. These advertising patterns exploit the opposite <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> disruptive coloration, {{for what is}} in effect the exactly opposite effect: to make the animal as conspicuous as possible.|$|E

5|$|Viral {{recombination}} produces {{genetic variation}} that likely {{contributes to the}} evolution of resistance to anti-retroviral therapy. Recombination may also contribute, in <b>principle,</b> <b>to</b> overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} at Srebrenica, sixteen nations {{met at the}} London Conference, which began on 21 July 1995, to {{consider}} new options for Bosnia. As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} in <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> defensive mimicry, {{where the}} mimic generally benefits from {{being treated as}} harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E
5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} five district councils in favour of a unitary authority (covering the existing two-tier county) were rejected following local opposition. West Somerset is the least populous district (except for the two sui generis districts) in England. In September 2016, West Somerset and Taunton Deane councils agreed in <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> merge the districts into one (with one council) subject to consultation. It is planned to achieve this on 1 April 2019 with the first elections to the new council in May 2019. The new district {{would not be a}} unitary authority, with Somerset County Council still performing its functions.|$|E

5|$|In late 2014, Russia {{offered the}} Su-35 to Indonesia {{as the country}} sought to replace its ageing F-5E Tiger II fleet. The {{following}} year, the Indonesian Ministry of Defence selected the Su-35 ahead of the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, F-16, and Saab JAS 39 Gripen; the Defence Ministry cited the Indonesian Air Force's familiarity with the Su-27SK and Su-30MK2 {{as the reason for}} the aircraft's selection. There were some initial reports that the country was to order a squadron of up to sixteen aircraft, but the number was later reduced to some ten aircraft. By mid-2017, negotiations between the two parties for the sale of the Su-35 had reached an advanced stage, with the Indonesian government later agreed in <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race. The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland. At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed in <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> reduce each country's nuclear arsenal by 50percent. A second summit, was held in October 1986, Reykjavík, Iceland. Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, which Gorbachev wanted eliminated. Reagan refused. The negotiations failed, but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with {{the signing of the}} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500kilometers (300 to 3,400miles) and their infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Powell v. Alabama in 1932, the United States Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to {{defendants}} in capital trials, that is trials where capital punishment was a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own counsel. In Johnson v. Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded this <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> cover all federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to State courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, the court has affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation {{after they have been}} arrested (Miranda v. Arizona), and for line-ups (United States v. Wade).|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 2003, Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle {{signed an}} {{agreement}} in <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> develop a plan for light rail expansion to the airport. The agreement envisioned a light rail station along International Boulevard near South 175th Street connected to the airport's terminal via the existing parking garage, with enhanced pedestrian connections and connections to a future hotel {{at the north end}} of the garage. The two agencies also agreed to work together on planning and engineering for the project, which would be built in conjunction with a realignment of the Airport Expressway. The plan was finalized in December 2004, with an agreement to accelerate planning and construction in time for a December 2009 opening, in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics held in nearby Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles.

However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> act in that way.|$|E
