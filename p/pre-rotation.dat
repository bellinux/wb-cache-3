We aim {{to assess the}} impact of PEM rotation on the scientific knowledge of residents from different specialties and training centers by comparing the pre- and post-rotation knowledge. PEM Departments of three major tertiary care training centers were selected. Rotating pediatric and emergency medicine residents were given pre-test with twenty multiple-choice type questions related to the scientific knowledge of PEM and then re-tested with the same questions towards the end of their rotation. The t-test was used to compare mean scores. Further comparison based on specialty and training center was also done. Seventy-three residents were approached and enrolled, 48 from Pediatrics and 25 from Emergency Medicine. The mean pre- and post-scores for all residents were 15. 9 / 20 and 15. 5 / 20, respectively. All residents’ score was less on the post-rotation compared to the <b>pre-rotation</b> in all centers. Pediatric residents at one center scored higher, but they were not statistically significant.

We then propose a practical and e#cient multi-level water-filling algorithm to optimally solve the problem for the general case of different QoS requirements. The optimal transmit-receive processing is shown to diagonalize the channel matrix only after a very specific <b>pre-rotation</b> of the data symbols.

In a recently published article by Polihronov and Straatman (Phys. Rev.

This article will show that the theoretical model leads to the most basic element of a radial inflow device. It is shown that Euler's work equation reduces to the same theoretical result for this case. The system is then studied as a self-governed device moving in a medium posing external resistance. It is observed that the output power from the device exhibits a peak at a certain characteristic value of its peripheral velocity. In the presence of resistance or loading, the system has motion, characterized by the requirement of <b>pre-rotation</b> exhibiting maximum power output and a terminal state. The points of equilibrium and operational thresholds of the motion are discussed, accompanied by a theoretical model of the presented dynamical system.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} visual feedback of task performance in visuomotor adaptation. Participants produced novel {{two degrees of freedom}} movements (elbow flexion-extension, forearm pronation-supination) to move a cursor towards visual targets. Following trials with no rotation, participants were exposed to a 60 A degrees visuomotor rotation, before returning to the non-rotated condition. A colour cue on each trial permitted identification of the rotated/non-rotated contexts. Participants could not see their arm but received continuous and concurrent visual feedback (CF) of a cursor representing limb position or post-trial visual feedback (PF) representing the movement trajectory. Separate groups of participants who received CF were instructed that online modifications of their movements either were, or were not, permissible as a means of improving performance. Feedforward-mediated performance improvements occurred for both CF and PF groups in the rotated environment. Furthermore, for CF participants this adaptation occurred regardless of whether feedback modifications of motor commands were permissible. Upon re-exposure to the non-rotated environment participants in the CF, but not PF, groups exhibited post-training aftereffects, manifested as greater angular deviations from a straight initial trajectory, with respect to the <b>pre-rotation</b> trials. Accordingly, the nature of the performance improvements that occurred was dependent upon the timing of the visual feedback of task performance. Continuous visual feedback of task performance during task execution appears critical in realising automatic visuomotor adaptation through a recalibration of the visuomotor mapping that transforms visual inputs into appropriate motor commands. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{subjects}} {{stand at}} the center of a fully enclosed room that is rotating at constant velocity, their natural postural sway generates Coriolis forces that destabilize their center of mass and head. We quantitatively assessed how exposure to constant velocity rotation at 10 rpm affected postural control. Twelve subjects stood in a heel-to-toe stance in the rotating room. Each test session involved three phases: (1) <b>pre-rotation,</b> (2) per-rotation, and (3) post-rotation. In each phase, subjects were tested in both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Four measures were used to characterize center of mass movement and head movement: mean sway amplitude, total power, mean power frequency, and frequency of maximum power. Each measure was computed for anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway. Both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral head and center of mass sway during rotation had significantly greater mean sway amplitude and total power compared with pre- and post-rotation values. Mean power frequency and frequency of maximum power were little affected. Eyes open conditions were significantly more stable in all test phases than eyes-closed, but vision did not completely suppress the effects of rotation. The greatest effect of rotation was in the eyes-closed condition with mean sway amplitude and total power increasing more than twofold. Inverted pendulum sway was maintained in all phases of both test conditions. No aftereffects of rotation were present after the four 25 -s exposures each subject received. We expect that with longer exposure periods and with active generation of body sway subjects would both adapt to rotation and exhibit post-rotary aftereffects...|$|E

This technology has started {{to have a significant}} impact on pathology practice in various aspects including resident education. To be sufficient and adequate, training in pathology requires gaining broad exposure to various diagnostic patterns through teaching sets, which are traditionally composed of glass slides. Methods: A teaching set of over 295 glass slides has been used for resident training at the Division of Genitourinary Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Whole slide images were prepared from these slides using an Aperio ScanScope CS scanner. These images and case-related information were uploaded on a web-based digital teaching model. Results: The web site is available at: [URL] Once logged in, users can view the list of cases, or search cases with or without diagnoses shown. Each case can be accessed through an option button, where the clinical history, gross findings are initially shown. Whole slide images can be accessed through the links on the page, which allows users to make diagnoses on their own.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Medical student {{rotations}} {{in community}} practice settings are increasingly common within pediatric clerkship curricula yet little evidence exists {{to support the}} quality of the educational exposure. Purpose: To assess the impact of clerkship site (community setting vs. exposure to an Academic Health Sciences Center) on the following educational outcomes: 1. Clinical Performance; 2. Examination Performance; 3. Written Assignment Performance; and 4. Successful Matching to a Canadian Pediatric Residency Program. Methods: 340 medical students from the graduating classes of 2007 and 2008 at the University of Toronto, Canada were studied. Rotation performance (clinical assessment, examination mark, and written assignment mark) and acceptance into a Canadian pediatric residency program were assessed in relation to clerkship rotation site. These outcomes were assessed while controlling for the following potential confounders: 1) Pre-clerkship career preference and 2) <b>Pre-rotation</b> site preference as expressed by each medical student. Results: 172 medical students completed rotations that included exposure to an academic health sciences center, while 168 medical students had exclusive exposure to the community setting. Students who completed exclusively community-based pediatric rotations received slightly higher clinical evaluations (p= 0. 006), but not exam marks (p= 0. 812) nor written assignment marks (p= 0. 086). Students who had expressed an interest in paediatrics as a career prior to beginning their clerkship performed better during paediatric clerkship regardless of site (p=. 0003) and were more likely to choose a clerkship setting that included exposure to an Academic Health Sciences Center (p=. 052). Clerkship setting was not found to impact on successful matching to a Canadian pediatric residency program (p= 0. 171).

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to examine the most effective takeoff movement for the Rebound Long Jump Test (RLJ test) under high-speed conditions. This test is designed to evaluate the ability to perform the ballistic stretch-shortening cycle movement for unilateral horizontal jump events {{on the basis of the}} RLJ index (RLJ index (m/s) =Jumping distance (JD (m)) /Contact time (CT (s)). Subjects jump from a 0. 1 -m-high step to the ground after an approach run (falling jump), followed by jumping without interruption for as far as possible (propulsive jump). Eleven male college track-and-field athletes performed the RLJ test, and the RLJ index was calculated. On the basis of the average value of the RLJ index, the athletes were assigned to an upper level group (RLJ index>mean value) or a lower level group (RLJ index<mean value), and the takeoff movement of upper level group was considered the effective takeoff movement. The results suggested that it was important to minimize the rotation angle of the body, and to use a faster rotation velocity. This was achieved by 1) increasing the movement distance and velocity in the direction of the forward movement of the swing leg in the air, 2) minimizing the rotation angle of the foot and shank segment, and increasing that of the thigh segment during the initial phase, and 3) accelerating the rotation angle of the thigh segment again and swinging the swing-leg forward and up during the latter phase.
