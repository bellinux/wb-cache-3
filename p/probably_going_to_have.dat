5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E

A DFS player interviewed by Bloomberg argued that [...] "no matter how much somebody knows about sports, if you put an established player up against a new player, that established player's <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a 75 percent chance of winning—at least." [...] A study by McKinsey & Company over {{the first half of}} the 2015 MLB season estimated that 91% of winnings were won by only 1.3% of players. FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles disputed the accuracy of the study, arguing that its daily fantasy baseball contests do not have as many participants as those it runs for football.|$|E

5000|$|Adventure Gamers rated it 2.5 stars, writing [...] "You {{certainly}} won’t {{be missing}} a classic if you skip it, but for Xbox fans starved for adventure, Life in the Dorms is an admirable comedic effort that works {{enough of the}} time to consider its student-friendly price tag." [...] In a negative review, Indie Gamer Ckick said [...] "This {{is one of the}} most clunky, cumbersome, awful interfaces I’ve ever seen. It’s like Life in the Dorms is overdosing from that slow-motion drug from Dredd. I just want to move the plot forward with as little resistance as possible. Yet every rinky dinky action requires Dack to turn and face the camera to address the situation, in what I can only guess is an attempt to break down the fourth wall. [...] " [...] Rating the game a 6 out of 10, ThisIsXbox summed up its review saying [...] "Life in the Dorms has its ups and downs. It has a pretty cool graphical style with sprites that sort of resemble Xbox LIVE Avatars. The storyline isn’t bad and most of the characters are unique rather than just flat cardboard cutouts. On the other hand, the game progresses at such a leisurely pace that if you aren’t already a fan of the point-and-click genre in general, you <b>probably</b> aren’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> much fun with this game. It doesn’t help things that the same background music just drones on and on and on the whole time." ...|$|R

It insists on taking over your life for an hour, demands a level of concentration rare in rock, amply repays multiple plays." [...] Under the Radar gave the album eight stars out of ten and said that the band [...] "has created the antithesis of ATDI, leaving behind any formula or typicality. What they kept was the fire, the fury, and the passion." [...] Drowned in Sound gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it [...] "truly exquisite and well worth the wait." [...] Playlouder gave it a score of four stars out of five and said, [...] "There are moments of prog rock, jazz fusion and freakydelia in this rush of ideas and if that sounds awful then don't be put off. Instead of the shambolic mess that this kinda influence normally entails Mars Volta have come strictly disciplined." [...] Uncut gave it four stars out of five and said: [...] "Imagine a jam session between King Crimson, Fugazi and '70s Miles. Now imagine it working. That's the Mars Volta." [...] Blender also gave it four stars and said it [...] "Roars like Led Zeppelin, churns like King Crimson and throbs like early Santana." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes likewise gave it a score of four out of five and called it [...] "a very strong debut album for the Mars Volta."

40|$|New {{concepts}} {{in the field}} of purchasing, such as outsourcing, supply-base management and value-chain management, have become increasingly common practice. Because of the cross-functional character of these concepts, the call for a strategic reorientation of the purchasing function becomes louder. However, a clear future vision to guide the purchasing process has not yet matured. We investigated the most prominent developments and the expected trends in the profession, as well as the role and position that purchasing is <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in major companies ten years from now. This article will start with a description of the changing business context with which companies are currently confronted.

40|$|There is an {{extensive}} potential for GHG emission {{reductions in the}} new EU member states and the EU accession countries by improving energy efficiency, investing in renewable energy supply and other measures, part {{of which could be}} tapped by JI. However, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and especially the recently adopted "Linking Directive" is <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a significant impact on this JI potential. Especially two provisions are important: The baseline of a project has {{to be based on the}} acquis communautaire, the environmental regulations of which are substantially higher than the Accession Countries' existing ones. Projects, which directly or indirectly reduce emissions from installations falling within the scope of the EU ETS, can only generate certificates if an equal number of EU allowances are cancelled. JI is thus put into direct competition with the EU ETS. In this paper we analyse the impact of these provisions first in theory and then country by country for six Central and East European countries that recently acceded the EU or are candidates for accession. As a result, we give an overview of the potential and the limitations of JI as an instrument for achieving emission reductions in the selected Accession Countries and provide important overview information to policy makers...|$|E
