5|$|After {{the initial}} testing period, the {{sandwich}} was renamed the Big King {{and added to}} the national menu {{at the end of}} the summer of 1997the first major <b>product</b> <b>introduction</b> since the company added its BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990. Unlike the Double Supreme, the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac had, and the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75% more beef claim. However, the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling <b>product</b> <b>introduction.</b> The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the Chicken Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name. As of November 2013, the Chicken Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the Middle East.|$|E

Demand fluctuations account for 35 % 80 % and 17 % 43 %, respectively, of the seasonal and cyclical variability of new <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> in various industries. Finally, new <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> respond more to fluctuations in aggregate demand than in market demand and in business cycles than in seasonal cycles. ...|$|R

40|$|Since Comanor and Scherer (1969), {{researchers}} have been using patents {{as a proxy for}} new product development. In this paper, we reevaluate this relationship by using novel new data. We demonstrate that the relationship between patenting and new FDA-approved <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> has diminished considerably since the 1950 s, and in fact no longer holds. Moreover, we also find that the relationship between R&D expenditures and new <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> is considerably smaller than previously reported. While measures of patenting remain important in predicting the arrival of <b>product</b> <b>introductions,</b> the most important predictor is the loss of exclusivity protection on a current product. Our evidence suggests that pharmaceutical firms are acting strategically with respect to new <b>product</b> <b>introductions.</b> Finally, we find no relationship between firm size and new <b>product</b> <b>introductions.</b> ...|$|R

The present study extends this literature by showing that price markups decline in response to new <b>product</b> <b>introductions,</b> and since new <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> vary in a procyclical manner, price markups can be countercyclical.

40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that business expectations are crucial for investment {{in research and}} development (R&D) as well as for process and product innovations. However, there are controversial theoretical predictions about the causal linkage between business expectations and new <b>product</b> <b>introductions.</b> In addition, most empirical studies have neglected so far business expectations as an important determinant of new <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> due to absence of data. To address this shortcoming, it is investigated in this study whether business expectations do affect new <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> and whether the net impact is positive or negative. The empirical analysis is based on panel data from 14 branches of the German food industry for six years (1993 - 1998). Our findings suggest that a strong pressure exists in stagnating or declining food industries to respond to unfavourable expectations by new <b>product</b> <b>introductions.</b> In addition, we identify the influence of market structure and industry-specific variables as significant for new <b>product</b> <b>introductions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that market structure variables influence technical change, growth and new <b>product</b> <b>introductions.</b> Based on a broad data set for new <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> in various food industries, it is elaborated in this article how market structure variables affect innovative activities in the US food sector. It is different from earlier studies {{in the way that}} cross-sectional and time-series data are combined and panel data models are used in the econometric analysis. A major result is that new <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> are driven by market structure variables and industry-specific characteristics, i. e. fixed effects. A significant determinant of new food <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> is the concentration ratio which affects the number of innovations in a nonlinear form. The fixed-effects estimates reveal a U-type effect of concentration on innovations. Furthermore, the number of firms, the degree of existing product differentiation and the size of a market show a positive influence on the number of innovations. From a methodological point of view, plain OLS models yield biased results on the concentration-innovation linkage and on the relationship between the size of a market and innovations. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} include sector-specific characteristics as is done in the fixed-effects models. ...|$|R
