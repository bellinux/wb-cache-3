50|$|The IBM 1403 {{line printer}} was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} the IBM 1401 computer in 1959 and had an especially long life in the IBM product line. The original model could print 600 lines of text per minute and could skip blank lines at up to 75 inches per second (190 cm/s), while the model 3 could print at up to 1400 lines per minute. The standard model had 120 print positions. An additional 12 positions were available as an option. A <b>print</b> <b>chain</b> with up to 15 copies of the character set spun horizontally in front of the ribbon and paper. Hammers struck the paper from behind at exactly the right moment to print a character as it went by. In later models, the <b>print</b> <b>chain</b> was replaced by a print train; print slugs instead of being mounted on a chain were placed in a track.|$|E
5000|$|When faster {{computers}} were developed, however, {{the speed of}} card reading, magnetic tape, and early disk drives, along with newer high speed transistorized circuits, meant that processing could be done {{at a much higher}} speed, and a faster print mechanism was needed to match the resulting productivity. [...] IBM's early computers, such as the IBM 701, were developed for higher speed calculation than was possible with earlier electromechanical calculating machines. They did not have a demand for high speed printing, as the results of massive calculations produced very little printed output. Around the time that the 1403 was introduced, IBM's line of computers had been largely divided into two lines, [...] "scientific" [...] and [...] "business." [...] However, as newer {{computers were}} being used for a greater variety of purposes, there was a need to print a greater variety of characters from a single device, including upper and lower case alphabets. With type bars and type wheels, changing character sets was impractical. The advent of the chain printer, as used in the 1403, allowed the type chain assembly to be removed and replaced within a few minutes. With the cover open, the print unit was unlatched and swung open, the ribbon roll covering the front of the chain was removed, whereupon the <b>print</b> <b>chain</b> assembly could be unlatched and lifted out.|$|E

These issues are presented with three in-depth case studies of enterprises with various ownership structures. For research, authors used three research methods: secondary sources analysis, semi-structured interviews with managers and workers’ representatives, and a survey among workers in selected companies. Two important conclusions are drawn from the analysis. Firstly, a high rate of workers’ participation in the workplace education does not automatically mean greater orientation of the companies in the development of workers’ skills, as it may be a lateral effect of deskilling.

All hyperbranched polymers show both a significantly greater maximum printable concentration compared to equivalent linear polymers with implications for faster <b>print</b> speed. Increasing <b>chain</b> branching above a critical value across the molecular weight distribution was found to result in suppression of molecular weight degradation. This resistance to molecular degradation is because the longest chain segment being much smaller, such that upon jetting the polymer rapidly retains its thermodynamically stable Gaussian coil conformation and {{the full force of}} the constrictional flow in the print head is not passed on to the polymer and degradation is supressed. We further go on to show using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance that degradation occurs via a free radical chain scission mechanism...|$|R
40|$|In {{the media}} sector, {{recently}} new means of distribution, new platforms for accessing media and consequently new media products have been introduced. With new products potential environmental impacts related to activities of media companies are changing. Finnish media publisher Alma Media commissioned an LCA study {{in order to}} learn more about environmental impacts related to their mature and emerging products. Based on this, the current paper aims to present potential environmental impacts related to printed and online newspapers, focusing on their differences and challenges in assessing, comparing, communicating and acting on the results. Three newspapers are studied as cases, covering upstream <b>printing</b> house supply <b>chain,</b> <b>printing</b> house activities, delivery to readers and final disposal for print versions; electronic storage and distribution, the relevant share of electronic devices manufacturing and disposal and electricity needed for downloading and reading for online versions; content production for both. Mainly generic data was used for online products assessment, since specific data were not available. The specific data for the more mature print products were detailed but less comprehensive than generic. The implication is increased uncertainty and difficulties in communication of results. Environmental performance of both printed and online newspapers is dependent on various characteristics of the newspaper and its readers, including e. g. format and number of pages for print versions, and type of device used and its total use, size of content download and reading time for online versions. User practices may be changing as emerging products get more mature, which will influence environmental performance. Print and online versions give rise to different types of environmental impacts and the distribution of impacts in the life cycles differ. Printed newspaper impacts largely occur in the <b>printing</b> house supply <b>chain</b> and in delivery to readers, whereas online newspapers impacts are mainly connected to the electronic devices supply chain, and to some extent electricity used for reading and distribution. Impacts of printed newspapers studied occur more locally with paper manufacturing and printing located in Finland. Impacts related to online versions largely occur in other countries. Also, new value chain actors are involved, which are not directly related to the media company. Different actions for improvement may be necessary for emerging media products, as well as new types of collaborations. Comparison of online and print versions is not straightforward as different benefits are provided and reader practices differ. Although emerging media products may be considered substitutes for print counterparts, this is not necessarily the case. The choice of functional unit of assessment proved crucial for the comparison. Different functional units were used (one year, one reader and week, one reading hour). Comparing print and online versions Alma Media online newspapers showed lower environmental impacts than their print versions per year and also per reader and week. However, impacts per reading hour were lower for printed newspapers in some cases. Using different kinds of perspectives, e. g. through different functional units, gives more information and increased knowledge. Complexity in assessing, comparing, communicating and acting on emerging media products was experienced in this study. Further studies and action need to be taken. QC 20121221 </p...|$|R

Instead of pressing the characters toward the paper, individual type hammers behind the paper, one for each column on the page (120 or 132), pushed the paper from behind, causing the front of the paper at that spot to push forward into the ribbon with the character behind it, causing the paper to strike the character, {{rather than the other way}} around, as had been done in the past. Each hammer was moved by a powerful electromagnet, with its coil connected to a high current drive circuit, such that the hammer could be forced out to hit the paper within only a few milliseconds, at exactly the right time to strike the correct character on the chain as it came by.|$|R

40|$|The {{publishing}} industry {{like many other}} industries has not escaped the impact of information technology in both the production and distribution of the information it creates. From earliest DTP techniques to the selling of books over {{the internet and the}} publishing of electronic journals the {{publishing industry}} has readily accepted technological innovation. Many publishers are now ready to embrace the potential of the web as a method of publishing and distribution rather than as a purely marketing tool. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} suggest an appropriate business model which will enable commercial electronic publishing to occur via the internet. When this model is in place it is likely that the traditional <b>print</b> information <b>chain,</b> will be redefined, the main changes occurring at the distribution and delivery level. However the end-user input also changes as electronic commerce provides the user with the ability to purchase smaller customised fragments of information sometimes directly from the source, i. e: the content creator. Although copyright and security are crucial to developments in this area, the paper does not attempt a detailed discussion of these issues and readers should refer to Swindells et al (1998). Likewise this work does not attempt to provide a detailed history of the publishing industry or of the internet. There are software applications which facilitate electronic commerce transactions, however this paper is concerned with the development of an appropriate model which could be adapted to the electronic publishing industry and not a discussion of software packages. The paper commences with a brief definition of electronic commerce. The relationship between electronic commerce and electronic and on-line publishing is discussed. Current models of internet commerce are presented in order to form a basis for an appropriate business model. This paper defines the traditional information <b>chain</b> in the <b>print</b> publishing context and attempts to define changes in the information chain arising from application of electronic commerce in the electronic and on-line publishing industries.

5000|$|Chain {{printers}} (also {{known as}} train printers) placed the type on moving bars (a horizontally-moving chain). As with the drum printer, as the correct character passed by each column, a hammer {{was fired from}} behind the paper. Compared to drum printers, chain printers had the advantage that the type chain could usually be changed by the operator. A further advantage was that vertical registration of characters in a line was much improved over drum printers, which needed extremely precise hammer timing to achieve a reasonably straight line of <b>print.</b> By selecting <b>chains</b> that had a smaller character set (for example, just numbers and a few punctuation marks), the printer could print much faster than if the chain contained the entire upper- and lower-case alphabet, numbers, and all special symbols. This was because, with many more instances of the numbers appearing in the chain, the time spent waiting for the correct character to [...] "pass by" [...] was greatly reduced. Common letters and symbols would appear more often on the chain, according to the frequency analysis of the likely input. It was also possible to play primitive tunes on these printers by timing the nonsense of the printout to the sequence on the chain, a rather primitive piano.

40|$|After gaining {{independence}} from Britain in 1947, {{for more than}} half of its history various authoritarian regimes and military dictatorships have ruled Pakistan. As military leaders needed civilian masks to legitimize their rule, Pakistan’s parasitic landlords and religious elite stepped in to fill the vacuum, in the process gaining significant control over the socio-political discourse via Islamic ideology. Under this authoritarian arrangement, no dissent or freedom of expression is allowed, and every channel of communication is placed under tight state scrutiny. Similarly, activist pockets of resistance have also never faltered to oppose and challenge such forces and the status quo, significant among them being the media, lawyers, intellectuals, and pro-democracy elements. The first part of this dissertation examines the resistance, social movements, and struggle for democracy under authoritarian rule, and the role of state controlled broadcast media and the independent but severely <b>chained</b> <b>print</b> media in a historical perspective.

40|$|The {{emergent}} {{phenomenon of}} social manufacturing is disrupting industries {{all over the}} world. Social manufacturing represents a new collaborative manufacturing paradigm. The shift from the current manufacturing paradigm to social manufacturing is facilitated by rapid development of mobile technologies, new digital manufacturing, and online social networks. There are already successful businesses that build upon the social manufacturing paradigm, e. g., in finance, hospitality, and transportation: new banks are born without physical offices (ING Direct), the world’s greatest hotel chain does not own a single room (AirBnB), and a taxi company neither owns cars nor employs drivers (Uber). The objective {{of this study is}} to construct a model concerning the paradigm shift from current manufacturing to social manufacturing. The model for the paradigm shift incorporates various topics that are central in the transition process, such as 3 D <b>printing,</b> customization, value <b>chains,</b> and social networks. The model is divided into two phases. First, there is an intermediary phase of social manufacturing where customers will co-create with manufacturers. However, here manufacturers still control the manufacturing platform. This phase represents an incremental dimension of social manufacturing. Second, there is the fully-fledged social manufacturing phase that I call it the ultimate phase of social manufacturing. In this phase of social manufacturing, customers can become entrepreneurs, pursuing their ideas throughout the manufacturing value chain by using support from a public manufacturing platform. This phase represents the disruptive dimension of social manufacturing. To demonstrate the practicality of this study, the proposed model is then applied in the apparel industry for creating insights both to the intermediary and ultimate phases of social manufacturing within this field. Finally, opportunities and risks related to social manufacturing are discussed, the limitations of the study are presented, and future avenues of study are outlined...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{the content of}} sixteen Indiana newspapers, chosen at random, to calculate the topic classification of editorials. Because of concern for chained newspaper growth 'in America, this study attempted to draw conclusions as to the topics of editorials <b>printed</b> in both <b>chained</b> and unchained newspapers. Since "one-publisher" cities are also increasing, further aspects of this study, examined editorials in newspapers of varying circulation categories. Indiana has eighty-two daily newspapers - 30 chained, and 52 unchained. From the complete list, sixteen papers were randomly chosen - two chained and two unchained {{from each of the}} following four circulation categories: 1 - 10, 000; 10 - 20, 000; 20 - 50, 000; and 50, 000 up. Editorials from a ten-day sampling over two, two-month periods were examined and classified according to the defined topics of "local," "state," "national," and "international. "The findings of the study showed that Indiana newspapers, whether chained or unchained, large or small, editorialized most heavily on national issues. However, comparatively, chained newspapers published more local and state editorials than did unchained papers. The unchained newspapers published approximately twice the number of national editorials as 'state and local editorials, combined. The newspapers with the largest circulations, also, published more local editorials than did small papers, but the small papers surpassed the large papers in printing state editorials. However, small papers did concentrate more heavily on national issues than large circulating dailies did. No classification of newspaper, consistently, printed many nternational editorials. The conclusions of the study show that chained newspapers and those with large circulations are doing a better job of localizing editorials than are the unchained newspapers anti small circulating dailies. However, this study was a quantitative account of editorial topics and it made no attempt to study the quality of the editorials. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of a mass-digitized book corpus {{has the potential to}} transform the academic library enterprise, enabling an optimization of legacy print collections that will substantially increase the efficiency of library operations and facilitate a redirection of library resources in support of a renovated library service portfolio. Executive Summary The Cloud Library project was jointly designed and executed by OCLC Research, the HathiTrust, New York University’s Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, and the Research Collections Access & Preservation (ReCAP) consortium, with support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The objective of the project was to examine the feasibility of outsourcing management of low-use print books held in academic libraries to shared service providers, including large-scale print and digital repositories. The following overarching hypothesis provided a framework for our investigation: • The {{emergence of}} a mass-digitized book corpus has the potential to transform the academic library enterprise, enabling an optimization of legacy print collections that will substantially increase the efficiency of library operations and facilitate a redirection of library resources in support of a renovated library service portfolio. From this, a number of research questions emerged: • What is the scope of the mass-digitized book corpus in the HathiTrust Digital Libray and to what degree does it replicate print collections held in academic research libraries? • Can public domain content in the HathiTrust Digital Library provide a suitable surrogate for low-use print collections in academic libraries? • Is there sufficient duplication between shared print storage repositories and the HathiTrust Digital Library to permit a significant number of academic libraries to optimize and reduce total spending on local print management operations? • What operational gains might be obtained through a selective externalization of collection management activities? Based on a year-long study of data from the HathiTrust, ReCAP, and WorldCat, we concluded that our central hypothesis was successfully confirmed: there is sufficient material in the mass-digitized library collection managed by the HathiTrust to duplicate a sizeable (and growing) portion of virtually any academic library in the United States, and there is adequate duplication between the shared digital repository and large-scale print storage facilities to enable a great number of academic libraries to reconsider their local print management operations. Significantly, we also found that the combination of {{a relatively small number of}} potential shared print providers, including the Library of Congress, was sufficient to achieve more than 70 % coverage of the digitized book collection, suggesting that shared service may not require a very large network of providers. Analysis of the distribution of subject matter and library holdings represented in the HathiTrust Digital Library and shared print repositories further confirmed that the digital corpus is largely representative of the collective academic library collection, suggesting a broad potential market for service. A further positive finding was that monographic titles in the humanities constitute the greatest part of the mass-digitized resource, which may indicate that some relatively under-resourced disciplines will begin to benefit from a digital transformation that has already powered enormous innovation in the sciences. As detailed below, we also found that substantial library space savings and cost avoidance could be achieved if academic institutions outsourced management of redundant low-use inventory to shared service providers. Our findings also revealed some important obstacles and limitations to implementing changed print management practices in the current library operating environment. The following are among the most important constraints we identified: • The proportion of public domain content in the HathiTrust Digital Library is relatively small (approximately 16 % of titles in June 2010) and typically represents material that is not widely held in the library system; as a result, the number of libraries that might hope to reduce local print management costs for these titles through negotiated agreements with the HathiTrust and shared print providers is quite low. Moreover, the age and subject distribution of titles in the public domain is not representative of academic research collections as a whole. In sum, the public domain corpus as currently defined by U. S. copyright law cannot be considered a viable surrogate for any academic print collection. • While significant duplication was found between the HathiTrust Digital Library and multiple large-scale library storage collections, it was apparent that no single print storage repository could offer coverage sufficient to enable significant space savings or cost avoidance for a given client library. Put another way, effective shared print storage solutions will depend upon a network of providers who will need to optimize holdings as a collective resource. • The absence of a robust discovery and delivery service based on collective print storage holdings is an impediment to changed print management strategies, especially for digitized titles in copyright. It is our strong conviction, based on the above findings, that academic libraries in the United States (and elsewhere) should mobilize the resources and leadership necessary to implement a bridge strategy that will maximize the return on years of investment in library print collections while acknowledging the rapid shift toward online provisioning and consumption of information. Even, and perhaps especially, in advance of any legal outcome on the Google Book Search settlement, academic libraries have a unique opportunity to reconfigure <b>print</b> supply <b>chains</b> to ensure continued library relevance in the <b>print</b> supply <b>chain.</b> In the absence of a licensing option, online access to most of the digitized retrospective literature will be severely constrained. Demand for print versions of digitized books will continue to exist and libraries will be motivated to meet it, but they will need to do so in more cost-effective ways. In the absence of fully available online editions, full-text indexing of digitized in-copyright material provides a means of moderating and tuning demand for print versions and should facilitate the transfer of an increasing part of the print inventory to high-density warehouses. Viewed in this light, shared print storage repositories could enable a significant and positive shift in library resources toward a more distinctive and institutionally relevant service portfolio...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how opinions of persons from outside the livestock industry on the practice of hot-iron jaw branding are perceived by persons from within the Texas livestock show industry. The key-informant interviews conducted revealed interesting findings. The persons interviewed from within the Texas livestock show industry personally did not feel that there was a problem with the practice of hot-iron jaw branding, but they did feel that persons from outside the livestock industry would obtain a negative image of the livestock industry from hearing about or witnessing the practice. The majority of the respondents felt the time for a change had come. The issues which surfaced during every interview centered on more efficient education and good sound reasons for every practice. From within, the livestock show industry must spot and mark for change or justify areas of potential or emerging concern. If a practice can be justified by persons within the livestock industry, it adds validity to the action. If a practice cannot be justified by persons within the livestock industry, the practice should be discontinued. Modern technology now gives us alternatives to hot-iron jaw branding with different perceptions of pain and effectiveness associated with them. Therefore, there is no longer an excuse for using a practice by reasoning that there are no alternatives. Persons from within the Texas livestock show industry perceive that persons from outside the livestock industry would have a negative experience when exposed to the practice of hot-iron jaw branding. If an individual found the practice negative, it could affect future buying choices and some respondents thought it would trigger the individual to continue to discover negative practices. It behooves the Texas livestock show industry to change from the current method of permanent marking at the livestock shows (hot-iron jaw branding) to a method which would be seen as more acceptable to persons from outside the livestock industry. Alternatives which should be considered by livestock shows in Texas include ear tattooing. hoof branding, electronic identification, non-removable eartags, nose <b>printing,</b> nontamperable neck <b>chains,</b> and no permanent marking...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{antibodies}} as capture {{molecules in}} assays {{is a common}} practice. By either <b>printing</b> monoclonal single <b>chain</b> fragment variables (scFvs) on a solid support – recombinant antibody microarray – or attaching them to magnetic beads – Global Proteome Survey (GPS) – we can specifically capture and measure target proteins of interest. Using the recombinant antibody microarray, we target predominantly intact immunoregualtory proteins, and measure their expression patterns in clinical samples, such as cancer samples. With GPS, we target peptides derived from digested (cancer) samples to identify and quantify a variety of proteins. While antibody microarrays use one antibody per targeted protein, GPS targets peptides, where one antibody can bind hundreds of different proteins – i. e. one antibody per several target proteins. The latter is accomplished by designing antibodies against a short 4 to 6 amino acid long peptide motif shared among these proteins. In this thesis, both of these methods {{have been used to}} decipher cancer biomarker signatures. In paper I, the antibody microarray was used to examine the immunosignature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and how the profile of the immune response differed between cancer patients compared to both healthy and benign controls. We successfully identified an immunosignature of four to ten scFv antibodies that could classify PDAC from controls with high specificity and sensitivity. In paper II we investigated with the antibody microarray how the immune response evolved with, and shaped, emerging cancer cells in patients later diagnosed with breast cancer using antibody microarray. By determining protein expression profiles for cases and controls, we identified several deregulated immunological proteins that reflected evolving breast cancer, up to two years before diagnosis. In papers III and IV, we used both the antibody microarrays and GPS to decipher biomarker signatures to differentiate between histological grades in breast cancer tumors. With molecular signatures capable of classifying grade, we could also visualize the heterogeneity of intermediate grade 2 tumors. Grade 2 tumors have little clinical prognostic value, and a majority of samples are classified as grade 2. Results from paper IV showed that {{it might be possible to}} reclassify many of these samples as either grade 1 or 3, giving clinicians further information for optimal treatment selection. In conclusion, in this thesis I have demonstrated the use of profiling parts of the immune response as a tool for surveying and classifying disease, by using antibodies as specific binders to capture and measure low and high abundant proteins...|$|R
