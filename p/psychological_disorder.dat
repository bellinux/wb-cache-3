25|$|Individuals {{who have}} a comorbid <b>psychological</b> <b>disorder</b> often have a poor {{prognosis}} if either disorder is untreated. Historically most individuals with dual diagnosis either received treatment only for one of their disorders or they didn’t receive any treatment all. However, since the 1980s, {{there has been a}} push towards integrating mental health and addiction treatment. In this method, neither condition is considered primary and both are treated simultaneously by the same provider.|$|E
25|$|For some people, {{procrastination}} can be {{persistent and}} tremendously disruptive to everyday life. For these individuals, procrastination may be symptomatic of a <b>psychological</b> <b>disorder.</b> Procrastination {{has been linked}} to a number of negative associations, such as depression, irrational behaviour, low self-esteem, anxiety and neurological disorders such as ADHD. Others have found relationships with guilt and stress. Therefore, it is important for people whose procrastination has become chronic and is perceived to be debilitating to seek out a trained therapist or psychiatrist to see if an underlying mental health issue may be present.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the association between minor <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> and the reduction of work capacity of nursing professionals. Epidemiological study (cross-sectional) involving 498 (84. 1 %) nursing professionals at a university hospital {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We used the Brazilian versions of the Work Ability Index and the Self-Reporting Questionnaire- 20, with descriptive and multivariate analysis. The prevalence of minor <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> and the reduction of work ability corresponded to 33. 7 % and 43. 3 %, respectively. The analyses adjusted due to confounding factors showed that nursing professionals with suspected minor <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> were twice as likely to have their work ability reduced when compared to those without suspected minor <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders.</b> It is concluded that there is a positive association between minor <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> and reduced work ability among the investigated professionals.

25|$|Both ADHD {{and obesity}} are {{complicated}} disorders and each produces a large impact on an individual’s social well being. This being both a physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>disorder</b> has reinforced that obese individuals with ADHD need more treatment time (with associated costs), and {{are at a}} higher risk of developing physical and emotional complications. The cognitive ability to develop a comprehensive self-construct and the ability to demonstrate capable emotion regulation is a core deficit observed in people with ADHD and is linked to deficits in executive function. Overall, low executive functioning seen in individuals with ADHD has been correlated with tendencies to overeat, as well as with emotional eating. This particular interest in the relationship between ADHD and obesity is rarely clinically assessed and may deserve more attention in future research.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1950s to early 1990s, several pedophile {{membership}} organizations advocated age of consent reform to lower or abolish age of consent laws, {{as well as}} for the acceptance of pedophilia as a sexual orientation rather than a <b>psychological</b> <b>disorder,</b> and for the legalization of child pornography. The efforts of pedophile advocacy groups did not gain any public support and today those few groups that have not dissolved have only minimal membership and have ceased their activities other than through a few websites. In contrast to these organizations, members of the support group Virtuous Pedophiles believe that child sexual abuse is wrong and seek to raise awareness that some pedophiles do not offend; this is generally not considered pedophile advocacy, as the Virtuous Pedophiles organization does not approve of the legalization of child pornography and does not support age of consent reform.|$|E
25|$|To {{a certain}} degree it is normal to procrastinate {{and it can be}} {{regarded}} as a useful way to identify what is important, due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks (for most people). On the other hand, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, stress, anxiety, sense of guilt and crisis as well as loss of personal productivity and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination gets almost chronic. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also social stigma and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of willpower or low ambition. In some cases problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying <b>psychological</b> <b>disorder,</b> but not necessarily.|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{national strategy}} {{for the prevention of}} <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> was presented. Both occupational and nonoccupational factors enter into the development of <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> among workers. <b>Psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> of current interest include affective disturbances such as anxiety, depression, and job dissatisfaction; maladaptive behavioral and lifestyle patterns; and chemical dependencies and alcohol abuse. At this time no surveillance system exists to adequately gauge the national scope of <b>psychological</b> health <b>disorders.</b> Epidemiologic and health care data on costs are accumulating, however. The prevention of work related <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> includes better job design to improve working conditions, surveillance of <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> and risk factors, information gathering and dissemination, training and education of workers, and the enrichment of psychological health services for workers. Recommendations for controlling psychosocial risk factors at work; for improving surveillance of work related <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> and risk factors; for information dissemination, education, and training; and for improving worksite based mental health services are presented.

25|$|It {{is also a}} {{question}} open to debate whether there are genetic influences on the tendency of the co-twins to change, without keeping in mind {{the direction of the}} change. Another factor that can be addressed is biological versus adoptive relatives and can be clearly seen in what is a real-life experiment: adoption. This creates two groups: genetic relatives (biological parents and siblings) and environmental relatives (adoptive parents and siblings). After studying hundreds of adoptive families, researchers discovered that people who grow up together, whether biologically related or not, do not much resemble one another in personality. In characteristics such as extroversion and agreeableness, adoptees are more like their biological parents than their adoptive parents. However, the minute shared-environment effects do not mean that adoptive parenting is ineffective. Even though genetics may limit the family environment's influence on personality, parents do influence their children's attitudes, values, faith, manners, and politics. In adoptive homes, child neglect and abuse and even divorce between the parents is uncommon. This noted it is not surprising, despite a somewhat greater risk of <b>psychological</b> <b>disorder,</b> that most adopted children excel, especially when they are adopted as infants. In fact, seven out of eight have reported feeling a strong connection with one or even both of their adoptive parents.|$|E

40|$|Objective : To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> and somatization among primary care patients from a semi-urban area of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Design : Screening of consecutive patients with the 12 -item and 28 -item versions of the General Health Questionnaires and assessments of physical symptoms associated with somatization, using the HSCL- 12. Eight primary care health centres in Assir, Saudi Arabia. Results : About half of the sample had one or more <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders.</b> The prevalence of somatization detected by the GHQ- 28 was 16 %. The prevalence of somatization indicated by GPs′ identification of medically unexplained symptoms was 14 %. Women displayed higher levels of somatization than men. Conclusion : This study reported prevalence of <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> that was as high as found in the more modern areas of Saudi Arabia such as Riyadh. The view that individuals in less open areas are protected from <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> associated with stress and lifestyle pressure seems to be unsubstantiated.

2500|$|Complex {{post-traumatic}} stress disorder (C-PTSD; also known as complex trauma disorder) is a <b>psychological</b> <b>disorder</b> thought to occur {{as a result of}} repetitive, prolonged trauma involving harm or abandonment by a caregiver or other interpersonal relationships with an uneven power dynamic.

[...] Situations involving captivity/entrapment (a situation lacking a viable escape route for the victim or a perception of such) can lead to C-PTSD-like symptoms, which include prolonged feelings of terror, worthlessness, helplessness, and deformation of one's identity and sense of self.|$|E

40|$|<b>Psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> {{have been}} proven to be {{associated}} with poor physiological, psychological and immune outcomes in cancer patients. However, despite of many challenges of the changed self-image/body image and the altered sexual/urinary function, relatively little is known about <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> of patients with newly diagnosed bladder and kidney cancer. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the associated psychosocial factors among bladder/kidney cancer patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted of consecutive inpatients with bladder/kidney cancer in the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University in Liaoning Province, northeast China. A total of 489 early-stage cancer patients eligible for this study completed questionnaires on demographic and clinical variables, depression, anxiety, PTSD, perceived social support and positive psychological variables (hope, optimism and resilience) anonymously during October 2013 and August 2014. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between psychosocial resources and <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders,</b> while controlling for possible covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD was 77. 5 %, 69. 3 % and 25. 2 %, respectively, while 24. 9 % of patients had psychological co-morbidity. Psychosocial resources together explained {{more than one-third of the}} variance on <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders.</b> Under standardized estimate (β) sequence, patient's perception of social support from family was significantly associated with depression, anxiety and PTSD (p < 0. 01). Optimism and resilience showed integrated and independent effects on <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders,</b> and hope represented the significant association with PTSD only (p < 0. 01). The high prevalence of <b>psychological</b> <b>disorders</b> in newly diagnosed patients with early-stage bladder/kidney cancer should receive more attention in Chinese medical settings.
