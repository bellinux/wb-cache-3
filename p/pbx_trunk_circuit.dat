50|$|When {{signaling}} {{is performed}} on the same circuit as the conversation of the call, it is termed channel-associated signaling (CAS). This {{is the case for}} earlier analogue trunks, multi-frequency (MF) and R2 digital <b>trunks,</b> and DSS1/DASS <b>PBX</b> <b>trunks.</b>|$|R
50|$|For old, analog <b>PBX</b> <b>trunks,</b> glare {{would be}} reduced by using ground start signalling, which offered better answer and {{disconnect}} supervision. IE: Nortel BSP discouraged using loop start trunks for this and other reasons. Long Distance exchanges in the 1950s and 60s incorporated Glare Detectors to alleviate the problem.|$|R

50|$|In {{early and}} middle 20th century {{telephone}} exchanges this task {{was done by}} a supervisory relay set known variously as junctor circuit or district junctor. Later designs made it {{a function of the}} <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> or absorbed it into software.|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as incoming <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|R
25|$|These voltage {{changes on}} the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> would cause pops or clicks that were audible to the {{subscriber}} as the electrical handshaking stepped through its protocol. Another handshake, to start timing for billing purposes, caused {{a second set of}} clunks when the called party answered.|$|R
25|$|Examples {{of signals}} {{communicating}} supervision or call progress include E and M signaling, SF signaling, and robbed-bit signaling. In physical (not carrier) E and M <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits,</b> <b>trunks</b> were four wire. Fifty trunks {{would require a}} hundred pair cable between switches, for example. Conductors in one common circuit configuration were named tip, ring, ear (E) and mouth (M). Tip and ring were the voice-carrying pair, and named after the tip and ring on the three conductor cords on the manual operator's console.|$|R
50|$|During this era, most voice {{connections}} used analog <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> {{that were}} designed to conform with the Via Net Loss plan established by Bell Laboratories. The purpose of the VNL plan and five-level long distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> in a call and maximize the voice quality of the connections. Excessive loss in a voice connection meant that subscribers may have difficulty hearing each other. This was particularly important in the 1960s when dial up data connections were developed {{with the use of}} analog modems. The SES evaluated multi-frequency outpulsing signaling as well as voice impairments including sound amplitude, noise, echo, {{and a variety of other}} parameters. Deployment of common-channel signaling systems such as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling and later Signaling System #7 obviated the need to monitor multi-frequency signaling as it became obsolete.|$|R
25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form called Panel Call Indicator Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably {{the most common form}} of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending dial pulses, equivalent to a rotary dial's pulsing, but sent over <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> between switches.|$|R

50|$|Also taking {{advantage}} of the superior versatility of 5XB, Centrex was invented as a service package. Later stored program control exchanges allowed more extensive service features. Autovon originally used a four-wire version of 5XB, with a more complex marker to implement its nonhierarchical polygrid routing system, and <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> with additional logic and data storage built in to implement preemption.|$|R
50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{outgoing}} <b>trunks</b> are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R

50|$|The {{signaling}} unit and <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> communicate their status over the E and M leads, {{using a combination}} of Battery and Earth (also known as Ground). The Battery signal used in the standard is nominally −48VDC. All E&M installations require that the +ve terminal of the Battery is connected to a shared reliable Earth. The maximum distance between the Signaling Unit and the Trunk interface is determined by the resistance of the wire, but will normally be less than 100m for adequate noise immunity.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Stored Program Control {{came to live}} up to {{its promise}} of versatility, and Centrex {{customers}} were among the first in the middle 1970s to be removed from 5XB to 1ESS switch. Complex logic and storage was cheaper in a central computer than in individual <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits,</b> hence outgoing calls could be transferred as easily as incoming. Other manufacturers produced similar services, usually calling them something else due to trademark considerations. Northern Electric (later known as Nortel) called their version IBN or Integrated Business Network and enhanced the service with their proprietary P-phone sets in the 1980s.|$|R

The cable was completed on 6 June 1929 and the first call between the Isle of Man and the outside world was made on 28 June 1929 by Lieutenant Governor Sir Claude Hill in Douglas to the Postmaster General in Liverpool.

5000|$|With a clean FCG test, {{the call}} {{completion}} software told the [...] "A" [...] relay in the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> to operate, connecting its transmission and test hardware to the switching fabric {{and thus to}} the line. Then, for an outgoing call, the trunk's scan point would scan {{for the presence of}} an off hook line. If the short was not detected, the software would command the printing of a [...] "Supervsion Failure" [...] (SUPF) and try again with a different junctor. A similar supervision check was performed when an incoming call was answered. Any of these tests could alert for the presence of a bad crosspoint.|$|R
2500|$|When {{a calling}} party lifted the receiver, the local loop current lit a signal lamp near the jack. The {{operator}} responded by inserting the rear cord (answering cord) into the subscriber's jack and switched her headset into the circuit to ask, [...] "Number, please?" [...] For a local call, the operator inserted the front cord {{of the pair}} (ringing cord) into the called party's local jack and started the ringing cycle. For a long distance call, she plugged into a <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> to connect to another operator in another bank of boards or at a remote central office. In 1918, the average time to complete the connection for a long-distance call was 15 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Previous systems use relays in the {{incoming}} <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> to control ringing and to return busy tone. 5XB uses a ringing selection switch (RSS): a crossbar switch with ten verticals, serving ten trunks. The various levels provide various tones, and ringing current of various durations and cadences (especially valuable for party lines). Levels 0 and 1 {{are used as}} discriminating levels to set polarity for selective ringing on tip side or ring side. An especially sensitive wire spring RT relay is used to detect off-hook from a line being rung, release the RSS hold magnet, and engage the shielded supervision relay so reverse battery answer supervision would {{be returned to the}} originating end.|$|R

50|$|Ditherington Flax Mill in Shrewsbury was {{the first}} iron-framed {{building}} {{in the world in}} 1797. Thomas Bolton & Sons of Froghall, Staffordshire, made the world's first transatlantic telegraph cable in 1857, having supplied a submarine cable across the English Channel in 1850. GEC Telecommunications was headquartered at the GEC Telephone and Radio Works in Coventry, it has now become the New Century Park, off the A428 north of Stoke Aldermoor in eastern Coventry. On 10 July 1890, a <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> telephone line was opened between London and Birmingham by the National Telephone Company; {{for the first time this}} allowed phone calls between the London and the north. The world's first coaxial cable was laid between London and Birmingham in 1936 to give 40 channels for telephone traffic. and brought into use in 1938, later extended to Manchester in 1940.|$|R
50|$|The {{card sorter}} of the 4A/CTS (Number 4A Crossbar / Card Translator System) allowed six digit {{translation}} of the central office code number dialed by the customer. This determined the proper <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> to use, where separate circuit groups were used for different cities {{in the same area}} code, {{as in the case of}} Oakland and San Francisco. The new device used metal cards similar in principle to computer punched cards, and they were rapidly scanned as they fell past a light beam. On busy days, it sounded like a machine gun firing. CTS machines were called 4A (Advanced) if the translator was included in the original installation, and 4M (Modified) if it was added later. A 1970s version of 4XB, the 4A/ETS, used a computer to translate. For international dialing, Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) provided the extra computer power.|$|R
50|$|The term is {{typically}} used with mobile telephony systems, {{in which there}} are simply not enough radio channels available in a given cell or cells. This causes blocked calls or dropped calls. However, it can also apply to landline phones, in which not enough <b>trunking</b> telephone <b>circuits</b> are available into and out of any given telephone exchange or equivalent switching office at any level of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).|$|R
50|$|Junctors are wired from LLF {{through the}} junctor {{grouping}} frame to {{the levels of}} trunk junctor switches in the trunk link frame (TLF). Unlike earlier designs, the junctors have no supervisory relays or other active hardware, all such functions being assigned to <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> The basic design of the TLF has ten junctor switches with their horizontal multiples split in half, hence two hundred junctors, and two hundred trunk links to the ten trunk switches. The banjo wiring of the trunk switch was not split, but a discriminator level trick devoted two levels to doubling {{the use of the}} other eight, thus allowing each trunk switch to connect sixteen trunks to its twenty trunk links. This results in the TLF having a 0.8:1 trunk concentration ratio (TCR). This degree of deconcentration eventually turned out to provide too few trunk appearances for the variety of trunk types needed. The final 1970s 5XB offices had type C trunk switches with twelve levels, using two for discrimination, leaving a TCR of unity.|$|R
