5|$|By 2001, {{the notable}} successes of computer-animated films from Pixar and DreamWorks such as Monsters, Inc. and, Shrek, respectively, against Disney's lesser returns for The Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis: The Lost Empire {{led to a}} growing {{perception}} that hand-drawn animation was becoming outdated and falling out of fashion. In March 2002, just after the successful release of Blue Sky Studios' computer-animated feature Ice Age, Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films. A handful of employees were offered positions doing computer animation. Morale <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> a low {{not seen since the}} start of the studio's ten-year exile to Glendale in 1985. The Paris studio was also closed in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In Spoke City, Thomas Prescott accepts an {{apparently}} innocent hitch-hiker into his car. The stranger's true intentions are revealed when he attaches a metal bracelet to Prescott's wrist, warning {{him that it}} contains a powerful explosive charge that is due to detonate in 30 minutes; the key to unlock it will be found {{in his office at}} the Hudson Building. Speeding to his workplace with the police in pursuit, Prescott removes the bracelet and leaves it in a filing cabinet. The device explodes as he is returning to the ground floor in a lift: the top levels of the Hudson Building are incinerated, and Prescott is <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> the bottom of the lift shaft, ten storeys underground.|$|E

25|$|On July 24, 1930, {{sometime}} after 6:00p.m., the park's Big Dipper roller coaster crashed when a bolt worked itself loose. Four cars containing {{children and teenagers}} <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> the ground. Four {{people were killed and}} 17 injured.|$|E
25|$|As of 1997, Hamburg Police {{had lost}} 26 police {{officers}} since World War II.

25|$|At {{the dawn}} of the twenty-first century, labor union density (percentage of unionized American workers) was {{reaching}} a historic low point. From a high of over 30 percent in the 1950s, the proportion of American workers who were union members had <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> 12 percent in the year 2000, and only 8 percent of private sector employees.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1969, the Indian Rupee was {{trading at}} around 13 British pence. A decade later, by 1979, it was trading at around 6 British pence. Finally, {{by the end of}} 1989, the Indian Rupee had <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> an all-time low of 3 British pence. This {{triggered}} a wave of irreversible liberalisation reforms away from populist measures.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, the vessels' {{entry into}} service closely coincided with the panic of 1873, which {{triggered}} {{one of the longest}} economic recessions in U.S. history. By 1875, immigration to the United States had <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> just 50% of its previous level, while overall trade declined 17%. Consequently, the four ships—the only ships fully owned by the American Steamship Company—steadily lost money.|$|E

When asked if Yushchenko should be impeached, over 56% of those polled were in favor with almost 27% against.|$|E
25|$|Belfast West has {{historically}} been the most nationalist of Belfast's four constituencies, though {{it is only in}} the last few decades that the votes for unionist parties have <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> tiny levels. The constituency is largely made of a long, slender, belt along the Falls Road and its suburban extensions, with three of the five wards from the staunchly unionist Shankill area now something of a bolt-on, with a several kilometre long peace line dividing them from the rest of the constituency. There is also a smaller Protestant enclave at Suffolk.|$|E
25|$|Mediterranean to {{continental}} Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa) and {{highland climate}} (Köppen H). These are the innermost lands and those {{at a higher}} elevation (cities included here are, amongst others, Alcoy, Morella, Requena and Villena). Here winters are cool to cold, especially at night (a few days of snow are not unusual), summers mild to hot and rainfall more evenly distributed through the year. The lower registered temperatures in the Valencian Community were in these inland areas during the cold wave of 1956. Temperatures <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> nearly −20°C; as in Vistabella del Maestrat (−19°C) and Castellfort (–17°C).|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of the dog {{was published in the}} Connecticut Quarterly, (April–June, 1898), by New York geologist W.H.C. Pynchon. According to Pynchon, in February 1891 he and geologist Herbert Marshall of the USGS were conducting geologic research in the Hanging Hills when they saw the dog. Pynchon had seen the dog once before. Marshall, who had seen the dog twice, scoffed at the legend. Shortly after the two of them saw the dog, Marshall slipped on the ice atop one of the cliffs and <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> his death. His body was recovered by authorities. Reports of the Black Dog continue to circulate today.|$|E
25|$|After {{refitting}} at Brisbane, Tuna {{set out on}} her sixth war patrol on 4 March to take up {{a position}} in the Bismarck Archipelago, off Lyra Reef, on the northeast side of New Ireland. En route, she patrolled west of Bougainville. On 16 March, she received orders to shift her position to a point southeast of a line between Mussau Island and Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands. Late in the afternoon of 29 March, she sighted a convoy of four merchantmen, with two escort ships and two aircraft. After stalking the convoy all night, Tuna attacked the following morning, firing three torpedoes at the largest vessel. Two hits, and the 4697-ton Kurohime Maru <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> the bottom.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 1999, the WWF {{made its}} return to {{terrestrial}} television, airing {{a special program}} known as SmackDown! on the fledgling UPN network. The Thursday night show became a weekly series on August 26, 1999—competing directly with WCW's Thursday night program Thunder on TBS. In 2000, the WWF, in collaboration with television network NBC, announced {{the creation of the}} XFL, a new professional football league that debuted in 2001. The league had high ratings for the first few weeks, but initial interest waned and its ratings <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> dismally low levels (one of its games was the lowest-rated prime-time show in the history of American television). NBC walked out on the venture after only one season, but McMahon intended to continue alone. However, after being unable to reach a deal with UPN, McMahon shut down the XFL.|$|E

500|$|In late 2015, Emanuel's {{approval}} rating <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> [...] "the low 20's" [...] {{in response to}} a series of scandals, most directly the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, the city's subsequent attempts to withhold a video of the shooting, and the lack of an investigation into the matter. In early December 2015 the federal Justice Department announced an investigation into the operations of the Chicago police department, a move which Emanuel initially opposed. At one point half of Chicagoans favored Emanuel's resignation, with highly critical evaluations of the mayor appearing in such sources as The New York Times and The New Yorker, and coming from such figures as the Reverend Al Sharpton.|$|E
500|$|Pierre Assouline {{remarked that}} Hergé's {{attention}} to accuracy lapsed in The Shooting Star.

In reality, no such heat wave would have been caused, while the meteorite would have <b>plunged</b> <b>to</b> the sea floor, causing a tsunami. He noted that the concept of madness was a recurring theme throughout the story, and that there was [...] "an unreality in the whole adventure". Fellow biographer Benoît Peeters asserted that The Shooting Star was [...] "of great power and brilliant construction". Elsewhere, Peeters wrote that the book was [...] "notable for the entry of the fantastic into Hergé's work".|$|E
