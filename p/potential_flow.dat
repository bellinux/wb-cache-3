25|$|Airy wave theory uses a <b>potential</b> <b>flow</b> (or {{velocity}} potential) {{approach to}} describe the motion of gravity waves on a fluid surface. The use of – inviscid and irrotational – <b>potential</b> <b>flow</b> in water waves is remarkably successful, given its failure to describe many other fluid flows where it is often essential to take viscosity, vorticity, turbulence and/or flow separation into account. This {{is due to the}} fact that for the oscillatory part of the fluid motion, wave-induced vorticity is restricted to some thin oscillatory Stokes boundary layers at the boundaries of the fluid domain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we firstly {{defined the}} <b>potential</b> debris <b>flow</b> gully. And then using {{the data of}} {{different}} gullies in Wenchuan earthquake hit areas, we built a discrimination model of <b>potential</b> debris <b>flow</b> gully by Fisher Linear Discrimination Analysis method. Finally, the model was used to discriminate the gullies in Jinxihe catchment, in Anxian County. <b>Potential</b> debris <b>flow</b> gully {{is a kind of}} special gully which is in a special evolution phase of the gully when the gully has the happening possibilities of debris flow but no debris <b>flow</b> records. Because <b>potential</b> debris <b>flow</b> can often pose more serious disasters, discrimination of <b>potential</b> debris <b>flow</b> gully is important for disaster prevention and mitigation. To build discrimination model of <b>potential</b> debris <b>flow</b> gully, a database of different gullies in quake-hit areas was established and six discrimination indices were selected based on cause analysis of debris flow. Using the database and the six discrimination indices, we built the discrimination model by Fisher Linear Discrimination Analysis method. The discrimination model was used to discriminate the gullies in Jinxihe catchment. Discrimination results showed that the discrimination model was effective and feasible in discriminating <b>potential</b> debris <b>flow</b> gullies, but it still needs further revised and perfected...|$|R
40|$|A parameter-free {{computational}} {{procedure for}} transonic <b>potential</b> <b>flows</b> around an airfoil is presented. The method {{is based on}} an inexact, Newton-like iterative scheme, and a preconditioned minimal residual algorithm is used to solve the linear system of equations arising at each iterate. This iterative procedure is formulated so that the difficulties associated with the approximate factorization technique, namely the requirement of iteration parameters and the boundary conditions for the intermediate variable are eliminated. Numerical experiments are given for <b>potential</b> <b>flows</b> around NACA 0012 airfoil with different Mach numbers and different angles of attack. These results are then compared with those obtained by the approximate factorization techniques...|$|R
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that action {{potentials}} do not usually produce an observable field, mainly because the currents associated with action <b>potentials</b> <b>flow</b> in opposite directions and the magnetic fields cancel out.

25|$|Sir George Stokes has solved this {{non-linear}} wave problem, in 1847, {{by expanding}} the relevant <b>potential</b> <b>flow</b> quantities in a Taylor series around the mean (or still) surface elevation. As a result, the boundary conditions {{can be expressed}} in terms of quantities at the mean (or still) surface elevation (which is fixed and known).|$|E
25|$|Evidence that Prandtl's {{scenario}} occurs for bluff {{bodies in}} flows of high Reynolds numbers {{can be seen}} in impulsively started flows around a cylinder. Initially the flow resembles <b>potential</b> <b>flow,</b> after which the flow separates near the rear stagnation point. Thereafter, the separation points move upstream, resulting in a low-pressure region of separated flow.|$|E

40|$|Scalar {{transport}} {{in closed}} <b>potential</b> <b>flows</b> is investigated {{for the specific}} case of a periodically reoriented dipole flow. Despite the irrotational nature of the flow, the periodic reorientations effectively create heteroclinic and/or homoclinic points arising from the joining of stable and unstable manifolds. For scalar advection, Lagrangian chaos can be achieved with breakdown of the regular Hamiltonian structure, which is governed by symmetry conditions imposed by the dipole flow. Instability envelopes associated with period-doubling bifurcations of fixed points govern which regions of the flow control parameter space admit global chaos. These regions are further refined via calculation of Lyapunov exponents. These results suggest significant scalar transport enhancement is possible within <b>potential</b> <b>flows,</b> given appropriate programming of stirring protocols...|$|R
25|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of the full nonlinear problem of surface gravity waves within <b>potential</b> <b>flow</b> theory, the above cnoidal waves can be considered the lowest-order term in a perturbation series. Higher-order cnoidal wave theories remain valid for shorter and more nonlinear waves. A fifth-order cnoidal wave theory was developed by Fenton in 1979. A detailed description and comparison of fifth-order Stokes' and fifth-order cnoidal wave theories is given in the review article by Fenton.|$|E
25|$|Subsonic (or low-speed) {{aerodynamics}} describes fluid {{motion in}} flows which are {{much lower than}} the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is inviscid, incompressible and irrotational. This case is called <b>potential</b> <b>flow</b> and allows the differential equations that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of fluid dynamics, thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} flow problem {{is put into}} a non-dimensional form, the viscous Navier–Stokes {{equations}} converge for increasing Reynolds numbers towards the inviscid Euler equations, suggesting that the flow should converge towards the inviscid solutions of <b>potential</b> <b>flow</b> theory – having the zero drag of the d'Alembert paradox. Of this, {{there is no evidence}} found in experimental measurements of drag and flow visualisations. This again raised questions concerning the applicability of fluid mechanics {{in the second half of}} the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Earlier {{attempts}} to describe surface gravity waves using <b>potential</b> <b>flow</b> were made by, among others, Laplace, Poisson, Cauchy and Kelland. But Airy {{was the first}} to publish the correct derivation and formulation in 1841. Soon after, in 1847, the linear theory of Airy was extended by Stokes for non-linear wave motion – known as Stokes' wave theory – correct up to third order in the wave steepness. Even before Airy's linear theory, Gerstner derived a nonlinear trochoidal wave theory in 1802, which however is not irrotational.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' first {{definition}} of wave celerity has, for a pure wave motion, the mean {{value of the}} horizontal Eulerian flow-velocity ŪE at any location below trough level equal to zero. Due to the irrotationality of <b>potential</b> <b>flow,</b> together with the horizontal sea bed and periodicity the mean horizontal velocity, the mean horizontal velocity is a constant between bed and trough level. So in Stokes first definition the wave is considered from a frame of reference moving with the mean horizontal velocity ŪE. This is an advantageous approach when the mean Eulerian flow velocity ŪE is known, e.g. from measurements.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} observation from Stokes' {{solution for}} the oscillating Stokes flow is that vorticity oscillations are confined to a thin boundary layer and damp exponentially when {{moving away from the}} wall. This observation is also valid for the case of a turbulent boundary layer. Outside the Stokes boundary layer – which is often the bulk of the fluid volume – the vorticity oscillations may be neglected. To good approximation, the flow velocity oscillations are irrotational outside the boundary layer, and <b>potential</b> <b>flow</b> theory {{can be applied to the}} oscillatory part of the motion. This significantly simplifies the solution of these flow problems, and is often applied in the irrotational flow regions of sound waves and water waves.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Competitions between {{different}} interactions in strongly correlated electron systems {{often lead to}} exotic phases. Renormalization group {{is one of the}} powerful techniques to analyze the competing interactions without presumed bias. It was recently shown that the renormalization group transformations to the one-loop order in many correlated electron systems are described by <b>potential</b> <b>flows.</b> Here we prove several rigorous theorems in the presence of renormalization-group potential and find the complete classification for the <b>potential</b> <b>flows.</b> In addition, we show that the relevant interactions blow up at the maximal scaling exponent of unity, explaining the puzzling power-law Ansatz found in previous studies. The above findings are of great importance in building up the hierarchy for relevant couplings and the complete classification for correlated ground states in the presence of generic interactions. 1...|$|R
