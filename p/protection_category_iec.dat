40|$|This paper {{propose a}} {{management}} model for improve {{the governance of}} protected areas from an institutional perspective. The good governance in protected areas is based in seven principles: Legitimacy, Inclusiveness, Accountability, Performance, Equity, Connectivity and Institutional sustainability. This proposal {{is based on an}} overview of work at the institutional framework level and incorporates factors that affect to the efficiency of governance and improve it. A collaborative multi-criteria method is proposed to improve the good governance and ensure the Institutional Sustainability dimension, by integrating the stakeholder preferences in decision making. This model allows for obtain priorities on the management objectives of the stakeholders in a protected area and identify equivalences with IUCN <b>protection</b> <b>categories</b> using a multi-criteria outranking technique. It also presents an application in the Albufera Natural Park in Valencia, a strongly man-modified wetland located in Eastern Spain. This holistic approach allows ensure the incorporation of elements associated with the institutional sustainability that are not sufficiently represented in the governance in protected areas and to lay the theoretical basis for improve the governance for the global network of protected areas. The application of the model in the Albufera Natural Park has identified the V-Protected Lanscape / Seascape IUCN category as the equivalent international <b>protection</b> <b>category.</b> The results obtained by the park staff and other stakeholders have no major discrepancies. This suggests that this <b>protection</b> <b>category</b> seems well adapted to the social context of this protected area, moreover, the V <b>protection</b> <b>category</b> usually fits well to ecosystems strongly modified by human activities as is the case of the Albufera of Valencia. This model achieves improve two subdimensions of the Institutional Sustainability in the governance of protected areas: the Institutional Resilience, with a flexible integration of the preferences of the stakeholders and the Institutional Robustness, including the priorities of the stakeholders in the decision making of the protected areas...|$|R

30|$|The {{relatively}} {{high number of}} endemic species is one of Taiwan's outstanding biodiversity features. The existing protected areas network, as it is mostly found in mountainous areas should, according to our analyses, protect most endemic species rather well as they are also concentrated in the mountains (Figure  3) with a few notable exceptions (the Taiwan Barbet, Formosan Blue Magpie Urocissa caerulea, Taiwan Hwamei, and Styan's Bulbul). However, this could change if mountain species are forced to migrate upwards because of climate change (Ko 2010; Chien et al. 2012). Moreover, although percentages of hotspot criteria covered by 'low-to-high’ protection were rather high (48.5 % to 87.2 %, Table  2), {{a large portion of}} those percentages come from major wildlife habitats, which are in the lowest <b>protection</b> <b>category.</b> For the highest <b>protection</b> <b>category,</b> namely national parks, percentages were much lower (12.7 % to 19.2 %, Table  2). Therefore, we strongly support upgrading the protection status of some of the less well-protected areas and establishing some completely new protected areas, especially in the northeastern mountains (Figures  6 and 7).|$|R

50|$|DVD-RAM was one {{of three}} {{competing}} technologies for rewritable DVDs. Its competitors are DVD-RW and DVD+RW. DVD-RAM technology provides good data integrity, data retention and damage protection through a number of mechanisms and properties. Therefore, DVD-RAM is perceived by people (who need to store their data on DVDs for long periods of time) to be better than the other DVD technologies for traditional computer usage tasks such as general data storage, and especially data backup and archival. The Mount Rainier Format standard and SecurDisc for DVD±RW (which also works on DVD-RAM, CD-R, and CD-RW) somewhat lessens the DVD-RAM format's perceived advantage in the data integrity category, but not in the data retention or damage <b>protection</b> <b>categories.</b>|$|R
