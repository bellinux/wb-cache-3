My dissertation contributes to the field of knowledge by providing the first full-length study of Milton’s thinking on the <b>passions</b> throughout his life. It argues that seventeenth-century <b>passions</b> help develop Milton’s concepts of matter and knowledge, agency, and ethics...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Passions</b> by Robert Solomon is {{a defense}} of the view that our <b>passions</b> {{constitute}} our world and our Selves, and that, since our <b>passions</b> are rational, we {{are in control of}} them, we are responsible for them, and we can change them. Indeed, for Solomon, the subject matter of philosophy are the pas-sions (the subjective), because it is only within subjectivity that we make life meaningful. A meaningful life is one in which we order our <b>passions</b> so as to achieve the ultimate goal of subjectivity, namely, the maximization of self-esteem and personal dignity. Thus, the task of philosophy or Solomon's book is to make people reflect upon the strategies they employ to maximize self-esteem and to change those inconsistent, and self-destructive strategies and employ the "right " ones. The main destructive strategy is "the myth of the <b>passions.</b> " This myth teaches us that our reason and our <b>passions</b> are distinct and opposing faculties; that our <b>passions</b> are forces hiding within us building up and bursting into the open when we let go of reason. The myth preserves the mistaken belief that our <b>passions</b> are not within our control. Onc...|$|R

40|$|<b>Passions</b> are {{activities}} that people find important, like or enjoy, and {{on which they}} spend large amounts of time. Research examining <b>passions</b> in adolescence has been limited, despite a tendency for adolescents to explore their identity by trying new activities (Dworkin et aI., 2003). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the association between adolescent <b>passions</b> and positive adjustment (psychological well-being, optimism, purpose in life, and low risktaking), as well as investigate possible underlying mechanisms for the link between <b>passions</b> and adjustment. High school students (N= 2270, 48. 7 % female) from Southern Ontario completed questionnaires in grades 10, 11, and 12. Path analyses were conducted to examine cross-lag paths among all study variables. <b>Passions</b> predicted higher optimism and purpose, as well as lower negative risk-taking, over time, but these adjustment indicators in tum did not predict higher <b>passions</b> over time. Additionally, positive mood and unstructured leisure activities partially mediated these associations. <b>Passions</b> appears to be important for adolescent adjustment, and may serve as a protective factor or help to foster thriving...|$|R
