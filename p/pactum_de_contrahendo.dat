50|$|A <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo</b> is a {{contract}} aimed at concluding another contract. Examples include the option contract (in terms {{of which the}} grantor’s right to revoke his offer is restricted) and the preference contract (whereby the grantor gives a preferential right to conclude a specific contract should he decide to conclude this contract). An option contract constitutes two offers: a substantive offer and an undertaking or option to keep the offer open. If the option holder accepts the first offer by exercising the option, the main contract is created.|$|E

The thesis focuses on the preliminary agreement being concluded according to the effective Czech Civil Code, on its purpose, utilization and function. The thesis also characterises its subjects, subject- matter, content and the process between entering into the preliminary agreement and the future agreement. The thesis deals in detail with the extinguishment of obligation deriving from under the influence of changes in circumstances. In several cases the thesis provides alternative approaches to a particular issue, presents judicial opinions of legal experts and pursues case law.

This Article investigates the international law and deeply commingled regional history pertaining to the Atacama Desert region, the hyperarid yet resource-rich region through which Bolivia seeks to secure its long-lost access to the sea. Investigating the factual circumstances (effectivités), the post-colonial international legal principle of uti possidetis, territorial temptations arising from resource discoveries, and the duty to negotiate based on a <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo,</b> a pactum de negotiando, or unilateral declarations, this Article concludes this case is less suited for adjudicative settlement than resolution by the principal three parties involved in the region – Bolivia, Chile, and Peru – primarily because the parties have, {{over the course of}} this protracted dispute, constructed intersubjective modalities for a shared sovereignty arrangement facilitated by sub-regional economic growth relations. A regional reconstruction of sovereignty in the northern Atacama region presents the better prospect for resolution than is possible through the limited outcomes presented by formal third party dispute settlement...|$|E

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMSince the <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo is prohibitory by {{its nature}} and operation, our law should have {{proceeded}} with caution when determining its effect. This, unfortunately, is not what transpired in the locus classicus decision. Nor did subsequent cases correct this fatal ratio. The distressing {{truth is that the}} old authorities, upon whom the locus classicus judgment is based, were in all probability not writing about pacta de non cedendo. Strangely enough, when this was suggested by an academic in the field, it elicited no response. The lack of response evidences a lack of interest in the topic in general, partly due to the uncertain state of affairs in which the <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo operates, and partly due to the courts' unwillingness to rectify the situation. Despite the waning interest, the <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo is prevalent and appears in many types of contracts, most recently in the powerhouse factoring industry, and cannot simply be swept under the rug. This dissertation breathes new life into the <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo and discusses its validity and effect from a fresh perspective: A commercial perspective with a strong influence from American law.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} whether the current South African law governing the doctrine of pacta de non cedendo complies with the constitutional mandates imposed by our Constitution. In terms of the current law a <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo will only be accorded validity if the debtor is able to demonstrate a substantial interest in the prohibition against cession. However, the interest requirement is only applicable when a <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo is superimposed onto a pre-existing right, and is not required when a right is born ab initio with a prohibition on transfer. In my opinion the current law falls short of the "spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights", as required by s 39 (2) of the Constitution, and is therefore, in need of development. In this paper I propose the following development: Firstly, by requiring the debtor to prove an interest that is served by the <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo, in certain circumstances, the law undermines the value of equality held so dearly by our society. This is because no such requirement exists when other types of restrictive clauses are concluded. It is my contention that the "interest requirement" be relegated from being a free-standing requirement to simply being another factor {{to be taken into account}} when conducting the public policy enquiry. Secondly, pacta de non cedendo appearing in book debts and other similar monetary obligations should always be held contrary to public policy due to the importance of the free flow of claims in commerce, specifically, the factoring and securitisation industries. Factoring plays a crucial role in the world economy, the most advantageous aspect of factoring is that small to medium size businesses may obtain much needed finance by selling their claims to a factoring house. Lastly, the current distinction drawn between a <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo that is superimposed onto a pre-existing right, and a right that is created with a <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo is artificial and illogical, the correct distinction that should be drawn is between a <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo that is concluded by the debtor and creditor on the one hand, and between a <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo concluded between the cedent and cessionary on the other...|$|R
40|$|Resumé Agreement on the Future Agreement {{according}} to the arrangement of Commercial Code The thesis deals with the institute of a contract about a future contract {{in the sense of}} a commercially legal adjustment. Although the focus is on the analysis of the legal institute {{according to}} its currently valid arrangement, the thesis also contains a brief historical excursus about the development of the pacta <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo</b> institute. The reason for it is the fact that a contract about a future contract is a legal institute with a long history which dates in the Roman law, where there cannot be any doubt that the long historical development of the institute of a contract about a future contract contributed to the forming of its current form and concept. From the point of view of the valid legal adjustment of a contract about a future contract implemented by the code of law the thesis deals with single necessities of this legal institute, as to say with the subjects which can conclude a contract about a future contract with essential necessities which condition its valid negotiation. It is also dealt with the consequences of breaking the obligations following from concluding pacta <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo.</b> Collaterally with the analysis of the valid commercially legal adjustment of the pacta <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo</b> institute there [...] ...|$|R

And as a general rule, under the Code of Conduct issued by the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe, European lawyers are not permitted to charge for their services based on the principle of <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> quota litis. This code of conduct is not always applicable in its entirety to all European lawyers, but in several European countries it has direct effect e.g. in cross border matters.

50|$|A <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> quota litis {{is defined}} as “an {{agreement}} to share the proceeds {{of one or more}} lawsuits” and it is the duty of the court to ascertain, of its own motion, the lawfulness of such agreement as it cannot lend its assistance to the execution of agreements and transactions which are contrary to law. An initial distinction between an acceptable and an objectionable <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> quota litis was formulated in Hugo & Möller N.O. v Transvaal Loan, Finance and Mortgage Co, 1894 (1) OR 336. The Court held that a fair agreement to provide the necessary funds to enable an action to be proceeded with, in consideration for which the person lending the money is to receive an interest in the property sought to be recovered, must not be considered per se to be contra bonos mores. The court was concerned about potential abuses for such agreements, such using them for purposes of gambling with litigation cases.|$|R

50|$|A non-variation clause does {{sometimes}} have unacceptable consequences, and its application is limited. It is restrictively interpreted, because it limits {{the principle of}} freedom of contract. Cancellation of the contract and certain forms of waiver of rights (e.g. waiver of an accrued right arising from a breach of contract, datio in solutum, release of the debtor, and a <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non petendo) do not amount to variations. A non-variation clause is not enforced where its enforcement is against public policy or where estoppel can be raised. Neither defence has successfully been raised on the facts in any reported case.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a general}} {{requirement}} {{for the creation of}} contractual obligations that their contents must be certain, or capable of being rendered certain. Courts generally try to interpret a contract as valid, rather than as void for uncertainty. In some circumstances, obligations may be void for uncertainty if they are pacta <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo,</b> or because they use vague language or are of indefinite duration. The parties may agree on a mechanism for determining what has to be performed. Where this mechanism {{takes the form of a}} power granted to a third party, or possibly even to one of the parties to determine what has to be performed, the courts will (depending on the type of contract) uphold the contract, provided that the power has been exercised reasonably.|$|R

40|$|The {{profound}} {{evolution in}} the European and international legislative framework with respect to contractual restrictions on the assignment of claims offers {{an opportunity for a}} critical reinterpretation of Italian legislation and a different, innovative reconstruction of the conditions of admissibility of agreements aimed at restricting or prohibiting the assignment of monetary claims (and in particular of trade receivables) in order to understand and take adequately into account the different needs of traders as well as promoting their competitiveness in the international market. In this context, particular attention should be focused on, among other things, the interaction between the provisions on contractual restrictions on the assignment of receivables and the implementing provisions of Directive 2011 / 7 /EU on combating late payments in commercial transactions, as well as the recent introduction in Italy, under law decree no. 245 of 23 December 2013, of a provision concerning restrictions on the assignment of the right to compensation for injury or damage resulting from the use of motor vehicles and watercrafts. Moreover, an analysis of the fragmentation of the legislative solutions addressing the topic of <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> non cedendo in different European countries provides a basis for reflection in the context of private international law, which highlights the substantial limits to competitiveness and {{to the development of the}} internal market resulting from this lack of homogeneity...|$|R
40|$|The {{profession}} of the lawyer {{is subject to}} additional and more demanding standards of professional conduct. Lawyer-client fiduciary relationshipdetermines that attorney’s fee {{is a matter of}} professional ethics. Most discussions occur regarding the contingence of the attorney. In some jurisdictions, the contingency fee is allowed and, in some jurisdictions, it is restricted. Especially in the United States, the majority of cases for compensation for heath injury are based on the contingency fee basis. The Code of Conduct for Lawyersin the European Union prohibits agreements with lawyers on the contingency fee basis, so-called <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> quata litis. The main advantage of the contingence fee agreement is thatthe right to justice is guaranteed, as indigent persons have a possibility to employ any attorney and do not need to pay for the attorney in advance. The person is obliged to pay to his/her attorney only when the case is successful. Therefore access to justice is not hindered due to lack of finances. The main drawback of the contingency fee is its size. Alawyer may agree with a client on the attorney fees which are disproportionately high in comparison with the attorney’s time spent on the case. This is illustrated by landmark Lithuanian cases against the Marijampolė hospital where the Court of Attorney Ethics declared that the attorney fee equal to 50 % of the outcome of the case is too high. Even though the contingence fee has drawbacks, it should be allowed because, in any case, the attorney fee must be reasonable. But reasonableness is not always enough, therefore itwould be recommended to have more detailed regulation of the contingence fee. The legislation should be also clearer and foresee a possibility to get the attorney contingency fee awarded from the losing party. As the present regulation requires presenting documents confirming the payment of the attorney fee prior to the decision of the court when the contingency fee is not known yet, {{it is not possible to}} get compensation for the attorney costs based on the contingency fee basis. Advokato profesijai taikomi papildomi reiklesni elgesio standartai. Advokato ir kliento fiduciariniai santykiai nulemia tai, kad advokato honoraras yra profesinės etikos klausimas. Daugiausia diskusijų kelia advokatų atlyginimas, priklausantis nuo bylos baigties, dar vadinamas sėkmės mokesčiu. Vienose valstybėse advokato atlyginimas, priklausantis nuo bylos baigties, yra leidžiamas, kitose ribojamas. Europos Sąjungos advokatų etikos kodeksas taip pat įtvirtina draudimą sudaryti susitarimą su advokatu dėl užmokesčio, priklausančio nuo bylos baigties, taip vadinamo <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> quota litis. Pagrindiniai argumentai už sėkmės mokestį yra asmens teisės kreiptis į teismą realizavimas. Nepasiturinčiam asmeniui sudaroma galimybė pasisamdyti norimą advokatą ir atsiskaityti su advokatu tik sėkmingos bylos atveju. Vienas iš pagrindinių sėkmės mokesčio trūkumų yra jo dydis. Advokatas gali susitarti su klientu dėl advokato honoraro, kuris būtų neproporcingai didelis advokato darbui. Nors advokato honoraro sėkmės mokestis turi trūkumų, vis tik jis turėtų būti leidžiamas, tik jo dydis, mokėjimo tvarka turėtų būti detaliau reglamentuoti poįstatyminiais teisės aktais.

The arbitrage document can be in the form compromise document, that is, the agreement document made by the parties after the dispute occurs and in the form of <b>pactum</b> <b>de</b> compromittendomade before the dispute. The arbitrage document has a binding power when the arbitrage document is consistent with the contract freedom principle and the binding power principle as mentioned in Section 1338 KUH Perdata, as well as fulfilling the legitimacy of agreement regulated in the Section 1230 of KUH Perdata, {{as long as it is}} not contrasted with the act, morality, and public discipline. The commercial court has an authority of deciding the bankruptcy case although the parties had made the arbitrage document, because arbitrage is a procedure of settling the debt-credit dispute usually leading to compensation, but if for such dispute the bankruptcy statement proposal is filed, it is becomes the Commercial Court’s authority completely and arbitrage may not settle it. It can also be confirmed by the presence of provision in Article 303 of Act Number 37 of 2004 about the Bankruptcy and Delay of Debt Payment Obligation...|$|R
