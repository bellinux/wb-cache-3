40|$|Failure of {{adaptation}} in feed utilization {{can result in}} larval mortality. Post-larval stage is a critical period of fish development in which transition from internal feeding to external feeding occurs. This study aimed to determine the growth and survival of hard-lipped barb (Osteochilus hasselti C. V.) post-larvae fed with different feeding patterns. The experiment was conducted on an experimental basis with a completely randomized design (CRD). The treatments consisted of (P 1) 100 % Spirulina sp., (P 2) 75 % Spirulina sp. + 25 % <b>pellet</b> <b>powder,</b> (P 3) 50 % Spirulina sp. + 50 % powder pellet, (P 4) 25 % + 75 % sp Spirulina <b>pellet</b> <b>powder,</b> and (P 5) 100 % powder pellets. Day 1 post-hatching larvae were reared in aquaria with density of 17 fish / L for 8 weeks. The larvae were fed as much as 5 % of the total weight of biomass. Post-larval development was evaluated by observing {{the development of the}} larvae morphology, the body length (every week), the biomass weight (every 2 weeks), and calculating their survival rate at week 8. Morphological data were analyzed descriptively. Data on body length, biomass weight and survival were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by LSD test. The results showed that the feeding pattern significantly affected the development of post-larvae (p< 0. 05). The most advance post-larval development was obtained from the post-larvae fed with 100 % <b>pellet</b> <b>powder.</b> In this group, morphological characters of post-larvae in the first week were the mouth start opening, the skin was pigmented, and gall bladder in bi-lobes shaped, caudal fin and dorsal fins were differentiated. Completion of fins development was achieved by the third week when the post-larvae have adult morphological character. The highest body length and biomass weight of the post-larvae was obtained in the group fed with 100 % of pellets and the highest survival rate was found in the group fed with combination of 50 % Spirulina sp. + 50 % <b>pellet</b> <b>powder</b> (P 3) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} by using pressed <b>powder</b> <b>pellets</b> for XRF analysis of ferrosilicon alloys have been investigated.

40|$|International audienceMixtures {{made up of}} {{bentonite}} <b>powder</b> and <b>pellets</b> are {{a possible}} candidate for making sealing plugs used in deep radioactive waste disposal due to their low permeability, high swelling capacity, favourable properties with respect to radionuclide retention and operational advantages in terms of placement in situ, which is much easier than that of pre-compacted bricks of bentonite/sand mixture. It is therefore essential to better understand their hydro-mechanical behaviour to optimize {{the design of the}} repository. In this context, the French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) has launched the SEALEX project (SEALing performance EXperiments) in which this work has been conducted. Once the initially heterogeneous unsaturated powder/pellet (80 / 20) MX 80 bentonite mixture is put in place, these sealing materials will be subject to coupled hydro-mechanical loadings: hydration due to the infiltration of pore water from the natural barrier and mechanical confinement resulting from the engineered barriers. The present work focuses on the different scales of the material: at the macroscopic scale, it is characterised by a heterogeneous distribution of <b>pellets</b> and <b>powder</b> of bentonite; at the microscopic scale, it is studied by several techniques (MIP, μ-CT observations and SEM). From MIP results, a typical bimodal distribution was found for both <b>pellet</b> and <b>powder.</b> From μ-CT and SEM observations, a heterogeneity was revealed in the internal structure of the pellet: heterogeneous density distribution of the clay minerals and presence of several high density elements...|$|R

40|$|Metal {{hydrides}} {{are potential}} materials for onboard hydrogen storage. Thermal property measurements {{are needed to}} optimize the thermal management design of metal hydride storage systems which require a measurement technique developed with considerations of the thermodynamics of the hydriding process and the pyrophoric nature of the material. In the present work, a transient plane source (TPS) apparatus was integrated with a pressure vessel to measure effective thermal conductivity (keff) and thermal diffusivity (α) of metal hydrides in a high pressure hydrogen environment (up to 275 bar) for the first time. From these direct measurements, the material specific heat (CP) was derived from isotropic property relations. Furthermore, a custom pellet press was fabricated to make metal hydride pellets, including additives for structural integrity and thermal enhancement. ^ Thermal properties of Ti 1. 1 CrMn in oxidized <b>pellet,</b> oxidized <b>powder,</b> activated <b>powder</b> were measured. <b>Pellets</b> composed with graphite and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) had the highest keff between 6. 3 and 6. 9 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K. <b>Pellets</b> with aluminum <b>powder</b> had a keff of 1. 7 to 3. 5 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K, dependent on the compression force applied on the <b>pellets.</b> Oxidized <b>powder</b> k eff increased from 0. 80 to 1. 6 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K with increasing hydrogen pressure from 0. 17 to 275 bar. The pressure dependence of keff was attributed to the change in mean free path of the hydrogen gas with pressure. In contrast to oxidized powder, keff of activated Ti 1. 1 CrMn powder ranged from 0. 31 to 0. 71 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K {{as a function of}} hydrogen pressure from 2. 9 to 253 bar. While k eff was only dependent on the hydrogen pressure, both α and C P data of activated powder had strong dependencies on the hydriding reaction progress. This dependency was attributed to the change in metal hydride lattice structure between the desorbed and the absorbed phase, which affected the phonon transport. The present thermal property study provided data and insights for the implementation of efficient thermal management in metal hydride based onboard hydrogen storage systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Raw plastic {{materials}} used in the plastic manufacturing industries are <b>pellets,</b> <b>powder</b> or sheet mixtures constituted by the main polymer together with several additives (e. g., plasticizers, stabilizers, antioxidants, pigments). The manufacturing processes themselves depend on both the polymer characteristics and the artifact characteristics. During the plastic manufacturing, toxic products can enter the working environment due to the plastic heating. A complete environmental analysis looking for all the pollutants that can be foreseen is usually carried out to define if the workers' risk level is acceptable or not. Therefore, a simple and cheap screening procedure has been developed and validated by comparison with environmental analysis carried out in two PVC manufacturing industries. Such a procedure can give information on which toxic products are expected to enter the working environment {{as well as on}} the relative amount of such products, and it can be used to screen which situations deserve a deeper environmental analysis. For this reason, a preliminary study aimed to evaluate the release of toxic compounds in manufactures of extruded cables has been carried out. Main aim of the work was to identify and quantify the possible emissions released by several PVC-based materials once they undergo heating treatments; typical operating conditions that are used during cable production have been reproduced in a laboratory-scale apparatus and different analytical techniques have been applied in order to detect the emissions. In particular, the attention has been focused on the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and aldehydes.
