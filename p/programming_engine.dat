30|$|The {{mathematical}} {{model can be}} readily solved by using constraint <b>programming</b> <b>engine</b> software, which has been proved to be very powerful in industrial control applications (Fromherz et al. 1999). The constraint <b>programming</b> <b>engine</b> software integrates multiple techniques in operations research (OR), artificial intelligence (AI) and graph theory (Rossi et al. 2006) for solving complicated scheduling problems with efficiency and cost-effectiveness (Bockmayr and Hooker 2003). Constraint programming has also been employed in addressing construction scheduling problems of practical size and complexity. Liu and Wang (2012) took advantage of constraint programming to enhance the computing efficiency for scheduling linear construction projects with multi-skilled crews. Menesi et al. (2013) demonstrated the capability of constraint programming to handle the time-cost trade-off problem for large-scale projects involving thousands of activities. In this study, IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V 12.6 (2016) was utilized to implement constraint programming algorithm in search for the optimum solution to the {{mathematical model}}.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGiven a logic {{program that}} is {{terminating}} and mode-correct in an idealized Prolog interpreter (i. e., in a top-down logic <b>programming</b> <b>engine),</b> a bottom-up logic <b>programming</b> <b>engine</b> {{can be used to}} compute exactly the same set of answers as the top-down engine for a given mode-correct query by rewriting the program and the query using the Magic Sets Transformation (MST). In previous work, we have shown that focusing can logically characterize the standard notion of bottom-up logic programming if atomic formulas are statically given a certain polarity assignment. In an analogous manner, dynamically assigning polarities can characterize the effect of MST without needing to transform the program or the query. This gives us a new proof of the completeness of MST in purely logical terms, by using the general completeness theorem for focusing. As the dynamic assignment is done in a general logic, the essence of MST can potentially be generalized to larger fragments of logic...|$|E

40|$|XSLT is a {{powerful}} and widely used language for transforming XML documents. However its power and complexity can be overwhelming for novice or infrequent users, many of which simply give up on using this language. On the other hand, many XSLT programs of practical use are simple enough to be automatically inferred from examples of source and target documents. An inferred XSLT program is seldom adequate for production usage but {{can be used as}} a skeleton of the final program, or at least as scaffolding in the process of coding it. It should be noted that the authors do not claim that XSLT programs, in general, can be inferred from examples. The aim of Vishnu - the XSLT generator engine described in this paper – is to produce XSLT programs for processing documents similar to the given examples and with enough readability to be easily understood by a programmer not familiar with the language. The architecture of Vishnu is composed by a graphical editor and a <b>programming</b> <b>engine.</b> In this paper we focus on the editor as a GWT web application where the programmer loads and edits document examples and pairs their content using graphical primitives.

40|$|Vishnu is a {{tool for}} XSLT visual {{programming}} in Eclipse - a popular and extensible integrated development environment. Rather than writing the XSLT transformations, the programmer loads or edits two document instances, a source document and its corresponding target document, and pairs texts between then by drawing lines over the documents. This form of XSLT programming is intended for simple transformations between related document types, such as HTML formatting or conversion among similar formats. Complex XSLT programs involving, for instance, recursive templates or second order transformations {{are out of the}} scope of Vishnu. We present the architecture of Vishnu composed by a graphical editor and a <b>programming</b> <b>engine.</b> The editor is an Eclipse plug-in where the programmer loads and edits document examples and pairs their content using graphical primitives. The <b>programming</b> <b>engine</b> receives the data collected by the editor and produces an XSLT program. The design of the engine and the process of creation of an XSLT program from examples are also detailed. It starts with the generation of an initial transformation that maps source document to the target document. This transformation is fed to a rewrite process where each step produces a refined version of the transformation. Finally, the transformation is simplified before being presented to the programmer for further editing...|$|E
