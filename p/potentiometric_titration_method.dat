40|$|The {{service life}} of a {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) bridge deck in cold climates is often limited by chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement due to exposure to de-icing salts routinely applied in the winter. Although {{there has been an}} extensive research effort on chloride ingress into concrete in the last three decades, research conducted on structural concrete members carrying in-service loads is limited. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of sustained load on chloride ingress into concrete and to examine the reliability of spraying a AgNO 3 solution onto concrete as a quick method to determine chloride penetration. To achieve these objectives, an experimental program was carried out, in which a small-scale RC slab was subjected to wet and dry cycles with a saturated chloride solution while sustaining static service loads. The concrete slab was cast with three strips of different water-to-cement ratios to represent different field conditions. Supports were located to create both positive and negative moment regions in the top mat reinforcement of the slab. Concrete cores were taken at several sections along the RC deck, which were stressed to different levels, and at three time intervals, each of them after a wet/dry cycle of 90 days. Concrete cores were sprayed with a AgNO 3 solution to determine an average chloride penetration front, and chloride profiles along the concrete cover for each core were measured by <b>potentiometric</b> <b>titration.</b> Chloride diffusion coefficients were obtained from the data obtained from spraying AgNO 3 and titration, the latter by curve-fitting to Fick's 2 nd law. The comparison between both sets of data reveals that the differences diminish as the time of exposure increases. The chloride diffusivity along the span of the slab, relative to that of an unstressed section, was related to the applied bending moment. The experimental results also indicate that there is a dependence of chloride ingress properties on the type and level of sustained load.

40|$|A {{sequential}} injection analysis {{system for the}} turbidimetric determination of chloride in different types of water is proposed. The determination {{is based on the}} reaction of chloride with silver ions and the subsequent measurement of the turbidity caused by silver chloride precipitation. In this method, the use of toxic reagents, such as mercury thiocyanate, commonly employed in most spectrophotometric techniques for chloride determination, is avoided. The main feature of the developed system is the use of a single configuration to carry out the determination over a wide concentration range (2 – 400 mg L 21) by changing only the aspirated sample volume. This characteristic allows the determination of chloride in ground, surface and wastewaters using the same manifold. In addition, a considerable saving of precipitating reagent is achieved due to noncontinuous consumption.
