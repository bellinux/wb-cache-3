After briefly discussing the common law doctrine of no contribution and efforts to alleviate such a harsh rule, the authors focus on the serious conflicts between the new statute and the underlying equitable principles of Hoffman v.

In particular, the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> <b>sharing</b> of liability, the settlement, and the release provisions of the statute are criticized as not allocating the ultimate liability of the tortfeasors based on their relative degrees of fault. The authors suggest that a legislative change regarding these provisions is warranted so as to maintain a consistent and equitable apportionment system for everyone...|$|E
40|$|We study {{multiline}} {{insurance companies}} with limited liability and limited capital, creating {{the possibility of}} insurer default. Insurance premiums are determined by no-arbitrage option pricing methods. The results are developed under the realistic assumption that the losses created by insurer default are allocated among policyholders following an ex post, <b>pro</b> <b>rata,</b> <b>sharing</b> rule. In general, the ratio of default costs to expected claims, and thus the ratios of premiums to expected claims vary across insurance lines. Moreover, capital and related costs are allocated across lines in proportion to each line’s share of a digital default option on the insurer.

40|$|We study a {{competitive}} multiline insurance industry, in which insurance companies with limited liability choose which insurance lines to cover {{and the amount}} of capital to hold. Premiums are determined by no-arbitrage option pricing methods. The results are developed under the realistic assumptions that insurers face friction costs in holding capital and that the losses created by insurer default are shared among policyholders following an ex post, <b>pro</b> <b>rata,</b> <b>sharing</b> rule. In general, the equilibrium ratios of premiums to expected claims and of default costs to expected claims will vary across insurance lines. We characterize the situations in which monoline and multiline insurance offerings will be optimal. Insurance lines characterized by a large number of essentially independent risks will be offered by very large multiline firms. Insurance lines for which the risks are asymmetric or correlated may be offered by monoline insurers. The results are illustrated with examples. 1...|$|E

In practice, however, limited liability and limited capital imply that insurers may fail to make the required payments to policyholders.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a normative theory of bankruptcy law. The {{core of the}} theory is that bankruptcy law exists in order to maximize the recoveries of and benefits for those who have legal entitlements ("rightsholders") in respect of a financially distressed debtor. It recognizes that bankruptcy law in the United States is a branch of civil procedure, in general, and the jurisdiction of federal courts, in particular; hence, I call the theory "procedure theory. " Procedure theory holds that it generally is wrong in bankruptcy to redistribute a debtor's wealth away from its rightsholders to benefit third-party interests, such as at-will employees and the general community. It also is wrong to rearrange priorities in bankruptcy as among a debtor's rightsholders {{in a way that is}} inconsistent with nonbankruptcy entitlements. Procedure theory explains what bankruptcy law is supposed to achieve. It does not address how bankruptcy law is to achieve its proper ends (e. g., status quo, adoption of market-based or contract-based structures to maximize wealth, etc.). Procedure theory draws support from three perspectives. First, it argues that it simply is incoherent to provide different substantive rules in bankruptcy when those substantive rules are equally applicable outside bankruptcy (e. g., an employer's right to close a plant or a nonbankruptcy priority rule). This incoherence offends notions of justice as well as Dworkin's value of "liberty. " Second, procedure theory is supported by the Erie doctrine in federal courts and considerations of federalism. Basic substantive law rules should not vary depending on the forum in which a proceeding is conducted (e. g., state court or bankruptcy court). Third, a public choice analysis reveals the enormous power of the bankruptcy bar over bankruptcy law, as formulated by Congress or as implemented in the courts. The Judiciary Committees in Congress and the bankruptcy courts, populated by bankruptcy mavens, are improper venues for the development of baseline legal principles that are not bankruptcy specific. If there is a justification for bankruptcy law it must be that, as a collective proceeding, it can maximize or enhance recoveries and benefits for rightsholders when compared to nonbankruptcy law. The paper finally examines a number of important features of United States bankruptcy law that conflict with (or at least appear to conflict with) procedure theory. It generally rationalizes procedure theory with several of these features, including the concept of "property of the estate," the "claims" that are recognized in bankruptcy, the "automatic stay," <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> <b>sharing</b> among creditors, and the trustee's avoidance powers, among others. In several cases procedure theory calls for a modification of current law...|$|E
