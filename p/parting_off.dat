The previous OG/HG series to Gibraltar had been discontinued, {{to be replaced by}} the MKS/KMS series of ships to and from the Mediterranean. The OS/SL series to Freetown and the South Atlantic continued, but now the two routes were combined from Gibraltar; SL convoys from Freetown now making a rendezvous with MKS convoys from North African ports for the final leg of the journey to Britain. Similarly the OS and KMS convoys travelled together across the Bay of Biscay, before <b>parting</b> <b>off</b> Gibraltar.|$|E
50|$|For a given {{machining}} operation, {{the cutting}} speed will remain constant for most situations; therefore the spindle speed will also remain constant. However, facing, forming, <b>parting</b> <b>off,</b> and recess operations on a lathe or screw machine involve the machining of a constantly changing diameter. Ideally this means changing the spindle speed as the cut advances {{across the face}} of the workpiece, producing constant surface speed (CSS). Mechanical arrangements to effect CSS have existed for centuries, but they were never applied commonly to machine tool control. In the pre-CNC era, the ideal of CSS was ignored for most work. For unusual work that demanded it, special pains were taken to achieve it. The introduction of CNC-controlled lathes has provided a practical, everyday solution via automated CSS. By means of the machine's software and variable speed electric motors, the lathe can increase the RPM of the spindle as the cutter gets closer {{to the center of the}} part.|$|E
50|$|While {{figuring}} out the escape plan, Lincoln goes about buying a bomb to plan an explosive finish for Susan and tried to use Sucre to trick her, but both attempts ultimately fail. Sucre and Maricruz were also implicated as a result, though without Lincoln's knowing. Later on, Susan used Sofia as a hostage. That night, Lincoln steals a bus to knock out the power lines to Sona Prison, which then starts off the escape of Michael and the other inmates inside Sona Prison. The escape is eventually successful, with Lincoln joining the inmates and McGrady <b>parting</b> <b>off</b> with his dad in separate ways. Whistler later tried to escape, but Lincoln managed {{to get hold of}} him, forcing Gretchen to carry out the hostage exchange successfully at a museum. Later on, Gretchen's men open fire on police, so that Gretchen and Whistler could escape unharmed but the firing caused Sofia to be shot.|$|E

Manufacturing Cost involves material, labor, equipment & tooling, quality, maintenance etc. Sheet metal forming {{is one of the}} major manufacturing processes and used for most of the products. The Die is the tooling used in the sheet metal forming. The proper design of die is important in sheet metal forming processes. This article discusses how the Combination Die can reduce the manufacturing cost, particularly the labor cost and material handling cost. For this study, a product “U Clamp ” is considered. The Product requires piercing, bending and <b>parting</b> <b>off</b> operations. The Combination Die is designed and fabricated for the product and tested. Data on operation time, material handling time, die fabrication cost are collected, analyzed and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Nowdays an {{efficient}} production {{is critical to}} achieve for companies competing {{on the market for}} steel cutting tools. One of such companies is Halmstad based Tooling Support Halmstad AB that manufactures threading-taps, threading-dies and <b>parting</b> <b>off</b> tools, towards a centralized warehouse in Schiedam, Holland. The large amount of different products, approximately 2500 is a big contributor to the problem along with a new order system that creates a demand of low setup times. Previously the company was forwarded orders through quarter based prognoses which enabled planning of the production over a longer time span. Currently the newer order system ZENIT is in use and the company thereby gets their orders weekly. This type of customer orders effects the production in terms of weekly orders having a variety of different products, which in turn creates a larger amount of setup work that prolongs the lead times even further. The purpose of this project has been to survey the present production in the end manufacturing state of the thread taps in order to come up with improvement proposals which will lead to a more flexible production and less sensitive to irregular demand. The factory consists of several production lines. Our work has been limited to the end manufacturing state of the thread taps in one of the 9 production lines, line 435. Based on the limitation our work has followed the production and order use of thread taps from the local storage to precisely before the wash. Value stream mapping and the SMED-method has been useful during the work process. With these tools proposals have been generated towards a production flow with a divided lead time compared to the current state and a decreased setup-time by 26...|$|E
40|$|O torneamento radial é um processo de usinagem usado na indústria metal mecânica para o corte de peças, abertura de canais ou faceamento. Esta pode ser considerada uma operação crítica devido à forma geométrica da ferramenta e aos movimentos de corte. Isto gera a necessidade de aplicação de fluidos de corte, normalmente em abundância, na região de corte. Considerando como funções destes fluidos o arrefecimento, a lubrificação e a expulsão do cavaco, sua aplicação durante essa operação é de suma importância. Várias pesquisas visam restringir o uso de tais fluidos, seja por critérios econômicos, ambientais ou sanitários. Neste contexto, o uso da técnica de mínima quantidade de lubrificante (MQL) vem ganhando espaço nos meios produtivos. Embora seja aplicada há anos em diferentes processos de usinagem, existem poucos relatos sobre a aplicação de MQL em operações de torneamento radial; no mesmo seguimento, a aplicação de ar comprimido (ACO) vai ao encontro do conceito de usinagem ambientalmente amigável. Assim, este trabalho apresenta uma análise comparativa na aplicação de lubrificantes em abundância (ABD), em MQL e o uso de ACO no torneamento radial do aço SAE 1045 para diferentes condições de corte. Na investigação, foram consideradas as forças geradas durante o processo, as rugosidades e o desvio {{dimensional}} das superfícies usinadas, e o desgaste da ferramenta. Observou-se que os esforços gerados com MQL foram similares ou inferiores aos gerados com ABD. A mesma tendência foi observada no perfil de rugosidade, predominando valores inferiores. O MQL possibilita um corte mais estável durante a vida da ferramenta, reduzindo a ocorrência de desgaste e prolongando sua vida útil, minimiza a oscilação axial e a flexão da ferramenta, reduz as rugosidades e minimiza os desvios dimensionais. Assim, pode-se afirmar que a aplicação da técnica por MQL é viável no torneamento radial do aço SAE 1045. Radial turning is a {{machining process}} {{used in the}} metalworking industry for <b>parting</b> <b>off,</b> grooving or facing operations. This {{can be considered a}} critical operation due to the geometric shape of the tool and the cutting movements. This generates the need for application of cutting fluids, usually in abundance, in the cutting region. Considering as functions of these fluids the cooling, lubrication and expulsion of the chip, their application during this operation is of paramount importance. Several researches aim to restrict the use of such fluids, either by economic, environmental or sanitary criteria. In this context, the use of the minimum quantity of lubricant (MQL) technique has been gaining ground in the productive media. Although it has been applied for years in different machining processes, there are few reports on the application of MQL in radial turning operations; at the same time, the application of compressed air (ACO) meets the concept of environmentally friendly machining. Thus, this work presents a comparative analysis on the application of abundant lubricants (ABD) in MQL and the use of ACO in radial turning of SAE 1045 steel for different cutting conditions. In the investigation, the forces generated during the process, the roughness and the dimensional deviation of the machined surfaces and the tool wear were considered. It was observed that the machining forces generated with MQL were similar or inferior to those generated with ABD. The same tendency was observed in the profile of roughness, predominating lower values. MQL enables a more stable cut during tool life, reducing the occurrence of wear and extending tool life, minimizes axial oscillation and tool flexion, reduces roughness and minimizes dimensional deviations. Thus, it can be indicated that the application of the technique by MQL is feasible in the radial turning of SAE 1045 steel...|$|E
