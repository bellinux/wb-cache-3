[...] In the original definition, it was a <b>power</b> <b>measurement,</b> and as employed in that context, the formulation 10×log should be used, as deci means one tenth. The user must be clear whether the quantity expressed is power or amplitude. It is useful to consider how power or energy is expressed, e.g., current×current×resistance, ×velocity×velocity×mass. [...] Where the power is a square function of a field variable (such as voltage, current, or pressure), then 10×log is the correct expression for the square, or 20×log for the field variable itself.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (a) to determine the measurement device and jumping protocol most appropriate for testing the leg power of elite hockey players and (b) to assess the relationship of leg <b>power</b> <b>measurements</b> to hockey playing ability as indicated by draft selection order. Comparisons were made of leg <b>power</b> <b>measurements</b> from the top 95 players entering the National Hockey League Entry Draft using 2 devices (Vertec and Just Jump) and 2 jump protocols (countermovement and squat). Players' leg powers were ranked from highest to lowest power using each device and protocol and were correlated with draft selection order. Vertec leg <b>power</b> <b>measurements</b> were highest (5, 511 - 5, 631 W), but {{there were no significant differences}} in power between the 2 jumping protocols on either device. Vertec squat jump provided the highest correlation (0. 47) between leg power ranking and selection order and was judged to most closely approximate the full-body coordinated movements involved in hockey. The Vertec device using a squat jump protocol is most appropriate for coaches and fitness specialists to use when evaluating hockey potential based on the off-ice leg <b>power</b> <b>measurements</b> of elite hockey players.
