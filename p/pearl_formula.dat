40|$|Investigation {{into the}} {{contraceptive}} efficacy of 200 μg R 2323 (13 -ethyl- 17 -hydroxy- 18, 19 -dinor- 17 α-pregna- 4, 9, 11 -trien- 20 -yn- 3 -one) and 10 μg R 2858 (11 β-methoxy- 17 α-ethinyl-oestradiol) {{as a combination}} pill, {{was carried out in}} a group of 86 healthy females of proven fertility during 667 cycles (mean 7. 74 cycles). A total of 10 pregnancies occurred for a pregnancy rate of 19. 5, computed by the <b>Pearl</b> <b>formula,</b> but only four were considered drug failures. Although side-effects were generally minimal, one case of cerebral thrombosis was reported. Only two women complained of menorrhagia and three developed amenorrhoea while on therapy. Papanicolaou smears were taken at two- to three-month intervals for a total of 161 smears and no malignant changes were recorded...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{try to provide}} a causal theory which {{can be applied to}} the log-linear models because they are devoid of {{complete}} methods to calculate the different effects. My causal theory uses odds ratios and Pearl's definitions (2001, 2009, 2012). I find that although I delete the log-linear parameter which regulates the interaction, there is still an interaction effect, which I call cell effect and which is due to the mere presence of two variables which affect a third. I then try to calculate this effect using <b>Pearl's</b> <b>formulas</b> for the direct, indirect and total effects and I find that a part of this effect is contained in Pearl's direct natural effect, this part is that related to the nonlinearity. To conclude I provide a test to see if this effect is equal to 0...|$|R
2500|$|Eurogamer's Dan Pearson {{commented that}} those {{looking for a}} {{traditional}} role-playing game for the Nintendo DS should buy something like Chrono Trigger, [...] or , or the Final Fantasy remakes, though he noted that those looking for a Pokémon title should get Platinum. Eurogamer Portugal's Ricardo Madeira called it the [...] "more complete and distinct Pokémon third version he has seen to date." [...] IGN's Craig Harris commented that while the improvements over Diamond and Pearl were not huge, its adventure mode and online mode were more fleshed out and expanded. They also included it in their list of Nintendo DS games of the Spring season, commenting that it improved on Diamond and <b>Pearls</b> gameplay <b>formula,</b> and went [...] "above and beyond with new areas, characters, and, of course, Pokemon". In their [...] "Cheers & Tears: DS RPGs" [...] article, which details role-playing games of both high and low quality, IGN included Platinum as a game of high quality. They called it [...] "packed to overflowing with content", commenting that {{even those who have}} played Diamond and Pearl several times could enjoy it. IGN ultimately named Platinum, along with Diamond and Pearl, as the ninth best Nintendo DS game. IGN nominated it for best role-playing game for the Nintendo DS, while its readers chose it as the best multi-player game for the Nintendo DS.|$|R
