Hybrid vigor for in vitro callus growth {{may be useful}} in the selection of hybrid colonies following <b>protoplast</b> <b>fusions</b> involving N. tabacum. Seedlings of burley tobacco, grown in a greenhouse, were heterotic (P = 0. 01) for dry weight production. Heterosis for seedling vigor could contribute to maintaining re-sidual heterozygosity in selfed and sib-mated lines of tobacco. Phenotypic correlations of seedling dry weight with in vitro callus growth and root production were positive and sig-nificant (P = 0. 05). However, specific combining ability effects for in vivo seedling growth and in vitro callus growth were uncorrelated(r = 0. 00). These results indicate that specific intra-allelic gene interactions that promoted seedling growth were unrelated to gene com-binations that promoted in vitro callus growth.

We evaluated {{the effect of the}} low melting point agarose (LMPA) bead technique on the regeneration capacity of protoplasts of seven C. intybus and four C. endivia genotypes. The LMPA bead technique was more efficient than culture in liquid or solid medium and allowed us to obtain plating efficiencies up to 4. 9 % in C. intybus genotypes and efficiencies of up to 0. 7 % in C. endivia genotypes. Moreover, the LMPA bead technique offers great advantages over liquid and solid culture systems: the media can be readily refreshed, protoplasts can be monitored separately, and microcalli can easily be removed from the beads. This increased efficiency was observed for all of the 11 Cichorium genotypes tested. Shoot formation was induced more efficiently when using 0. 5 mg l- 1 indole- 3 -acetic acid-enriched medium (up to 87. 5 % of the protoplast-derived calli started shoot development) compared to 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid-enriched medium.

Heterokaryons (hets) of the asexual, {{pathogenic}} yeast Candida albicans obtained by fusing protoplasts of complementing auxotrophic strains generate large numbers of parental-type auxotrophic monokaryons by random assortment of single nuclei into blastospores, and smaller numbers of monokaryons bearing hybrid nuclei formed through either karyogamy or the transfer of genetic material from one het nucleus to another. Het populations grown at 30 degrees C or 37 degrees C contain high frequencies (approx. 5 %- 10 %) of two kinds of stable variants peculiar specifically for segregation of parental-type monokaryons: NS variants produce inviable auxotrophic monokaryons of one or both parental classes while AT variants yield parental-type monokaryons which grow very slowly. Variant frequencies are not affected by the wild-type strain background of hets, or the auxotrophies used to force heterokaryosis. However, both kinds of variants are induced by growth at 25 degrees C or by treatments with certain chemical or physical metabolic inhibitors. Evidence is presented that variant nuclei of independent origins carry different nutritionally irreparable recessive lethal (NS) or debilitating (AT) defects acquired {{in the course of}} actual or potential internuclear transfers of genetic material within het cells.

Compared to chemical production, microbial production of sugar alcohols has become attractive because of its environmentally friendly and sustainable characteristics. Our previous study identified the nonconventional yeast Pichia anomala TIB-x 229 as a potential producer of sugar alcohols from glucose. To further improve strain performance, we combined genome shuffling with optimized high throughput screening methods for the directed improvement of nonconventional yeast and complex phenotypes. Results: To accelerate strain improvement, a practical genome shuffling procedure was developed and success-fully applied in the nonconventional yeast P. anomala to increase sugar alcohol production. Through two rounds of genome shuffling, an improved P. anomala isolate GS 2 - 3 could produce 47. 1 g/L total sugar alcohols from 100 g/L glucose, which was 32. 3 % higher than the original strain. In this process, a simple and accurate colorimetric assay was optimized and used for high throughput screening of sugar alcohol-producing strains. Moreover, a fluorescence-activated cell sorting method was developed to efficiently screen <b>protoplast</b> <b>fusions</b> for genome shuffling of noncon-ventional yeast. Conclusion: An efficient genome shuffling procedure was developed and applied to enhance the sugar alcohol production of the nonconventional yeast P. anomala.

The search for alternative CTV-resistant rootstocks that also withstand the other constraints is now considered an urgent priority for a sustainable citrus industry in the area. Complementary progenitors can be found in citrus germplasm to combine the desired traits, particularly between Poncirus and Citrus genera. The production of somatic hybrids allows cumulating all dominant traits irrespective of their heterozygosity level, and would appear to be an effective way to solve the rootstock challenge facing the Mediterranean citrus industry. This paper presents the results obtained during a regional collaborative effort between five countries, to develop new rootstocks by somatic hybridization.

She produced the first functional copies of HIV, allowing her and other scientists to access biologically active material for future research of the virus’s genes. She determined the roles {{of several of the}} genes in HIV. These findings have been significant in studying and understanding different characteristics of HIV and Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Whilst at the NIH, Fisher developed approaches that allowed the successful introduction of exogenous DNA onto human blood cells. Two methods, <b>protoplast</b> <b>fusion</b> and electroporation, proved successful and allowed Fisher to test whether molecular clones isolated from HIV-infected cultures could generate infectious retrovirus upon transfection. Fisher showed in 1985 that molecular clones of HIV, contained within approximately 18kb of contiguous proviral DNA, were biologically active and generated cytopathic virus when introduced into primary human T-cells. This discovery was important s it established that products of the viral genome itself, rather than a cofactor or contaminant, were capable of killing human T cells and were therefore potentially capable of mediating the immunosuppressive effect of HIV. it also provided the basis for dissecting the molecular function of each of the viral genes and for developing DNA-based diagnostic tests for HIV infection. In the following 4 years, Fisher showed that the transactivator gene tat was essential for virus replication, that truncation of the 3' open reading frame disrupts virus cytopathogenicity, and that sor (now called vif) is required for efficient cell to cell transmission of HIV virus. With clinical collaborators from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Redfield and Looney), Fisher showed that patient antisera displayed type-specific neutralising properties and that multiple HIV isolates derived from a single patient were biologically diverse and contained replication-competent as well as replication-incompetent cytopathic variants. These studies performed more than 20 years ago, gave some of the first hints that a successful HIV vaccine might prove difficult to engineer.|$|E
