40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the production of}} <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> (PKM) coupled with the concern for continued availability of conventional feedstuffs {{in some parts of the}} world has led to research to establish the maximum inclusion level of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> in broiler diets. The results suggested that <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> has no anti-nutritional properties and thus its inclusion is safe up to at least 40 % in the diet, provided the diet is balanced in amino acids and metabolisable energy. Although feed digestibility is decreased due to high dietary fibre when PKM is included in the diet, the feed intake is increased. This makes total digestible nutrient intake relatively high, β-mannan is the main component of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> non-starch polysaccharide (NSP). Both mannose and manno-oligosaccharides have been reported to act as prebiotics. The inclusion of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> in the diet improves the immune system of birds and reduces pathogenic bacteria and increases the population of non-pathogenic bacteria in the intestine. These two benefits should be considered as strong recommendations for using <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> in broiler diets, particularly in <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> producing countries, not only for increasing bird productivity but also to improve chicken health.

Half-carcasses were then sliced between the 12 th and 13 th ribs to collect the loin (longissimus dorsi), which was used to determine the sensorial characteristics and fatty acid profile of the meat.

40|$|A <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> {{processing}} (Cracking and Separating) {{unit was}} developed to crack effectively various sizes/diameters of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> {{as well as to}} separate the <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> from the shell with the aim of reducing the challenges encountered during the production of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> Oil. This machine was fabricated and designed with locally available materials for the ease of maintenance and it was designed the the aims of easing the pain, stress involved, intensive labour, time consuming, unduly cost and cumbersome operation encountered in the traditional/existing process of manually cracking and separating <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> from the nut. After the fabrication of this machine, the machine was tested to ascertain its performance and efficiency. The efficiency of the machine was discovered to be 98 % with a processing rate of 95 nuts per second. This is an improvement over existing ordinary <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> machine that has an efficiency of 90 % with a processing rate of 87 nuts per second wiithout separation. A 5 hp Prime mover was selcted based on the power that was needed to effectively operate the machine. This project has catered for the various challenges encountered in the manual process of shelling <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> and separating the kernel from the shell...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} {{of energy and}} digestibility values of new added-value products is important for feed formulation. True amino acid digestibility and metabolizable energy of feedstuffs were evaluated in adult meat type crossbred chickens. Sulfur amino acids (cysteine and methionine) and lysine were limiting amino acids in <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> (solvent extract; PKM) and fermented <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> (FPKM) with Aspergillus wentii TISTR 3075. The FPKM with Aspergillus wentii TISTR 3075 {{lead to an increase}} in true amino acids digestibility except for arginine. The apparent metabolizable energy (AME; DM basis) of corn, PKM and FPKM were 3, 628. 88, 2, 201. 83 and 2, 080. 26 kcal/kg, respectively. The true metabolizable energy (TME) of PKM (DM basis: 2, 958. 21 kcal/kg) was slightly higher than FPKM (DM basis: 2, 843. 01 kcal/kg) while the nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AME n), nitrogen-corrected true metabolizable energy (TME n) of PKM (DM basis: 2, 411. 84 and 2, 603. 33 kcal/kg, respectively) were significantly higher than FPKM (DM basis: 2, 153. 11 and 2, 333. 07 kcal/kg, P = 0. 03 and P = 0. 02 respectively). Aspergillus wentii may use up nitrogen-free extract (NFE) in PKM as an energy source during the fermenting process, resulting in a lower metabolizable energy of FPKM when compared to PKM (without fermentation) ...|$|E

In this paper, the {{combustion}} characteristics of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>meal</b> were investigated in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB 100) (height= 3000 mm, inner diameter= 100 mm). The {{results showed that}} the temperature and pressure of the furnace were relatively steady. The contents of SiO 2, Na 2 O and K 2 O of the bed material ranged smoothly with the process, the particle size of the bed material fluctuated slightly. The alkali metal contents of bed material were ranged from 1. 5 % to 3. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: One {{hundred and}} twenty Anak Cockerels were used in a 56 -day trial to {{determine}} the substitutional value of <b>Palm</b> <b>Kernel</b> <b>meal</b> (PKM) for Soyabean meal in the diet of growing cockerels. The five week-old cockerels were randomly allotted to five dietary treatment groups in which the dietary soyabean meal had been substituted with PKM at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %. The diets were respectively designated as diets 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The results showed that mean daily body weight gain and feed-to-gain ratio for all the treatments were significantly (P< 0. 05) influenced. Birds fed diet 2 had the highest weight gain (1229. 17 g) followed by birds fed diet 1 (control) while birds fed diets 3, 4 and 5 respectively had their weights depressed. Birds fed diet 2 gave the best feed-to-gain ratio (3. 88). The feed cost per kilogramme diet significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased with the increasing PKM replacement of soyabean meal. Diet 2 gave the least cost per kg weight gain (N 159. 90) and the highest accruable revenue (N 614. 58). From {{the results of this}} study, it would appear that substituting 25 % of soyabean meal with PKM in growing cockerel diets would not only be economically advantageous but enhanced performance.

40|$|Abstract—Waste {{lubricating}} oil re-refining adsorption process by different adsorbent materials was investigated. Adsorbent {{materials such as}} oil adsorbent, egg shale powder, date <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> powder, and acid activated date <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> powder were used. The adsorption process over fixed amount of adsorbent at ambient conditions was investigated. The adsorption/extraction process was able to deposit the asphaltenic and metallic contaminants from the waste oil to lower values. It {{was found that the}} date <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> powder with contact time of 4 h was able to give the best conditions for treating the waste oil. The recovered solvent could be also reused. It was also found that the activated bentonite gave the best physical properties followed by the date <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> powder.
