A drainage system is installed below the gravel to carry excess water away from the field.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Texture is {{a surface}} {{characteristic}} {{which has a}} very wide influence on pavements functional quality. It is currently assessed {{by a number of}} test methods. Road Administrations face the problems of dealing with data acquired by different methods and, in addition to that, the repeatability and reproducibility of the results. This paper presents an analysis of test methods used for texture depth evaluation in Portugal: the volumetric patch method and two methods based on surface profiles. Hence, three roads with low (dense asphalt), medium (“open texture asphalt”) and high (porous asphalt) texture depths were selected, where five profilometers made five runs. Two subsections of 150 m length were also selected to carry out the volumetric patch test. The texture indicators analysed were: the mean texture depth, the mean <b>profile</b> <b>depth</b> and the sensor measured texture depth. The average and the standard deviation were the statistical parameters used for the analysis. The results obtained for each method are significantly different and a good correlation between the mean <b>profile</b> <b>depth</b> and the sensor measured texture depth was established...|$|E

A high-speed texture laser and a 3 -D scanning laser system based on auto-synchronized scanning technology are developed in this project. A mean <b>profile</b> <b>depth</b> algorithm based on ASTM standard has been developed and embedded into both point laser and scanning laser devices.

A criterion of automatically identifying a pavement section for flushing, shelling or normal surface conditions is also developed using the field data from both devices.

40|$|In the {{semiarid}} central {{region of}} Argentina {{the probability that}} rainfall meets crop requirements during growing season is less than 10 %, therefore fallowing {{has been the most}} important practice to assure water availability during the growing season. Various site-specific and management factors have been identified as crucial for defining fallow efficiency (FE) and final available water contents (AW). The objective {{of the present study was}} to improve our knowledge about the interactions between residue cover, weed control, soil <b>profile</b> <b>depth</b> and water storage capacity (WSC) on FE. In 10 sites covering the environments of calcareous plains and sandy plains of the semiarid central region of Argentina and with different WSC, experiments with 3 different levels of residue cover (H, M, L) and with and without weed control (C and W respectively) during fallow were set up. A completely randomized block design with four repetitions and splits plots to consider weed control was used. Soil texture and organic matter were determined in samples of the A horizon (0. 20 m). Bulk density, field capacity, permanent wilting point and soil water contents (monthly frequency) were measured at depth intervals of 0. 20 m to the depth of the calcite layer or to 2. 00 m depth. Soil temperature was taken in weekly intervals at 0. 05 m depth and weed plants, separated by species, were counted at the end of fallow in 4 repetitions of 0. 25 m 2 in each treatment. An empirical model was developed to predict final AW under these experimental conditions. Model parameters were: Residue level, weed control, WSC, <b>profile</b> <b>depth,</b> and rainfall during fallow. Site-specific conditions (WSC and <b>profile</b> <b>depth)</b> affected water storage during fallow; soils with highest values for both parameters showed highest final AW. Weed density was the most important factor that controlled AW, with on average 35 mm less AW in W than in C treatments. Residue level had a positive effect on final AW in both C and W treatments, with a difference of 18. 5 mm between H and L. An interaction between residue level and weed density was observed, indicating weed suppression in H treatments. This was also confirmed by correspondence analysis between residue level and weed species which revealed that different species were related to each level. High residue levels also decreased soil temperature, thus affecting germination of post-fallow crops. The empirical model had an overall average prediction error of 13. 7 % and the regression between measured and predicted values showed a determination coefficient of 0. 77. ...|$|E
