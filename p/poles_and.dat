5|$|On Mars, {{observations}} of the Phoenix Mars lander reveal that water-based snow crystals occur at high latitudes. Additionally, carbon dioxide precipitates from clouds during the Martian winters at the <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> contributes to a seasonal deposit of that compound, which is the principal component of that planet's ice caps.|$|E
40|$|Research on size {{structure}} of skipjack captured by <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line fishermen {{inside and outside}} of fish aggregation device area has been done from January until June 2016 in Gulf of Bone waters. The objectives of research were to analysis of size structure percentage of suitable length to catch and yield composition of <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line with FAD and without FAD. Size structure was analyzed by method of Bhattacharya percentage of suitable length to catch by method of Mallawa and catch composition by column diagram. The result showed that the size structure was different between skipjacks captured by <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line with FAD and without FAD where skipjack captured by <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line with FAD dominated by small fishes while skipjack captured by <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line without FAD dominated by large fishes percentage of suitable length to catch of skipjack captured by <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line without FAD was high than <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line with FAD while both were still low yields of <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line with FAD <b>and</b> <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line without FAD consist of skipjacks and yellow fin tuna where skipjack was dominant for all trip...|$|R

5|$|The Russian–Saxon–Polish allies {{assembled}} their armies in Lithuania for a joint {{offensive against}} the Swedes. Their troops consisted of four contingents; the main Russian army of 50,000 men under Georg Benedict Ogilvy near Polotsk, another 8,000 Russians and 10,000 Lithuanians loyal to Augustus close to Vilnius, about 6,000 <b>Poles</b> <b>and</b> 3,500 Saxons under Otto Arnold von Paykull at Brest-Litovsk and 20,000 Cossacks under Ivan Mazepa in Volhynia. In Saxony close to 20,000 men were recruited {{for the main}} Saxon army under Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg. In all, the allied forces enjoyed a massive advantage as their forces counted almost 120,000 men against the 35,000 Swedes and 10,000 <b>Poles</b> <b>and</b> Lithuanians in Poland under Charles and the 6,000 men in Courland under Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt.|$|E

25|$|The tuna {{are caught}} by the {{following}} methods: <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line, handline <b>and</b> longline. The <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line method is most commonly used, and results in 90 percent (2002) of the total fish catch. This traditional use of the <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> line method in the Maldivian tuna industry {{has contributed to the}} sustainability of the tuna resources. With recent further improvements in fishing gear and methods, it appears that the catch levels may be close to the maximum sustainable yield.|$|R

5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power <b>poles,</b> <b>and</b> increasing the power supply. This was done to enable the utility to restore power more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic <b>poles,</b> <b>and</b> the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
5|$|As Julio made landfall, it {{produced}} lightning and locally heavy rainfall, which left {{more than a}} dozen communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people. Winds were generally light, although strong enough to damage a few electrical <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> small buildings. In nearby Sinaloa, rainfall from the storm led to an emergency evacuation of 500 residents.|$|E

5|$|So {{immigrants}} who had newly acquired land were not enfranchised as were not {{most of the}} rural ethnically Polish farmers, who still held land by way of lease or feudal fief only like serfs or vassals of their landlords, unlike Prussia proper where serfdom had been abolished in 1807 and 1810. Immigrant farmers from the Holy Roman Empire (such as the Bambrzy) or later from member states of the German Confederation, had usually remained free peasants, causing their stronger representation within the eight members elected by peasants, {{of a total of}} 48. With regard to ethnicity, most of the nobility representatives were Polish, peasantry representatives were balanced, and the townsfolk representatives were mostly German. The first sejm included 22 <b>Poles</b> <b>and</b> 26 Germans, and most of the subsequent elections produced an almost even split between the <b>Poles</b> <b>and</b> the Germans. A major issue of the Sejm was the abolition of serfdom, which would enlarge the number of Polish speaking landowners and after ten years allow their participation in Sejm elections.|$|E
