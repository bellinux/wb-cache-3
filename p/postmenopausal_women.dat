5|$|It {{is thought}} that boron plays several {{essential}} roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women</b> first made boron deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.|$|E
5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like serous {{cell carcinoma}}, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it {{is characterized by the}} features common to all clear cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H stained and visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
5|$|Serous {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women</b> with atrophied endometrium and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as omental caking) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, papillary structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} surgical {{removal of}} a feminizing adrenal tumour in a <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>woman</b> is described. Most of these tumours are malignant and the pathological findings and the biological behaviour of the tumour frequently do not correlate, so that a careful follow-up is necessary. In the presence of vaginal bleeding in a <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>woman</b> endometrial carcinoma should be considered. If this has been ruled out and if oestrogens are elevated with low plasma gonadotrophins, a feminizing ovarian or adrenal tumour should be considered...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a calcified {{parasitic}} leiomyoma in a 51 -year-old <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>woman</b> with lower abdominal discomfort. She had no history of surgery. Workup confirmed a calcified leiomyoma. On laparoscopy, the mass was separate from the uterus and adhered to the bowel and bladder. Histopathological examination confirmed a calcified leiomyoma. A calcified parasitic leiomyoma in a <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>woman</b> is rare. Most prior cases were in persons with a history of a laparoscopic myomectomy. The diagnosis can be made by radiological findings. Laparoscopic excision is the treatment of choice in such cases...|$|R
40|$|Endometriosis is {{a benign}} disease {{defined as the}} extra-uterine {{implantation}} and proliferation of tissue similar to endometrium (glands and stroma), causing a chronic inflammatory response and adhesions that distort anatomy. The extra-gonadal involvement is rare, but reports of intestinal endometriosis have increased substantially, mainly affecting the sigmoid colon and rectum; isolated involvement of the cecum is rare, even more so in a <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>woman</b> without use of hormone replacement therapy.

25|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy consisting of systemic treatment with estrogen {{alone or in}} combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women.</b> These benefits include increased skin collagen content, skin thickness and elasticity, and skin hydration and surface lipids. Topical estrogen {{has been found to}} have similar beneficial effects on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and firmness and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women.</b> Skin hydration and surface lipids, on the other hand, did not significantly change with topical progesterone. These findings suggest that progesterone, like estrogen, also has beneficial effects on the skin, and may be independently protective against skin aging.|$|E
