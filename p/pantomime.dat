5|$|Barrowman {{starred in}} <b>pantomime</b> {{productions}} of Cinderella at the New Wimbledon Theatre (Christmas, 2005–06) and in Jack and the Beanstalk at Cardiff's New Theatre (Christmas, 2006–07). He played {{the title role}} in Aladdin at the Birmingham Hippodrome over Christmas 2007–8 and as a guest act for the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium in 2008. Barrowman played {{the lead in the}} Robin Hood <b>pantomime</b> at the Birmingham Hippodrome for the 2008–09 season. He presented Andrew Lloyd Webber's 60th birthday party in London's Hyde Park on 14 September 2008. Exactly one year later, Barrowman succeeded Roger Allam as Zaza/Albin in the West End revival of La Cage aux Folles, at the Playhouse Theatre.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{well-established}} that when <b>pantomiming</b> objects, preschool aged children use BPO <b>pantomimes</b> instead of IO <b>pantomimes.</b> Conceptually, {{this is similar}} to children using replica objects (i.e. concretely similar objects) in pretend play before they progress to using substitute objects (i.e. abstractly representative objects).|$|R
50|$|Jarvis has {{appeared}} in <b>pantomimes</b> professionally every year since 1995, and prior to that had performed in several as an amateur. Since 2001, he has written and directed many of these <b>pantomimes</b> as well.|$|R
5|$|Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences {{a further}} four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the {{intention}} of showcasing the comedian's <b>pantomime</b> talents: One Arabian Night was a reworking of Aladdin and co-starred Lionelle Howard and Edward O'Neill, while Harlequinade visited the roots of <b>pantomime.</b> One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was Sancho Panza in Maurice Elvey's 1923 film Don Quixote, for which he received a fee of £700 a week. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair with one of his leading ladies {{and walked out of the}} family home.|$|E
5|$|Formby {{appeared}} {{on stage in}} numerous variety and music hall performances, although no full record exists. He appeared in variety shows and concerts for troops with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) during the Second World War, {{as well as in}} regular winter <b>pantomime</b> in the 1950s, Babes in the Wood at the Liverpool Empire Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Tucker was in Richmond {{to attend}} a benefit performance, and put his life in danger during the infamous Richmond Theatre fire. The event, {{including}} a play entitled The Father, or Family Feuds and a <b>pantomime</b> afterwards named Raymond and Agnes, was held in December. It being Christmas time, the auditorium was packed—with 518 adults and 80 children.|$|E
50|$|McGranger was a {{participant}} in the fourteenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She regularly appears in British <b>pantomimes</b> during the Christmas season, and has starred in <b>pantomimes</b> in Brighton, Torquay, York and Ashton-under-Lyne and Southport.|$|R
40|$|When {{performing}} reach-to-grasp movement, {{the fingers}} open {{wider than the}} size of the target object and then stop opening. The recorded peak grip aperture (PGA) is significantly larger when performing this action without vision during the movement than with vision, presumably due to an error margin that is retained in order to avoid a collision with the object. People can also pretend such prehension action based on an internal target representation (i. e., <b>pantomimed</b> prehension), and previous studies showed that the kinematic differences exist between natural and <b>pantomimed</b> prehension. These differences are regarded as a reflection of the respective information processing in the brain, namely, the dorsal and ventral streams. <b>Pantomimed</b> movements are thought to be mediated by the ventral stream. This implies that visual information during the movement, which is essential for the dorsal stream, has little effect on the kinematic properties of <b>pantomimed</b> prehension. We investigated whether the environment’s view affects <b>pantomimed</b> grasping; namely, whether the dorsal stream is involved in the execution of the <b>pantomimed</b> action. Participants initially gazed at a target object and then were subjected to a 3 -second visual occlusion, during which time the experimenter removed the object. The participants were then required to pretend reach-to-grasp movements toward the location where the object had been presented. Two visual conditions (full vision and no vision) were imposed during the <b>pantomimed</b> prehension by manipulating shutter goggles. The PGA showed {{significant differences between the two}} visual conditions, whereas no significant difference was noted for terminal grip aperture, which was recorded at the movement end. This suggests an involvement of the dorsal stream in <b>pantomimed</b> action and implies that <b>pantomimed</b> prehension is a good probe for revealing the mechanism of interaction between the ventral and dorsal streams, which is also linked to embodied cognition...|$|R
40|$|Comparison between {{real and}} <b>pantomimed</b> actions {{is used in}} {{neuroscience}} to dissociate stimulus-driven (real) as compared to internally driven (<b>pantomimed)</b> visuomotor transformations, {{with the goal of}} testing models of vision (Milner & Goodale, 1995) and diagnosing neuropsychological deficits (apraxia syndrome). Real actions refer to an overt movement directed toward a visible target whereas <b>pantomimed</b> actions refer to an overt movement directed either toward an object that is no longer available. Although similar, real and <b>pantomimed</b> actions differ in their kinematic parameters and in their neural substrates. Pantomimed-reach-to-grasp-actions show reduced reaching velocities, higher wrist movements, and reduced grip apertures. In addition, seminal neuropsychological studies and recent neuroimaging findings confirmed that real and <b>pantomimed</b> actions are underpinned by separate brain networks. Although previous literature suggests differences in the praxis system between males and females, no research to date has investigated whether or not gender differences exist in the context of real versus <b>pantomimed</b> reach-to-grasp actions. We asked ten male and ten female participants to perform real and <b>pantomimed</b> reach-to-grasp actions toward objects of different sizes, either with or without visual feedback. During <b>pantomimed</b> actions participants were required to pick up an imaginary object slightly offset relative to the location of the real one (which was in turn the target of the real reach-to-grasp actions). Results demonstrate {{a significant difference between the}} kinematic parameters recorded in male and female participants performing <b>pantomimed,</b> but not real reach-to-grasp tasks, depending on the availability of visual feedback. With no feedback both males and females showed smaller grip aperture, slower movement velocity and lower reach height. Crucially, these same differences were abolished when visual feedback was available in male, but not in female participants. Our results suggest that male and female participants should be evaluated separately in the clinical environment and in future research in the field...|$|R
5|$|Peking-opera {{performers}} use {{four main}} skills. The first two are song and speech. The third is dance-acting. This includes pure dance, <b>pantomime,</b> {{and all other}} types of dance.

25|$|Many {{researchers}} have advanced {{the idea that}} the regressive use of BPO <b>pantomimes</b> reflects the presence of a central symbolic deficit in aphasic patients. It is suggested this is due to BPO <b>pantomimes</b> offering a more concrete representation of an object and permits a more vivid experience of affective component of the pretended action. However, others interpret BPO <b>pantomiming</b> in aphasics as being indicative of apraxic motor disturbance, due to the high-comorbidity between Aphasia and Apraxia.|$|R
50|$|Body part as {{an object}} (BPO) <b>pantomimes</b> occur when an {{individual}} substitutes {{a part of their}} body - usually arms, fingers, or hands - to be part of an object they are miming. <b>Pantomimes</b> are representational gestures, meaning they are used to convey a message to others without the use of speech. A commonly used example of BPO <b>pantomiming</b> is demonstrated by an individual using their finger to represent a toothbrush while acting out brushing their teeth.|$|R
5|$|The town {{is home to}} the Herne Bay Little Theatre, a playmakers drama {{society and}} member of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain who have a 72-seat theatre in Bullers Avenue. In 2007, the theatre won a large grant from the Big Lottery Fund to {{renovate}} and extend their building and provide improved disabled access. The theatre also has an active youth theatre and between them, they put on at least eight productions every year including a <b>pantomime.</b> Theatrecraft, a local theatre group, produce three shows a year including an annual <b>pantomime</b> at the King's Hall theatre. Other groups and touring companies often put productions on at the open-air 'Theatre in the Park' on the grounds of Strode Park House in Herne.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1790s, Grimaldi {{starred in}} a <b>pantomime</b> version of Robinson Crusoe, which {{confirmed}} his credentials as a key <b>pantomime</b> performer. Many productions followed, but his career at Drury Lane was becoming turbulent, and he left the theatre in 1806. In his new association with the Covent Garden theatre, he appeared at {{the end of the}} same year in Thomas John Dibdin's Harlequin and Mother Goose; or, The Golden Egg, which included perhaps his best known portrayal of Clown. Grimaldi's residencies at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells ran simultaneously, and he became known as London's leading Clown and comic entertainer, enjoying many successes at both theatres. His popularity in London led to a demand for him to appear in provincial theatres throughout England, where he commanded large fees.|$|E

5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are <b>pantomime.</b> In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
5|$|ASL signs have {{a number}} of phonemic components, {{including}} movement of the face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of <b>pantomime,</b> but iconicity does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1894, Robey {{travelled}} to Manchester {{to participate in the}} <b>pantomime</b> Jack and Jill, where he was paid £25 a week for a three-month contract. He did not appear in Jack and Jill until the third act but pleased the holiday crowds nonetheless. During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him to improvise for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly what he had eaten. The routine was such a hit that it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.|$|E
5|$|Born in London to an {{entertainer}} father, Grimaldi began to perform as a child, making his stage debut at Drury Lane in 1780. He became successful at the Sadler's Wells Theatre the following year; {{his first major}} role was as Little Clown in the <b>pantomime</b> The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin's Wedding in 1781, in which he starred alongside his father. After a brief schooling, he appeared in various low-budget productions and became a sought-after child performer.
