5|$|The Tawau Hills National Park {{established}} as a natural water catchment area. The park contains rugged volcanic landscapes including a hot spring and spectacular waterfalls. Bordering the Philippine Turtle Islands is the Turtle Islands National Park, it consists of three islands of Selingaan, Bakkungan Kechil and Gulisaan which is notable as the nesting place for green turtle and hawksbill sea turtle. Other important wildlife regions in Sabah include the Maliau Basin, Danum Valley, Tabin, Imbak Canyon and Sepilok. These places are either designated as national parks, wildlife reserves, virgin jungle reserves, or <b>protection</b> <b>forest</b> reserve. Beyond the coasts of Sabah lie a number of islands rich with coral reefs such as Ligitan, Sipadan, Selingaan, Tiga and Layang-Layang (Swallow Reef). Other main islands including the Jambongan, Timbun Mata, Bum Bum and the divided Sebatik. The Sabah state government has enacted several laws to protect its forests and endangered wildlife species under the Animals Ordinance 1962, Forest Enactment 1968 and the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 among others. Under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment, any persons hunting inside conservation lands are liable for imprisonment {{for five years and}} fined with RM50,000. The state government also plans to implement seasonal huntings as part of its conservation efforts to prevent the continuous lose of its endangered wildlife species while maintaining the state indigenous hunting traditions.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{silvicultural}} system now called coppicing was practiced solely for small wood production. In German {{this is called}} Niederwald, which translates as low forest. Later on in Mediaeval times farmers encouraged pigs to feed from acorns and so some trees were allowed to grow bigger. This different {{silvicultural system}} is called in English coppice with standards. In German this is called Mittelwald (middle forest). As modern forestry (Hochwald in German, which translates as High forest) seeks to harvest timber mechanically, and pigs are generally no longer fed from acorns, both systems have declined. However, there are cultural and wildlife benefits from these 2 silvicultural systems so both can be found where timber production or some other main forestry purpose (such as a <b>protection</b> <b>forest</b> against an avalanche) is not the sole management objective of the woodland.|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) {{is an ideal}} measure {{to cope with the}} eco-environmental problems of the water-level fluctuation zone (WLFZ). Thus, the information for screening winter-flood-tolerant woody plant species is useful for the recovery and re-{{establishment of}} the riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in the TGR WLFZ. Therefore, we discussed the possibilities of constructing and popularizing riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in the TGR WLFZ from several aspects, including the woody plant species distribution in the WLFZ, the survival rate analyses of suitable candidate woody species under controlled flooding conditions, the survival rate investigation of some woody plant species planted in the TGR WLFZ, and the physiological responses of some woody plant species during the recovery stage after winter floods. The results of woody species investigation showed that most woody plant species that existed as annual seedlings in the TGR WLFZ are not suitable candidates for the riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests.</b> However, arbor species (e. g., Salix matsudana, Populus 6 canadensis, Morus alba, Pterocarya stenoptera, Taxodium ascendens, and Metasequoia glyptostroboides) and shrub species (e. g., Salix variegata, Distylium chinensis, Lycium chinense, Myricaria laxiflora, and Rosa multiflora) might be considered suitable candidates for the riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in the TGR WLFZ by survival rate analyses under controlled winter flooding conditions, and survival rate investigations of woody plant species planted in the TGR WLFZ, respectively.

40|$|According to {{the problem}} of seriously {{degraded}} natural forest in Southwest China prior to the implementation of Natural <b>Forest</b> <b>Protection</b> Project, under the guidance of principle of practicality and systematicness, we establish the comprehensive-benefit evaluation index system of restoring the degraded natural forest in Southwest China, including 3 second-level indices, 12 third-level indices and 24 fourth-level indices. In addition, we use the method of Analytic Hierarchy Process to conduct comprehensive-benefit evaluation on implementation of Natural <b>Forest</b> <b>Protection</b> Project in Southwest China. The results show that since ten years of implementation of Natural <b>Forest</b> <b>Protection</b> Project in Southwest China, it has gained considerable comprehensive benefit. The comprehensive evaluation index of Natural <b>Forest</b> <b>Protection</b> Project in Southwest China is 83. 08; the ecological benefit index of Natural <b>Forest</b> <b>Protection</b> Project in Southwest China is 56. 75; the economic benefit index of Natural <b>Forest</b> <b>Protection</b> Project in Southwest China is 19. 05; the social benefit index of Natural <b>Forest</b> <b>Protection</b> Project in Southwest China is 7. 28.
