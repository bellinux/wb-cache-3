40|$|Abstract Background The first {{objective}} of a DNA microarray experiment is typically {{to generate a}} list of genes or probes that {{are found to be}} differentially expressed or represented (in the case of comparative genomic hybridizations and/or copy number variation) between two conditions or strains. Rank <b>Products</b> <b>analysis</b> comprises a robust algorithm for deriving such lists from microarray experiments that comprise small numbers of replicates, for example, less than the number required for the commonly used t-test. Currently, users wishing to apply Rank <b>Products</b> <b>analysis</b> to their own microarray data sets have been restricted to the use of command line-based software which can limit its usage within the biological community. Findings Here we have developed a web interface to existing Rank <b>Products</b> <b>analysis</b> tools allowing users to quickly process their data in an intuitive and step-wise manner to obtain the respective Rank Product or Rank Sum, probability of false prediction and p -values in a downloadable file.

Because of this unique design methodology, the condominium units are still considered well designed, even decades after their construction.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s <b>product</b> <b>analysis</b> via SYBR Green, other double-strand {{specific}} dyes, or probe-based melting curve analysis has become nearly ubiquitous. The probe-based technique is sensitive enough to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and can distinguish between homozygous wildtype, heterozygous and homozygous mutant alleles {{by virtue of}} the dissociation patterns produced. Without probes, amplicon melting (melting and analysis of the entire PCR product) was not generally successful at finding single base variants through melting profiles. With higher resolution instruments and advanced dyes, amplicon melting analysis of one base variants is now possible with several commercially available instruments. For example: Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast System and the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System, Idaho Technology's LightScanner (the first plate-based high resolution melting device), Qiagen's Rotor-Gene instruments, and Roche's LightCycler 480 instruments.|$|E

This species is named after Carol Creutz, who prepared the ion during her PhD studies with Henry Taube. The bridging ligand is the heterocycle pyrazine, 1,4-C4H4N2. In the Creutz-Taube Ion, the average oxidation state of Ru is 2.5+. Spectroscopic studies, however, show that the two Ru centers are equivalent, which indicates the ease with which the electron hole communicates between the two metals. [...] The significance of the Creutz-Taube ion is its simplicity, which facilitates theoretical analysis, and its high symmetry, which ensures a high degree of delocalization. Many more complex mixed valence species are known both as molecules and polymeric materials.|$|E

50|$|Even though RT-PCR is {{technically}} {{more difficult to}} perform and more expensive than ELISA, it {{has the ability to}} allow for the detection of low viral loads. RT-PCR is considered to be 102 to 105 fold more sensitive than traditional ELISA. RT-PCR also allows for the detection of several viral targets in the same reaction through the use of several primer combinations. This is called multiplexing. Although multiplexing {{is technically}} more demanding than a traditional simplex reaction it allows for a higher throughput in that a single sample can be tested for several viral strains in a single reaction. Primers used for multiplexing are chosen in such a manner that they result in amplicons of various sizes. This allows for post RT-PCR analysis using gel electrophoresis. Although RT-PCR saves time, allows for multiplexing and is more sensitive than ELISA, the reagents and instrumentation needed are expensive and require a higher level of technical expertise. Also, end <b>product</b> <b>analysis</b> using gel electrophoresis is laborious, relatively more expensive, time consuming and does not lend itself to automation. For these reasons the use of RT-PCR for routine screening is not feasible and has not replaced ELISA. It does, however, provide the industry with the opportunity to screen borderline cases, {{especially in the case of}} seed potato certification.|$|E
40|$|Outer <b>product</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{a method}} that permits the {{combination}} of two spectral domains {{with the aim of}} emphasizing co-evolutions of spectral regions. This data fusion technique consists in the product of all combinations of the variables that define each spectral domain.

The present work presents an alternative way to perform outer <b>product</b> <b>analysis</b> in the PCA context without incurring into high demands on computational resources. This works shows that by decomposing each spectral domain with PCA and performing the outer product on the recovered scores, one can obtain the same results as if one calculated the outer product in the original variable space, but using much less computational resources. The results show that this approach will make possible to apply outer <b>product</b> <b>analysis</b> to very wide domains...|$|E
