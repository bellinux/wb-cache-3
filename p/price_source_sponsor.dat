Therefore, scientific planning, management, and judicious use of fish and fisheries’ resources seem to be important tasks for the present-day fishery biologist.

Especially, study at the genome level in various fish models as a function of climate change may give clues for the better management.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that rational, periodically collapsing speculative bubbles may be pervasive in stock markets globally, {{but there is}} no research that considers them at the individual stock level. In this study we develop and test an empirical asset pricing model that allows for speculative bubbles to affect stock returns. We show that stocks incorporating larger bubbles yield higher returns. The bubble deviation, at the stock level as opposed to the industry or market level, is a <b>priced</b> <b>source</b> of risk that is separate from the standard market risk, size and value factors. We demonstrate that much of the common variation in stock returns that can be attributable to market risk is due to the co-movement of bubbles rather than being driven by fundamentals...|$|R
