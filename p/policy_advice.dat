40|$|Abstract. Financial {{innovation}} and financial risk often emerge {{at the same}} time. On one hand, financial innovation can transfer and disperse part of financial risks. On the other hand, financial innovation can also produce new risk factors. If the financial institutes {{want to put up}} any carbon financial innovation in the low-carbon economy time, they must improve their risk consciousness, keep away and control financial risk. This paper discusses the potential financial risks in carbon financial innovation, and brings forward relevant <b>policy</b> <b>advices...</b>|$|R

25|$|According to the IMF itself, {{it works}} to foster global growth and {{economic}} stability by providing <b>policy,</b> <b>advice</b> and financing the members, {{by working with}} developing nations to help them achieve macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty. The rationale {{for this is that}} private international capital markets function imperfectly and many countries have limited access to financial markets. Such market imperfections, together with balance-of-payments financing, provide the justification for official financing, without which many countries could only correct large external payment imbalances through measures with adverse economic consequences. The IMF provides alternate sources of financing.|$|E

It seemed as if because of this appointment, Yudhoyono could be considered one of Wahid's men, however Yudhoyono would break ranks from Wahid in July 2001 when the latter was facing impeachment. In desperation, Wahid issued a decree freezing the People's Representative Council (DPR) and then asked Yudhoyono to declare {{a state of emergency}} to further strengthen his position. Yudhoyono refused to accept this, and Wahid dismissed him.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, FAO {{launched}} its Initiative on Soaring Food Prices to help small producers raise their output and earn more. Under the initiative, FAO {{contributed to the}} work of the UN High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis, which produced the Comprehensive Framework for Action. FAO has carried out projects in over 25 countries and inter-agency missions in nearly 60, scaled up its monitoring through the Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, provided <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> to governments while supporting their efforts to increase food production, and advocated for more investment in agriculture. It has also worked hand-in-hand with the European Union. One example of its work is a US$10.2 million, €7.5 billion scheme to distribute and multiply quality seeds in Haiti, which has significantly increased food production, thereby providing cheaper food and boosting farmers' incomes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} causal {{relationship}} between energy consumption and economic {{performance for the}} total economy {{as well as for}} industry, transport, and residential sectors for Tunisia during the period 1980 - 2007. The application of Vector error correction model (VECM) for non-stationary and cointegrated series suggests that causality directions at aggregated and disaggregated levels are mixed. However, the findings have important policy implications. While {{at the level of the}} total economy, energy plays an important role in development of Tunisian economy, it seems not to have an impact on economic performance at sectoral level. We conclude that results appear to be dependent on the level of aggregation and therefore <b>policy</b> <b>advices</b> should be given with caution...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper shows how <b>policy</b> <b>advices</b> based on the {{standard}} dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) framework were ineffective when significant degree of uncertainty surrounds consequences of alternative choices, and when, as the DSGE framework does, combinatorial aspects or effects of agents forming clusters of alternative choices, that is entropy effects, are ignored. In a shorter second section we mention a few other concepts outside the mainstream macroeconomics that are important to more realisitic modeling of macroeconomy, and yet missing in the DSGE models, such as random partitions of agents into clusters, distributions of sizes of clusters, ultra-metrics to measure distances between clussters, and evolutionary aspects of dynamics, that is entries by new types of agents or goods...|$|R

500|$|In September 2008 the National Research Council (NRC), {{a nonprofit}} agency {{providing}} science and <b>policy</b> <b>advice</b> {{to the federal}} government, submitted {{a report on the}} progress of CERP. The report noted [...] "scant progress" [...] in restoration because of problems in budgeting, planning, and bureaucracy. The NRC report called the Everglades one of the [...] "world's treasured ecosystems" [...] that is being further endangered by lack of progress: [...] "Ongoing delay in Everglades restoration has not only postponed improvements—it has allowed ecological decline to continue". It cited the shrinking tree islands, and the negative population growth of the endangered Rostrhamus sociabilis or Everglades snail kite, and Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis, the Cape Sable seaside sparrow. The lack of water reaching Everglades National Park was characterized as [...] "one of the most discouraging stories" [...] in implementation of the plan. The NRC recommended improving planning on the state and federal levels, evaluating each CERP project annually, and further acquisition of land for restoration. Everglades restoration was earmarked $96 million in federal funds as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 with the intention of providing civil service and construction jobs while simultaneously implementing the legislated repair projects.|$|E
