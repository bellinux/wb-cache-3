5|$|On October 15, 1966, the Historic <b>Preservation</b> Act {{created the}} National Register of Historic Places and the {{corresponding}} State Historic <b>Preservation</b> Offices (SHPO). Initially, the National Register consisted of the National Historic Landmarks designated before the Register's creation, {{as well as any}} other historic sites in the National Park system. Approval of the act, which was amended in 1980 and 1992, represented the first time the United States had a broad-based historic <b>preservation</b> policy. The 1966 act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO and an independent federal agency, the Advisory Council on Historic <b>Preservation</b> (ACHP), to confront adverse effects of federal activities on historic <b>preservation.</b>|$|E

5|$|As a result, the Riverside Historic District, Jacksonville's first {{historic}} district, {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; it now comprises 6870 acres and contains 2120 historic buildings.

40|$|This thessis {{deals with}} {{assessment}} of the actual state of an herb layer and regeneration in nature <b>preservations</b> Coufavá and Slunná. Both of nature <b>preservations</b> were affected large-scale wind disturbances. The survey was conducted in June and July 2013. There were totally performed 384 phytosocenological releves (162 in nature preserve Coufavá and 222 in nature preserve Slunná). Research was carried out on a regular grid 15 × 15 meters. There were 254 juvenile trees which were founded in nature preserve Coufavá and also 1891 juvenile trees were founded in nature preserve Slunná. In both of <b>preservations</b> browse didn't rise up 10 % from all regeneration. Most abundant tree species in nature preserve Coufavá were Fagus sylvatica. In nature preserve Slunná were most abundant Tilia sp. Strong clonal species dominated in disturbed desktop non-wood undergrowth in both of studied areas. In closed stand dominated typical forest species. Impatiens parviflora has abundant occurrence in both of biotopes. For both nature preserves was estimated future development and propose of solutions. Result of work {{should serve as a}} basis for optimizing the management plan for the said reservation...|$|R
