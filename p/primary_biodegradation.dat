5000|$|A {{complete}} biodegradation under aerobic conditions {{consists of}} two steps, <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> and ultimate biodegradation. The first step begins from the terminal carbon in the alkyl chain as omega-oxidation, which can start from one or both ends, then is followed by beta-oxidation. After the first step the residual is sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates (SP(d)Cs), a large molecule which can {{be involved in the}} second step. The second step occurs only when the required bacteria exist. The ring cleavage of benzene and the further desulphonation of the mono- and dicarboxyilic sulphophenyl acids happen. After the two-step biodegradation, LAS is degraded into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic salts and residual biomass. During the biodegradation, several specific bacteria and oxygen are required in both omega-oxidation of the alkyl chain and the benzene ring cleaving process, so this biodegradation can only happen in aerobic conditions. [...] In anaerobic conditions in treatment process, LAS shows no change. Researchers also prove that biodegradation process is restricted in 20-40 mg/L and even inhibited at a higher concentration, which leads to the incomplete biodegradation of LAS in sewage treatment plants.|$|E

The authors used the biodegradation test guideline proposed by the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances of the United States Environmental Protection Agency; 835. 3160 “Biodegradability in sea water” in its shake flask variant. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been employed {{for the analysis of}} the surfactant material.

Mean values of 6. 15 ± 0. 45 and 6. 67 ± 0. 6 days were obtained for t 50 and lag time, respectively. These results indicate that although LAS has a high <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> rate in sea water, it biodegrades slower than in similar tests conducted in river water...|$|E
40|$|An acclimated {{shake flask}} CO 2 {{evolution}} {{test was used}} to study the biodegradability of 14 commercial phthalate esters that are commonly used as plasticizers. Both CO 2 evolution (ultimate biodegradation) and loss of parent phthalate esters (<b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation)</b> were measured. With only a few exceptions, <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> was 90 % or higher, and ultimate biodegradation was in excess of 55 % of theoretical results in 28 days. The results showed that all of the commercial phthalate esters were susceptible to biodegradation by mixed populations of microorganisms from natural sources. The results also provide considerable insight into the utility and reproducibility of a standard biodegradation test that is being recommended for widespread screening of chemicals...|$|E

It is also the <b>primary</b> final <b>biodegradation</b> product of nonylphenol polyethoxylate, a non-ionic surfactant that is frequently incorporated into detergent formulation. Several studies have reported adverse effects of NP on the male reproductive system, including hormonal changes and testicular abnormalities. However, its mechanisms are not clearly understood. In the present study, experiments were performed {{to examine the effects}} of 4 -nonylphenol on the testosterone production in mice Leydig cells. Interstitial (Leydig) cells were cultured with addition of 0. 04, 0. 2, 1. 0, 2. 5 and 5 μg/mL of 4 -nonylphenol and compared with control. Concentrations of testosterone in the media were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hormone production significantly (P< 0. 05) increased at 1. 0, 2. 5 and 5. 0 μg/mL of 4 -nonylphenol concentrations. Results of the study indicated dose-dependent increases in testosterone production of interstitial (Leydig) cells following a 48 h in vitro 4 -nonylphenol exposure.

40|$|An {{innovative}} biodegradation {{test system}} {{was developed in}} order to fill the current gap for cost effective and environmentally relevant tools to assess marine biodegradability. Glass beads were colonized by a biofilm in an open flow-through system of seawater with continuous pre-exposure to Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS) (20  μg/L). Thereafter, such colonized beads were added as inoculum in different test systems. [14 C]-LAS (5 - 100  μg/L) was added and <b>primary</b> and ultimate <b>biodegradation</b> were assessed. The bacterial density collected on the beads (109 bact. /mL beads) was ca. 3 orders of magnitude higher than the typical seawater content. The LAS mineralization lag phase duration decreased from 55 to < 1  days and the mineralization extent increased from 53 to 90 % as the colonized beads volume increased from 10 to 275  mL. This is the first demonstration of marine bacteria's ability to mineralize LAS. On the opposite, less than 13 % LAS was mineralized in seawater only. The colonized beads possibly enhanced the probability to encounter the full degraders' consortium in a low volume of seawater (100  mL). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{controlled}} biodegradation of ametryn and methomyl {{has been}} performed, {{in accordance with}} the OECD Zahn-Wellens/EMPA procedure, by use of an enriched mixture of activated sludge collected from three domestic waste-water-treatment plants (WWTP). During the process concentrations of ametryn and methomyl in the water samples were isolated by solid-phase extraction (SPE); recovery rates were 98. 9 and 93. 2 for methomyl and ametryn, respectively. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to determine final pesticide concentrations and for metabolite identification. The efficiency of aerobic biodegradation of ametryn and methomyl was evaluated by measuring both the decrease in the concentration of the pesticides and global properties such as the chemical oxygen demand (COD). The acute toxicity of ametryn and methomyl was evaluated by use of the ToxAlert 100 biological test, which is based on inhibition of the bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri. There was significant correlation between results from <b>primary</b> and ultimate <b>biodegradation</b> and those from determination of toxicity.

Although these OPFRs are already marketed, their environmental fate and effects are poorly characterised. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to determine the mineralisation and <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of these OPFRs by activated sludge. Mineralisation was monitored by measuring CO 2 production by means of GC analysis, whereas <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> was monitored by LC-MS/MS analysis of the OPFRs and their potential metabolites. TPHP was biodegraded and mineralised most rapidly and achieved the requirement for ready biodegradability (60 % of theoretical maximum mineralisation). <b>Primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> was also rapid for PBDPP, but 60 % mineralisation was not achieved within the time of the test, suggesting that transformation products of PBDPP may accumulate. Primary degradation of BPA-BDPP was very slow and very low CO 2 production was also observed. Based on these results, TPHP {{and to a lesser extent}} PBDPP appear to be suitable replacements for the more environmentally persistent brominated flame retardants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aerobic {{biodegradation}} behaviour of nonyl-phenol propoxylates {{was investigated}} in two tests with different sewage sludge as inocula.

40|$|Aerobic {{biodegradation}} of {{aliphatic alcohol}} polyethoxylates (AEs) was tested under screening test conditions (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] 301 E protocol) using recently developed analytic methodologies {{for the specific}} determination of AEs and their neutral (polyethylene glycols [PEGs]) and carboxylic (carboxylated PEGs and AEs) aerobic metabolites. Biodegradation screening tests were performed under the same conditions on three typical, commercial AE blends and an individual, linear AE ethoxymer. The linear and monobranched AEs underwent a fast <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation,</b> whereas the multibranched AEs underwent a slower biodegradation. Based on the formation and oligomeric distribution of PEGs {{and the lack of}} detection of other biointermediates before the formation of PEGs, the central cleavage of the AE molecule appeared to be the mechanism for <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of the linear and monobranched AEs in the tested commercial blends. As a result, the shorter AE ethoxymers biodegraded faster than the longer ones. No PEGs were detected during biodegradation of the multibranched AEs. In addition, PEGs biodegraded more slowly than the parent AEs and were removed by hydrolysis, thus leading to shorter PEG oligomers, and by oxidative hydrolysis, thus forming carboxylated PEGs...|$|E

However, {{little is known}} about the microorganisms and mechanisms involved in NA degradation. We isolated a sediment bacterium (designated strain IS 2. 3), with 100 % 16 S rRNA gene sequence identity to Mycobacterium aurum, which degraded synthetic NAs (4 ′-n-butylphenyl) - 4 -butanoic acid (n-BPBA) and (4 ′-t-butylphenyl) - 4 -butanoic acid (t-BPBA). n-BPBA was readily oxidized with almost complete degradation (96. 8 %± 0. 3) compared with t-BPBA (77. 8 %± 3. 7 degraded) by day 49. Cell counts increased fourfold by day 14 but decreased after day 14 for both n- and t-BPBA. At day 14, (4 ′-butylphenyl) ethanoic acid (BPEA) metabolites were detected. Additional metabolites produced during t-BPBA degradation were identified by mass spectrometry of derivatives as (4 ′-carboxy-t-butylphenyl) - 4 -butanoic acid and (4 ′-carboxy-t-butylphenyl) ethanoic acid; suggesting that strain IS 2. 3 used omega oxidation of t-BPEA to oxidize the tert-butyl side-chain to produce (4 ′-carboxy-t-butylphenyl) ethanoic acid, as the <b>primary</b> route for <b>biodegradation.</b> However, strain IS 2. 3 also produced this metabolite through initial omega oxidation of the tert-butyl side-chain of t-BPBA, followed by beta-oxidation of the alkanoic acid side-chain.

40|$|Chlorinated ethenes are {{prevalent}} groundwater contaminants. To better constrain (bio) {{chemical reaction}} mechanisms of reductive dechlorination, the position-specificity of reductive trichloroethene (TCE) dehalogenation was investigated. Selective biotransformation reactions (i) of tetrachloroethene (PCE) to TCE in cultures of Desulfitobacterium sp. strain Viet 1; and (ii) of TCE to cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cis-DCE) in cultures of Geobacter lovleyi strain SZ were investigated. Compound-average carbon isotope effects were − 19. 0 ‰ ± 0. 9 ‰ (PCE) and − 12. 2 ‰ ± 1. 0 ‰ (TCE) (95 % confidence intervals). Using instrumental advances in chlorine isotope analysis by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry, compound-average chorine isotope effects were measured for PCE (− 5. 0 ‰ ± 0. 1 ‰) and TCE (− 3. 6 ‰ ± 0. 2 ‰). In addition, position-specific kinetic chlorine isotope effects were determined from fits of reactant and product isotope ratios. In PCE <b>biodegradation,</b> <b>primary</b> chlorine isotope effects were substantially larger (by − 16. 3 ‰ ± 1. 4 ‰ (standard error)) than secondary. In TCE biodegradation, in contrast, the product cis-DCE reflected an average isotope effect of − 2. 4 ‰ ± 0. 3 ‰ {{and the product}} chloride an isotope effect of − 6. 5 ‰ ± 2. 5 ‰, in the original positions of TCE from which the products were formed (95 % confidence intervals). A greater difference would be expected for a position-specific reaction (chloride would exclusively reflect a primary isotope effect). These results therefore suggest that both vicinal chlorine substituents of TCE were reactive (intramolecular competition).

This analytical survey describes their occurrence in the subsurface and sea surface layers and investigates their possible fates in this marine environment. The results indicated the presence of LAS in both layers and up to 3 km from the discharge point, whereas the concentration of sulfophenyl carboxylic acids, which are the main metabolites of LAS, was only significant near the sewer outfall and in the surface layer. The NPEO were present only in minor quantities, especially near the discharge point, and no other selected metabolites were detected. The fate of the surfactants in question was then assessed by two types of experiments according to their potential means of degradation under natural conditions.

DATS were more resistant than iso-LAS to <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation.</b> Biotransformation of both LAStype compounds and DATS produced, besides expected sulfophenyl alkyl monocarboxylated (SPAC) LAS and sulfotetralin alkylcarboxylated (STAC) DATS metabolites, significant amounts of dicarboxylated (SPADC and STADC) species. SPADCs were less persistent than STADCs. After more than 5 months {{from the beginning of the}} experiment, 40 % and 35 % of the initial amounts of DATS and iso- LAS, respectively, were not mineralized. About 64 % of refractory SPACs contained 2 - 5 alkanoyl carbons in the alkyl chain, while the number of alkanoyl carbons in the free alkyl chains of refractory STACs and STADCs averaged respectively 2. 4 and 1. 1. On the basis of the results of this study and LAS consumption, we roughly estimated that 200 000 ton of refractory organics is each year dispersed in the environment as the result of use of the above surfactants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{study focused}} on {{evaluating}} the toxi-city as well as primary and ultimate biodegradability of morpholinium herbicidal ionic liquids (HILs), which incorporated MCPA, MCPP, 2, 4 -D or Dicamba anions. The studied HILs were also subjected to determination of surface active properties {{in order to assess}} their influence on toxicity and biodegradability. The study was carried out with microbiota isolated from different environmental niches: sediments from river channel, garden soil, drainage trench collecting agricultural runoff stream, agricultural soil and municipal waste repository. The obtained results revealed that resistance to toxicity and biodegradation efficiency of the micro-biota increased in the following order: microbiota from the waste repository[microbiota from agricultural soil & microbiota from an agricultural runoff stream[microbiota from garden soil[microbiota from the river sludge. It was observed that the toxicity of HILs increased with the hydrophobicity of the cation, however the influence of the anion was more notable. The highest toxicity was observed when MCPA was used as the anion (EC 50 values ranging from 60 to 190 mg L- 1). The results of ultimate biodegradation tests indicated that only HILs with 2, 4 -D as the anion were mineralized to some extent, with slightly higher values for HILs with the 4 -decyl- 4 -ethylmorpholinium cation (10 – 31 %) compared to HILs with the 4, 4 -didecylmorpholinium cation (9 – 20 %). Overall, the cations were more susceptible (41 – 94 %) to <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> compared to anions (0 – 61 %). The obtained results suggested that the surface active properties of the studied HILs may influence their toxicity and biodegradability by bacteria in different environmental niches...|$|E
40|$|A set of {{bench scale}} {{biotrickling}} filters were designed and operated for simultaneous treatment of graywater and waste containing {{elevated levels of}} ammonia (NH 3) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). Preliminary experiments were conducted to optimize graywater processing in the reactors. While surfactants have been considered to be readily biodegradable, removal of carbon from graywater was {{not as high as}} expected during preliminary experiments when no waste gas was supplied to the system. Removal efficiency was not improved after several modifications to reactor design and it was hypothesized that complete removal of surfactants and their relevant biodegradation metabolites was a challenge. Therefore, surfactant biodegradation was studied in detail. Experimental work showed that while all three surfactants exhibited rapid <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation,</b> biodegradation of by secondary byproducts was very slow. In the case of the amphoteric surfactant, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, biodegradation byproducts seemed to be recalcitrant. A mathematical model was developed to describe the biotrickling filter processes and this model was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis so that governing processes within the biotrickling filter could be determined. Important design parameters were elucidated as well as parameters inherent to the system, or intrinsic parameters. Results showed that an increase in wetted area within the biotrickling filter could significantly improve process performance. Therefore, a set of tracer test experiments was conducted {{to examine the effects of}} packing material and hydraulic loading rate on hydrodynamics in the bench scale biotrickling filters. Of the packing materials tested, the use of Rings in the biotrickling filters resulted in improved hydrodynamics. Proof of Concept was established for simultaneous treatment of graywater and waste gas in the studied biotrickling filters. Complete removal of NH 3 gas loaded at 150 mg/min and H 2 S loaded at 0. 83 mg/min was achieved while removal of carbonaceous compounds from graywater remained stable. ...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{data were}} {{collected}} in a pilot-scale municipal activated sludge plant to assess {{the fate of the}} C 12 -homologue of linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS-C 12). The pilot-plant was operated at influent LAS-C 12 concentrations between 2 and 12 mg/l and at sludge retention times of 10 and 27 days Monitoring {{data were collected}} in a pilot-scale municipal activated sludge plant to assess the fate of the C- 12 -homologue of linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS-C- 12). The pilot-plant was operated at influent LAS-C- 12 concentrations between 2 and 12 mg l(- 1) and at sludge retention times of 10 and 27 days. Effluent and waste sludge concentrations varied between 5 and 10 mug l(- 1) and between 37 and 69 mug g(- 1) VSS, respectively. In the sludge samples only 2 - 8 % was present as dissolved LAS-C- 12, whereas the remaining 92 - 98 % was found to be adsorbed to the sludge. In spite of this high degree of sorption, more than 99 % of the LAS-C- 12 load was removed by biodegradation, showing that not only the soluble fraction but also the adsorbed fraction of LAS-C- 12 is readily available for biodegradation. Sorption and biodegradation of LAS-C- 12 were also investigated separately. Sorption was an extremely fast and reversible process and could be described by a linear isotherm with a partition coefficient of 3. 21 g(- 1) volatile suspended solids. From the results of biodegradation kinetic tests it was concluded that <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of LAS-C- 12 cannot be described by a (growth) Monod model, but a secondary utilisation model should be used instead. The apparent affinity of the sludge to biodegrade LAS-C- 12 increased when the sludge was loaded with higher influent concentrations of LAS-C- 12. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of natural estrogens, {{a class of}} endocrine disrupting compounds, in water has caused increasing concerns over their adverse impacts {{on the health of}} aquatic eco-systems and human beings. In this study, adsorption characteristics of two natural estrogens, 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and estrone (E 1), on granular activated carbon (GAC) were investigated in isotherm tests and in a GAC column. The GAC column was then converted to a biologically active carbon (BAC) column and the removal efficiency of E 2 and its <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> intermediate E 1 were monitored. During BAC operation, the impacts of various reactor operation parameters, such as the carbon (i. e., acetic acid vs. humic acid) and nitrogen sources (i. e., ammonium vs. nitrate) in reactor influent and empty bed contact times (i. e., 20 – 48 minutes), were systematically studied. Corresponding to each reactor operation, the structure of the bacterial community, particularly the E 2 and E 1 degrading bacterial populations, in the BAC reactor was monitored using the pyrosequencing technology. Finally, metabolic pathways involved in E 2 biodegradation in an E 1 degrading bacterial isolate, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain ZL 1, were investigated using a quantitative proteomic approach. The following conclusions were drawn from this study: The adsorption isotherm experiment showed that the F 400 GAC had a higher adsorption capacity for E 1 than for E 2, and revealed mild competitive adsorption between E 1 and E 2. The GAC column cannot effectively remove E 2 due to the long mass transfer zone. The microbial activities in the BAC column enhanced E 2 removal. Highest removal of E 2 and its primary degradation product E 1 occurred when the BAC column was operated with long EBCTs and fed acetic acid as the energy source and ammonium as the nitrogen source. Microbial community analysis showed that E 2 degrading bacteria were accumulated in the BAC reactor and E 1 degrading bacteria were the most abundant when ammonium was used as the nitrogen source. Enzymes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis, protein biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation were up-regulated during the biodegradation of E 2 and E 1 in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain ZL 1. An E 2 assimilation pathway through aromatic amino acid biosynthesis was proposed. Advisor: Xu L...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from March 21, 2017 - September 21, 2017 Large quantities of the chemical oil dispersant Corexit were applied in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) {{in response to the}} Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Large data gaps regarding the potential transport, persistence and impact of Corexit in the Gulf existed {{at the time of the}} emergency response. Analytical methods for the quantification of the individual surface-active-agent (surfactant) components of Corexit in seawater and sediments did not exist and needed to be developed for the support of environmental monitoring and laboratory experiments. The work presented in this thesis addresses important questions about the persistence and transport of the surfactant components of Corexit, namely DOSS, Span 80, Tween 80, and Tween 85 in marine systems. Unique challenges were uncovered and overcome along the way to answering these questions. Chapter 2 describes laboratory microcosm experiments quantifying the biodegradation of the Corexit surfactants in the presence and absence of oil using large volume injection liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The extent of <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> differed for each surfactant and between treatments. Additionally, the microbial and abiotic hydrolysis of DOSS to its transformation intermediate EHSS was quantified. Significant biodegradation of DOSS was observed but mass balance with EHSS was not achieved, indicating that other transformation intermediates are formed during DOSS biodegradation. In contrast to a previous literature report, the abiotic hydrolysis of DOSS was not observed, suggesting that the abiotic losses observed by others were the result of the chemical biocide (sodium azide) employed in that study. Aqueous-phase surfactant concentrations were lower when Corexit was mixed with excess oil, due to partitioning of the surfactants into oil. The implication of this finding is that surfactant exposure concentrations depend on how Corexit is prepared. Chapter 3 describes the development and demonstration of an analytical method for the extraction and quantification of DOSS in marine sediments and sediment-trap materials using liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). The use of QTOF resolved interferences without the need for sample cleanup that were observed in some samples analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Chapter 4 describes the application of the method developed in Chapter 3 to a large set of sediments collected in the Gulf between 2010 and 2015. Publicly available, but unpublished data, on DOSS in gulf sediments generated as part of the natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) were also incorporated and use to identify an area of DOSS-impacted sediments. The temporal trend in DOSS concentration from 2010 - 2015 indicates long-term persistence of DOSS with quantifiable DOSS concentrations remaining for more than 5 years after the application of Corexit during the Deepwater Horizon oil-spill. Chapter 5 describes the quantification of Corexit surfactants in aerosols generated under laboratory conditions that simulate bursting bubbles that occur under breaking waves. The ejection of the Corexit surfactants as aerosols was demonstrated. Collectively, the research presented in this thesis overcame analytical challenges in the measurement of the Corexit surfactants and informed the transport and persistence of DOSS and other surfactants in marine systems...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceuticals are biologically active {{compounds}} {{that may be}} consumed in hundreds of tonnes per year, and which are excreted into municipal sewerage systems. Many pharmaceuticals persist during sewage treatment, and significant environmental risk {{has been linked to}} incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals. Evaluation of this risk is important and should be as representative as possible, taking into consideration all significant exposure routes and removal processes. Sludge treatment processes are of particular interest because they offer a final opportunity for the removal of persistent compounds before the disposal of treated biosolids. During environmental risk assessment, it is currently assumed that anaerobic sludge treatment results in insignificant removal of persistent and adsorptive compounds from sewage sludge. This project was undertaken to address whether this assumption is valid. This thesis describes research into the behaviour and fate of pharmaceuticals in anaerobic digester sludge, and examines how redox conditions influence removal efficiency. Nine commonly used pharmaceuticals (caffeine, cimetidine, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, metformin, naproxen, paroxetine, propranolol and salicylic acid) were selected for use based upon detection levels within sewage sludge and predicted anaerobic biodegradability. Initial experiments were conducted to identify toxicity to anaerobic microorganisms and anaerobic biodegradability. No toxicity to the microorganisms in anaerobic sludge was identified at ≤ 50 mg C L- 1 for any of the selected pharmaceuticals. The extent of removal in anaerobic sludge and the principal removal mechanism was found to vary between the selected pharmaceuticals. Metformin and salicylic acid were removed by 82 and 93 % through mineralisation, respectively; naproxen was completely removed through primary biodegradation; fluoxetine, paroxetine and propranolol were removed by 92 and 96 and 55 % due to adsorption, respectively. It was hypothesised that the removal of pharmaceuticals in anaerobic sludge through biodegradation and adsorption would be observed at varying rates under differing redox conditions. Test systems using headspace gas flushing and chemical amendment were evaluated for the control of redox conditions, with Eh measurements and DOC removal being used to indicate the stability of the system and its capacity for biodegradation. The addition of nitrate, sulfate and carbonate resulted in poised Eh values in the region of + 200, - 200 and - 200 mV, respectively and 81, 78 and 74 % removal of DOC, respectively. This methodology was subsequently used to evaluate the removal of naproxen, propranolol and fluoxetine under carbonate-, nitrate- and sulfate-amended conditions. Significant differences (p = 0. 001) in the removal of naproxen through <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradation</b> were found to exist between different redox conditions. Naproxen was completely removed under control conditions, while 26, 98 and 61 % removal was observed under nitrate- sulfate- and carbonate amended conditions, respectively. Some differences were observed in Kd values, however, redox amendment was found to have little influence upon the elimination of propranolol and fluoxetine through adsorption. It was identified from this work that pharmaceuticals within the aqueous phase degraded under anaerobic conditions as predicted, while pharmaceuticals associated with the biosolids were removed through adsorption and present a potential threat to the environment on the disposal of treated biosolids. This work supports the current industry assumption that anaerobic treatment of biosolids offers limited opportunity for the removal of adsorptive pharmaceuticals, and also found no evidence for their enhanced removal under redox-controlled conditions. While research described within this thesis increases knowledge of the behaviour of pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions, data is presented for a limited range of test substances only, and further investigation into the behaviour of additional compound classes is recommended.
