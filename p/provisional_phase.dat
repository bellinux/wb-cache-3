40|$|Background and aim There {{is a lack}} of {{instruments}} that focus on the specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues that affect older people with cancer. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a HRQOL questionnaire module to supplement the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-C 30 for older (> 70 years) patients with cancer. Methods Phases 1 – 3 were conducted in seven countries following modified EORTC Quality of Life Group guidelines for module development. Phase 1 : potentially relevant issues were identified by a systematic literature review, a questionnaire survey of 17 multi-disciplinary health professionals and two rounds of qualitative interviews. The first round included 9 patients aged > 70. The second round was a comparative series of interviews with 49 patients > 70 years with a range of cancer diagnoses and 40 patients aged 50 – 69 years matched for gender and disease site. In Phase 2 the issues were formulated into a long provisional item list. This was administered in Phase 3 together with the QLQ-C 30 to two further groups of cancer patients aged > 70 (n = 97) or 50 – 69 years (n = 85) to determine the importance, relevance and acceptability of each item. Redundant and duplicate items were removed; issues specific to the older group were selected for the final questionnaire. Results In Phase 1, 75 issues were identified. These were reduced in Phase 2 to create a 45 item <b>provisional</b> list. <b>Phase</b> 3 testing of the provisional list led to the selection of 15 items with good range of response, high scores of importance and relevance in the older patients. This resulted in the EORTC QLQ-ELD 15, containing five conceptually coherent scales (functional independence, relationships with family and friends, worries about the future, autonomy and burden of illness). Conclusion The EORTC QLQ-ELD 15 in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C 30 is ready for large-scale validation studies, and will assess HRQOL issues of most relevance and concern for older people with cancer across a wide range of cancer sites and treatment stages...|$|R

Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the fracture toughness of the Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) resin and Bis-Acryl Composite (BAC) resin reinforced with the Polyethylene and Glass fibers. Materials and Methods: Three groups (N= 10) of each of the two materials were prepared for the fracture toughness test. Two groups had the different reinforcements and group without reinforcement served as the control. The mean fracture toughness (MPa. m½) was compared by One-way ANOVA, followed by the Scheffe analysis. Fracture toughness between fiber-reinforced PMMA and BAC resin was compared by the independent samples t test. Results: For the controls, the fracture toughness for PMMA resin (0. 91) was significantly lower than for the BAC resin (1. 19). Glass fiber reinforcement produced significantly higher fracture toughness for both, PMMA (1. 48) and BAC (1. 82) resin, but the Polyethylene fibers did not (0. 95 for PMMA and 1. 23 for BAC resin). Among the reinforced groups, Silane impregnated Glass fibers showed highest fracture toughness for the BAC resin (1. 82). Conclusion: Of two fiber reinforcement methods evaluated, Glass fiber reinforcement for the PMMA and BAC resin produced highest fracture toughness.

40|$|Background The overrepresentation {{of young}} drivers in road crashes, {{injuries}} and fatalities {{around the world}} {{has resulted in a}} breadth of injury prevention efforts including education, enforcement, engineering, and exposure control. Despite multifaceted intervention, the young driver problem remains a challenge for injury prevention researchers, practitioners and policy-makers. The intractable nature of young driver crash risks suggests that a deeper understanding of their car use – that is, the purpose of their driving – is required to inform the design of more effective young driver countermeasures. Aims This research examined the driving purpose reported by young drivers, including the relationship with self-reported risky driving behaviours including offences. Methods Young drivers with a Learner or Provisional licence participated in three online surveys (N 1 = 656, 17 - 20 years; N 2 = 1051, 17 - 20 years; N 3 = 351, 17 - 21 years) {{as part of a larger}} state-wide project in Queensland, Australia. Results A driving purpose scale was developed (the PsychoSocial Purpose Driving Scale, PSPDS), revealing that young drivers drove for psychosocial reasons such as for a sense of freedom and to feel independent. Drivers who reported the greatest psychosocial purpose for driving were more likely to be male and to report more risky driving behaviours such as speeding. Drivers who deliberately avoided on-road police presence and reported a prior driving-related offence had significantly greater PSPDS scores, and higher reporting of psychosocial driving purposes was found over time as drivers transitioned from the supervised Learner licence phase to the independent <b>Provisional</b> (intermediate) licence <b>phase.</b> Discussion and conclusions The psychosocial needs met by driving suggest that effective intervention to prevent young driver injury requires further consideration of their driving purpose. Enforcement, education, and engineering efforts which consider the psychosocial purpose of the driving are likely to be more efficacious than those which presently do not. Road safety countermeasures could reduce the young driver’s exposure to risk through such mechanisms as encouraging the use of public transport...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} avoid dentin {{contamination}} and the resulting problems, the dual bonding or immediate dentin sealing technique has been proposed [4, 5]. In this procedure a dentin bonding agent {{is applied to the}} fresh cut dentin prior to the placement of the provisional restoration. Immediate dentin sealing requires hybridization of the exposed dentin surface immediately after tooth preparation and during final luting procedures [6, 7]. The technique prevents the bacterial invasion and dentin sensitivity during the <b>provisional</b> <b>phase,</b> and it is concerned with increased bond strength [4]. Another advantage is that the thickness of dentin bonding agent is considered before tooth preparation impression [8]. The technique could be used with a 3 -step etch-and-rinse dentin bonding agent, leading to increased microtensile bond strength compared to delayed dentin sealing. General protocol suggests the use of two step total-etch systems and two-steps self-etch systems as well [3].|$|E
40|$|Justice, Jonathan B. This {{study is}} about {{accountability}} relationships {{in decision making}} processes and intends to advance research of accountability in unfamiliar (non routine) contexts. Accountability {{is defined as the}} individual experience of being accountable. Two research problems, linked to each other, are identified. The first research problem is the conceptualization of accountability primarily in routine contexts, the second relates to the individual experience of being accountable for the adoption of unfamiliar hazard mitigation measures such as vertical evacuation for tsunami in natural hazard mitigation plans. Vertical evacuation for tsunamis is a strategy to make people safer by moving them above the threat, as opposed to moving them out of harm’s way; also known as horizontal evacuation. Understanding how accountability works in situations perceived as either routine or non-routine provides actionable knowledge on how to manage accountability and its effects on behavior in situations of uncertainty. This research develops, operationalizes, and validates an analytic framework for describing accountability in routine and non routine situations. ☐ Building on Yang’s (2012) conceptualization of accountability as recursive, the study focuses on the individuals’ reasons and motivations for being accountable. The research proposes that the preference in the adoption of horizontal evacuation over vertical evacuation for tsunami is the result of accepting horizontal evacuation as a routine practice. ☐ An interpretive approach and multiple case study design is used. All interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a first and second cycle of coding. The first cycle of coding yielded exploratory knowledge. In this <b>phase,</b> <b>provisional</b> coding to which attribute and magnitude codes were applied was used. The second cycle of coding used hypothesis coding. Participants were asked questions related to their cognitive process of vertical evacuation as a mitigation measure to define what vertical evacuation meant to them, what their attitude was toward VE, and what they think of VE as a strategy for aiding vulnerable populations specifically. ☐ Comparison across case studies shows that the study cannot confirm a direct relationship between the rejection of vertical evacuation and the adoption of horizontal evacuation due to the high costs of vertical evacuation structures. The dissertation concludes with practical suggestions for public administration practitioners and addresses the need for more research on accountability in non routine contexts; particularly in fields other than emergency management.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} Conventions and Recommendations {{to regulate the}} minimum age for admission to employment between the years 1919 and 1973 – the ILO minimum age campaign. The adoption process has been studied in its chronological and historical context. The dissertation has three points of departure: that childhood is a historical construction and that the legal material {{is part of that}} construction; that the minimum age campaign suffered from a ‘hang-over-from-history’, namely, the history of Western industrialisation during the 19 th and early 20 th centuries; and, finally, that children had a subordinate and weak position in the minimum age campaign. The study was organised around five central themes: (1) the over-all theme of predominant conceptions of children and work; (2) the relationship between industrialised and colonised and developing nations; (3) the relationship between the child, the family and the state; (4) minimum age; and (5) the importance of school. The most important results of the study are that: (1) In view of the revolutionary changes during the 20 th century the continuity in the minimum age campaign was remarkable. In 1919, the ‘child labour problem’ was an issue mainly for the Western industrialised word. By the end of the campaign, in 1973, the transformations in societies during the century had made ‘the child labour problem’ an issue mainly for the developing world and with different conditions and implications in many respects. The content and ‘grammar’ of the minimum age campaign was however never really challenged. (2) The study has verified that the minimum age campaign suffered from a ‘hang-over-from history’. The campaign built directly on the Western industrial experience during the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. The Western dominance in the ILO, the legal transplants, and the roots in the labour movement all contributed to the ‘hang-over’. (3) The minimum age campaign was modelled on the ‘norm of the Western industrialised childhood’. The norms and realities of childhood {{in other parts of the}} world were neglected of considered as <b>provisional</b> and inferior <b>phases</b> in relation to the Western ‘norm’. In this way, there were two separate childhoods in the minimum age campaign: ‘the normal’ childhood conceived for Western conditions and ‘the other’ childhood conceived for the ‘imperfect’ conditions of poor children in the colonised and developing nations. (4) In the minimum age campaign the ‘best interests of the child’ was negotiable and was subordinated in case of conflict with other interests...|$|R

40|$|The {{graduated}} driver licensing (GDL) {{program in}} Queensland, Australia, was considerably enhanced in July 2007. This paper explores the compliance of young learner and provisional (intermediate) drivers with current GDL requirements and general road rules. Unsupervised driving, learner logbook accuracy, {{and experiences of}} punishment avoidance were explored as was speeding as a provisional driver. Participants (609 females, 423 males; M = 17. 43 years) self-reported their sociodemographic characteristics, driving behaviors, and licensing experiences as learners. Six months later, a subset of participants (238 females, 105 males) completed another survey that explored their provisional behaviors and experiences. Although {{the majority of participants}} reported compliance with both the GDL requirements and general road rules, such as stopping at red lights on their learner license, a considerable proportion reported speeding. Furthermore, they reported becoming less compliant during the <b>provisional</b> <b>phase,</b> particularly with speed limits. Self-reported speeding was predicted by the following variables: younger age at licensure, being in a relationship, driving unsupervised, submitting inaccurate learner logbooks, and speeding as a learner. Enforcement and education countermeasures should focus on curtailing noncompliance, targeting speeding in particular. Novice drivers should be encouraged to comply with all road rules, including speed limits, and safe driving behaviors should be developed and reinforced during the learner and early provisional periods. Novice drivers have been found to model their parents’ driving, and parents are pivotal in regulating novice driving.

30|$|Bonded {{indirect}} restorations require two appointments: one for provisional {{treatment and}} one for luting with resin cement and dentin bonding agents (DBA). The DBA layer may be accomplished during a delayed dentin sealing (DDS) step following the <b>provisional</b> <b>phase</b> or an immediate dentin sealing (IDS) step after tooth preparation and during final luting procedures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the effect of resin-based provisional material (RBPM) on the tensile bond strength to human dentin developed using DDS and IDS procedures. Flat dentin surfaces were prepared on 48 molars for microtensile testing. The specimens were restored using a 3 -step etch-and-rinse DBA and composite resin (CR). A set of control specimens (G 1) was directly restored using DBA and CR, while the remaining samples were treated using a provisional restoration procedure for 2  weeks: DDS + acrylic resin (AR) + calcium hydroxide cement (CHC) (group G 2), DDS + AR + eugenol-free cement (G 3), DDS + RBPM (G 4), IDS + glycerin + RBPM (G 5), or IDS + RBPM (G 6). After storage of the final restoration in water for 24  h, the specimens were serially sectioned to obtain bonded sticks 0.8  mm 2 in area. The tensile strength was tested at a crosshead speed of 0.5  mm/min. The results were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc tests (α =  0.05). The mean (standard-deviation) bond strengths for groups G 1 –G 6 were 42.18 (± 2.63); 40.14 (± 3.46); 37.77 (± 0.93); 37.16 (± 2.61); 34.11 (± 1.08) and 23.79 (± 0.49) MPa. The mean bond strength of group G 6 was significantly lower (p <  0.05), suggesting that adhesion to dentin is influenced by use of RBPM with IDS prior to placement of a definitive restoration.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cleft lip and palate (CLP) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} congenital facial abnormality and multidisciplinary treatment extending over many years is necessary to rehabilitate the affected individuals to normal function and esthetics. Objective: To evaluate the clinical treatment outcome for missing teeth with tooth supported fixed partial dentures in unilateral cleft lip and palate patients. Patients and Methods: Tooth supported fixed partial denture (T-FPD) was utilized for restoration of missing teeth in the cleft area for 9 non syndromic, unilateral cleft lip and palate patients (U-CLP). The {{mean age of the}} patients was 25 ± 4 years. The edentulous sites were prepared to receive ovate pontic for best possible esthetic results. Survival and complications were recorded following various biologic, technical and esthetic parameters up to 10 years of follow up. A clinical comparison was also made with respect to the periodontal status and development of new carious lesion between the restored cleft side teeth and corresponding teeth of the normal side with in the same patient. Results: Three failures experienced with fixed partial dentures were a result of ceramic chipping after 10 years, functional fracture after 3 years, and fracture due to external trauma after 2 years. Discussion: CLP patients undergo a lot of treatment; therefore understanding their opinions, expectations, and perspectives towards the prosthodontic intervention was given due importance. The <b>provisional</b> <b>phase</b> was utilized to educate the patients on the achievable treatment outcome and its limitation. In the present case series, out of three failed FPDs, only one restoration failed relatively early due to functional factors. Re-treatment was successfully achieved without change in the original material and extent of the FPDs. Conclusion: The outcome accomplished endorses the integral role of T-FPDs in the overall cleft care and it will remain a viable treatment alternative in select few patients in meeting their esthetic and functional desires...|$|E
40|$|Young novice drivers - that is, drivers aged 16 - 25 {{years who}} are {{relatively}} inexperienced in {{driving on the}} road and have a novice (Learner, Provisional) driver's licence - have been overrepresented in car crash, injury and fatality statistics around the world for decades. There are numerous persistent characteristics evident in young novice driver crashes, fatalities and offences, including variables relating to the young driver themselves, broader social influences which include their passengers, the car they drive, and when and how they drive, and their risky driving behaviour in particular. Moreover, there are a range of psychosocial factors influencing the behaviour of young novice drivers, including the social influences of parents and peers, and person-related factors such as age-related factors, attitudes, and sensation seeking. Historically, a range of approaches have been developed to manage the risky driving behaviour of young novice drivers. Traditional measures predominantly relying upon education have had limited success in regulating the risky driving behaviour of the young novice driver. In contrast, interventions such as graduated driver licensing (GDL) which acknowledges young novice drivers' limitations - principally pertaining to their chronological and developmental age, and their driving inexperience - have shown to be effective in ameliorating this pervasive public health problem. In practice, GDL is a risk management tool that is designed to reduce driving at risky times (e. g., at night) or in risky driving conditions (e. g., with passengers), while still enabling novice drivers to obtain experience. In this regard, the GDL program in Queensland, Australia, was considerably enhanced in July 2007, and major additions to the program include mandated Learner practice of 100 hours recorded in a logbook, and passenger limits during night driving in the <b>Provisional</b> <b>phase.</b> Road safety researchers have also continued to consider the influential role played by the young driver's psychosocial characteristics, including psychological traits and states. In addition, whilst the majority of road safety user research is epidemiological in nature, contemporary road safety research is increasingly applying psychological and criminological theories. Importantly, such theories not only can guide young novice driver research, they can also inform the development and evaluation of countermeasures targeting their risky driving behaviour. The research is thus designed to explore the self-reported behaviours - and the personal, psychosocial, and structural influences upon the behaviours - of young novice drivers 	This thesis incorporates three stages of predominantly quantitative research to undertake a comprehensive investigation of the risky driving behaviour of young novices. Risky driving behaviour increases the likelihood of the young novice driver being involved in a crash which may harm themselves or other road users, and deliberate risky driving such as driving in excess of the posted speed limits is the focus of the program of research. The extant literature examining the nature of the risky behaviour of the young novice driver - and the contributing factors for this behaviour - while comprehensive, has not {{led to the development of}} a reliable instrument designed specifically to measure the risky behaviour of the young novice driver. Therefore the development and application of such a tool (the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale, or BYNDS) was foremost in the program of research. In addition to describing the driving behaviours of the young novice, a central theme of this program of research was identifying, describing, and quantifying personal, behavioural, and environmental influences upon young novice driver risky behaviour. Accordingly the 11 papers developed from the three stages of research which comprise this thesis are framed within Bandura's reciprocal determinism model which explicitly considers the reciprocal relationship between the environment, the person, and their behaviour. Stage One comprised the foundation research and operationalised quantitative and qualitative methodologies to finalise the instrument used in Stages Two and Three. The first part of Stage One involved an online survey which was completed by 761 young novice drivers who attended tertiary education institutions across Queensland. A reliable instrument for measuring the risky driving behaviour of young novices was developed (the BYNDS) and is currently being operationalised in young novice driver research in progress at the Centre for Injury Research and Prevention in Philadelphia, USA. In addition, regression analyses revealed that psychological distress influenced risky driving behaviour, and the differential influence of depression, anxiety, sensitivity to punishments and rewards, and sensation seeking propensity were explored. Path model analyses revealed that punishment sensitivity was mediated by anxiety and depression; and the influence of depression, anxiety, reward sensitivity and sensation seeking propensity were moderated by the gender of the driver. Specifically, for males, sensation seeking propensity, depression, and reward sensitivity were predictive of self-reported risky driving, whilst for females anxiety was also influential. In the second part of Stage One, 21 young novice drivers participated in individual and small group interviews. The normative influences of parents, peers, and the Police were explicated. Content analysis supported four themes of influence through punishments, rewards, and the behaviours and attitudes of parents and friends. The Police were also influential upon the risky driving behaviour of young novices. The findings of both parts of Stage One informed the research of Stage Two. Stage Two was a comprehensive investigation of the pre-Licence and Learner experiences, attitudes, and behaviours, of young novice drivers. In this stage, 1170 young novice drivers from across Queensland completed an online or paper survey exploring their experiences, behaviours and attitudes as a pre- and Learner driver. The majority of novices did not drive before they were licensed (pre-Licence driving) or as an unsupervised Learner, submitted accurate logbooks, intended to follow the road rules as a Provisional driver, and reported practicing predominantly at the end of the Learner period. The experience of Learners in the enhanced-GDL program were also examined and compared to those of Learner drivers who progressed through the former-GDL program (data collected previously by Bates, Watson, & King, 2009 a). Importantly, current-GDL Learners reported significantly more driving practice and a longer Learner period, less difficulty obtaining practice, and less offence detection and crash involvement than Learners in the former-GDL program. The findings of Stage Two informed the research of Stage Three. Stage Three was a comprehensive exploration of the driving experiences, attitudes and behaviours of young novice drivers during their first six months of Provisional 1 licensure. In this stage, 390 of the 1170 young novice drivers from Stage Two completed another survey, and data collected during Stages Two and Three allowed a longitudinal investigation of self-reported risky driving behaviours, such as GDL-specific and general road rule compliance; risky behaviour such as pre-Licence driving, crash involvement and offence detection; and vehicle ownership, paying attention to Police presence, and punishment avoidance. Whilst the majority of Learner and Provisional drivers reported compliance with GDL-specific and general road rules, 33...|$|E
40|$|Newly {{licensed}} drivers on {{a provisional}} or intermediate licence {{have the highest}} crash risk when compared with any other group of drivers. In comparison, learner drivers have the lowest crash risk. Graduated driver licensing is one countermeasure that has been demonstrated to effectively reduce the crashes of novice drivers. This thesis examined the graduated driver licensing systems in two Australian states {{in order to better}} understand the behaviour of learner drivers, provisional drivers and the supervisors of learner drivers. By doing this, the thesis investigated the personal, social and environmental influences on novice driver behaviour as well as providing effective baseline data against which to measure subsequent changes to the licensing systems. In the first study, conducted prior to the changes to the graduated driver licensing system introduced in mid- 2007, drivers who had recently obtained their provisional licence in Queensland and New South Wales were interviewed by telephone regarding their experiences while driving on their learner licence. Of the 687 eligible people approached to participate at driver licensing centres, 392 completed the study representing a response rate of 57. 1 per cent. At the time the data was collected, New South Wales represented a more extensive graduated driver licensing system when compared with Queensland. The results suggested that requiring learners to complete a mandated number of hours of supervised practice impacts on the amount of hours that learners report completing. While most learners from New South Wales reported meeting the requirement to complete 50 hours of practice, it appears that many stopped practising soon after this goal was achieved. In contrast, learners from Queensland, who were not required to complete a specific number of hours {{at the time of the}} survey, tended to fall into three groups. The first group appeared to complete the minimum number of hours required to pass the test (less than 26 hours), the second group completed 26 to 50 hours of supervised practice while the third group completed significantly more practice than the first two groups (over 100 hours of supervised practice). Learner drivers in both states reported generally complying with the road laws and were unlikely to report that they had been caught breaking the road rules. They also indicated that they planned to obey the road laws once they obtained their provisional licence. However, they were less likely to intend to comply with recommended actions to reduce crash risk such as limiting their driving at night. This study also identified that there were relatively low levels of unaccompanied driving (approximately 15 per cent of the sample), very few driving offences committed (five per cent of the sample) and that learner drivers tended to use a mix of private and professional supervisors (although the majority of practice is undertaken with private supervisors). Consistent with the international literature, this study identified that very few learner drivers had experienced a crash (six per cent) while on their learner licence. The second study was also conducted prior to changes to the graduated driver licensing system and involved follow up interviews with the participants of the first study after they had approximately 21 months driving experience on their provisional licence. Of the 392 participants that completed the first study, 233 participants completed the second interview (representing a response rate of 59. 4 per cent). As with the first study, at the time the data was collected, New South Wales had a more extensive graduated driver licensing system than Queensland. For instance, novice drivers from New South Wales were required to progress through two provisional licence phases (P 1 and P 2) while there was only one provisional licence phase in Queensland. Among the participants in this second study, almost all provisional drivers (97. 9 per cent) owned or had access to a vehicle for regular driving. They reported that they were unlikely to break road rules, such as driving after a couple of drinks, but were also unlikely to comply with recommended actions, such as limiting their driving at night. When their provisional driving behaviour was compared to the stated intentions from the first study, the results suggested that their intentions were not a strong predictor of their subsequent behaviour. Their perception of risk associated with driving declined from when they first obtained their learner licence to when they had acquired provisional driving experience. Just over 25 per cent of participants in study two reported that they had been caught committing driving offences while on their provisional licence. Nearly one-third of participants had crashed while driving on a provisional licence, although few of these crashes resulted in injuries or hospitalisations. To complement the first two studies, the third study examined the experiences of supervisors of learner drivers, as well as their perceptions of their learner’s experiences. This study was undertaken after the introduction of the new graduated driver licensing systems in Queensland and New South Wales in mid- 2007, providing insights into the impacts of these changes from the perspective of supervisors. The third study involved an internet survey of 552 supervisors of learner drivers. Within the sample, approximately 50 per cent of participants supervised their own child. Other supervisors of the learner drivers included other parents or stepparents, professional driving instructors and siblings. For two-thirds of the sample, this was the first learner driver that they had supervised. Participants had provided an average of 54. 82 hours (sd = 67. 19) of supervision. Seventy-three per cent of participants indicated that their learners’ logbooks were accurate or very accurate in most cases, although parents were more likely than non-parents to report that their learners’ logbook was accurate (F (1, 546) = 7. 74, p =. 006). There was no difference between parents and non-parents regarding whether they believed the log book system was effective (F (1, 546) =. 01, p =. 913). The majority of the sample reported that their learner driver had had some professional driving lessons. Notwithstanding this, a significant proportion (72. 5 per cent) believed that parents should be either very involved or involved in teaching their child to drive, with parents being more likely than non-parents to hold this belief. In the post mid- 2007 graduated driver licensing system, Queensland learner drivers are able to record three hours of supervised practice in their log book for every hour that is completed with a professional driving instructor, up to a total of ten hours. Despite this, there was no difference identified between Queensland and New South Wales participants regarding the amount of time that they reported their learners spent with professional driving instructors (X 2 (1) = 2. 56, p =. 110). Supervisors from New South Wales were more likely to ensure that their learner driver complied with the road laws. Additionally, with the exception of drug driving laws, New South Wales supervisors believed it was more important to teach safety-related behaviours such as remaining within the speed limit, car control and hazard perception than those from Queensland. This may be indicative of more intensive road safety educational efforts in New South Wales or the longer time that graduated driver licensing has operated in that jurisdiction. However, other factors may have contributed to these findings and further research is required to explore the issue. In addition, supervisors reported that their learner driver was involved in very few crashes (3. 4 per cent) and offences (2. 7 per cent). This relatively low reported crash rate is similar to that identified in the first study. Most of the graduated driver licensing research to date has been applied in nature and lacked a strong theoretical foundation. These studies used Akers’ social learning theory to explore the self-reported behaviour of novice drivers and their supervisors. This theory was selected as it has previously been found to provide a relatively comprehensive framework for explaining a range of driver behaviours including novice driver behaviour. Sensation seeking was also used in the first two studies to complement the non-social rewards component of Akers’ social learning theory. This program of research identified that both Akers’ social learning theory and sensation seeking were useful in predicting the behaviour of learner and provisional drivers over and above socio-demographic factors. Within the first study, Akers’ social learning theory accounted for an additional 22 per cent of the variance in learner driver compliance with the law, over and above a range of socio-demographic factors such as age, gender and income. The two constructs within Akers’ theory which were significant predictors of learner driver compliance were the behavioural dimension of differential association relating to friends, and anticipated rewards. Sensation seeking predicted an additional six per cent of the variance in learner driver compliance with the law. When considering a learner driver’s intention to comply with the law while driving on a provisional licence, Akers’ social learning theory accounted for an additional 10 per cent of the variance above socio-demographic factors with anticipated rewards being a significant predictor. Sensation seeking predicted an additional four per cent of the variance. The results suggest that the more rewards individuals anticipate for complying with the law, the more likely they are to obey the road rules. Further research is needed to identify which specific rewards are most likely to encourage novice drivers’ compliance with the law. In the second study, Akers’ social learning theory predicted an additional 40 per cent of the variance in self-reported compliance with road rules over and above socio-demographic factors while sensation seeking accounted for an additional five per cent of the variance. A number of Aker’s social learning theory constructs significantly predicted provisional driver compliance with the law, including the behavioural dimension of differential association for friends, the normative dimension of differential association, personal attitudes and anticipated punishments. The consistent prediction of additional variance by sensation seeking over and above the variables within Akers’ social learning theory in both studies one and two suggests that sensation seeking is not fully captured within the non social rewards dimension of Akers’ social learning theory, at least for novice drivers. It appears that novice drivers are strongly influenced by the desire to engage in new and intense experiences. While socio-demographic factors and the perception of risk associated with driving had an important role in predicting the behaviour of the supervisors of learner drivers, Akers’ social learning theory provided further levels of prediction over and above these factors. The Akers’ social learning theory variables predicted an additional 14 per cent of the variance in the extent to which supervisors ensured that their learners complied with the law and an additional eight per cent of the variance in the supervisors’ provision of a range of practice experiences. The normative dimension of differential association, personal attitudes towards the use of professional driving instructors and anticipated rewards were significant predictors for supervisors ensuring that their learner complied with the road laws, while the normative dimension was important for range of practice. This suggests that supervisors who engage with other supervisors who ensure their learner complies with the road laws and provide a range of practice to their own learners are more likely to also engage in these behaviours. Within this program of research, there were several limitations including the method of recruitment of participants within the first study, the lower participation rate in the second study, an inability to calculate a response rate for study three and the use of self-report data for all three studies. Within the first study, participants were only recruited from larger driver licensing centres to ensure that there was a sufficient throughput of drivers to approach. This may have biased the results due to the possible differences in learners that obtain their licences in locations with smaller licensing centres. Only 59. 4 per cent of the sample in the first study completed the second study. This may be a limitation if there was a common reason why those not participating were unable to complete the interview leading to a systematic impact on the results. The third study used a combination of a convenience and snowball sampling which meant that it was not possible to calculate a response rate. All three studies used self-report data which, in many cases, is considered a limitation. However, self-report data may be the only method that can be used to obtain some information. This program of research has a number of implications for countermeasures in both the learner licence phase and the provisional licence phase. During the learner phase, licensing authorities need to carefully consider the number of hours that they mandate learner drivers must complete before they obtain their provisional driving licence. If they mandate an insufficient number of hours, there may be inadvertent negative effects as a result of setting too low a limit. This research suggests that logbooks may be a useful tool for learners and their supervisors in recording and structuring their supervised practice. However, it would appear that the usage rates for logbooks will remain low if they remain voluntary. One strategy for achieving larger amounts of supervised practice is for learner drivers and their supervisors to make supervised practice part of their everyday activities. As well as assisting the learner driver to accumulate the required number of hours of supervised practice, it would ensure that they gain experience in the types of environments that they will probably encounter when driving unaccompanied in the future, such as to and from education or work commitments. There is also a need for policy processes to ensure that parents and professional driving instructors communicate effectively regarding the learner driver’s progress. This is required as most learners spend at least some time with a professional instructor despite receiving significant amounts of practice with a private supervisor. However, many supervisors did not discuss their learner’s progress with the driving instructor. During the <b>provisional</b> <b>phase,</b> there is a need to strengthen countermeasures to address the high crash risk of these drivers. Although many of these crashes are minor, most involve at least one other vehicle. Therefore, there are social and economic benefits to reducing these crashes. If the new, post- 2007 graduated driver licensing systems do not significantly reduce crash risk, there may be a need to introduce further provisional licence restrictions such as separate night driving and peer passenger restrictions (as opposed to the hybrid version of these two restrictions operating in both Queensland and New South Wales). Provisional drivers appear to be more likely to obey some provisional licence laws, such as lower blood alcohol content limits, than others such as speed limits. Therefore, there may be a need to introduce countermeasures to encourage provisional drivers to comply with specific restrictions. When combined, these studies provided significant information regarding graduated driver licensing programs. This program of research has investigated graduated driver licensing utilising a cross-sectional and longitudinal design in order to develop our understanding of the experiences of novice drivers that progress through the system in order to help reduce crash risk once novice drivers commence driving by themselves...|$|E
