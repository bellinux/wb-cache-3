5|$|A <b>population</b> ecology {{concept is}} r/K {{selection}} theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to <b>population</b> density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in <b>population</b> size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid <b>population</b> growth. These early phases of <b>population</b> growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the <b>population</b> becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the <b>population</b> experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E
