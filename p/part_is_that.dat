500|$|In contrast, several {{parties have}} {{expressed}} concern that Doomsday presents negativity in England's latent view of Scotland based on their history. Angus MacNeil, member of the Scottish National Party, said of the film's impact: [...] "The complimentary <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people are thinking about Scotland as we are moving more and more towards independence. But the film depicts {{a country that is}} still the plaything of London. It is decisions made in London that has led to it becoming a quarantine zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Roadrunner Records showed {{interest}} in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal. The offer was ultimately turned down, {{and the band}} signed a five-album record deal with Sony BMG and a UK licensing deal with Visible Noise. According to Tuck, they chose Sony because, [...] "We thought that a lot more doors {{would be open to}} us." [...] A self-titled EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK. Produced by Colin Richardson, it featured five tracks and marked the band's first official release. A second EP, Hand of Blood, was released on 22 August 2005 through Trustkill Records and was only available in the U.S.; the release contained one extra track than the self-titled EP, [...] "4 Words (To Choke Upon)." [...] Daniel Lukes of Decibel Magazine reviewed the EP by stating, [...] "The worst <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the music itself isn’t all that bad, for the genre." [...] He went on to comment that the band should be [...] "embarrassed" [...] about the release. Zeromag's Josh Joyce complimented the band on [...] "how technical they can get without confusing the kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|Birth of a Nation, {{even more}} than other films in the public domain, has been poorly {{represented}} in later releases. The problem, in <b>part,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Griffith and others have reworked the film, leaving no definitive version. According to the silent film website Brenton Film, [...] "there are a multitude of poor quality DVDs with different edits, scores, running speeds and usually in definitely unoriginal black and white".|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the present}} scheme of frescos, the {{earliest}} <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{of the side}} walls. They are divided into three main tiers. The central tier of the walls has two cycles of paintings, which complement each other, The Life of Moses and The Life of Christ. They were commissioned in 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV and executed by Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Cosimo Roselli and their workshops. They originally ran all round the walls, but have since been replaced on both end walls.|$|E
2500|$|Iann Robinson, {{writing for}} CraveOnline, wrote an essay {{critical}} of All Star Batman & Robin, calling it [...] "a comic series that just spirals {{deeper and deeper}} into the abyss of unreadable. I understand Miller's need to re-invent, but this is just badly done and in poor taste." [...] Robinson commented that [...] "the art by Jim Lee is first rate [...] really wonderful to look at, [...] Frank Miller has stripped Batman of all of his dignity, class, and honor. This isn't the Dark Knight; this is Dirty Harry in a cowl. The worst <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this is exactly what Batman isn't about." [...] He added, [...] "In one fell swoop, Miller has erased all the good he did for Batman with [...] and [...] All of that is just gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{responses}} to the characters have been positive. Time reported in July 2016 that [...] "people are thrilled about Nickelodeon's decision" [...] to include a gay couple. Kaitlyn Hayes of PinkNews wrote in her review of The Loud House that their portrayal in [...] "such a natural and accurate way still puts a huge smile on our faces." [...] Radio Times reported that the social networking site Twitter had given rise to many [...] "overwhelmingly positive" [...] tweets about the couple. Laura Bradley of Vanity Fair stated that The Loud House [...] "handles the topic [...] in exactly the right way...this kind of casual representation in children's programming is a milestone." [...] De Elizabeth of Teen Vogue wrote, [...] "The best <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the show doesn’t treat these characters any differently, or even introduce them with a heavy asterisk about their marital status." [...] The Friskys Tai Gooden mentioned that [...] "kids who have two dads (or moms) {{will be more than}} thrilled to see a family they can identify with on TV." ...|$|E
5000|$|Repairable <b>parts</b> <b>are</b> <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> deemed {{worthy of}} repair, usually {{by virtue of}} {{economic}} consideration of their repair cost.

2500|$|Reviewers {{were mostly}} unified {{in the overall}} fun factor in the game. [...] Levi Buchanan of IGN stated that the game was [...] "fun, fun, fun" [...] and [...] "an instant pleasure". [...] Slide to Play's Chris Reed agreed and felt that the game was perfect for when a {{consumer}} has short moments of boredom. [...] He likened this to playing the game while waiting in line for something and stated [...] "it'll slice the time in half." [...] Jim Squires of GameZebo felt the gameplay was simple and addictive. [...] Geoff Gibson of DIYGamer stated {{that he could see}} Fruit Ninja [...] "becoming the next [...] "big thing" [...] on the App Store." [...] Several reviewers praised price and Halfbrick's commitment to continual updates to the game. [...] GameZone's James Pikover stated [...] "perhaps the best <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this game isn't even complete." [...] He then spoke of the future game modes to be made available and lauded the value-to-price ratio. [...] App Spy's Andrew Nesvadba agreed that Halfbrick's commitment and updates were [...] "nothing short of spectacular." [...] He also praised the game's graphics and said they were [...] "luscious". [...] The reviewer from BuzzFocus praised the game's inexpensive price and said consumers [...] "should really be downloading this app right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1993 {{interview}} with Miller, Option wrote that success was a touchy subject for him, quoting Miller's joking {{example of a}} typical review: [...] "Nothing good ever happens to Scott Miller, but somehow he's managed to drag his broken body into a studio {{one more time and}} make another album." [...] Miller continued that he was [...] "past the point of fighting" [...] discussions of how [...] "arty or brainy" [...] he was, but had hoped for greater emphasis [...] "on what the songs are about—be it the boy-girl situation, or being depressed about some key failure I've had, or getting a little bit of understanding about life." [...] In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad {{that a lot of people}} don't get what I consider to be my real songwriting coups. I think they go right past a lot of people. The bad part of that is I probably won't become a big star. But the good <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I don't think people will find the albums less useful over time. They'll sound as good in 2004 as they will in 1994.|$|E
