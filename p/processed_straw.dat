30|$|To {{support the}} inefficient {{limitation}} of long-term biosystem by well-known simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), electron beam irradiated rice straw (at 80  kGy, 1  MeV, and 0.12  mA) was fermented using fungal-based simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (FBSSF) by saprophytic zygomycetes Mucor indicus. Based {{on the growth}} optimization (by response surface methodology), this eco-friendly bioprocess either without metabolic inhibitors (especially furfurals and acetic acids) or byproducts (especially glycerols) significantly increased the biodegradability and fermentability of lignocellulosic rice straw. Specifically, when irradiated straw was simultaneously bioconverted by M. indicus for 48  h, the ethanol yield was 57.2 % of the theoretical maximum. This value was on the similar level as the 59.8 % (for 144  h) measured from <b>processed</b> <b>straw</b> by well-known SSF. Furthermore, after FBSSF for 144  h based on large-scale mass balance, the ethanol concentration and production yield, and productivity were 34.6  g/L, 72.3 % of the theoretical maximum, and 0.24  g/L/h, respectively.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{functions}} of rice straw {{can be used as}} ruminant feed requirements, rice straw potentially large enough {{to meet the needs of}} animal feed despite relatively low-quality feed ingredients and high-fiber ballpark. Utilization of rice straw is very important to help farmers in the supply of animal feed, rice straw that has not been exploited farmers at harvest so that the straw is burned. Though rice straw at harvest could reach 10 - 15 tonnes per hectare, the results can be used as animal feed. While fodder in the dry season is very critical, farmers are very expensive to buy and look for animal feed. Through the feed processing technology is efficient, rice straw can be processed into highly nutritious feed.

40|$|Wheat straw (Triticum aestivum L.) is an {{abundant}} source of plant fiber. It is regenerated, in large quantities, every year. At present, this potentially valuable resource is greatly under-exploited. Most of the excess straw biomass (i. e., tonnage above that required for agronomic cropping system sustainability) is managed through expensive chopping/tillage operations and/or burnt {{in the field}} following harvest, resulting in air pollution and associated health problems. Potential applications for wheat straw investigated within this project include energy and composites manufacture. Other methods of straw utilization that will potentially benefit from {{the findings of this}} research project include housing and building, pulp and paper, thermal insulation, fuels, and chemicals. This project focused on components of the feedstock assembly system for supplying a higher value small grains straw residue for (1) gasification/combustion and (2) straw-thermoplastic composites.

The present work aims to identify and quantify the environmental impacts associated with the production of flax fibres, through 3 -year field experiment, carried out in Bologna and Pisa representative of the pedoclimatic characteristics of central Italy. Life Cycle Impact of “a one ton of fibre ready to be processed in a pulp mill” was assessed taking into account: farming, straw process (drying, scutching and baling) and transport. Inventory data for agricultural inputs and outputs were obtained directly from field experimentation and from bibliographic data about heat, transport and electricity consumption on straw processing. An economic allocation approach to assign impacts within flax seed and <b>processed</b> <b>straw</b> has been used. The CML baseline 2000 methodology was selected to quantify the potential environmental impact associated to the crops. Specifically, global warming (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP) and photochemical oxidant formation (POP) were evaluated together with energy use (EU). Major impacts contribution arise from fertilizers use and straw processing. Cultivation phase of flax fibre at Pisa reported higher values (approximately 3 times greater) for all the impact categories. The lower impact in the flax cultivation scenario at Bologna was due to no use of mineral fertilizer and the higher flax-straw yield. It resulted also a strong reduction of the impacts with respect to those of hemp pulp in Spain {{as well as to}} the impacts of the conventional wood-pulp reported in Simapro. Furthermore, LCA tool aided to identify the materials and process that most affected the impacts: fertilizers use, diesel consumption and straw processing were identified as hot spots in both crops.

40|$|The thesis {{addresses}} the post-glacial {{development of the}} Niagara Cuesta between Hamilton and Collingwood. Conventional thinking on the escarpment during the Holocene suggests that the present morphology developed rapidly following deglaciation due to periglacial <b>processes</b> (<b>Straw,</b> 1966 /Tovell 1992). The disruption of the preglacial drainage pattern by drift has meant the escarpment has not been subject to extensive ﬂuvial action along its base, resulting in an extremely slow rate of retreat (Bird, 1980). The concept that the escarpment is a relict feature therefore pervades the modem literature. The apparent motion of the blocks at {{the face of the}} escarpment (Hintz, I 997) suggests that in the absence of exogenetic processes, a slow development due to endogenetic processes has dominated the modem development of the escarpment. It has been suggested by Hewitt (1997), that the present morphology found at cliffed sections of the escarpment may be due to deformation within the shale layers. ln order to test this hypothesis, the strength properties of the rocks that form the escarpment were tested and compared to the gravitational stresses that would be experienced within the rock mass. The results indicate that both the Cabot Head Shale and the Queenston Shale possess compressive strengths that are below the principal gravitational stress expected within the escarpment. It is therefore concluded that in the absence of high conﬁning stresses. As would be expected near the cliff face, deformation within these formations is occurring...|$|R

40|$|Straw {{black liquor}} is {{relatively}} difficult to recover using the Tomlinson process {{because of the}} presence of silica in inorganic components. Gasification with direct causticization might serve as a promising alternative; however, the interaction between silica and direct causticization agents needs to be evaluated. In this work, desilication was achieved using a laboratory-scale membrane electrolysis cell adopted from the chlor-alkali industry. Then raw and desilicated straw black liquors were carried out through direct causticization with titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and recycled sodium tri-titanate (Na 2 O center dot 3 TiO(2)) at 850 degrees C using a tube furnace. The results show that these two agents exhibit different silica transfer mechanisms. When using TiO 2, approximately 80 % of the silica is retained in the solid residue after hydrolysis because of chemical interactions. Almost all of the silica transfers to the hydrolysis-derived white liquor when using Na 2 O center dot 3 TiO(2). This means that the <b>process</b> of treating <b>straw</b> black liquor by direct causticization might need additional lime causticization to improve the efficiency of sodium recovery. This observation also indicates that silica will not consume the direct causticization agent Na 2 O center dot 3 TiO(2) after the initial step using TiO 2. The sodium hydroxide (NaOH) yield was 60 % when using raw black liquor as the feed to the Na 2 O center dot 3 TiO(2) recycling tests and 80 % when using desilicated straw black liquor. Considering the NaOH recovered in the electrolysis cell, the total NaOH yields exceed 85 % of total titratable alkali. No detectable deterioration of the direct causticization agents was found within the limited number of recycles tested.

In this <b>process,</b> wheat <b>straw</b> was pretreated by soaking in aqueous ammonia (SAA), which extensively removed lignin but preserved high percentages of the carbohydrate fractions for subsequent bioconversion. The pretreatment conditions included 15 wt% NH 4 OH, 1 : 10 solid:liquid ratio, 65 oC and 15 hours. Under these conditions, 48 % of the original lignin was removed, whereas 98 %, 83 % and 78 % of the original glucan, xylan, and arabinan, respectively, were preserved. The pretreated material was subsequently hydrolyzed with a commercial hemicellulase to produce a solution rich in xylose and low in glucose plus a cellulose-enriched solid residue. The xylose-rich solution then was used for production of value-added products. Xylitol and astaxanthin were selected to demonstrate the fermentability of the xylose-rich hydrolysate. Candida mogii and Phaffia rhodozyma were used for xylitol and astaxanthin fermentation, respectively. The cellulose-enriched residue obtained after the enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated straw was used for ethanol production in a fed-batch simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process.
