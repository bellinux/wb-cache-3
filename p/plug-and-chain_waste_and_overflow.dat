40|$|Approach: The {{amount of}} energy related costs as {{a portion of the}} total farm {{operating}} cost can be as high as 29 % and the continuing increase of the real cost of energy related farm input {{has been one of the}} major factors impacting the cost of agricultural production. However, agricultural has the potential of replacing some of the purchased energy in the form of fossil fuels, commercial fertilizer and field production of animal feed with bioenergy and organic fertilizer from onsite renewable biomass such as animal manure in order to economically and environmentally sustain it. The aim of this study was to develop an innovative energy efficient pilot scale anaerobic digester composting facility. Methodology: A solid/liquid manure separator farm scale anaerobic digester and composting facility for a medium sized dairy farm were designed, constructed and tested. In order to make the anaerobic digestion economically viable under Canadian climatic conditions, the design, installation and operation of the system were based on advantages gained from the digester as a component of the total farm management system. In addition to the biogas production, benefits related to manure handling and storage, environmental quality improvement through odor control and water pollution reduction, fertilizer recovery and water recycling, were considered. Results: The layout of the farm was modified to provide solutions for four environmental problems related to: disposal of milkhouse <b>wastes</b> <b>and</b> <b>overflow</b> from the manure storage facility into the fire pond. The system possesses high energy conversion efficiency at relatively low capital cost and reduced labour requirement and has indirect energy ramifications through the production of organic fertilizer (compost) to replace expensive and energy consuming commercial fertilizer as well as the production of bioenergy (biogas) which will reduce the demand for energy. The overflow from the system (purified water) can be recycled for cleaning the barn, thereby reducing the costs of water use and manure storage facilities on one hand and eliminating pollution problems associated with manure storage and disposal on the other hand. Conclusion: The use of dairy waste as a source of energy and fertilizer resulted in a saving of 6289 kg of fertilizer at a cost of $ 17 925 annually and additional saving of $ 20 547 on energy use...|$|R
40|$|This master’s project compares {{policy options}} that will most {{effectively}} reduce climate risk, specifically flooding, in Chicago’s most vulnerable communities. Chicago {{is expected to}} receive heavier and more frequent precipitation due to climate change, increasing upwards to 20 to 30 percent more {{by the end of}} the century (Hayhoe, et al, 2010). Unfortunately, over the past several decades, the City’s century-old combined sewer system has failed to protect communities from flooding (Hayhoe, et al, 2010). The City’s sewer system carries sewage and stormwater in the same underground pipe, and it often exceeds its threshold of 2. 5 inches of rainfall per day (USGCRP, 2009). Beyond that, the untreated <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> stormwater <b>overflow</b> into the Chicago River and Lake Michigan – the City’s source of drinking water – or onto city streets and into basements (City of Chicago, n. d. b). The City has been investing in infrastructure to combat the increasing frequency of flooding. In 1972, the City unveiled the Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP) to reduce flooding, but several challenges have delayed phases of execution, and it is not expected to be completed until 2029. Until a more sophisticated sewer system is constructed, green and other gray infrastructure can mitigate flooding risks by capturing stormwater. Recognizing this, City of Chicago established the Green Stormwater Infrastructure Strategy in 2014 and plans to release a Citywide Stormwater Managemen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Smart waste {{management}} {{in a city}} is significantly manifested by the optimal distribution of waste collection points (dustbins). Evidently, inadequate number of dustbins coupled with improper management may trigger pollution to a great extent. Waste collection using insufficient street dustbins is a widely used way of solid {{waste management}} in Dhaka city. Yet an uncomforting scenario of air pollution is prevailing in different wards of Dhaka. The reasons can be put forth as inadequate and unequal distribution of municipal dustbins, improper management including <b>waste</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>and</b> the lack of awareness in usage among the people. In this context, an attempt {{has been made in}} this paper to obtain a quantitative analysis between existing dustbins and their serving population. This study first analyses the spatial distribution of dustbins in some areas of Dhaka city employing average nearest neighbor functions of GIS. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of the existing dustbins has shown to be predominantly in clustered pattern. Next, an optimal number of additional dustbins were calculated. An additional number of 20 and 8 dustbins are required in areas (wards) # 34 and # 35 in Dhaka city. We also examined the extent of pollution caused by the existing dustbins using spatial analyst functions of GIS. It is found that all the dustbins are burst with <b>wastes</b> <b>and</b> causing pollution to the ground surface and air. The results thus obtained would help to understand the present scenario of the waste management of Dhaka city and to optimally place the required number of dustbins to prevent further pollution to environment. 1...|$|R

50|$|Another {{controversial}} {{issue in the}} uk is {{the frequency of the}} waste collections. To save money, many councils are cutting the frequency of both general <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> recyclables collections.

40|$|Computational secret image sharing (CSIS) is an {{effective}} way to protect a secret image during its transmission and storage, and thus it has attracted lots of attentions since its appearance. Nowadays, it has become a hot topic for researchers to improve the embedding capacity and eliminate the underflow <b>and</b> <b>overflow</b> situations, which is embarrassing and difficult to deal with. The scheme, which has the highest embedding capacity among the existing schemes, has the underflow <b>and</b> <b>overflow</b> problems. Although the underflow <b>and</b> <b>overflow</b> situations have been well dealt with by different methods, the embedding capacities of these methods are reduced more or less. Motivated by these concerns, we propose a novel scheme, in which we take the differential coding, Huffman coding, and data converting to compress the secret image before embedding it to further improve the embedding capacity, and the pixel mapping matrix embedding method with a newly designed matrix is used to embed secret image data into the cover image to avoid the underflow <b>and</b> <b>overflow</b> situations. Experiment results show that our scheme can improve the embedding capacity further and eliminate the underflow <b>and</b> <b>overflow</b> situations at the same time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Congestion {{mitigation}} <b>and</b> <b>overflow</b> avoidance {{are two of}} {{the major}} goals of the global routing stage. With {{a significant increase in the}} chip size and routing complexity, congestion <b>and</b> <b>overflow</b> have become critical issues in physical design automation. In this paper we present several routing algorithms for congestion reduction <b>and</b> <b>overflow</b> avoidance. Our methods are based on ripping up nets that go through the congested regions and replacing them with congestion-aware Steiner trees. We propose several efficient algorithms for finding congestion-aware Steiner trees and evaluate their performance using the ISPD routing benchmarks. We also show that the novel technique of network coding contributes to further improvements in routability and reduction of congestion. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm for identifying efficient congestion-aware network coding topologies and evaluate its performance. I...|$|R
