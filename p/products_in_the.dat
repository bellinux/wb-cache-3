5|$|Aloin, a {{compound}} {{found in the}} exudate of some Aloe species, was the common ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) laxative <b>products</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States until 2002 when the Food and Drug Administration banned it because the companies manufacturing it failed to provide the necessary safety data. Aloe vera has potential toxicity, with side effects occurring at some dose levels both when ingested or applied topically. Although toxicity may be less when aloin is removed by processing, Aloe vera that contains aloin in excess amounts may induce side effects.|$|E
5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to <b>products</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E

5|$|Neon Genesis Evangelion gained {{widespread}} {{critical acclaim}} {{as well as}} controversy.

5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of <b>products</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E
