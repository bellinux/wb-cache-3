40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role and}} use of <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> in north Queensland. Using a semi-structured questionnaire and personal interviews, the opinions of 18 operators of <b>portable</b> and fixed-site <b>sawmills</b> were canvassed {{on a number of}} issues including main problems faced by the local industry, current sources of timber, sawn timber recovery rates of their operations, willingness to purchase new milling and other equipment, opinions about why (or if) <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> can sell timber at a lower cost than fixed-site mills, and destinations of sawn timber milled. The most critical issues faced by sawmillers were the lack of resource security and competing products, in particular competition from imported tropical timbers from neighbouring island countries including Papua New Guinea. Most sawmillers in north Queensland currently obtain logs mainly from private landholdings and are hesitant to invest in new equipment due to concerns about future log supplies. This paper also explores the current and potential role of <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> in the regional small-scale forestry industry. An examination of policy issues suggests that there may be a need for new legislation to cover employees, sawn timber consumers and sawmillers themselves. The future role of <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> may require a co-operative approach that emphasizes low volume value-adding, due to the decreasing supply of logs i...|$|R

40|$|The {{sawmilling}} industry within North Queensland, Australia {{has traditionally}} processed a {{diverse range of}} high quality rainforest cabinet timbers from locally occurring tropical rainforests. Over 100 species are suitable for milling, many of which produce highly prized timber for cabinet work and flooring. The sawmilling industry contracted dramatically with the World Heritage listing in 1988 and associated logging bans on Crown and some private land. Sawmilling is currently restricted to {{a small number of}} fixed-site and portable mills which source timber from privately owned native forests. The low stumpage prices paid by these mills relative to the final sawn timber prices is a source of contention, with landholders believing that the mills are profiteering from an oligopsony situation. There has been increased use of <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> in recent years by full-time and part-time millers. While <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> do compete with traditional fixed-site sawmills on the local market, they are not seen as a major threat to the future of traditional fixed-site sawmills. Anecdotal evidence suggests that portable sawmillers do not account for all costs relevant to their milling activities but rather work on a cash flow basis. For portable sawmillers, labour is the major cost element, especially if associated costs such as workers compensation and superannuation are included. This paper examines cost structures of <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> in North Queensland. The various sources of cost data and the limitations of these data are discussed. Short-run cost curves are derived and sensitivity analysis undertaken with respect to a number of key cost parameters. An attempt is also made to develop a timber milling long-run average cost curve. Results of this analysis are used to shed light on the accusations of rent capture by fixed-site sawmillers and to examine the potential role of <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills...</b>|$|R

In 1889 James McConnel began selling off small parcels of land from his property Cressbrook to his workers for dairying. The railway, which provided rapid and cheap transport to Brisbane, fostered the timber industry's development. Over the next 30 years sawmills were established at Lowood, Esk, Toogoolawah, Moore, Linville, Harlin, Blackbutt, Monsildale and Perseverance {{as well as a}} number of <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> operating in stands of timber.|$|R

40|$|Markets for {{rainforest}} cabinet timbers {{in north}} Queensland are currently limited. The {{vast majority of}} the logs come from private land due to the reduction of the resource with the World Heritage listing of the rainforest in 1988. For a variety of reasons, no market is available for logs for woodchip. Thus for landholders harvesting trees the main market for these species is the sawn-timber market. In north Queensland the single large-scale processor of logs, Ravenshoe Timbers Pty Ltd, only processes plantation grown softwoods. The potential buyers of hardwood logs are limited to a few small 2 ̆ 7 family 2 ̆ 7 fixed-site mills and portable sawmillers. The markets these sawmillers service in turn are often long distances from north Queensland, which leads to high road or rail haulage costs. Additionally, these sawmillers face stiff competition from rainforest timbers of similar characteristics imported from developing countries where legislative requirements and cost of labour are not as onerous as those in Australia. It is important to ascertain what role the cabinet timber industry can play in the north Queensland economy and what role, if any <b>portable</b> <b>sawmilling</b> can play in a future timber industry. Potential exists for greater use of <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills,</b> to handle the relatively small volume of hardwood timber available, and reduce log transport and milling costs...|$|R

The principal trees logged by the company were white pine, white oak, chestnut, and hemlock. While lumber was the principal product of the company, chestnut, hemlock, and oak bark were also shipped as extract wood to Newport. The timber was logged out in 1905, and the company closed up, selling the lumber cars to the N&SV and the engine to the East Waterford Lumber Company. In April 1907, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought its land, establishing the McClure Division of Tuscarora State Forest. Part of the grade also lies within Fowlers Hollow State Park.|$|R
40|$|Various {{forms of}} <b>portable</b> or 'walkabout' <b>sawmills</b> have become popular for timber {{extraction}} and in-forest milling in tropical forestry in recent years. A number of advantages over larger fixed-site mills have been recognised, such as reduced transport costs and utilisation of smaller logs and branches. Portable bandsaws, {{with a thin}} blade kerf generally {{give rise to a}} greater timber recovery than traditional circular saws. Chainsaws have been criticised for greater timber wastage, and in some cases their use for timber extraction has been declared illegal. The choice of appropriate technology involves a tradeoff with respect to various factors including capital outlays, maintenance capability and costs, labour efficiency and timber recovery rate. If these items are factored into the overall average cost curve, it becomes apparent that both <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> and chainsaw milling do have an important role in tropical small-scale forestry. the latter are particularly useful for flitch cutting as a first stage of milling...|$|R
50|$|A {{trend is}} the small <b>portable</b> <b>sawmill</b> for {{personal}} or even professional use. Many different models have emerged with different designs and functions.

Some remote communities that have experienced natural disasters have used portable sawmills to rebuild their communities out of the fallen trees.|$|E
50|$|A {{log house}} moulder is a machine to prepare logs to be {{suitable}} for building a log home. In general, the logs are first sawn to a square beam, then the moulder makes the groove.

The log house moulder is usually powered by electricity, but for portable sawmills they are sometimes using a chainsaw as power head. One of the more common, especially in Europe, is theLogosol log house moulder.|$|E

50|$|Pinecrest Lake is {{the last}} {{in a series of}} dams {{constructed}} on the South Fork of the Stanislaus River. In the beginning the purpose was to divert water via ditches and flumes to the mining claims in and around Columbia and the foothills. Much of this aqueduct system remains intact today and is still used as a portion of the main water system for the surrounding area. A large part of the aqueduct in the forest was built with wooden flumes, builders carried <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> into the forest to mill the trees into boards in order to construct the flumes. The present dam at Pinecrest, previously called Lower Strawberry Reservoir Dam, was built by Sierra and San Francisco Power Company for hydroelectric power, the water is managed by Tuolumne Utilities District (TUD).|$|R
50|$|Rip {{cuts are}} {{commonly}} {{made with a}} table saw, but other types of power saws can also be used, including a radial arm saw, band saw, and hand held circular saw. In sawmills the head saw is the first rip-saw a log goes through, which is sometimes a gang-saw, and then the cants may be resawn using other saws and then edged in a edger and sometimes cut to length by a crosscut saw. Also, smaller <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills</b> and chainsaw mills use rip-cuts to produce lumber. Each time {{a piece of wood}} is rip cut it takes time and the kerf material turns into sawdust and loses value so the number and width of each rip cut influence the economics of the operation: This gives band saws an advantage over circular saws and chainsaws.|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the Wood-Mizer in 1982, portable bandsaw mills represented a dramatic shift in design. Unlike traditional mills, they used a thin-kerf blade of the type used on a band saw rather than a circular blade, which reduced weight and cost, and reduced the size and weight of the bearings and support blocks. The smaller kerf on these blades dramatically increased the yield from a given log. Use of band blades also allowed for a different design where the head, consisting of the blade and a power source, moves back and forth while the log remains stationary. This is in contrast to traditional mills where the log moves on a trolley while the blade remains fixed. Aside from the original Wood-Mizer company, many companies now manufacture and sell personal and <b>portable</b> <b>sawmills.</b>|$|R
