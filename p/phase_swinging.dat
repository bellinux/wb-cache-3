40|$|We held infants (aged 4 – 12 months) over a {{treadmill}} {{to study how}} they co-ordinated the two limbs during stepping. We disturbed one limb during the stance or <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> and recorded the responses (muscle activity and movement) from both lower limbs. Manual disturbances were applied during the stance phase by sliding the foot backward, forcing the limb into the <b>swing</b> <b>phase.</b> Disturbances were also applied in the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> by manually extending the hip, interfering with the forward motion of the limb. Additional disturbances were applied to see if both limbs could perform the stance and <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> synchronously. When the limb was forced to initiate the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> on one side, the contralateral limb either prolonged its contact with the ground or quickly established ground contact. When the forward motion of the limb was interrupted in the <b>swing</b> <b>phase,</b> the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> was prolonged on the disturbed side and the stance phase prolonged on the contralateral side. In most cases, one leg maintained ground contact. Moreover, {{it was easy to}} elicit bilateral, simultaneous stance phase, whereas it was difficult to elicit simultaneous <b>swing</b> <b>phase.</b> In cases where <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> in the two limbs was initiated close in time, rhythmic alternate stepping was immediately restored in the following step.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} changes in lower-extremity joint work and power during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> in a maximal accelerated sprinting. Twelve male sprinters performed 60  m maximal sprints while motion data was recorded. Lower-extremity joint work and power during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> of each stride for both legs were calculated. Positive hip and negative knee work (≈ 4. 3 and ≈− 2. 9  J kg− 1) and mean power (≈ 13. 4 and ≈− 8. 7  W kg− 1) {{during the entire}} <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> stabilized or decreased after the 26. 2 ± 1. 1 (9. 69 ± 0. 25  m s− 1) or 34. 3 ± 1. 5  m mark (9. 97 ± 0. 26  m s− 1) during the acceleration phase. In contrast, the hip negative work and mean power during the early <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> (≈ 7 -fold and ≈ 3. 7 -fold increase in total), {{as well as the}} knee negative work and power during the terminal <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> (≈ 1. 85 -fold and ≈ 2 -fold increase in total), increased until maximal speed. Moreover, only the magnitudes of increases in negative work and mean power at hip and knee joints during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> were positively associated with the increment of running speed from the middle of acceleration phase. These findings indicate that the roles of energy generation and absorption at the hip and knee joints shift around the middle of the acceleration phase as energy generation and absorption at the hip during the late <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> and at the knee during early <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> are generally maintained or decreased, and negative work and power at hip during the early <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> and at knee during the terminal <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> may be responsible for increasing running speed when approaching maximal speed...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{evidence}} for distal rectus femoris transfer {{as a part}} of multilevel surgery for the correction of stiff-knee gait in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy is limited because of inconsistent outcomes reported in various studies and the lack of long-term evaluations. Methods: This study investigated the long-term results (mean, nine years) for fifty-three ambulatory patients with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy and stiff-knee gait treated with standardized distal rectus femoris transfer {{as a part of}} multilevel surgery. Standardized three-dimensional gait analysis and clinical examination were carried out before surgery and at one year and nine years after surgery. Patients with decreased peak knee flexion in <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> who had distal rectus femoris transfer to correct the decreased peak knee flexion in <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> (C-DRFT) were evaluated separately from those with normal or increased peak knee flexion in <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> who had distal rectus femoris transfer done as a prophylactic procedure (P-DRFT).

Tinamous are paleognathous birds as are the ratites, whereas the cariamids are neognathous birds sharing a cursorial adaptation with the large ratites. Osteological measurements of the long bones of the hind limbs, and frame by frame analysis of high speed video records of the birds walking under usual conditions, allowed for comparing duration of the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> in two functional categories: birds with long stretched-hind limbs versus those with short flexed-limbs. In addition were compared birds of two distinct phylogenetic groups: Neognathae vs Palaeognathae. Results indicate that there is a correlation between the duration of the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> and two studied clades, the paleognathous birds having a longer <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> duration than neognathous birds belonging to the same functional categories. However, this parameter alone does not allow for discriminating between groups. The functional categories are also correlated to the duration of the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> as flexed-limb birds have a shorter <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> than the stretched-limb ones.

40|$|AbstractRunning is a cyclic {{motion in}} which each leg has two <b>phases,</b> stance and <b>swing.</b> The energy {{generated}} by the muscular forces are dominant in the phase between initial contact and mid-stance. However, during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase,</b> other internal forces act to transfer the mechanical energy between segments. In this research, we focused on the energy transfer mechanism during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> and investigated how non-muscular (e. g. centrifugal and gravity) forces of each link generate, absorb, and transfer the mechanical energy. A mathematical analysis of the lower limb's movement in the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> of running at different speeds was carried out. A multi-body power analysis was performed using dynamical equations of a three-dimensional double pendulum to find the mechanism {{to increase the speed}} of the leg swing efficiently. Results show that the internal force at the knee joint work throughout the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> to generate centrifugal force in the shank and that the knee joint moment is very small in comparison to the internal force. Understanding the transfer mechanism using the internal forces could lead to economical running forms that prevent injuries and enhance the performance of the runners...|$|R

The study included 28 unilateral transfemoral amputees amputated for reasons other than chronic vascular disease.

After having tried both knee joints, 19 patients preferred the Tehlin knee, 6 patients preferred the Otto Beck 3 R 20, and 3 patients had no preference. The energy expenditure measurement showed that walking with the Tehlin knee required more energy than walking with Otto Beck 3 R 20.

30|$|To our knowledge, {{this study}} is the first to provide a {{comparison}} of elderly and very elderly women with respect to peak angular velocities, and the temporal relationship of these peak values to the gait cycle, at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. However, significant differences were only noted in the timing of peak values throughout the gait cycle, rather than the peak velocities themselves. Peak values occurred during the pre-swing <b>phase,</b> initial <b>swing</b> <b>phase,</b> and terminal <b>swing</b> <b>phase.</b> Previously identified significant differences in peak angular velocity parameters have primarily been observed in comparison with younger (Watelain et al. 2000; Mills and Barrett 2001; Anderson and Madigan 2014) and middle-age participants (Ko et al. 2012). If the timing of the peak joint angle parameter is representative of the timing of joint angle displacement, then the timing of the peak angular velocity is representative of the greatest moment of instantaneous change in flexion/extension. Therefore, in combination with the timing of peak joint angle movements, angular velocity is necessary to obtain a better understanding of gait characteristics in the elderly.|$|R

Tripping perturbation onset during <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> is strongly related {{to the use of}} different recovery strategies; however, it is insufficient to fully explain how strategies are chosen. The dynamic interactions between the foot and the obstacle may further explain observed recovery strategies but the relationship between such contextual elements and strategy selection has not been explored. In this study, we investigated whether perturbation onset, duration and side could explain strategy selection for all of <b>swing</b> <b>phase.</b> We hypothesized that perturbations of longer duration would elicit lowering and delayed-lowering strategies earlier in <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> than shorter perturbations. We developed a custom device to trip subjects multiple times while they walked on a treadmill. Seven young, healthy subjects were tripped on the left or right side at 10 % to 80 % of <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> for 150 ms, 250 ms or 350 ms. Strategies were characterized by foot motion post-perturbation and identified by an automated algorithm. A multinomial logistic model was used to investigate the effect of perturbation onset, side, and the interaction between duration and onset on recovery strategy selection. Side perturbed did not affect strategy selection. Perturbation duration interacted with onset, limiting the use of elevating strategies to earlier in <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> with longer perturbations. The choice between delayed-lowering and lowering strategies was not affected by perturbation duration.

30|$|Delayed peak {{joint angle}} timing was also {{detected}} {{during the initial}} <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> (62 – 75  % of gait cycle). In this phase, delayed timing was noted when the knee and ankle joints transferred from extended to flexed and dorsiflexed to plantarflexed positions, respectively. The initial <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> begins when the foot leaves the ground and continues until maximum knee flexion occurs (Perry and Burnfield 2010). Knee flexion is essential in lifting the foot for swing limb advancement and to facilitate foot clearance during the initial <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> (Nene et al. 1999). Indeed, diminished knee flexion during the initial <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> is associated with knee stiffness during walking (Goldberg et al. 2003). Moreover, elderly individuals appear to produce less isokinetic ankle plantarflexion during walking (Silder et al. 2008), have a more limited range of motion at the knee joint (Kirkwood et al. 2007), and exhibit poorer propulsion during the push-off period {{as a product of}} smaller plantarflexor torques (Cho et al. 2004). In addition, Ko et al. (2011) reported that elderly women exhibit poorer capacity to advance the swing limb forwards during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase,</b> as a product of less generative mechanical work expenditure from the knee joint. In a report from Shin et al. (2012), there was a significant correlation between muscle strength and gait variability at the knee joint. Accordingly, it can be suggested that the delayed peak angle timings observed during the initial <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> at the knee and ankle joints are a product of knee stiffness, a reduction in push-off torque, less power to lift the limb, and deteriorating muscle strength with age.|$|R

In this paper, genetic algorithm (GA) and its variant multi-objective GA (MOGA) is used to perform the search operation for the ‘best’ spring parameters for the SBO spring mounted on an average sized subject simulated in the sagittal plane.

The single support phase was defined as the period of time during which the opposite foot was lifted for <b>swing</b> <b>phase,</b> whilst the double support phase was defined as the period when both feet were in contact with the floor. The gait cycle was defined as the time interval between 2 successive occurrences of 1 repetitive event of walking.|$|R
40|$|A therapy which {{coordinates}} neuromuscular {{electrical stimulation}} (NMES) of the ankle flexor muscle to robotic treadmill training (RTT) {{was developed for}} a rodent model of spinal cord injury (SCI) to investigate how such a therapy could help rehabilitate stepping which is impaired after SCI. Changes in EMG burst activity were measured to assess the effects of NMES+RTT therapy on neuromotor control and were compared {{to the effects of}} RTT alone. In particular, changes in the involvement of the tibialis anterior (TA) ankle flexor were assessed in the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> of the gait cycle. The results shows that applying stimulation to the TA during the initial portion of <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> during treadmill training encouraged spinal cord injured rats to flex their ankles during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> during testing. These results demonstrate one way in which NMES+RTT can be used to promote motor learning and rehabilitation of steppin...|$|R
40|$|During walking, {{a change}} in speed is {{accomplished}} by varying {{the duration of the}} stance <b>phase,</b> while the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> remains relatively invariant. To determine if this asymmetry in the control of locomotor cycles is an inherent property of the spinal central pattern generator (CPG), we recorded episodes of fictive locomotion in decerebrate cats with or without a complete spinal transection (acute or chronic). During fictive locomotion, stance and <b>swing</b> <b>phases</b> typically correspond to extension and flexion phases, respectively. The extension and flexion phases were determined by measuring the duration of extensor and flexor bursts, respectively. In the vast majority of locomotor episodes, cycle period varied more with the extension phase. This was found without phasic sensory feedback, supraspinal structures, pharmacology or sustained stimulation. We conclude that the control of walking speed is governed by an asymmetry within the organization of the spinal CPG, which can be modified by extraneous factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{mechanically}} evoke a triceps surae stretch reflex during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> of running, in order to study its within-the-step phase dependency. Seven participants ran on a treadmill at 2. 8 m. s- 1 wearing an exoskeletoncapable of evoking a sudden ankle dorsiflexion. We measured the electromyographic activity of the soleus, medial and lateral gastrocnemii just after the perturbation to evaluate the triceps surae stretch reflex. Similar perturbations were also delivered at rest. Our results showed that the stretch reflex was suppressed during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> of running, except in late swing where a late reflex response was observed. At rest, all triceps surae muscles showed an early reflex response to stretch. Our findings suggest that the triceps surae short/medium-latency stretch reflex cannot be evoked during <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> and thus cannot contribute to the control of the locomotor pattern after aperturbation during this phase...|$|R
40|$|Individual muscle {{function}} during single {{stance and}} <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> of gait {{were analyzed using}} muscle driven forward simulation. The activation of each of 22 muscles in a musculoskeletal model with seven degrees of freedom {{were excluded from the}} forward simulation and the resulting changes in joint angles studied. A classification of muscle function during single support and <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> of gait is presented. Altered joint kinematics due to the absence of individual muscle action is discussed in the light of pathological gait kinematics and clinical decision-making. status: publishe...|$|R
