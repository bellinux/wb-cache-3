25|$|The bony labyrinth, or osseous labyrinth, is {{the network}} of {{passages}} with bony walls lined with <b>periosteum.</b> The membranous labyrinth runs inside of the bony labyrinth. There is a layer of perilymph fluid between them. The three parts of the bony labyrinth are the vestibule of the ear, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea.|$|E
25|$|Intramembranous {{ossification}} mainly {{occurs during}} {{formation of the}} flat bones of the skull but also the mandible, maxilla, and clavicles; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as mesenchyme tissue rather than from cartilage. The process includes: {{the development of the}} ossification center, calcification, trabeculae formation and the development of the <b>periosteum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} bone {{tissue is}} no longer present but the calcium phosphate mineralisation has preserved the structure of original bone cells, showing individual osteocytes including their inner hollow spaces and the canaliculi. Also the internal blood vessels of the bone have been preserved, in some cases still empty inside. On some bones, {{including some of the}} skull and lower jaws, the <b>periosteum</b> is still visible.|$|E
25|$|Skeletal {{muscle is}} {{arranged}} in discrete muscles, {{an example of}} which is the biceps brachii. The tough, fibrous epimysium of skeletal muscle is both connected to and continuous with the tendons. In turn, the tendons connect to the <b>periosteum</b> layer surrounding the bones, permitting the transfer of force from the muscles to the skeleton. Together, these fibrous layers, along with tendons and ligaments, constitute the deep fascia of the body.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{tension on}} the tendons, ligaments, and joint {{capsules}} of the pastern area can strain the <b>periosteum.</b> The body compensates by growing bone at the stresspoint. Strain on the extensor tendon, the superficial digital flexor tendon branches, the collateral ligaments, and the distal sesamoidean ligaments are all common factors. If these tissues are stretched or torn, and the joint is instabilized by the injury, new bone is produced to help to stabilize the joint.|$|E
25|$|Potentially {{damaging}} mechanical, thermal, {{and chemical}} stimuli are detected by nerve endings called nociceptors, which {{are found in}} the skin, on internal surfaces such as the <b>periosteum,</b> joint surfaces, and in some internal organs. The concentration of nociceptors varies throughout the body; they are found in greater numbers in the skin than in deep internal surfaces. Some nociceptors are unspecialized free nerve endings that have their cell bodies outside the spinal column in the dorsal root ganglia. Nociceptors are categorized according to the axons which travel from the receptors to the spinal cord or brain.|$|E
25|$|A growth {{center is}} located in the head of each mandibular condyle before an {{individual}} reaches maturity. This growth center consists of hyaline cartilage underneath the <b>periosteum</b> on the articulating surface of the condyle. This is the last growth center of bone in the body and is multidirectional in its growth capacity, unlike a typical long bone. This area of cartilage within the bone grows in length by appositional growth as the individual grows to maturity. Over time, the cartilage is replaced by bone, using endochondral ossification. This mandibular growth center in the condyle allows the increased length of the mandible needed for the larger permanent teeth, {{as well as for the}} larger brain capacity of the adult. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face, and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. When an individual reaches full maturity, the growth center of bone within the condyle has disappeared.|$|E

There is a vascular layer between the rhamphotheca and the deeper layers of the dermis, which is attached directly to the <b>periosteum</b> of the bones of the beak. The rhamphotheca grows continuously in most birds, and in some species, the colour varies seasonally.|$|E
500|$|The sail of Dimetrodon {{is formed}} by {{elongated}} neural spines projecting from the vertebrae. Each spine varies in cross-sectional shape from its base to its tip {{in what is}} known as [...] "dimetrodont" [...] differentiation. Near the vertebra body, the spine cross section is laterally compressed into a rectangular shape, and closer to the tip, it takes on a figure-eight shape as a groove runs along either side of the spine. The figure-eight shape is thought to reinforce the spine, preventing bending and fractures. A cross section of the spine of one specimen of Dimetrodon giganhomogenes is rectangular in shape but preserves figure-eight shaped rings close to its center, indicating that the shape of spines may change as individuals age. The microscopic anatomy of each spine varies from base to tip, indicating where it was embedded in the muscles of the back and where it was exposed as part of a sail. The lower or proximal portion of the spine has a rough surface that would have served as an anchoring point for the epaxial muscles of the back, and also has a network of connective tissues called Sharpey's fibers that indicate it was embedded within the body. Higher up on the distal (outer) portion of the spine, the bone surface is smoother. The <b>periosteum,</b> a layer of tissue surrounding the bone, is covered in small grooves that presumably supported the blood vessels that vascularized the sail.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the width}} of the {{mandible}} is less than 1cm, the jaw loses its endosteal blood supply. [...] Instead, the blood supply comes largely from the <b>periosteum.</b> [...] Open reduction (which normally strips the <b>periosteum</b> during the dissection) can lead to avascular necrosis. [...] In these cases, oral surgeons sometimes opt for external fixation, closed reduction, supraperiosteal dissection or other techniques to maintain the periosteal blood flow.|$|E

The lacerum portion is still considered 'extra-dural', as it is surrounded by <b>periosteum</b> and fibrocartilage along its course. The vidian artery arises from the lacerum segment, though it is often {{too small to be}} angioraphically visible. It is erroneously stated in several anatomy text books that the internal carotid artery passes through the foramen lacerum. This at best has only ever been a partial truth in that it passes through the superior part of the foramen {{on its way to the}} cavernous sinus. As such it does not traverse the skull through it. The inferior part of the foramen is actually filled with fibrocartilage. The broad consensus is that the internal carotid artery should not be described as travelling through the foramen lacerum.|$|E
2500|$|Family {{physicians}} and orthopedists rarely see a malignant bone tumor (most bone tumors are benign). The route to osteosarcoma diagnosis usually {{begins with an}} X-ray, continues {{with a combination of}} scans (CT scan, PET scan, bone scan, MRI) and ends with a surgical biopsy. A characteristic often seen in an X-ray is [...] Codman's triangle, which is basically a subperiosteal lesion formed when the <b>periosteum</b> is raised due to the tumor. Films are suggestive, but bone biopsy is the only definitive method to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign.|$|E

[...] The anterior sacrococcygeal ligament is an extension of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) that run down the anterior side of the vertebral bodies. [...] Its irregular fibers blend with the <b>periosteum.</b> [...] The posterior sacrococcygeal ligament has a deep and a superficial part, the former is a flat band corresponding to the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) and the latter corresponds to the ligamenta flava. [...] Several other ligaments complete the foramen of the last sacral nerve.|$|E
2500|$|An ulcer ( [...] ; from Latin ulcus, [...] "ulcer, sore") is a {{break in}} the skin or mucous {{membrane}} with loss of surface tissue and the disintegration and necrosis of epithelial tissue. A mucosal ulcer is an ulcer which specifically occurs on a mucous membrane. An ulcer is a tissue defect which has penetrated the epithelial-connective tissue border, with its base at a deep level in the submucosa, or even within muscle or <b>periosteum.</b> An ulcer is a deeper breach of the epithelium than an erosion or an excoriation, and involves damage to both epithelium and lamina propria.|$|E
2500|$|Direct trauma, such as from an {{interference}} {{injury or}} a kick from another horse, {{is a common}} causes of splints. The <b>periosteum</b> is damaged by the trauma, and the horse's body lays down new bone in the injured area. Splints caused by trauma are more commonly seen lower down the leg than ones caused by strain. The splints may occur in a front leg or hind, in one leg or both. Severe enough trauma can fracture the splint bone. [...] If minimally displaced, and in the lower portion, some heal well. [...] Others may need surgical removal of {{a portion of the}} damaged splint bone.|$|E
2500|$|Because the splint bone {{does have}} some {{mobility}} independent of the cannon bone, it can cause tension and strain on the <b>periosteum</b> of the splint bone where the interosseous ligament attaches. The horse will then lay down new bone and the area will become inflamed. [...] "Blind splints" [...] are named because the bony reaction happens on the inside border between the splint bone and cannon bone, where {{it can not be}} seen, and is usually not palpable. Besides causing pain as any active splint reaction can, the swelling can impinge on the suspensory ligament. This condition is difficult to diagnose, but ultrasound is generally diagnostic. [...] MRI and CT also show these well.|$|E
2500|$|When a {{fracture}} {{occurs in the}} tooth bearing portion of the mandible, {{whether or not it}} is dentate or edentulous will affect treatment. [...] Wiring of the teeth helps stabilize the fracture (either during placement of osteosynthesis or as a treatment by itself), so the lack of teeth will guide treatment. [...] When an edentulous mandible (no teeth) is less than 1cm in height (as measured on panoramic radiograph or CT scan) addition risks apply because the blood flow from the marrow (endosseous) is minimal and the healing bone must rely on blood supply from the <b>periosteum</b> surrounding the bone. [...] If {{a fracture}} occurs in a child with mixed dentition different treatment protocols are needed.|$|E
2500|$|Bone {{tissue is}} a hard tissue, a type of dense {{connective}} tissue. [...] It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. [...] Bone tissue {{is made up of}} different types of bone cells. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called ossein and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. Bone tissue is a mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, <b>periosteum,</b> nerves, blood vessels and cartilage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hard outer}} layer of bones is {{composed}} of cortical bone also called compact bone. Cortical referring to the outer (cortex) layer. The hard outer layer gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human skeleton. Cortical bone consists of multiple microscopic columns, each called an osteon. Each column is multiple layers of osteoblasts and osteocytes around a central canal called the haversian canal. Volkmann's canals at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a <b>periosteum</b> on its outer surface, and an endosteum on its inner surface. The endosteum is {{the boundary between the}} cortical bone and the cancellous bone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{outer surface}} of the beak {{consists}} of a thin horny sheath of keratin called the rhamphotheca, which can be subdivided into the rhinotheca of the upper mandible and the gnathotheca of the lower mandible. This covering arises from the Malpighian layer of the bird's epidermis, growing from plates {{at the base of}} each mandible. There is a vascular layer between the rhamphotheca and the deeper layers of the dermis, which is attached directly to the <b>periosteum</b> of the bones of the beak. The rhamphotheca grows continuously in most birds, and in some species, the color varies seasonally. In some alcids, such as the puffins, parts of the rhamphotheca are shed each year after the breeding season, while some pelicans shed a part of the bill called a [...] "bill horn" [...] that develops in the breeding season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent to}} which cranial bones are able to move is {{considered}} controversial and studies of the existence and degree of cranial motion have yielded mixed findings. Cranial sutures are {{the areas in which}} the eight cranial bones are joined. During infancy, the cranial bones are not rigidly fused to each other, but are instead bound together by a membrane known as a fontanelle where two sutures join. Between the first and second year of life, the cranial bones begin to move together and fuse as a normal part of development. Studies examining the age of the closure of the cranial sutures have reported mixed findings. Closure has been reported to occur during adolescence while other studies indicate greater individual variability in the timing of this closure with fusion of the lambdoid suture, sagittal suture, and coronal sutures taking place in the fourth decade of life, but complete fusion of all sutures not occurring until advanced age (the eighth decade of life has been reported); some studies have found that the sutures never rigidly fuse. According to Gray's Anatomy, [...] "hen such sutures are tied by sutural ligament and <b>periosteum,</b> almost complete immobility results".|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, {{a partial}} Camarasaurus grandis {{skeleton}} was discovered at the Bryan Small Stegosaurus Quarry of the Morrison Formation near Canon City, Colorado. This specimen preserved a partial right humerus catalogued as DMNH 2908 {{as well as}} associated vertebrae from the back and tail. In 2001, Lorie McWhinney, Kenneth Carpenter, and Bruce Rothschild published {{a description of a}} pathology observed on the humerus. They noted a juxtacortical lesion 25 by 18cm wide made of bone that resembled woven fibers. Although woven bone forms in accessory dental bone, in other locations it is a sign of injury or illness. The woven bone's [...] "undulating fibrous bundles" [...] were observed oriented {{in the direction of the}} M. brachialis. The lesion's [...] and lack of porosity at its near and far ends indicate the periostitis was inactive or healed. McWhinney and the other researchers argued that this injury would have been a continuous source of hardship for the animal. It would have exerted pressure on the muscles. This pressure would have compressed the muscles' blood vessels and nerves, reducing the range of motion of both the limb's flexor and extensor muscles. This effect would have hindered the M. brachialis, M. brachoradialis, and to a lesser degree the M. biceps brachii to the lesion's position on the humerus. The researchers inferred that the inflammation of the muscles and <b>periosteum</b> would have caused additional complications in the lower region of the forelimb as well. The lesion would also have caused long-term fasciitis and myosistis. The cumulative effect of these pathological processes would have moderate to severe effects on the ability of the limb to move and [...] "made everyday activities such as foraging for food and escaping predators harder to accomplish." ...|$|E

6000|$|In various breeds of the fowl {{the males}} and females often differ greatly; and these {{differences}} are {{far from being the}} same with those which distinguish the two sexes of the parent-species, the Gallus bankiva; and consequently have originated under domestication. In certain sub-varieties of the Game race we have the unusual case of the hens differing from each other more than the cocks. In an Indian breed of a white colour shaded with black, the hens invariably have black skins, and their bones are covered by a black <b>periosteum,</b> whilst the cocks are never or most rarely thus characterised. Pigeons offer a more interesting case; for throughout the whole great family the two sexes do not often differ much; and the {{males and females}} of the parent-form, the C. livia, are undistinguishable: yet we have seen that with pouters the male has the characteristic quality of pouting more strongly developed than the female; and in certain sub-varieties the males alone are spotted or striated with black, or otherwise differ in colour. When male and female English carrier-pigeons are exhibited in separate pens, the difference {{in the development of the}} wattle over the beak and round the eyes is conspicuous.

6000|$|Many facts {{support this}} view of the {{independent}} life of each minute element of the body. Virchow insists that a single bone-corpuscle or a single cell in the skin may become diseased. The spur of a cock, after being inserted into the ear of an ox, lived for eight years, and acquired a weight of 396 grammes (nearly fourteen ounces), and the astonishing length of twenty-four centimetres, or about nine inches; so that the head of the ox appeared to bear three horns. (27/37. See Prof. Mantegazza's interesting work 'Degli innesti Animali' etc. Milano 1865 page 51 tab. 3.) The tail of a pig has been grafted into the middle of its back, and reacquired sensibility. Dr. Ollier (27/38. 'De la Production Artificielle des Os' page 8.) inserted a piece of <b>periosteum</b> from the bone of a young dog under the skin of a rabbit, and true bone was developed. A multitude of similar facts could be given. The frequent presence of hairs and of perfectly developed teeth, even teeth of the second dentition, in ovarian tumours (27/39. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. des Anomalies' tome 2 pages 549, 560, 562; Virchow ibid page 484. Lawson Tait 'The Pathology of Diseases of the Ovaries' 1874 pages 61, 62.), are facts leading to the same conclusion. Mr. Lawson Tait refers to a tumour in which [...] "over 300 teeth were found, resembling in many respects milk-teeth;" [...] and to another tumour, [...] "full of hair which had grown and been shed from one little spot of skin not bigger than the tip of my little finger. The amount of hair in the sac, had it grown from a similarly sized area of the scalp, would have taken almost a lifetime to grow and be shed." ...|$|E
60|$|Section 68. We {{now come}} to Bone, a tissue {{confined}} to the vertebrata, and typically shown only in the higher types. As we descend in the scale from birds and mammals to lizards, amphibia (frogs and toads) and fish, we find cartilage continually more important, and the bony constituent of the skeleton correspondingly less so. In such a type as the dog-fish, the skeleton is entirely cartilaginous, bone only occurs {{in connection with the}} animal's scales; it must have been in connection with scales that bone first appeared in the vertebrate sub-kingdom. In the frog we have a cartilaginous skeleton overlaid by numerous bony scutes (shield-like plates) which, when the student comes to study that type, he will perceive are equivalent to the bony parts of such scales as occur in the dog-fish, sunk inward, and plating over the cartilage; and in the frog the cartilage also is itself, in a few places, replaced by bony tissue. In the adult rabbit these two kinds of bone, the bone overlying what was originally cartilage (membrane bone), and the bone replacing the cartilage (cartilage bone) have, between them, practically superseded the cartilage altogether. The structure of the most characteristic kind of bone will be understood by reference to Figure XVI. It is a simplified diagram of the transverse section of such a bone as the thigh bone. M.C. is the central marrow cavity, H.v., H.v. are cross sections of small bloodvessels, the Haversian vessels running more or less longitudinally through, the bone in canals, the Haversian canals. Arranged round these vessels are circles of the formative elements, the bone corpuscles or osteoblasts (b.c.) each embedded in bony matrix in a little bed, the lacuna, and communicating one with another by fine processes through canaliculi in the matrix, which processes are only to be seen clearly in decalcified bone (See Section 70). The osteoblasts are arranged in concentric series, and the matrix is therefore in concentric layers, or lamellae (c.l.). Without and within the zone of Haversian systems are (o.l. and i.l.), the outer and inner lamellae. The bone is surrounded by connective tissue, the <b>periosteum.</b> In addition to this compact bone, there is a lighter and looser variety in which spicules and bars of bony tissue are loosely interwoven. Many flat bones, the bones of the skull, for instance, consist of this spongy bone, plated (as an electro spoon is plated) with compact bone.|$|E
60|$|It is notorious, and {{we shall}} {{immediately}} adduce proofs, that increased use or action strengthens muscles, glands, sense-organs, etc.; and that disuse, on the other hand, weakens them. It has been experimentally proved by Ranke (24/12. 'Die Blutvertheilung, etc. der Organe' 1871 as quoted by Jaeger 'In Sachen Darwin's' 1874 page 48. See also H. Spencer 'The Principles of Biology' volume 2 1866 chapters 3-5.) that {{the flow of blood}} is greatly increased towards any part which is performing work, and sinks again when the part is at rest. Consequently, if the work is frequent, the vessels increase in size and the part is better nourished. Paget (24/13. 'Lectures on Pathology' 1853 volume 1 page 71.) also accounts for the long, thick, dark-coloured hairs which occasionally grow, even in young children, near old-standing inflamed surfaces or fractured bones by an increased flow of blood to the part. When Hunter inserted the spur of a cock into the comb, which is well supplied with blood-vessels, it grew in one case spirally to a length of six inches, and in another case forward, like a horn, so that the bird could not touch the ground with its beak. According to the interesting observations of M. Sedillot (24/14. 'Comptes Rendus' September 26, 1864 page 539.), when a portion of one of the bones of the leg of an animal is removed, the associated bone enlarges till it attains a bulk equal to that of the two bones, of which it has to perform the functions. This is best exhibited in dogs in which the tibia has been removed; the companion bone, which is naturally almost filiform and not one-fifth the size of the other, soon acquires a size equal to or greater than that of the tibia. Now, it is at first difficult to believe that increased weight acting on a straight bone could, by alternately increasing and diminishing the pressure, cause the blood to flow more freely in the vessels which permeate the <b>periosteum</b> and thus supply more nutriment to the bone. Nevertheless the observations adduced by Mr. Spencer (24/15. H. Spencer 'The Principles of Biology' volume 2 page 243.), on the strengthening of the bowed bones of rickety children, along their concave sides, leads to the belief that this is possible.|$|E
