25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the factory level. These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive <b>plastic</b> <b>ribbon</b> with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an elastomeric connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E

The contribution of autotrophic biomass decreased as total biomass increased over the time. Mean periphytic ash free dry weight ranged from 0. 8 to 5. 6 mgcm− 2, but periphyton chlorophyll a concentrations presented shorter amplitudes, which oscillated from 0. 12 to 0. 44 μgcm− 2 throughout the experiment. Periphyton metabolism was overall heterotrophic on all substrates, especially on senescent leaves. Our data show that substrate type influenced both biomass accrual and periphyton net productivity and respiration rates throughout periphyton development and highlighted the dominance of heterotrophic metabolism.

40|$|Ballard’s complex {{evocation}} of the spaces of Concrete Island (1974) belies {{the simplicity of the}} structures that surround them. Before the construction of the Westway in the late 1960 s the huge motorway intersection was shown as a smooth <b>plastic</b> <b>ribbon</b> laid atop the grittiness of run down and densely occupied 19 th century housing of North Kensington. The spaces between were not considered. But Concrete Island celebrates this disappearing domain by tracing out fragments of its history, drawing an archaeology, but also expanding the ways that architectural spaces may be understood by paying attention to their sensual qualities. This paper examines the ways that the spaces of Concrete Island can be understood in the context of Rosalind Krauss’s concept of the expanded field, and suggests that considering the novel {{as an example of the}} expanded field helps us to pay attention to ‘spaces between’. Situated at a very specific moment of change, in the arts and in technological advances, Ballard looks backwards and forwards in time, and questions the stability of time and place. By taking de Certeau’s understanding of the detailed movements of pedestrians in the city as analogous with writing, I seek to develop a way forward to the production of drawn responses that acknowledge this expanding field. My argument focuses on Ballard’s metaphorical use of tactile, material qualities, demonstrating how rapid changes in the environment may be felt through his representation of the grass that thrives in between the giant structures of the Westway and M 4 motorways. By reference to historical and contemporary writing on the psychogeographic affects associated with walking through the urban environment, I reveal how Ballard tells the story of a destabilised understanding of place that is, all the same, responsive to human intervention...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Studies to {{identify}} the environmental factors that influence the rate of ectotrophic mycelial growth of Phellinus weirii (Murr.) Gilbertson along Douglas-fir roots were undertaken both in the laboratory and in the field. The effects of soil pH, nitrogen, moisture, temperature, microorganisms and bulk density were investigated. In the lab, the rates of ectotrophic mycelial growth from Alnus inoculum blocks onto 1. 5 cm diameter Douglas-fir branch sections, glass rods and wood dowels buried in 475 cm³ soil tubes filled with autoclaved, pasteurized or untreated forest soils were compared. Maximum ectotrophic mycelial growth occurred along Douglas-fir branches. The rates of growth along Douglas-fir branches were similar in autoclaved, pasteurized and untreated soils, but the fungus only grew profusely into the sterilized soils. Ectotrophic mycelial growth averaged 9. 0 cm after 25 days. Penetration of the pith from the cut end of the branch section occurred more rapidly than penetration through the xylem. Ectotrophic mycelial growth of P. weirii was greatest at 15 % soil water content. Maximum growth occurred at 20 - 25 C. Field inoculations {{to determine the effects}} of soil environment on the rate of ectotrophic mycelial growth of P. weirii were performed in two Douglas-fir plantations on the east side of the Oregon Coast Range, near Corvallis, Oregon. Roots were inoculated by tying inoculum blocks to living roots, and test treatments were produced by altering the soil around inoculated roots. After one year, the roots were removed and inoculation success and ectotrophic mycelial growth were measured. Ectotrophic mycelium was observed on 58 % of the inoculated roots. However, on 10 % of the roots, the fungus failed to grow beyond the <b>plastic</b> <b>ribbon</b> that was wrapped around the inoculation area. The majority of ectotrophic mycelial growth appeared to have taken place during the first few months after inoculation. Although ectotrophic growth was dramatically enhanced in the vicinity of the wounds, the rate of growth away from the wound area was not significantly affected (90 % confidence). Penetration of the fungus into the root was observed in 53 % of the successful inoculations. P. weirii was isolated from the phloem of 24 % of these roots. Colonization of roots was markedly enhanced by root wounding. The average total extent of P. weirii along inoculated roots, where any growth had occurred, was 15. 5 cm. However, variation was high, so conclusions must be tentative. Soil pasteurization and elevated soil temperatures markedly decreased inoculation success. In contrast, changes in soil pH, moisture and bulk density had relatively little effect. The extent of P. weirii growth along inoculated roots decreased with changes in soil pH, moisture and nitrogen levels, both above and below ambient levels. Relatively little change was associated with pasteurization, compaction and temperature treatments...|$|E

Infectious disease accounts for nearly 50 million illness incidences around the world. Applications of lab on chip devices in conducting biomedical research have been drawn substantial interests from scientists and researchers all over the world. These lab-on-achip systems create clinically useful technologies and {{have a number of}} competitive advantages over the conventional biomedical instruments due to the reduced reagents/samples consumption, decreased analysis times and operational costs. In addition, these systems facilitate the development of the portable devices and the possibility of automatically performing multiple assay processes. Early detection and notification of pathogenic bacteria, is therefore of considerable significance in disease control. DNA-based amplification technique, known as a precise diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens, has presented a distinctive advantages over the conventional microbiological culture-based methods for pathogen detection such as high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity, especially in the detection of bacteria in samples containing low concentrations. over the past decade, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has caught significant attention as it is provides rapid amplification with high sensitivity and specificity of the target gene. In this thesis, various lab on a chip based platforms have been developed combining DNA LAMP amplification for detection and quantification of pathogens. In the first part, a microfluidic device designed for amplification of malB gene of E. coli bacteria followed by electrochemical detection of the amplified product. Through amplification time optimization, microfluidic chip could detect and quantify 48 cfu/ml of bacteria in 35 min employing immobilisation-free electrochemical transduction. In the second part of thesis, we have invented a cassette device for high throughput detection of various bacteria types (gram negative &# 38; gram positive). The cassette consists of two aluminum reels and a <b>plastic</b> <b>ribbon,</b> which has an array of chambers. one reel act as the provider of ribbon whilst the other one act as collector. The collector reel is connected to a heater to provide adequate temperatures for the amplification. LAMP solutions with E. coli (as gram negative model for bacteria) was applied to each reservoir and a plastic tape cover the chambers and rolls into the collector reel. After 1 hour - amplification of E. coli was detected using a colorimetric method employing Hydronaphthol blue (HNB) with a 30 CFU/ml limit of detection. The color of HNB changed from purple to blue in the presence of bacterial amplified product. Through procedure modification we were able to detect as low as 200 CFU/ml of S. aureus as an example gram-positive bacteria using Calcein. In the third part of thesis, the cassette’s ribbon has been modified by using flexible screen-printed electrode attached at the bottom of each chamber. Using Osmium redox and immobilisation-free of electrochemical technique, we could monitor the amplification of DNA of E. coli and S. aureus bacteria in a real-time analysis and quantification. In the forth part of thesis, a novel biosensor platform has been developed to detect the viability of bacteria using T 4 bacteriophage and label free impedance spectroscopy. We have shown that we could monitor viability of bacteria in the range of 103 - 109 CFU/ml, while using LAMP amplification and linear sweep voltammetry technique we could detect 102 CFU/ml within 40 min response time. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, we summarize our findings, and provide contribution of these researches to the knowledge as well as health.

Na osnovi nalaza keramike i metalnih predmeta naselje se datira u stupanj Br C i D, s nešto elemenata Ha A. Naselje je kulturno srodno drugim nalazištima grupe Barice - Gređani i Virovitica. The village Mačkovac is {{situated}} on the left, Croatian bank of the Sava River, approximately 15 km south of Nova Gradiška. It was first mentioned in the literature already {{at the end of}} the 19 th century, parallel to a hoard of bronze artifacts found at the Klupko site (Ilić-Oriovčanin, 1874; Ljubić, 1889). This was the first in a series of hoards found in the neighboring area. It was published in 1973 (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 73), along with the hoard from the neighboring village Siče (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 95). The third hoard from this area, from Dolina on the Sava, was published by Schauer in 1974. The locality {{is situated}} 1 km north of the village, on a site called Crišnjevi, 92 m above sea level, thus topping a floodplain at 90 m above sea level. It covers approximately 2 hectares of land. On its southern side it is defined by the natural depression called Prišnjica, in which water accumulates throughout most of the year, making access to the settlement difficult. In the surrounding area there are a few other sites with Late Bronze Age pottery. In the vicinity there are two more sites, Glavičica with tumuli, and the Late Bronze Age settlement Babine Grede. In 1985 another hoard was uncovered on Crišnjevi (Karavanić and Mihaljević, 2001), which brought about trial excavations in 1997. Its interesting results contributed to the continuation of excavations. Up to the present day, 323 m 2 have been investigated. Over the years many pottery objects, animal remains, a human tooth (verbal communication by M. Šlaus) and several bronze objects were unearthed. Three layers can be distinguished at the site. The surface layer consists of humus damaged by plowing, with pottery and daub finds. Beneath this comes a dark brown, almost black clay layer with plenty of daub, pottery and charcoal, representing a cultural deposit settled in the area outside or above the settlement facilities. On the bottom there is a layer with many animal bones and coal. On Crišnjevi no remains of above-ground houses were uncovered, but only of smaller furnaces. One furnace has a regular oval ground plan, with two layers of a 20 cm thick clay coat, whereas others were made of a substruction of pottery fragments and a 2 - 3 cm thick clay coat. Above the furnace with the thicker coat there was an implosion made of daub fragments and parts of furnace. In the implosion a bronze ingot and a bellows nozzle (T. 2, 14) were found, and in the vicinity dross fragments as well, indicating metallurgical activity in this part of the settlement. In 2000 and 2001, a 15 cm thick stratum of hard, packed clay was unearthed above the bottom layer, on which there was a furnace (Fig. 2), as well as numerous heaps of pottery and daub fragments. The earth in this stratum was obviously leveled in order to create a surface for specific economic activities in the settlement; thus it might have been a house surface, within which there were smaller fireplaces and furnaces. In it only a limited number of finds was unearthed, only a few pottery and daub fragments. Considering the excavated surface, a relatively large number of metal objects was unearthed in Mačkovac. Those were mostly bronze needles. Thus regular sewing needles were found, as well as two needles with a biconical head (Vrdoljak, Mihaljević, 2000, Fig. 2, 1 - 6). Needles with a simple biconical head as well as those with a rounded head are simple, long-lasting utensils. Apart from a few exceptions, these needles cannot be used for accurate dating. In Moravia they were dated in early Urnfield culture, and in Hungary, in the hoards Romand and Velemszentvid, in late Urnfield culture. The needle (T. 4, 5) would correspond to the Deinsdorf type (Říhovský, 1979; Innerhofer 2000). Most similar to the needle from Mačkovac is that from grave-mound I, from a skeletal grave at the Velke Hosteradky site (Říhovský, 1963, 66, T. 1,; B 6). Similar needles were also found in the Polešovice hoard in Moravia (Salaš, 1997, T. 23, 574 - 577), where they were dated in late grave-mound culture and early Urnfield culture (Salaš, 1997, 40). Needles of the same type were also found at other localities in northern Croatia, e. g. in Ilok (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, 180, T. 19, 1 - 2), Bogdanovci (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 19, 3), and Slavonski Brod (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T 19, 4). These needles, along with other finds, correspond with the group of finds representing the Middle Bronze Age basis for the development of Urnfield culture and are dated into the end of the Middle Bronze Age and the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. Apart from those needles, there is also a needle from the Virovitica site (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 10, 10) that represents the Middle Bronze Age needle type with a nailshaped head which Teržan used as an argument for dating the beginning of the Virovitica group in the period Br B 2 -C (Teržan, 1995, 327). The most numerous group of finds in Mačkovac is pottery. The paper gives a selection of finds from all these years. Pot types found in Mačkovac are distributed over a large territory and in different Urnfield culture groups. Mostly we are dealing with pots with a rounded body and an everted rim, of different sizes, with one or two ribboned grips beneath the rim. Often they are decorated with a horizontal rib or a <b>plastic</b> <b>ribbon</b> with finger-prints (T. 1, 7), sometimes combined with a vertical ribbon, which is connected with the rim. The same forms of pots are found in the settlement Oloris (Dular, 2002), in Laminci near Bosanska Gradiška (Čović, 1983, 65 - 70, T 1; Đurđević, 1987, 50) and Saghegy (Patek, 1968). Interesting are pots decorated by clustered applications at the bottom (T. 3, 4), which are also found at the Laminci locality (Čović, 1983, 65 - 70). Such applied ornaments also occur in Transdanubia at the Gelsesziget site within the gravemound culture (Laszlo, 1994, 226), as well as at the Urnfield culture necropolis Voers-Battyani (Honti, 1993, 152, 155). Bowls are represented with a much richer repertoire of forms. Several varieties of rounded bowls with a flat rim (B 3 a, B 3 b, B 3 e) and one with an everted, horizontally flattened rim (B 3 d) were out. They occur in the early Urnfield culture settlements of Oloris (Dular, 2002) and Saghegy (Patek, 1968), as well as at the necropoli of Barice (Čović, 1958) and Mala Brusnica (Belić, 1963 - 1964). The bowl variety of rough manufacturing, with thicker walls and a flat bottom with vertical, horn-shaped protrusions (B 3 c) (T. 3, 2) has no closer analogies. Řihovsky mentions them in his work as an element of the grave-mound culture which was conveyed into early Urnfield culture, the Blučina-Kopčany horizon (Říhovský, 1982, 17, 42). Patek dates them as early as Br C and defines them as a form conveyed from gravemound culture (Patek, 1968, 102, T. 1, T. 6). Bowls with a broadly ribboned rim (B 6), a regular find on each necropolis of the Virovitica and Barice-Gređani groups, were also found in Mačkovac, and they appear in early Urnfield culture since Br C. Among them is also a fragment decorated with an oval knob in the interior (T. 3, 7). Deep bowls with a rounded (B 5 a) (T. 1, 1 - 2, 4 - 6; T. 4, 2, 4) or slightly biconical (B 5 b) (T. 1, 3; T. 4, 1, 3) belly account for more than a third of all bowls in Mačkovac and are the most remarkable vessels at the site. They were all reductionally baked, they may have one or two ribboned grips, the portion where the belly turns into the neck is accentuated by a shallow groove, and often their belly is decorated with oval, knob-shaped protrusions (German Buckel) surrounded by a groove. Similar bowls were found in the necropoli of the Barice-Gređani group (Minichreiter, 1982, T. 4, 6, 8, 15), the necropoli in the surroundings of Bjelovar (Majnarić-Pandžić, 1988, 18 - 23), in Virovitica and Sirova Katalena (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 8, 15), and Moravče near Sesvete (Sokol, 1996, Fig. 13, 14). Particularly interesting is the analogy of bowls from Vinkovci (Dimitrijević, 1979, 141) that opened a number of questions pertaining to their chronological and cultural position. It is a chance find, culturally determined already in 1966 (Dimitrijević, 1966, 68) as part of the Hatvanoid- Bebrin culture and dated into Br A 2 and Br A 3. The scientific literature leans on this opinion due to a lack of investigation (Dimitrijević, 1979; Čović, 1983), or refers to it as Brod culture (Petrović, 1970; Belić, 1968; Lozuk, 1993, 2000), persisting upon dating into the Early Bronze Age. Bosnian literature, after the excavation in Laminci, subscribes the earlier published finds to Urnfield culture (Čović, 1988; Đurđević, 1987). After having studied the materials preserved in the Brodsko Posavlje Museum and comparing them to all the published localities it can be concluded that we are dealing with pottery artifacts from a settlement which is notably related to those from the Mačkovac-Crišnjevi site and therefore chronologically classified as belonging to the end of the Middle Bronze Age and the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, concurrent with the Virovitica group and culturally belonging to the Barice-Gređani group. The preliminary analysis of metal and ceramic finds dates the settlement into the latest phases of Middle Bronze Age and the very beginning of the Late Bronze Age or the Virovitica group. To conclude, the settlement lasted from stage Br BC until stage Br D with a few elements of Ha A. The principal economic activities were farming and livestock breeding with occasional fishery, and there are also testimonies to metallurgic activity that took place near the furnaces. At present we cannot estimate how many inhabitants the settlement had since only a small area has been excavated, but it can be assumed that it was a smaller village community...|$|E

Na početku starijega željeznog doba primjetni su utjecaji s prostora dolenjske i grupe Martijanec - Kaptol, uz koje se povezuju slučajni nalazi fibula iz Vinkovaca i Orolika te pojava tumula u Starim Jankovcima, Ilači i Gabošu. Utjecaji ovih grupa kao i s prostora glasinačkoga kulturnoga kruga prisutni su i u mlađoj fazi starijega željeznog doba kojoj pripadaju ravna groblja s kosturnim ukopima srijemske kulture u Vinkovcima i Novim Jankovcima. U završnu fazu starijega željeznog doba datiraju se naselja Damića gradina u Starim Mikanovcima i Dirov brijeg u Vinkovcima koja predstavljaju najzapadnija do sada poznata nalazišta najmlađe faze bosutske kulture. Keramički nalazi s tih naselja ujedno dokumentiraju kulturnu i etničku osnovu koju su Kelti zatekli pri naseljavanju prostora srednjeg Podunavlja krajem 4. st. pr. Kr. The Early Iron Age {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{investigated}} and little known prehistoric periods in the region of Vinkovci, as well as in eastern Slavonia and western Srijem. On the territory of the town of Vinkovci and its surroundings, intensive rescue excavations were conducted in the past three decades, in which settlements and cemeteries were uncovered which enable a more clear cultural and chronological picture of the Early Iron Age in the broader south-Pannonian area (Fig. 1.). Apart from the results of the excavations, the understanding of the material heritage is supported by isolated and chance finds from the Early Iron Age, preserved in the City Museum in Vinkovci, {{as well as in the}} Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, on the basis of which it is possible to assume the continuous habitation of the area of Vinkovci and its surroundings from the very beginning of the Early Iron Age in the 8 th century BC up until the settlement of the Celts by the end of the 4 th century BC. The older phase of the Late Bronze Age in the Vinkovci area is marked by the Belegiš II culture, known on the basis of the excavations of settlements in Vinkovci and Privlaka. From the period of the younger phase of the Late Bronze Age only isolated finds are known, which do not make possible their clear cultural classification. Thus the basis for the coming period of the Early Iron Age, to whose initial phase the chance find of a fragment of a bronze fibula of the Vače type from Vinkovci is dated, remains unknown. According to the classification by S. Gabrovac, the Vinkovci fibula belongs to the type Va of two-looped arched fibulae with an iron core and a bronze coating. The dissemination center of those fibulae was in the areas of Bela Krajina, Dolenjska and Gorenjska. A fibula of the Vače type (type Vb) was found on the cemetery Lijeva bara in Vukovar in the skeleton grave 269, in which a man with a spear and a sharpening iron was buried, whose handle was fashioned in the Thraco- Cimmerian style. On the sites of the Martijanec-Kaptol group, those fibulae appear throughout the first horizon, belonging to the end of the 8 th and the beginning of the 7 th century BC, into which period the Vinkovci fibula should be dated as well. Two fibulae chance finds from the area of the village of Orolik testify to the existence of links between the Vinkovci area in the early phase of the Early Iron Age and the dissemination area of the Dolenjska and Martijanec-Kaptol groups. On the site Rajterovo Brdo a fragment of a bronze fibula with a boat-shaped arch was found, whose terminals are decorated with engraved lines (T. 1., 3), whereas on the neighboring site called Zadružno dvorište (Cooperative Yard) a small bronze boat-shaped fibula with a transversal rip on its arch was unearthed, which is also decorated with engravings (T. 1., 1). Boat-shaped fibulae with transversal rips are characteristic of the eastern Alpine-Pannonian Region, and they belong to the first half or the middle of the 7 th century BC. The fibula from Orolik can probably be dated into the same period. The existence of tumuli, uncovered already by the end of the 19 th century, and systematically recorded in the Vinkovci area in 1951, testify to the links of the eastern Slavonian and the Srijem regions with the dissemination area of the Martijanec-Kaptol group in the West during the early phase of the Early Iron Age. The largest group, consisting of five tumuli, was uncovered near Stari Jankovci, whereas one tumulus was registered between the villages Ostrovo and Gaboš, northwest from Vinkovci. In the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb objects from the destroyed earth tumulus in Ilača are preserved, in which an iron spear, a bronze knob as part of horse-riding equipment, a rounded wether-bell and a part of a doublethreaded wire were found. Considering the excavation results in Stari Jankovci, where cremation and possibly skeleton burials were registered, we should look for analogies in the first place within the framework of the neighboring Martijanec-Kaptol group. The find of a bronze knob as part of horse-riding equipment from the destroyed tumulus in Ilača testifies to the dating of eastern Slavonian and Srijem tumuli, dating the knob into the 8 th century BC, when on the right Danube bank a concentration of hoards containing horse-riding equipment is registered. The Dalj culture finds, uncovered in 1951 during the leveling of the southern part of the prehistoric multi-layer settlement on Tržnica (the Market) in the center of Vinkovci, belong to the earlier phase of the Early Iron Age. On this occasion, a pot with an S profiled body was unearthed with a striped grip and a shoulder decorated by vertically set cannelures divided into metopes. On the basis of the shape and the ornaments, the pot is classified as belonging to the Dalj culture and dated in the period from the year 700 until 600 BC. In trial excavations on the same site in 1962 in the surface strata new pottery finds of the Dalj culture were registered, collected also on Borinci near Jarmina. The early phase of the Early Iron Age in the Vinkovci area is represented by a larger number of sites (Fig. 1.), consisting of settlements as well as grave sites with skeleton burials, testifying to the complex ethnic and cultural activities going on in the region of southern Pannonia from the beginning of the 6 th century BC until the Celtic settlement at the end of the 4 th century BC. In the site Silos on Ervenica in the southeastern part of Vinkovci, in rescue excavations in 1972 two skeleton graves were unearthed. Grave 1 contained a woman’s burial with rich vaults representing Late Hallstatt I southern Pannonian costume, consisting of a bronze astragalar belt with 73 pieces preserved; a bronze Certosa fibula of the V group, decorated on its arch with the engraved motif of a firbranch; and a necklace with 24 beads. In grave 2 there was a biconical pot, which on the spot where the shoulder enters into the body is decorated with four knob-shaped protrusions, between which there are transversal cannelures. On the basis of vaults, the graves are dated into the devel- oped 5 th century BC and classified as belonging to the Srijem culture of the western Balkan cultural complex. A richly vaulted female burial, which according to its inventory completely corresponds to grave 1 from Ervenica, was found near Novi Jankovci during railway construction works in 1890. Of the vaults, 11 bronze pieces of the astragalar belt, a bronze Certosa fibula of the V group and 4 beads made of yellow glass paste were preserved. On the basis of the find of the astragalar belt, J. Brunšmid ascribes the burial from Novi Jankovci to a man, but other contemporaneous burials with astragalar belts in the area of southern Pannonia suggest that we are dealing with female burials with characteristically extraordinarily rich costumes. Graves from Vinkovci and Novi Jankovci are dated on the basis of Certosa fibulae of the V group, which was one of the leading forms in the 5 th century BC. On an unknown location in Vinkovci two astragalar belt pieces were found (T. 1., 8 - 9), whereas a fragment of another piece (T. 1., 4) was found during rescue excavations in Duga Street 23 in the center of Vinkovci. J. Brunšmid mentions a piece and a buckle of an astragalar belt with three loops and a fibula with two spirals and a plateshaped arch. The large number of chance finds of pieces of astragalar belts and other artifacts of the earlier phase of the Early Iron Age testify to the existence of a larger number of graves from this period on a couple of sites in Vinkovci. Chance finds of beads made of yellow glass paste with an ornamentation in the shape of a white-andblue eye-motif, found on Rajterovo brdo in Orolik (T. 1., 5 - 6) and in Vinkovački Banovci (T. 1., 7), most probably belong to the same period to which the graves from Ervenica and Novi Jankovci are dated. Graves from Ervenica and Novi Jankovci, as well as other chance finds from the same period from the Vinkovci area belong to the Srijem culture of the western Balkan cultural complex. Of particular significance for the understanding of the complex cultural and ethnic picture of the southern Pannonian area at the end of the Early Iron Age was the uncovering of the cemetery on the site of the department store Nama in the western, peripheral part of the multilayer prehistoric settlement on Tržnica in Vinkovci. In the rescue excavations in 1976 and 1977 eight skeletal burials and three horse burials were unearthed. In the graves of men, women and children bronze Certosa fibulae of the XIII group were found, as well as bronze and iron crossbow fibulae with a slightly bowed foot and a bronze fibula with a drum-shaped arch. An iron lance with a narrow web and a long sheath belongs to weapon finds. In grave 1 a bronze scepter was found, decorated with incised geometrical motifs. Among objects intended for every-day use there are finds of iron knives, whereas bracelets made of glass paste beads were worn around the neck. Vaults of pottery vessels were registered in the graves too, including a cantharus from grave 3 with a smoothed surface covered by miniature graphite particles. Burials of two horses contained parts of bronze horse-riding equipment. One piece of equipment consisted of bronze phalera produced in three sizes and of radially bowed parts of bronze metal sheet originating from the dissemination area of phase Early La Tène culture. The burial of the other horse contained forged bronze equipment with Thraco-Scythian characteristics, consisting of appliqués stylized in the shape of a griffin or a deer and of two polygonal sheets that served as metal fittings at rein endings. On the basis of the described vaults, the cemetery is dated into the late 5 th and the first half of the 4 th century BC, and it testifies to various influences from the territory of the lower Danube area and from the northern parts of the Pannonian Valley. The find of a bronze Certosa fibula of group XIII (T. 1., 2), found in 1977 on the southern part of the prehistoric tell Tržnica, is dated to the same period. The results of the rescue excavations of the prehistoric multi-layer settlement Damića gradina in Stari Mikanovci, conducted in 1980, are of particular importance for the understanding of the typology of pottery shapes of the younger phase of the Early Iron Age on the territory of eastern Slavonia and western Srijem. The greatest concentration of finds was registered in quadrant 20 and those surrounding it, where the remains of a house with a burned-down clay floor were found at 1. 40 m, in which there were pottery fragments laid as terrazzo. The house was destroyed in a vigorous fire, as evident from large lumps of burned daub, as well as from finds of pottery fragments which were almost totally misshaped due to exposure to high temperature. Among the most interesting finds from Damića gradina is certainly that of the bronze Dux fibula, for which there are no exact data as to the location and depth of the find. Since the La Tène culture settlement is dated into the younger stage of Middle La Tène phase and the Late La Tène phase, i. e. into the second half of the 2 nd and the 1 st century BC, the fibula most probably belongs to the Early Iron Age layer, which, used in conjunction with the analysis of pottery finds, plays a significant role in the final dating of the settlement. In order to determine a clear cultural and chronological position of the Early Iron Age settlement on Damića gradina, a detailed typological-statistical processing of all pottery finds was carried out, on the basis of which basic functional forms were isolated with their respective types and versions. In a descriptive analysis a total of 5, 109 fragments were processed, out of which number it was possible to define the functional form for 1, 361 (26. 64 %), whereas this was not possible with 3, 748 fragments (73. 36 %). When defining the typological table of functional forms, the basic criterion was sorting the forms based on the outline of the vessel, followed by the defining of the versions, which were sorted according to different rim shape and according to different decorating techniques (T. 2. - 4.). Out of 1, 361 distinct forms, 632 were pots (46. 44 %), 642 were bowls (47. 17 %), 22 canthari (1. 62 %), in one case a jug was registered (0. 07 %), and cups are represented with 34 samples (2. 50 %), whereas vessels of small dimensions with one grip were recognized as spoons and registered in 30 cases (2. 20 %). On Damića gradina 703 functional forms or fragments were sorted, which makes 13. 76 % of the total number of processed frag-ments, which are decorated in seven various decorating techniques appearing in different combinations on a single vessel. The largest number of forms and fragments is ornamented in the combination of the application of a <b>plastic</b> <b>ribbon,</b> on which fingerprints are applied (T. 2., 2, 5; T. 3., 4). Next come imprinting, engraving (T. 4., 4), appliqué, gouge (T. 4., 1) and modeling. The smallest number of forms and fragments is decorated with canneluring or a smoothed ornament (T. 2., 6). On the surface of a couple of fragments miniature graphite particles were registered. Characteristics similar to Damića gradina in selecting the position for constructing a settlement are also evident with Dirov brijeg in Vinkovci, where, during rescue excavations, pottery finds were unearthed which according to their forms and ornaments completely correspond with the finds from Damića gradina. Dirov brijeg is a prehistoric hillfort on the confluence of the Nevkoš Stream and the Bosut River. During rescue excavations in 1951 a fragment of a cup with a grip was found, on whose top there is a plastic protrusion decorated with a smoothed ornament (T. 1., 8). In conservation excavations in 1996 in J. Kozarca Street 74, which runs through the eastern part of Dirov brijeg, a trench was investigated, in whose filling, apart from plenty of La Tène pottery, pottery fragments were found which are dated into the younger phase of the Early Iron Age (T. 5.). A settlement form the Early Iron Age was uncovered in a survey in 1954 on the site Gradac, situated on the Bosut River near the village Podgrađe. It is a multi-layer settlement, from which a find of a cup with a rounded body and a grip with two plastic protrusions on the top is known (T. 1., 11). The find of a cup with an identically shaped grip is known from Gradina on Bosut, which is not surprising considering the fact that the settlement in Podgrađe is situated some ten kilometers to the west of the eponymous site of the Bosut culture. The comparatively closest functional forms and decorating techniques and motifs to pottery finds from Damića gradina and Dirov brijeg may be found on sites of the horizon of cannelured pottery in Srijem, i. e. phase III of the Bosut culture. This relates particularly to the rich and various pottery repertoire sorted in layers belonging to the settlement horizon Bosut IIIc of the eponymous Gradina on Bosut. In the youngest phases of the horizon IIIc fragments decorated with net-like or ribbon-like smoothed ornaments were registered, thus forming a base for the dating of identical fragments from Damića gradina and Dirov brijeg. Certain pottery forms may be compared to finds from other sites form the Early Iron Age in eastern Slavonia, as well as in a broader southeastern Alpine Pannonian area. Pottery finds from Damića gradina have numerous corresponding forms, decoration motifs and techniques in the finds from settlements in Osijek, as well as in the phases IIc and IIIa of Donja Dolina according to the classification by Z. Marić, i. e. with finds of the phases 3 a- 2 and 3 b according to the classification by B. Čović. Correspondences with certain forms from Damića gradina may be found on the hillfort Klinac southern from Petrinja, as well as the hillfort Kiringrad. Considering numerous described comparisons, the pottery finds from Damića gradina, Dirov brijeg and Gradac in Podgrađe can be dated into the younger phase of the Early Iron Age. The mentioned settlements according to the typological characteristics of pottery forms as well as decoration motifs and techniques belong to the dissemination area of the phase III of the Bosut culture, i. e. the horizon of cannelured pottery. In order to support the suggested dating of settlements we can take the finds of pots with a rounded body and the grips overtopping the rim (T. 4., 6), which have one or two differently shaped plastic protrusions on the top, out of which the two from Dirov brijeg are decorated with a smoothed ornament (T. 1., 8; T. 5., 8). The fragment of a grip from Damića gradina with a somewhat clearer presentation of two small animal heads proves that we are dealing with highly stylized presentations of animal protomes. Significant for the dating of the settlements Damića gradina and Dirov brijeg are also fragments of cups with a rounded body whose inner surface is decorated with a smoothed ornament. Direct comparisons as to the form of the cup and the decoration technique and motifs are found on Gradina on Bosut, where the described form belongs to the horizon of cannelured pottery. Decorating by smoothing is to become characteristic of the ceramography of La Tène culture of the Scordiscs. In determining the chronology of the Early Iron Age strata from Damića gradina and recognizing the base of certain cultural influences, the appearance of a jug and of fragments with rippled decorations is significant (T. 4., 5). The appearance of the rippled ornament on Damića gradina points to the existence of cultural influences from the west, from the dissemination area of the Dolenjska and the Martijanec-Kaptol groups, which were already registered in the younger phase of the Early Iron Age in the description of the finds from the graves of the Srijem culture. Certain differences between the pottery finds from Damića gradina and Gradina on Bosut are visible in the first place in the small number of forms and fragments, which on Damića gradina are cannelured, and an entire phase of the Bosut culture was named after this decorating technique. The described difference, as well as the fact that only a slightly larger number of fragments from Damića gradina was decorated in similar gouge technique, probably corresponds to certain chronological differences, i. e. it is supposed that the settlements Damića gradina and Dirov brijeg belong to the younger part of phase III of the Bosut culture, when decorating by canneluring, after which the entire phase was named, was not that common any longer. Pottery became mostly undecorated, and even if there was an ornament, it was mostly a combination of a <b>plastic</b> <b>ribbon</b> and a set of stamps. The assumptions on dating are supported also by the lack of finds of horizontally facetted everted pot rims, as well as of bowls with a rounded body and an inverted rim, transversally or horizontally cannelured and facetted on Damića gradina, from where a significant quantity of pottery material originates, as well as on Dirov brijeg. The Early Iron Age sites in Vinkovci and its surroundings offer a possibility for studying the relationship of the Bosut and the Dalj culture, two neighboring cultural phenomena that in the central Danube Region marked the period of the Early Iron Age. In settlements and grave sites of the Dalj culture from the early phase of the Early Iron Age in Dalj and Vukovar the appearance of pottery fragments of Bessarabian style was registered, which belong to phase II of the Bosut culture, whereas fragments of Dalj pottery are known from Gradina on Bosut. The appearance of skeletal burials on cremation grave sites of the Dalj culture in Vukovar and Dalj reflects the influence of the neighboring Bosut culture, as well as the eastern Alpine and the northern Balkan area, of which the inhumation rite is characteristic. The southern border of the Dalj culture dissemination was mainly drawn along the line Ilok-Vukovar-Županja or Vukovar-Vinkovci, with the penetration of the Dalj culture up to the western slopes of Fruška gora near Ilok and Šid. Thus the area between Vukovar and Šid might have been a transitional zone between the Bosut and the Dalj cultures, and the basis for making a distinction was pottery, whereas metal finds such as horse-riding equipment appear on sites of both cultures. The supposed differentiation could thus be related to the early phase of the Early Iron Age, into which pottery finds of the Dalj culture from Tržnica in Vinkovci are dated. In the younger phase of the Early Iron Age the Bosut culture was spread to the west in its phase III or the horizon of cannelured pottery, to which the settlements Dirov brijeg in Vinkovci and Damića gradina in Stari Mikanovci belong.

In the present study, we further investigated the repair process in ribbon synapses in guinea pigs after similar noise exposure.

The loss and recovery of hair cell ribbons and post-synaptic densities (PSDs) occurred in parallel, but the recovery was not complete, resulting in a permanent loss of less than 10 % synapses. During the repair process, ribbons were temporally separated from the PSDs. A <b>plastic</b> interaction between <b>ribbons</b> and postsynaptic terminals may be involved in the reestablishment of synaptic contact between ribbons and PSDs, as shown by location changes in both structures. Synapse repair was associated with a breakdown in temporal processing, as reflected by poorer responses in the compound action potential (CAP) of auditory nerves to time-stress signals. Thus, deterioration in temporal processing originated from the cochlea. This deterioration developed with the recovery in hearing threshold and ribbon synapse counts, suggesting that the repaired synapses had deficits in temporal processing...|$|R
