40|$|Abstract-At present, {{the most}} {{widespread}} method of monitoring of uterine contractions activity during pregnancy and labour is the external tocography. This mechanical method, however, has limited value resulting from its low accuracy and sensibility. Recent progress in new techniques of <b>perinatal</b> <b>monitoring</b> requires more precise method of monitoring uterine activity. The most promising {{seems to be the}} electrohysterography, which consist in recording of electrical uterine activity by means of electrodes attached to abdominal wall. We made an attempt to evaluate the possibility to replace the traditional mechanical method by the electrical one. We developed methods of extraction of slow wave from electrohysterogram. This slow wave corresponds to mechanical signal and can be regarded as a contractions wave. Then, using this wave, the contractions detection can be performed in a similar way as in conventional tocogram. The results obtained allow to conclude that there is close relation between electrical and mechanical signals of uterine activity. It manifests by similar number of contractions detected and large number of contractions being consistent...|$|E

Even such simple measurements as maternal blood pressure recording can provide additional information. However, for an accurate analysis of the feto-maternal coupling at least cardiac output and maternal oxygen saturation should be monitored. Nevertheless, our investigations have shown that for routine use even the MHR provides sufficient information to improve {{the interpretation of the}} CTG quite considerably. The correlation analysis of fetal and maternal heart rates facilitates diagnosis, particularly in borderline cases, and may help to prevent misinterpretation of the CTG.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiac rhabdomyoma (CRs) are {{the most}} common primary tumour of the heart in infants and children. Usually are {{multiple}} and, basing on the location can cause a haemodynamic disturbance, dysrhythmias or heart failure during the fetal and early postnatal period. CRs have a natural history of spontaneous regression and are closely associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). It has an association with tuberous sclerosis (TS), and in those, the tumour may regress and disappear completely, or remain consistent in size. AIM: We aimed to evaluate the prenatal diagnosis, clinical presentation and outcome of CRs and their association with TSC in a single centre. The median follow-up period was three years (range: 6 months - 5 years). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed medical records of all fetuses diagnosed prenatally with cardiac rhabdomyoma covering the period January 2010 to December 2016 which had undergone detailed ultrasound evaluation at a single centre with limited technical resources. RESULTS: Twelve fetuses were included in the study; mostly had multiple tumours and a total of 53 tumours were identified in all patients - the maximum was one fetus with 16 tumours. All patients were diagnosed prenatally by fetal echocardiography. In two patient's haemodynamic disturbances during the fetal period was noted and pregnancies have been terminated. After long consultation termination of pregnancy was chosen by the parents in totally 8 cases. In four continuing pregnancies {{during the first year of}} live tumours regressed. TSC was diagnosed in all patients during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac rhabdomyoma are benign from the cardiovascular standpoint in most affected fetuses. An early prenatal diagnosis may help for an adequate planning of <b>perinatal</b> <b>monitoring</b> and treatment with the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. Large tumour size, the number of tumours and localisation may cause hydrops, and they are significantly associated with poor neonatal outcome...|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} {{included}} all perinatal {{deaths in the}} Croatian health facilities in 2001 and 2002 which met the WHO report criteria, i. e. ≥ 500 g birth weight or ≥ 22 weeks of gestational age. In order to {{enhance the quality of}} <b>perinatal</b> <b>monitoring</b> in Croatia, in addition to mortality rate and level of perinatal mortality and its components, we also require data on the causes of perinatal deaths to make planning of prevention measures possible. Given that risk factors for developing perinatal death can be maternal, infant or common, no one classification of perinatal mortality can fully meet all the specific needs related to monitoring causes of death. Medical practice today mostly uses Wigglesworth pathophysiological classification, Aberdeen obstetric classification and standard International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), as well as other, less known, classifications. By studying the available literature, no attempt was discovered to combine the two most common perinatal classifications (Wigglesworth and Aberdeen) through ICD codes for the purpose of a more precise determination of underlying causes of perinatal deaths. This aim {{of this study was to}} obtain data on the most common causes of perinatal deaths according to the three above listed classifications. The method was connecting Wigglesworth and Aberdeen classification through ICD codes. The purpose was proposing a new classification system to provide more complete information on underlying causes of perinatal deaths. The following hypothesis was formulated: diagnosing maternal diseases/conditions is of greater importance for advancing perinatal care and a favorable perinatal outcome than clinically or pathoanatomically establishing the causes of death in infant. It was assumed that connecting Wigglesworth and Aberdeen classifications through ICD codes could yield more complete information on the underlying causes od death. Before connecting, classification was done according to each of the three classification systems and causes of death were ranked for every component of perinatal mortality. Given that certain causes of perinatal mortality rarely appear in the newborn population, it was necessary to analyze biennial data on the deceased in Croatia. Of 796 deceased, 472 were stillbirths (59. 3 % of perinatal mortality) and 324 early neonatal deaths (40. 7 % of perinatal mortality). No significant statistical differences were found in the distribution of the two monitored periods (p= 0. 377). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normal distribution of two components of perinatal mortality for birth weight and gestational age has shown that the obtained distribution for weight and gestation does not follow the Gaussian curve for either variable. According to Mann-Whitney U test, early neonatal deaths were related to statistically significantly lower mean birth weight and gestational age than stillbirths. Mean birth weight in stillbirths was 1935 g, in early neonatal deaths 1691 g. Average gestation duration in stillbirths was 33. 4 weeks, in early neonatal deaths 30. 9 weeks. The share of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths of low birth weight in overall perinatal mortality was 71. 1 %, the proportion of premature births before 37 th week of gestation 68. 7 %. By analyzing separately each of the components, the largest share of early neonatal deaths was shown to belong to the 22 nd- 27 th week gestational group (33 %), whereas stillbirths were found most numerous in the group with normal pregnancy duration, ≥ 37 weeks (30. 1 %). It is a well known fact that the causes of death are closely tied to birth weight and pregnancy duration, and that the incidence of individual causes of death is dependent upon these two variables. According to Wigglesworth classification, the causes of perinatal deaths are divided into five groups: intrauterine, antenatal deaths (45. 4 %), congenital anomalies (17. 2 %), conditions related with immaturity (21. 7 %), asphyxia (7. 9 %) and specific conditions different from those listed (7. 8 %). Differences in the distribution of perinatal deaths according to basic groups of causes of death in Wigglesworth classification between two monitored periods are not statistically significant (p= 0. 594). Each group is further divided into subgroups according to the modified Wigglesworth classification. Leading causes of stillbirth (antenatal and intrapartal) in overall perinatal mortality are the following: antepartal asphyxia (33. 3 %), antepartal asphyxia with infection (8. 7 %), other malformations (not classified separately by organ systems; 3. 4 %), fetal deaths without maceration or known cause (2. 6 %) and diabetes (1. 4 %). Leading causes of early neonatal deaths in overall perinatal mortality are as follows: hyaline membrane disease (5. 0 %), other malformations (4. 9 %), intrauterine infection (4. 5 %), hyaline membrane disease with infection (3. 6 %) and immaturity without details about the cause (2. 8 %). Only 32. 9 % of causes from common Wigglesworth groups which contain both stillbirths and neonatal deaths are intercomparable. When displaying causes of death separately for each component, the results show that the leading cause of mortality is asphyxia (83. 9 % in antepartal deaths and 83. 3 % intrapartal deaths), whereas in early neonatal deaths the consequences of immaturity (53. 5 %). Early neonatal deaths due to immaturity have three leading causes: hyaline membrane disease in 23. 1 % of cases, infection (20. 8 %) and hyaline membrane disease with infection (16. 8 %). These most common causes of perinatal deaths are found in two Wigglesworth groups not mutually comparative due to being specific either for stillbirths or early neonatal deaths. Two monitored periods showed no statistically significant differences in the distribution of causes of stillbirth (p= 0. 176) and early neonatal deaths (p= 0. 095), which confirms the fact that the period of one year provides enough data on the most common causes of perinatal mortality in Croatia. According to Aberdeen classification, the causes of perinatal mortality are dividied into nine groups: 35. 8 % of mortality due to maternal disease or other conditions which complicate pregnancy/delivery, 17. 2 % of mortality due to congenital anomalies, 12. 5 % due to mechanical causes, most commonly related to umbilical cord complications, 12. 3 % due to unexplainable reasons, 9. 7 % due to antepartal hemorrhage, 6. 0 % due to maternal (pre) eclampsia, 3. 1 % unclassifiable, 2. 6 % miscellaneous and 0. 8 % mortality due to isoimmunization. Differences in the incidence of individual causes between stillbirths and early neonatal births are statistically significant (p< 0. 001), with greater incidence of all maternal diseases and conditions which complicate pregnancy/delivery in stillbirths, and congenital malformations in early neonatal deaths. According to individual components we find the following: the most common causes of mortality are maternal diseases/conditions during pregnancy in 40. 1 % of cases, followed by antepartal hemorrhage and mechanical causes (umbilical cord pathology) in 12. 1 %, accounting for 65 % of all causes of stillbirth; the most common causes of mortality in early neonatal deaths are also maternal diseases/conditions during pregnancy (28. 7 %), followed by congenital malformations (26. 5 %) and unknown causes (17. 9 %). Two monitored periods showed no statistically significant differences either in the distribution of perinatal deaths by basic groups of causes of death according to Aberdeen classification (p= 0. 085), stillbirths (p= 0. 121) or early neonatal deaths (p= 0. 061), which confirms that the data collected annually are sufficient to establish the most common causes of perinatal mortality in Croatia. According to ICD, causes of perinatal mortality are divided in two groups: 82. 8 % of deaths due to certain conditions in the perinatal period and 17. 2 % of deaths due to congenital anomalies. Each group is further divided into subgroups according to ICD- 10 as follows: 60. 2 % perinatal deaths in certain conditions in the perinatal period group are found in the fetus and newborn affected by maternally related factors and complications in pregnancy and delivery subgroup; respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific for the perinatal period subgroup accounts for 9. 9 % of perinatal mortality, whereas the remaining eight subgroups participate in overall perinatal mortality in individual proportions ranging from 0. 1 to 3. 1 %. The distribution of the leading causes of perinatal mortality between stillbirths and early neonatal deaths has demonstrated statistically significant differences in the three leading diagnoses (p< 0. 001) with substantially higher incidence of chorioamnionitis, placental insufficiency and (pre) eclampsia in stillbirths than in early neonatal deaths. The most common in congenital anomalies group is diaphragmatic hernia from the musculoskeletal anomalies subgroup (20. 4 %), followed by nervous anomalies and multiple malformations, with an equal share of 18. 3 %, chromosomal anomalies (13. 9 %) and circulation anomalies (12. 4 %). Other malformations are sporadic. Congenital anomalies account for 10. 8 % of all causes of stillbirths and 26. 5 % of all causes of early neonatal deaths. Combining the classification systems has yielded significantly more information on the underlying cause of death than the original classifications. By connecting the ICD- 10 codes with groups in Wigglesworth classification, it was established that maternal diseases/conditions are the cause of 84 % of intrauterine mortality, 66 % of mortality due to intrapartal asphyxia and 68 % mortality due to immaturity. By combining ICD- 10 codes with Aberdeen classification, it was established that maternal diseases/conditions cause 60. 1 % of all perinatal deaths. The results of this study have shown that the two most frequently applied classification systems in perinatology vary significantly in establishing the causes of perinatal mortality: Wigglesworth classification produces data on immediate, Aberdeen on underlying causes of death. Combining different classification systems has proved the hypothesis that diagnosing maternal diseases/conditions is of greater importance for advancing perinatal care and a favorable perinatal outcome than clinically or pathoanatomically establishing the causes of death in infant. A proposal of a new classification system for determining the causes of perinatal mortality in Croatia is based on the codes of standard medical classification – ICD- 10 – with supplements in the form of subgroups taken from Aberdeen and Wigglesworth classifications to provide more information on the most common underlying causes of perinatal mortality, and, in case the underlying causes are unknown, more information on the consequences established in perinatal deaths. Such classification system makes it possible to plan preventive measures in antenatal, intrapartal and postnatal care...|$|E

40|$|Background: International {{comparisons}} of perinatal health indicators are {{complicated by the}} heterogeneity of data sources on pregnancy, maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature by searching PubMed for perinatal health studies from 2001 to 2011 based on linkage of routine data (data collected continuously at various time intervals). We also surveyed European health monitoring professionals about use of linkage for national perinatal health surveillance. Results: 516 studies fit our inclusion criteria. Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the US and the UK contributed 76 % of the publications; a further 29 countries contributed at least one publication. Most studies linked vital statistics, hospital records, medical birth registries and cohort data.

Methods: Study patients consisted of 220 full-term pregnant women between 2006 and 2008. Cases were analyzed based on 1) pattern of delivery, the use of pain control (anesthesia) or hypnotics (Sophrology), 2) maternal complications, and 3) habitual smoking or alcohol consumption. Urinary samples were collected from pregnant women before and after delivery, and from newborn babies. Results: The average level of BPn in pregnant women was 2. 61 ± 0. 25 U/g·Creatinin (Cre). (Mean ± SE). This is significantly higher than age-matched non-pregnant women (0. 79 ± 0. 24 U/g·Cre). After normal delivery, BPn was significantly elevated to 5. 29 ± 0. 57 U/g·Cre (p < 0. 001).

The Netherlands {{was found to have}} the highest perinatal mortality in Europe: the foetal and neonatal mortality amounted to 7. 4 and 3. 5 per 1000 births, respectively. European countries differ in registration practices. Some countries do not register perinatal deaths occurring before a duration of amenorrhoea of 28 weeks. Therefore, the Peristat mortality data should be compared with 28 weeks of gestation as a cut-off point. With this cut-off point, The Netherlands has the second highest perinatal mortality. A number of factors may have contributed to this relatively high mortality, such as differences in registration practices, the profile of the Dutch childbearing population and the characteristics of Dutch perinatal care. The Netherlands has a relatively high proportion of older mothers, multiple births and mothers belonging to an ethnic minority. Also, Dutch neonatologists are known to be conservative in their treatment of premature newborns, which reduces their chances of survival.

40|$|Hypoxia-ischemia {{constitutes}} a risk in infants by altering {{cerebral blood flow}} regulatory mechanisms and causing loss of cerebral vascular auto-regulation. Hypotension, cerebral ischemia, and reperfusion are the main events involved in vascular auto-regulation leading to cell death and tissue damage. Reperfusion could be critical since organ damage, particularly of the brain, may be amplified during this period. An exaggerated activation of vasoactive agents of calcium mediated effects could be responsible for reperfusion injury, which, in turns, leads to cerebral hemorrhage and damage. These dramatic phenomena represent a common repertoire in infants complicated by perinatal acute or chronic hypoxia or cardiovascular disorders treated by risky procedures such as open heart surgery and cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB). To date, despite accurate <b>perinatal</b> and intra-operative <b>monitoring,</b> the post-insult period is crucial, since clinical symptoms and monitoring parameters may be of no avail and therapeutic window for pharmacological intervention (6 - 12 hours) may be limited, {{at a time when}} brain damage is already occurring. Therefore, the measurement of circulating biochemical markers of brain damage, such as vasoactive agents and nervous tissue peptides is eagerly awaited in clinical practice to detect high risk infants. The present review is aimed at investigating the role as circulating biochemical markers such as adrenomedullin, a vasoactive peptide; S 100 B, a calcium binding protein, activin A, a glycoprotein; neuronal specific enolase (NSE), a dimeric isoenzyme; glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), a astroglial protein, in the cascade of events leading to ischemia reperfusion injury in infants complicated by perinatal asphyxia or cardiovascular disorders requiring risky therapeutic strategies such as CPB and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd...|$|R

40|$|A {{retrospective}} cross-sectional {{survey was}} conducted to assess key practices and costs relating to home- and institutional delivery care in rural Rajasthan, India. One block from each of two sample districts was covered (estimated population– 279, 132). Field investigators listed women who had delivered {{in the past three}} months and contacted them for structured case interview. In total, 1, 947 (96 %) of 2, 031 listed women were successfully interviewed. An average of 2. 4 and 1. 7 care providers attended each home- and institutional delivery respectively. While 34 % of the women delivered in health facilities, modern care providers attended half of all the deliveries. Intramuscular injections, intravenous drips, and abdominal fundal pressure were widely used for hastening delivery in both homes and facilities while post-delivery injections for active management of the third stage were administered to a minority of women in both the venues. Most women were discharged prematurely after institutional delivery, especially by smaller health facilities. The cost of accessing home-delivery care was Rs 379 (US$ 8) while the mean costs in facilities for elective, difficult vaginal deliveries and for caesarean sections were Rs 1, 336 (US$ 30), Rs 2, 419 (US$ 54), and Rs 11, 146 (US$ 248) respectively. Most families took loans at high interest rates to meet these costs. It is concluded that widespread irrational practices by a range of care providers in both homes and facilities can adversely affect women and newborns while inadequate observance of beneficial practices and high costs are likely to reduce the benefits of institutional delivery, especially for the poor.

The infants with the increased baseline levels of PCT demonstrated significant reduction of the biomarker over time that was considered as the adequacy of performed antibiotic therapy. The highest S 100 β levels were recorded in premature babies with sepsis including those without significant perinatal lesion of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Unidirectional reduction was typical for both S 100 β and PCT levels. Combination of increased S 100 β serum concentration decreased PCT was a pattern of developing the periventricular leukomalacia. There was evidence for a direct relation of biomarker S 100 β? to the presence of convulsive syndrome (Kendal’s coefficient 0. 36; p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Similarly to newborn infants with traumatic, hypoxic, and hemorrhagic CNS lesions, patients with infectious and septic pathology exhibited elevated S 100 β levels. Both biomarkers PCT and S 100 β are suggested to be included in a battery of clinical and monitoring tests to optimize treatment of high-risk neonates in the intensive care unit.
