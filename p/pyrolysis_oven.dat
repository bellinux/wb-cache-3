40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro Tecnológico, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência e Engenharia de Materiais, Florianópolis, 2016. A transformação direta de polímeros precursores em cerâmicas covalentes, via termólise no estado sólido, foi proposta há mais de 30 anos e desde então permitiu avanços tecnológicos significativos na ciência e tecnologia cerâmica. Entre eles, a redução do coeficiente de atrito (µ) de substratos metálicos e cerâmicos com o uso de revestimentos amorfos de carbonitreto de silício (SiCN), produzidos por meio de cerâmicas derivadas de polímeros (PDC). Porém, através de rotas de processamento tecnologicamente sofisticadas, enquanto neste trabalho a viabilidade de processamento desses revestimentos sobre um aço baixa liga sinterizado, por pulverização de suspensões e pirólise em forno, foi explorada. Para compensar a retração do polímero precursor, evitar a formação de trincas e produzir revestimentos auto-lubrificantes para avaliações tribológicas de deslizamento alternado a seco, cargas inertes foram adicionadas a solução do poli(organo) silazano, especificamente nitreto de silício (Si 3 N 4, 30 ou 65 % em volume) e nitreto de boro {{hexagonal}} (h-BN, 9 % em volume). O Si 3 N 4 em pó foi utilizado para reforçar a matriz (SiCN) e reduzir o desgaste, pela formação de uma rede agregada pela fase do ligante precursor e, h-BN para gerar um efeito lubrificante na interface reduzindo o atrito, o desgaste e o aquecimento por atrito. A fim de acomodar as diferenças de propriedades, originadas pela natureza das ligações químicas do substrato metálico e revestimento cerâmico, a tecnologia de plasma de corrente contínua (DC) foi utilizada para modificar as superfícies do aço sinterizado. A nitretação ou o enriquecimento de superfície com Mo seguido de nitretação, tinham o intuito de gerar uma camada de compostos na superfície do substrato com uma zona de difusão gradiente abaixo, de modo a aumentar o suporte de carga e evitar a fratura do revestimento pelo carregamento do contra corpo. A nitretação resultou em um aumento na dureza da superfície (600 HV) do aço por precipitação de nitretos de ferro metaestáveis, enquanto o enriquecimento com Mo resultou em carbetos (Fe 3 Mo 3 C) dispersos na superfície do substrato. Os últimos, durante a nitretação evoluem para uma camada descontínua de carbonitreto (Fe 3 Mo 3 (C,N)), que contribuíram para o aumento da dureza na superfície (800 HV). Foi possível produzir revestimentos PDC em amostras sinterizadas com espessura de até 10 µm e com adequado preenchimento dos poros na superfície, independente dos teores de carga avaliada (39 ou 74 vol. %). Além disso, a combinação de 65 % em volume de Si 3 N 4 e 9 % em volume de h-BN resultou em revestimentos cerâmicos homogêneos, sem macro trincas ou falhas coesivas após o processamento sobre o aço sinterizado, independente das modificações de superfície. Conforme projetado para o estudo, após o tratamento térmico de pirólise os precipitados Fe 3 Mo 3 (C,N) não foram totalmente decompostos como os nitretos de ferro, apesar da ausência do endurecimento de superfície. O controle da microestrutura e composição química finais são vantagens inerentes aos processos de manufatura utilizados e foram explorados para projetar a microestrutura final dos compósitos. Porém, apesar da utilização de um teor aumentado de cargas passivas ter possibilitado a obtenção de revestimentos cerâmicos sem trincas sobre substratos sinterizados, os compósitos não apresentaram uma resposta tribológica satisfatória, quando avaliados nas condições testadas. No regime permanente, o coeficiente de atrito médio (0, 4 a 0, 5) dos compósitos permaneceu acima do regime de lubricidade (µ Abstract : 	The directly {{transformation of}} organosilicon polymers into covalent ceramics, via solid-state thermolysis, was proposed over 30 years ago, {{and since then}} enabled significant technological breakthroughs in ceramic science and technology. Among them, the friction coefficient (µ) reduction of metallic and ceramic substrates with use of amorphous silicon carbonitride (SiCN) coatings, produced by the polymer derived ceramic route (PDC). Nevertheless, technologically sophisticated processing steps are used to produce them, while in this work, the possibility to process such coatings onto sintered low alloy steel samples by simple spraying of poly(organo) silazane suspensions and <b>oven</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> was explored. In order to compensate the precursor shrinkage, avoid crack formation and produce hard and self-lubricating coatings for reciprocating dry sliding evaluations, inert fillers namely silicon nitride (30 or 65 vol. %) and hexagonal-boron nitride (9 vol. %) {{were added to the}} polymer precursor. Powdered Si 3 N 4 was used to strengthen the matrix and reduce wear, by formation of a network aggregated by the precursor binder phase, and h-BN to generate a lubricating effect on the interface reducing friction, wear and friction heating. To accommodate dissimilarities of properties, originated from different chemical bonds of the metallic substrate and ceramic coating, the direct current (DC) plasma technology was utilized to modify the surface of the sintered steel. Nitriding or surface enrichment with Mo followed by nitriding was expected to generate a compound layer at the surface of the substrate with a gradient diffusion region below, in order to increase the load support and avoid coating fracture from the counterface load. Nitriding led to an increase in surface hardness of steel (600 HV) due to precipitation of metastable iron nitrides, while surface enrichment resulted in dispersed carbides (Fe 3 Mo 3 C) onto the substrate surface. The latter evolved to a discontinuous carbonitride layer (Fe 3 Mo 3 (C,N)) during nitriding, which increased the surface hardness (800 HV). It was possible to produce PDC coatings with thickness below 10 µm and with proper filling into substrate surface pores, regardless of total filler amount evaluated (39 or 74 vol. %). Moreover, the combination of 65 vol. % of Si 3 N 4 and 9 vol% of h-BN resulted in homogeneous ceramic coatings, free of macro cracks and cohesive failure after processing onto sintered substrates, independent of surface modification. As desired for evaluating, after pyrolysis the Fe 3 Mo 3 (C,N) precipitates were not totally decomposed as the iron nitrides, despite the surface hardening absence. The high control of final microstructure and chemical composition are competitive advantages inherent to cited manufacturing processes, explored to project the final microstructures of the steel, interfaces and ceramic coatings involved. However; despite the use of an increased amount of filler (74 vol. %) allowed the successful obtainment of homogeneous and crack-free ceramic coatings, the composites did not presented a satisfactory tribological response when evaluated under tested conditions. The average steady state friction coefficient of composites (0. 4 to 0. 5) were above the lubricious regime (µ< 0. 2), regardless of coating composition or surface modification. The maximum contact pressure (0. 53 GPa) caused failure of coatings, which were in sequence deformed, comminuted and oxidized by substrate and counter-body during sliding, revealing a tribo-chemical wear character. The major contribution to the friction coefficient behavior was from the substrate but controlled by the formed third-body, composed of oxygen and chemical elements from substrate, coatings and counter-body. The third-body presence, indirectly indicated by the contact electrical resistance, increased the wear rates of composites (1. 5 to 4. 2 x 10 - 4. mm 3. N- 1. m- 1) and counter-bodies (7. 0 to 8. 7 x 10 - 5. mm 3. N- 1. m- 1) in relation to the sintered steel tested under same conditions (1 and 0. 1 x 10 - 4. mm 3. N- 1. m- 1 respectively). The wear rates of composites were further increased with the raise of Si 3 N 4 amount in the coating composition, and with the presence of hard ternary carbonitrides at the substrate surface...|$|R

The initial acquisition of some hardware needed and the actual construction of the sampling system have begun. This sampling system will contain the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>oven</b> to atomize the sample gas stream needed for total gaseous mercury measurements, the CRD cavity to acquire the ring-down signal needed to obtain the mercury concentration, various tubing, and temperature and pressure measurement equipment. The amount of tubing and valves have been cut to a minimum to try and reduce the resident time the sample flue gas stream is in the sampling system and minimize the possibility that the gases in the sample gas stream will react with the elements of the sampling system and change the component mixture contained in the flue gas. In an effort to minimize the equipment that needs to be close to the actual sampling port, SRD scientists decided to fiber optically couple the laser to the CRD cavity. However, the ultra-violet (UV) light needed for the mercury transition presents a problem as fiber optics can be solarized by the UV radiation thereby changing the transmission characteristics. SRD has obtained a solarization-resistant fiber. SRD scientists were then able to couple the UV laser light into the fiber and inject the output of the fiber into the CRD cavity and obtain a ring-down signal. Long-term effects of the UV radiation on the fiber optic are being monitored to detect any change in the transmission of the laser light to the cavity. Additional requirements of the mercury CRD monitor will be to not only monitor the mercury concentration continuously but also perform the measurements over extended periods of time.

40|$|Accurate {{reporting}} of mercury concentration requires a detailed model that includes experimental parameters that vary, such as: pressure, temperature, concentration, absorption cross-section, and isotopic structure etc. During this quarter a theoretical {{model has been}} developed to model the 253. 7 nm mercury transition. In addition, while testing the interferent species SO{sub 2 }, SRD was able to determine the absorption cross-section experimentally and add this to the theoretical model. Assuming that the baseline losses are due to the mirror reflectivity and SO{sub 2 }, SRD can now determine the concentrations of both mercury and SO{sub 2 } from the data taken. For the CRD instrument to perform as a continuous emission monitor it {{will be required to}} monitor mercury concentrations over extended periods of time. The stability of monitoring mercury concentrations over time with the CRD apparatus was tested during the past quarter. During a test which monitored the mercury concentration every 2 seconds {{it was found that the}} standard deviation, of a signal from about 1. 25 ppb Hg, was only 30 ppt. SRD continued interferent gas testing during this past quarter. This included creating a simulated flue gas composed of the gases tested individually by SRD. The detection limits for mercury, although dependent on the concentration of SO{sub 2 } in the simulated gas matrix, remained well below the ppb range. It was determined that for the gases tested the only measurable changes in the baseline level occurred for SO{sub 2 } and mercury. Speciation studies continued with mercury chloride (HgCl{sub 2 }). This included checking for spectral speciation with both Hg and HgCl{sub 2 } present in the CRD cavity. There was no observable spectral shift.

The analysis of samples via analytical instrumentation {{on the surface of}} Mars has thus far only been attempted by the two Viking missions. Robotic arms scooped relogith material into a <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>oven</b> attached to a GC/MS. No trace of organic material was found on any of the two different samples at either of the two different landing sites. This null result puts an upper limit on the amount of organics that might be present in Martian soil/rocks, although the level of detection for each individual molecular species is still debated. Determining the absolute limit of detection for each analytical instrument is essential so that null results can be understood. This includes investigating the trade off of using pyrolysis versus liquid solvent extraction to release organic materials (in terms of extraction efficiencies and the complexity of the sample extraction process.) Extraction of organics from field samples can be accomplished by a variety of methods such utilizing various solvents including HCl, pure water, supercritical fluid and Soxhelt extraction. Utilizing 6 N HCl {{is one of the most}} commonly used method and frequently utilized for extraction of organics from meteorites but it is probably infeasible for robotic exploration due to difficulty of storage and transport. Extraction utilizing H 2 O is promising, but it could be less efficient than 6 N HCl. Both supercritical fluid and Soxhelt extraction methods require bulky hardware and require complex steps, inappropriate for inclusion on rover spacecraft. This investigation reports the efficiencies of pyrolysis and solvent extraction methods for amino acids for different terrestrial samples. The samples studied here, initially created in aqueous environments, are sedimentary in nature.

40|$|Previous {{work on the}} {{detection}} of mercury using the cavity ring-down (CRD) technique has concentrated on {{the detection}} and characterization of the desired mercury transition. Interferent species present in flue gas emissions have been tested {{as well as a}} simulated flue gas stream. Additionally, work has been done on different mercury species such as the elemental and oxidized forms. The next phase of the effort deals with the actual sampling system. This sampling system will be responsible for acquiring a sample stream from the flue gas stack, taking it to the CRD cavity where it will be analyzed and returning the gas stream to the stack. In the process of transporting the sample gas stream every effort must be taken to minimize any losses of mercury to the walls of the sampling system as well as maintaining the mercury in its specific state (i. e. elemental, oxidized, or other mercury compounds). SRD first evaluated a number of commercially available sampling systems. These systems ranged from a complete sampling system to a number of individual components for specific tasks. SRD engineers used some commercially available components and designed a sampling system suited {{to the needs of the}} CRD instrument. This included components such as a <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>oven</b> to convert all forms of mercury to elemental mercury, a calibration air source to ensure mirror alignment and quality of the mirror surfaces, and a pumping system to maintain the CRD cavity pressure from atmospheric pressure (760 torr) down to about 50 torr. SRD also began evaluating methods for the CRD instrument to automatically find the center of a mercury transition. This procedure is necessary as the instrument must periodically measure the baseline losses of the cavity off of the mercury resonance and then return to the center of the transition to accurately measure the mercury concentration. This procedure is somewhat complicated due to the isotopic structure of the 254 nm mercury transition. As a result of 6 isotopes and hyperfine splittings there are 5 individual peaks that can be resolved by the CRD instrument. SRD tested a derivative method with both simulated data and actual data taken with the CRD apparatus.

Before proceeding to the GC-QMS analysis, the solid sample collected by Curiosity is subjected to a thermal treatment thanks to the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>oven</b> to release the volatiles into the gas processing system. As the Viking landers in 1976 [2], SAM detected chlorohydrocarbons with the pyrolysis GC-QMS experiment [3, 4]. The detection of perchlorates salts in soil at the Phoenix Landing site [6] suggests that these chloro- hydrocarbons could come from the reaction of organics with oxychlorines. Oxychlorines indeed decomposed into molecular oxygen and volatile chlorine when heated and react with the organic matter in the samples by oxidation and/or chlorination processes. [3, 5, 7, 8]. During SAM pyrolysis, samples are heated to 850 ◦C. SAM detected C 1 to C 3 chloroalkanes, entirely attributed to reaction products occurring during the pyrolysis experiment between oxychlorines and organic carbon from instrument background [3] and chlorobenzene and C 2 to C 4 dichloroalkanes produced by reaction between Mars endogenous organics with oxychlorines [4]. To help understanding the influence of perchlorate and chlorate salts on organic matter during SAM pyrolysis, we systemically study the reaction products formed during pyrolysis of various organic compounds mixed with various perchlorates and chlorates. We selected organics from simple molecule forms as for instance PAHs and amino acids to complex material (> 30 carbon atoms) such as kerogen. The perchlorate and chlorate salts are prepared at 1 wt % concentration in silica and mixed with the organics to study the potential qualitative and/or quantitative effects. The experiments are performed on a laboratory GC-QMS with a Restek Rxi- 5 column (30 m x 0. 25 mm x 0. 25 μm) and an Intersciences pyrolyser. The mixture is pyrolyzed at different temperatures up to 900 ◦C to cover the SAM temperature range. Different experiments are done to discriminate the pyrolysis products directly coming from the organics, and those produced from the reaction with oxychlorine. These experiments are under progress and should bring key information on the potential to identify Martian organics when pyrolyzing solid samples. Depending on the organic families studied, we may find recurring molecules, which are potentially present in Mars’ surface samples. This work could thus highlight some organic precursors of the chlorinated compounds found on Mars, and support the interpretation of SAM measurements...|$|E
