40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} if digital study models are a satisfactory alternative to <b>plaster</b> study <b>models.</b> Method: 1. Pilot study to compare linear measurements from <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with {{two types of}} digital model. 2. Study to compare PAR scores from <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with digital models created from scans of dental impressions. 3. Pilot study to compare PAR scores of <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with 30 printed models created from scans of dental impressions. Results: A mean difference of <O. 5 mm (range 0. 02 - 0. 51 mm) for single linear measurements and < 3. 0 mm (0. 47 - 3. 03 mm) for multiple linear measurements was indicated. A mean difference of 0. 03 PAR points (SD= 3) was demonstrated between PAR scores for <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> and digital models. A mean difference of 1 PAR point (SD= 3) was demonstrated between PAR scores for <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> and 30 printed models. Conclusions: Both types of digital study model may be comparable with <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> when used for linear measurements. Digital models created from scans of dental impressions are indicated to be comparable with <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> for PAR scoring. 30 printed models may be comparable to <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> for PAR scoring.

30|$|Along {{with the}} {{increasing}} prevalence of aligner therapy, digital models are gradually replacing <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> and will eventually become the new standard for orthodontic records. However, many orthodontists still find familiarity in <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> that can be physically articulated and measured, and studies have reported that models are {{the single most important}} orthodontic record for treatment planning [6, 7]. Several studies have looked at the accuracy of digital models, and in general, they {{have been found to be}} reasonably accurate compared to <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> [8 – 12].

40|$|BACKGROUND The EUROCRAN index {{has been}} used in inter-center studies to assess dental arch {{relationship}} (DAR) and palatal morphology (PM) in children with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP). For this type of inter-center research, a scoring method that could be performed over the internet would be the most effective. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the reliability of application of the EUROCRAN index on 3 D digital models or photographs of <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> instead of using <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> METHODS The EUROCRAN reference models were presented in three formats: <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> 2 D photographs of <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> and 3 D digital <b>models.</b> <b>Plaster</b> <b>models</b> of children with UCLP (n[*]=[*] 45) were rated. Of each case, all three formats were rated by six calibrated observers in random order. The strength of agreement of the ratings was assessed with kappa statistics. Concordance among observers was evaluated with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS The ICC showed a good inter-observer agreement for the DAR and poor inter-observer agreement for the PM. Intra-observer agreement for the DAR was moderate to very good, yet for the PM poor to moderate. Comparison between the three formats per observer for the DAR was good or very good and for the PM moderate to poor. CONCLUSIONS The overall results show that the EUROCRAN index is an acceptable and reliable scoring method for the DAR on <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> 2 D photographs of <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> and 3 D digital models. However, due to the small range of deviations in palatal morphology between the cases in our study, the PM component of the index was difficult to assess. CLINICAL RELEVANCE In clinical audits and inter-center studies, <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> can be substituted by 2 D photographs of plaster casts or 3 D digital models when grading treatment outcome with the EUROCRAN index...|$|R
5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and <b>plaster</b> <b>model</b> of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E

40|$|AIM: A {{case-control study}} {{to assess the}} {{potential}} use of virtual models {{as an alternative to}} orthodontic <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> MATERIALS AND METHOD: Assessment of tooth widths was conducted on 80 <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> which were measured to the nearest 0. 01 mm with digital callipers, and their virtual models by two trained and calibrated examiners. Agreement of tooth width was assessed with paired t-test analysis. Intra- and interexaminer reliability of assessments were investigated. RESULTS: Both intra- and interexaminer reliability and test-retest reliability of <b>plaster</b> and virtual <b>model</b> analysis were acceptable in measuring tooth sizes. There were no signifi cant differences between measurements of 24 teeth on the <b>plaster</b> and virtual <b>models.</b> The mean directional differences (MDD) were less than 0. 20 mm. The MDD for tooth width measurements was less than 0. 10 mm. Intraclass correlation coeffi cients of assessments of tooth width obtained from <b>plaster</b> and virtual <b>models</b> were > 0. 80. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual models can be as accurate as the traditional method of digital callipers and <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> Therefore, virtual models can be used as an alternative to <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: The {{accuracy}} and reliability of <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> and digital models acquired with two different surface laser scanners were tested by means of three methods: measurement with calipers, digital measurement with proper software and superimposition of the digital <b>models.</b> Methods: Thirty <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with permanent dentition that met the inclusion criteria were selected and scanned with two laser scanners (R 700 and Xcad). Three examiners measured distances on <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with a digital caliper and on digital models using Ortho Analyzer software. The digital models were also compared by means of superimposition of the models using the Geomagic Qualify software. The intra and inter-examiner reliability of the measurements were evaluated using the ICC. Paired t {{test was used to}} test the accuracy of the measurements on digital and <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> Results: The measurements on <b>plaster</b> and digital <b>models</b> acquired by two different scanners showed high values for the ICC. Although statistically significant differences between the measurements on <b>plaster</b> and digital <b>models</b> have been found, these discrepancies were not considered clinically relevant.

The Beaux Arts style had become dated; instead of funding Taft's large-scale Midway Plaisance beautification plan, and providing the originally planned granite, bronze or Georgia marble materials, the trust only allocated sufficient funds and support for a concrete sculpture.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the feasibility of virtual models as an alternative to orthodontic <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> Virtual dental models (obtained from OrthoCAD®) and corresponding <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> of 80 patients in the permanent dentition were randomly selected from patients seeking orthodontic care. Inter-examiner error was assessed by measuring tooth width, overjet, overbite, intermolar width, intercanine width, and midline discrepancy. Criterion validity of virtual model analysis was determined by the agreement between the measurements from virtual and <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> Test-retest reliability was determined by remeasuring 10 virtual models 1 week later. Comparison analysis was assessed by calculating the mean directional differences and standardized directional differences. Correlation analysis was determined by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Both intra- and inter-examiner reliability and test-retest reliability of virtual model analysis were acceptable in measuring intercanine, intermolar, overjet, overbite, midline discrepancy, space analysis, and tooth width (ICC > 0. 7). Good criterion validity was indicated by agreement between the results from the <b>plaster</b> and virtual <b>models</b> (ICC > 0. 8). There were substantial agreements for canine and molar relationship classifications (κ > 0. 70).

30|$|<b>Plaster</b> <b>models</b> {{that have}} been {{traditionally}} used in orthodontics for evaluating patients’ occlusal status have several limitations.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the angle of permanent second molars in schoolchildren with a normal occlusion, using panoramic radiographs and <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> and to evaluate the correlation between measurements obtained by these two methods. Methods: Thirty Brazilian schoolchildren {{with a mean age of}} 14 years and 7 months were selected. These individuals had not previously undergone orthodontic interventions, required a minimum of four of Andrews' six keys of occlusion, with the first key (interarch relation) being mandatory, and significant facial asymmetry was absent. Angulation of the maxillary second molars was measured using panoramic radiographs and <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> Results: The mean angulation, according to panoramic radiography, was 105. 8 º in the distal direction (standard deviation of 5. 1 º). The <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> revealed a mean angulation of - 5. 8 º, indicating a distal angulation of the crown. Pearsons' correlation test demonstrated a negative and weak relationship (p = 0. 009; r 2 = - 0. 474), with a greater angle in the panoramic radiographs and a smaller angle in <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> This was considered an inverse proportional relationship. Conclusion: Measurements of the panoramic radiographs showed an angulation of 105. 8 º in the distal direction, while the <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> revealed an angulation of - 5. 8 º. Therefore, one should consider these angulations in order to personalize the placement of accessories on the upper permanent second molars. Correlation of this angulation using these two methods was negative; however, due to the weak correlation, both methods are needed when evaluating the angle of the upper second molar...|$|R
