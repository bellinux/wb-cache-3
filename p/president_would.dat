5|$|In 2003, Indiana Representative Mark Souder {{proposed}} that former president Ronald Reagan, {{who was then}} dying of Alzheimer's disease, replace Roosevelt on the dime once he died, stating that Reagan was as iconic to conservatives as Roosevelt was to liberals. Reagan's wife Nancy expressed her opposition, stating that she was certain the former <b>president</b> <b>would</b> not have favored it either. After Ronald Reagan died in 2004, there was support for a design change, but Souder declined to pursue his proposal.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Rodríguez Saá got {{the mandate}} of interim president, with {{instructions}} from the Assembly to call for elections the following March 3, with the run-off on March 17 if needed. The new <b>president</b> <b>would</b> complete delaRúa's term of office. Those elections were held with ley de lemas, double simultaneous voting, and the victor took the reins of government on April 5.|$|E
50|$|The Republic {{would be}} governed by a <b>president.</b> There <b>would</b> be a vice <b>president</b> who <b>would</b> replace the <b>president</b> in his absence.|$|R
5000|$|Successive <b>Presidents</b> <b>would</b> be Barry Goldwater, Spiro Agnew, [...] "Big Chuck" [...] Heston (a {{parody of}} Reagan {{becoming}} President), and Oliver North.|$|R
50|$|During Augusto Pinochet's {{military}} regime from 1973 to 1989, the University experienced many profound changes. On 2 October 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 {{stated that the}} University's <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> be designated by the {{military regime}}.|$|R
5|$|The Laroche family, father Joseph {{and daughters}} Simonne and Louise, {{were the only}} known {{passengers}} of black ancestry on board the ship. They, along with Joseph's pregnant wife Juliette, were travelling to Joseph's native island of Haiti. Joseph hoped that a move from their former home in Paris back to Haiti, where his uncle Cincinnatus Leconte was <b>president,</b> <b>would</b> take his family away from racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|Côte d'Ivoire so that {{he could}} organise {{opposition}} to the Sankara regime. In 1987, Sankara was overthrown and assassinated in a coup. The coup may have had French involvement, since the Sankara regime had fallen into disfavour in France. Houphouët-Boigny was also suspected of involvement in the coup and in November, the PDCI asked the government to ban the sale of Jeune Afrique following its allegations of Houphouët-Boigny's participation. The Ivorian <b>president</b> <b>would</b> have greatly benefited from the divisions in the Burkina Faso government. He contacted Blaise Compaoré, the second-most powerful man in the regime; it is generally believed that they worked in conjunction with Laurent Dona Fologo, Robert Guéï and Pierre Ouédraogo to overthrow the Sankara regime.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the umpire}} {{development}} program was created, the Minor League <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> recruit umpires {{directly from the}} schools. Umpires were then [...] "sold" [...] from league to league {{by word of mouth}} through the various league presidents.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, Vincent {{conducted}} a plebiscite about extending his term in office, receiving a favorable vote to extend it to 1941. The plebiscite also approved {{an amendment to}} the constitution so that future <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> be elected by popular vote.|$|R
50|$|After {{his death}} in 1904, Shaykh Sufi's resting place became a site of annual pilgrimage for the {{faithful}} from across Somalia and East Africa. A cemetery would eventually be constructed around his mausoleum, where prominent Somali ministers, entertainers and <b>Presidents</b> <b>would</b> also be buried.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission <b>President</b> <b>would</b> have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was unable}} to secure the {{nomination}} at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent James Buchanan's nomination. After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice <b>president</b> <b>would</b> help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the general election, Louisiana's J. L. Lewis nominated him. Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind Mississippi's John A. Quitman with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33. On the second ballot, Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much {{of the credit for}} that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as <b>President</b> <b>would</b> appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E
50|$|On 26 November 1982, Lerma was {{appointed}} President of the Valencian Community after {{the resignation of}} Enrique Monsonís. This was the last occasion to date that a President {{was appointed}} as future <b>Presidents</b> <b>would</b> be chosen by the Corts Valencianes, the Valencian regional parliament.|$|R
50|$|During these summits the <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> hold {{meetings}} on energy, infrastructure, {{education and social}} policies, in addition to defining a transitional formula until {{the full force of}} the treaty, which must still be approved by legislatures, comes into effect. Foreign ministers are to meet every six months.|$|R
50|$|The Civic Youth Union, was {{organized}} in 1889 {{at the intersection}} with the Avenida Córdoba. This organization would foment the Revolution of the Park in 1890, and from its ranks the Radical Civic Union (to whom six <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> later belong during the twentieth century) would be established in 1891.|$|R
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} the first Whig <b>president</b> <b>would</b> give that party the {{opportunity}} to fill federal jobs for the first time. This proved complicated, and Harrison was called to Washington in mid-January, nearly two months before his March 4, 1841 inaugural date, to be at hand. He made a very public progress from Ohio to Washington, getting little rest along the way: even those Whigs who were not seeking government employment wanted to see and meet the President-elect and celebrations often surrounded his hotel all night. He reached Washington on February 9, his 68th birthday. After consultation with Whig politicians, he filled his cabinet, to the disappointment of some, like Henry Clay, who saw his nominees passed over, and Thaddeus Stevens, who believed he had been promised the position of Postmaster General.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of {{the exact}} {{location}} of the blockading squadron, Decatur set a course to avoid them and seek a safe port, but approximately two hours later the squadron's sails were spotted on the horizon. President changed course to outrun them, but the damage she suffered the night before had significantly reduced her speed. Attempting to gain speed, Decatur ordered expendable cargo thrown overboard; by late afternoon of 15January, HMS Endymion under Captain Henry Hope came alongside and proceeded to fire broadsides. Decatur planned to bring President in close to Endymion, whereby Presidents crew could board and capture the opposing ship and sail her to New York. (<b>President</b> <b>would</b> be scuttled to prevent her capture).|$|E
50|$|Murder at 1600 (1997), {{starring}} Wesley Snipes. Senior {{administration officials}} {{and military leaders}} attempt to engineer {{the resignation of the}} <b>President.</b> This <b>would</b> allow the elevation of the Vice <b>President,</b> who <b>would</b> then take military action to rescue hostages held by North Korea, action the sitting President is unwilling to take.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of the United States electing a married woman as <b>President,</b> her husband <b>would</b> presumably be {{addressed}} as either First Man or First Gentleman, while the <b>President</b> herself <b>would</b> presumably be addressed as Madam President.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Ramos Hernández won {{election}} as municipal president of Tijuana, an office he would hold for three years. One of the signature projects of his presidency, {{the use of}} hydraulic concrete to repave streets throughout the city, resulted in a large debt load that later municipal <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> need to refinance.|$|R
5|$|By mid-1850, Honório Hermeto {{was back}} in Rio de Janeiro. He had found the months in Pernambuco excruciating. Being named provincial <b>president</b> <b>would</b> have been {{considered}} a great achievement for a young politician, but it added no luster to the reputation of a seasoned politician and {{a founding member of}} his party. Instead of being at the center of power, he was put in the humiliating position of having to submit to a cabinet composed of men with less political experience, such as Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Paulino Soares de Sousa (Honório Hermeto's colleague along with Rodrigues Torres in Coimbra) and Eusébio de Queirós. It was particularly grating being subordinated to Paulino Soares and Eusébio de Queirós, protégés whom Honório Hermeto had advanced during the 1830s. While in Pernambuco, Honório Hermeto's actions were frequently reviewed and overturned by the cabinet, often with Eusébio de Queirós leading the criticism.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Richmond {{convention}} opened, Randolph had abandoned the Anti-Federalist cause, which damaged efforts by Mason and Henry to co-ordinate with their counterparts in New York. Mason moved that the convention consider the document clause by clause, which may have played {{into the hands of}} the Federalists, who feared what the outcome of an immediate vote might be, and who had more able leadership in Richmond, including Marshall and Madison. Nevertheless, Broadwater suggested that as most delegates had declared their views before the election, Mason's motion made little difference. Henry, far more a foe of a strong federal government than was Mason, took the lead for his side in the debate. Mason spoke several times in the discussion, on topics ranging from the pardon power (which he predicted the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> use corruptly) to the federal judiciary, which he warned would lead to suits in the federal courts by citizens against states where they did not live. John Marshall, a future Chief Justice of the United States, downplayed the concern regarding the judiciary, but Mason would later be proved correct in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), which led to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the <b>President</b> <b>would</b> sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{criticized the}} film, however. Susan Silver, {{a staff writer}} for The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Bob Newhart Show, {{predicted}} that, {{as a result of the}} film's success, future <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> be judged by voters on their ability to deliver a [...] "laugh riot" [...] rather than on substantive policy positions.|$|R

50|$|The {{monument}} {{in memory of}} the Ukrainian victims of AK in Sahryń awaits its official unveiling. It was erected in 2009, with the hope that both Ukrainian and Polish <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> attend the ceremonies, but there were spelling errors discovered in the names. The monument was built by the Ukrainian side, with Polish participation.|$|R
5|$|In 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz {{planned a}} summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, an {{historic}} first meeting between a U.S. {{president and a}} Mexican president and also the first time an American <b>president</b> <b>would</b> cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose {{on both sides of}} the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Burnham was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Díaz.|$|E
5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Presidency was {{established}} in 1990 and the <b>President</b> <b>would,</b> according to the altered constitution, be elected by the Soviet people by direct and secret ballot. However, {{the first and only}} Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev, was elected by the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies. In connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union national elections for the office of President never took place. To be elected to the office a person must have been a Soviet citizen and older than thirty-five but younger than sixty-five years. The same person could not be elected president for more than two terms. The Presidency was the highest state office, and was the most important office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition, eclipsing that of Premier and General Secretary. With the establishment of the Presidency executive power was shared between the President and the Prime Minister. The Presidency was given broad powers, such as being responsible for negotiating the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers with the Supreme Soviet; the Prime Minister, however, was responsible for managing the nomenklatura and economic matters.|$|E
