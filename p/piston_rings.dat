2500|$|Rotor sealing. This {{is still}} a minor problem as the engine housing has vastly {{different}} temperatures in each separate chamber section. The different expansion coefficients of the materials leads to imperfect sealing. Additionally, {{both sides of the}} seals are exposed to fuel, and the design does not allow for controlling the lubrication of the rotors accurately and precisely. Rotary engines tend to be overlubricated at all engine speeds and loads, and have relatively high oil consumption and other problems resulting from excess oil in the combustion areas of the engine, such as carbon formation and excessive emissions from burning oil. By comparison, a piston engine has all functions of a cycle in the same chamber giving a more stable temperature for <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> to act against. Additionally, only one side of the piston in a (four-stroke) piston engine is being exposed to fuel, allowing for oil to lubricate the cylinders from the other side. Piston engine components can also be designed to increase ring sealing and oil control as cylinder pressures and power levels increase.
