With careful observations at the meniscus part during the pulling, {{we found that}} the faceting formation is closely correlated with a "dog-leg" footing in combination with unsteady melt convection modes. It is assumed that one of predominant origin of the so-called spiralgrowth should be the faceting inclined against the <b>pulling</b> <b>axis</b> at the meniscus part of the solid-liquid interface.

40|$|AbstractA {{coarse-grained}} {{model of}} the nucleosome is introduced to investigate the dynamics of force-induced unwrapping of DNA from histone octamers. In this model, the DNA is treated as a charged, discrete worm-like chain, and the octamer is treated as a rigid cylinder carrying a positively charged superhelical groove that accommodates 1. 7 turns of DNA. The groove charges are parameterized to reproduce the nonuniform histone/DNA interaction free energy profile and the loading rate-dependent unwrapping forces, both obtained from single-molecule experiments. Brownian dynamics simulations of the model under constant loading conditions reveal that nucleosome unraveling occurs in three distinct stages. At small extensions, the flanking DNA exhibits rapid unwrapping-rewrapping (breathing) dynamics and the octamer flips ∼ 180 ° and moves toward the <b>pulling</b> <b>axis.</b> At intermediate extensions, the outer turn of DNA unwraps gradually and the octamer swivels about the taut linkers and flips a further ∼ 90 ° to orient its superhelical axis almost parallel to the <b>pulling</b> <b>axis.</b> At large extensions, a portion of the inner turn unwraps abruptly with a notable rip in the force-extension plot and a > 90 ° flip of the octamer. The remaining inner turn unwraps reversibly to leave {{a small portion of}} DNA attached to the octamer despite extended pulling. Our simulations further reveal that the nonuniform histone/DNA interactions in canonical nucleosomes serve to: stabilize the inner turn against unraveling while enhancing the breathing dynamics of the nucleosome and prevent dissociation of the octamer from the DNA while facilitating its mobility along the DNA. Thus, the modulation of the histone/DNA interactions could constitute one possible mechanism for regulating the accessibility of the nucleosome-wound DNA sequences...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{aluminium}} tubes {{have very}} important industrial applications, particularly in automobile industry. Tube drawing process {{is widely used}} to reduce the outer and inner diameters of tubes. An important issue in the tube drawing process to obtain variable wall thickness is how to determinate and predict its formability limits. Previously published works generally deal with the formability limit of conventional tube drawing based on experimental analysis, analytical method and finite element method. However, {{in the case of}} variable wall thickness tubes, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge and data in order to predict their limit of formability. In the present study, both theoretical and experimental methods are proposed for estimating the formability limit of the variable wall thickness aluminium tubes used for the transportation purposes. A modification of a conical mandrel was proposed and a special control system for mandrel displacement during the process was used to carry out the drawing tests. During the drawing process, the tube <b>pulling</b> <b>axis</b> was controlled at constant speed while the mandrel was moved to achieve the continuously variable wall thickness. The formability limit in term of minimum wall thickness and maximum area reduction was obtained before tube rupture. These values are useful data for the determination of the extent of deformation during a drawing process that a material can experience without failure. The maximum drawing stress ratio was also determined experimentally. Further, an extension of an upper bound solution developed in previous publications is proposed to predict the drawing stress field. The maximum drawing stress ratio was used as a criterion for fracture analysis. It was shown that the analytical model with its new extension combined to the fracture criterion predicts quite well the thickness and area reduction limit. The experimental studies were completed by examining the microstructure and strain field at the limit state...|$|R

He was deposed in a coup, and the Allies struck quickly, hoping resistance would be slight. The first Allied troops landed on the Italian peninsula on 3 September 1943 and Italy surrendered on 8 September, however the Italian Social Republic was established soon afterwards. The first American troops landed at Salerno on 9 September 1943, by U.S. 5th Army, however German troops in Italy were prepared and after the Allied troops at Salerno had consolidated their beachhead, The Germans launched fierce counterattacks. However they failed to destroy the beachhead and retreated on 16 September and in October 1943 began preparing a series of defensive lines across central Italy. The US 5th Army and other Allied armies broke through the first two lines (Volturno and the Barbara Line) in October and November 1943. As winter approached, the Allies made slow progress due to {{the weather and the}} difficult terrain against the heavily defended German Winter Line, they did however manage to breakthrough the Bernhardt Line in January 1944. By early 1944 the Allied attention had turned to the western front and the Allies were taking heavy losses trying to breakthrough the Winter line at Monte Cassino. The Allies Landed at Anzio on 22 January 1944 with the aim of outflanking the Gustav line and <b>pulling</b> <b>Axis</b> forces out of it so other allied armies could breakthrough. After slow progress, the Germans counterattacked in February but failed to stamp out the Allies, after months of stalemate, the Allies broke out in May 1944 and Rome fell to the Allies on 4 June 1944.Following the Normandy invasion in on 6 June 1944, the Equivalent of seven US and French divisions were pulled out of Italy to Participate in Operation Dragoon: the allied landings in southern France, despite this the remaining US forces in Italy with other Allied forces pushed up to the Gothic line in northern Italy, the last major defensive line. From August 1944 to March 1945 the Allies managed to breach the formidable defenses but they narrowly failed to break out into the Lombardy Plains before the winter weather closed in and made further progress impossible. In April 1945 the Allies broke through the remaining Axis positions in Operation Grapeshot ending the Italian Campaign on 2 May 1945, US forces in mainland Italy suffered between 114,000 and over 119,000 casualties.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} experimental and numerical {{investigation of the}} directional-solidification growth patterns in thin films of the CBr 4 - 8 mol% C 2 Cl 6 alloy, {{as a function of}} the orientation of the (fcc) crystal with respect to the solidification setup. Most experiments are performed with single-crystal samples about 10 mm wide and 15 mu m thick. The crystal sometimes contains small faceted gas inclusions, the shape of which gives us direct information about the orientation of the crystal. Numerical simulations by a fully dynamical method are carried out with parameters corresponding to the experimental system. We find experimentally that, in crystals with a (111) plane (nearly) parallel to the plane of the thin film, the growth pattern is nondendritic and unsteady over the explored velocity range (5 Vc- 50 Vc; Vc approximately= 1. 9 mu m s- 1 is the cellular threshold velocity). By studying the time evolution of this pattern, we establish that it is essentially similar to the "seaweed pattern" characteristic of vanishingly small capillary and kinetic anisotropies of the solid-liquid interface, recently studied numerically (T. Ihle and H. Muller-Krumbhaar, Phys. Rev. E 49, 2972 (1994)). The building blocks of this pattern are local structures-pairs of symmetry-broken (SE) fingers called "SE double fingers" or "doublons", and more complex structures called "multiplets"-whose lifetime is long but finite. We show experimentally that, in agreement with numerical findings, doublons obey selection rules, but do not have a preferential growth direction. We furthermore find that "dendritic" doublons also appear in crystals with a (100) axis close to the pulling direction (thus having a strong two-dimensional anisotropy) above a critical velocity (approximately= 20 Vc). The existence and stability of dendritic doublons in directional solidification at high velocity are confirmed by the simulations. Another crystal orientation of interest is that in which two (100) axes are symmetrically tilted at +or- 45 degrees with respect to the <b>pulling</b> <b>axis.</b> We show experimentally and numerically that the nondendritic unsteady "degenerate" pattern observed in this case, and previously noticed by F. Heslot and A. Libchaber (Phys. Scr. T 9, 126 (1985)), is qualitatively different from the seaweed pattern. In crystals close to this orientation, we find experimentally transitions between the degenerate and the two possible tilted dendritic states. The small amplitude of the sidebranches of dendrites in our system and the fact that the simulations with a purely capillary anisotropy do not reproduce these transitions lead us to attribute them to the increasing effect of kinetic anisotropy as the pulling velocity increase...|$|R
30|$|Our aim is {{to focus}} on the {{trajectory}} of the slider. However, we must here mention previous results obtained concerning the anisotropic friction. At the microscopic scale, the possibility to measure the normal and the components of the force applied the AFM tip [11] made the latter an appropriate tool to study the friction at the atomic level [12]. In the case of an anisotropic surface, the tip is subjected to a transverse force which can be also measured by considering the torsion of the cantilever [13]. At the macroscopic scale, measurements of the frictional force showed that the “maximum energy release rate” criterion should apply but the two components of the force were not obtained indepently [14]. Another interesting effect of the transverse frictional force is the torque applied to a wheel <b>pulled</b> along its <b>axis</b> across the surface [15, 16].|$|R
50|$|Because of a planet's {{rotation}} {{around its}} own axis, the gravitational acceleration is less at the equator {{than at the}} poles. In the 17th century, following {{the invention of the}} pendulum clock, French scientists found that clocks sent to French Guiana, on the northern coast of South America, ran slower than their exact counterparts in Paris. Measurements of the acceleration due to gravity at the equator must also take into account the planet's rotation. Any object that is stationary with respect {{to the surface of the}} Earth is actually following a circular trajectory, circumnavigating the Earth's <b>axis.</b> <b>Pulling</b> an object into such a circular trajectory requires a force. The acceleration that is required to circumnavigate the Earth's axis along the equator at one revolution per sidereal day is 0.0339 m/s². Providing this acceleration decreases the effective gravitational acceleration. At the equator, the effective gravitational acceleration is 9.7805 m/s2. This means that the true gravitational acceleration at the equator must be 9.8144 m/s2 (9.7805 + 0.0339 = 9.8144).|$|R

The first proposes that strong forces induce a phase transition to a molten state consisting of unhybridized single strands. The second picture introduces an elongated hybridized phase called S-DNA. Little thermodynamic evidence exists to discriminate directly between these competing pictures. Here we show that within a microscopic model of DNA we can distinguish between the dynamics associated with each. In experiment, considerable hysteresis in a cycle of stretching and shortening develops as temperature is increased. Since there are few possible causes of hysteresis in a system whose extent is appreciable in only one dimension, such behavior offers a discriminating test of the two pictures of overstretching. Most experiments are performed upon nicked DNA, permitting the detachment (unpeeling) of strands. We show that the long-wavelength progression of the unpeeled front generates hysteresis, the character of which agrees with experiment only if we assume the existence of S-DNA. We also show that internal melting can generate hysteresis, the degree of which depends upon the nonextensive loop entropy of single-stranded DNA...|$|R
40|$|When <b>pulled</b> {{along the}} <b>axis,</b> double-strand DNA {{undergoes}} a large conformational change and elongates by roughly twice its initial contour length at a pulling force of about 70 pN. The transition to this highly overstretched form of DNA is very cooperative. Applying a force {{perpendicular to the}} DNA axis (unzipping), double-strand DNA can also be separated into two single-stranded DNA, this being a fundamental process in DNA replication. We study the DNA overstretching and unzipping transition using fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and argue that the conformational changes of double-strand DNA associated with either of the above mentioned processes {{can be viewed as}} force induced DNA melting. As the force {{at one end of the}} DNA is increased the DNA starts melting abruptly/smoothly above a critical force depending on the pulling direction. The critical force fm, at which DNA melts completely decreases as the temperature of the system is increased. The melting force in the case of unzipping is smaller compared to the melting force when the DNA is pulled along the helical axis. In the case of melting through unzipping, the double-strand separation has jumps which correspond to the different energy minima arising due to sequence of different base pairs. The fraction of Watson–Crick base pair hydrogen bond breaking as a function of force does not show smooth and continuous behavior and consists of plateaus followed by sharp jumps...|$|R

40|$|Rather than {{investigating}} the indications for mesh in prolapse surgery, {{the focus of}} this study was on searching the ideal mesh. When starting from the design table, manufacturers would ask the end-users for the physical properties the textile pelvic floor enforcement or substitute would need to have. One of the first tools in such an endeavor would be to calculate what range of forces, or estimate what deformation potential such implant would need to have. Such theoretical mathematical model, which can be used to calculate the effect of manipulation of each of the contributing variables, could help understand both the mechanism leading to prolapse, as well as helping in designing more appropriate mesh materials from a biomechanical viewpoint. We herein propose a mathematical model for that purpose, as was done previously for abdominal wall reconstruction following either hernia or evisceration. We estimated with our model a range of membrane tensions at the urogenital hiatus and mid-pelvis. We did so for patients with and without prolapse, and based ourselves on actual geometric variables and abdominal pressure values measured at rest and valsalva. We calculated a membrane tension at the urogenital hiatus at rest at around 0. 35 N/cm. Surprisingly the calculated membrane tensions are much lower than what is reported for the abdominal cavity (16 N/cm). One of the reason for these larger values is that the abdominal pressures used for calculation of the membrane tension in that study, where higher (2 N/cm) than what we, as well as others have measured (0. 27 N/cm). Conversely lower pressures would yield membrane tensions in the abdominal wall closer to what we calculated. But apart from that the factor abdominal pressure, lower tensions are also logic in the pelvis as opposed to higher in the abdomen, certainly when considering the law of Laplace. Larger dimensions inherently result in larger membrane tensions. The body copes with these larger forces higher up in the abdomen, by a thicker abdominal wall. Based on Laplaces law, on valsalva, membrane tensions increased (in non-prolapse patients) to 0. 85 N/cm (factor 2. 5). In prolapse the factor by which it increases is 3. 6. The difference between POP- and POP+ can be explained largely by an increased anatomical dimension in case of prolapse, which does not answer the question whether this is the cause or effect of the prolapse. For prolapse patients, this effect becomes even more important when taking the specific orientation of the structures. We did show that due to alterations in the presumed orientation of the tissues during valsalva, the adjusted membrane tensions were up to five times higher. The above mathematically modeled membrane tensions are much lower than what current implant materials have. For instance, Gynemesh M (Ethicon), which was used throughout several experiments in this thesis 127, 128, has a membrane tension of 630 N/cm ex vivo, which exceeds by far the forces it is exposed to. This would suggest that there might is lots of room for constructing a more ideal mesh material. Other frequently used pelvic floor meshes (which are typically heavier) have even larger tensions. In other words, the currently available implants are still over-engineered. Biomechanical testing may be even more important in post implantation research. Biomechanical studies provide quantitative information on the generation of and response to physical forces present within implants or tissues. The base line tests are destructive in nature and subject implants or explants to an increasing force, while the consecutive displacement is measured. In uni-axial experiments a rectangular sample is subjected to forces <b>pulling</b> along the <b>axis</b> of the sample. This generates a plot which can for biological tissues typically is divided in 3 regions: an initial linear region of low stress and strain, followed by a transition to a linear region at higher stress and strain, until final failure. When un-implanted textiles are subject to such uniaxial tensiometry such plot actually provides information about the properties of the structure. Most multi-axial testing subjects the implant to forces perpendicular to the test sample and information about the behaviour of the fibers or filaments of the implant, rather than their interaction as a structure. We were interested in measuring both within the framework of a single experiment. During the research period, a custom build inflation device became available. The device exposes the tested im- or explant to pressures generated by compressed fluid, while the displacement is being optically measured. We demonstrated that for a given material, which was stiffer on uni-axial measurement, that material was also stiffer when subjected to multi-axial testing. Though at first glance multiaxial testing would seem to substitute other biomechanics tests, we experimentally and mathematically demonstrated that both test generated different hence more comprehensive complementary information. Ideally future experiments should provide results from both tests. Another observation was that, irrespective of the testing method, explants maintained a supra-physiologic or stiffer profile. Our research was not only methodological, but also (pre) clinical. We used the uni-axial experimental set up to look at biomechanical changes following host tissue ingrowth. We did so for a stiff, heavier mesh (SPMM, Covidien) as well as a lighter mesh (Gynemesh M, Johnson&Johnson Medical, Norderstedt, Germany). Interestingly, though prior to implantation there were significant differences between these dry implants, in-growth of host tissues made those differences disappear (uniaxial at 120 days). At first glance, it would thus seem that prior manipulation of the textile properties of the implant are in vain, as they disappear after incorporation into the host. In another (again uni-axial) experiment however, we demonstrated that this is not always so. Anisotropic fabrics, such as Gynemesh M, apparently keep their anisotropic properties following implantation, though the differential properties attenuate over time. Again, as before, also in that experiment, the ultimate compliance of the implant remained less than that of normal, native tissues. This lead again to the conclusion that from this perspective available meshes remain still far from ideal. This observation was a constant throughout all further experiments. This opens doors for further innovation and improvement. Speculating that structure of the textiles determines the ultimate biomechanical (hence functional) properties, one might improve the mesh biomechanics (prior to implantation), as well as to decrease the host response, for instance by using progressively lighter materials. This can be achieved by structural changes (increasing pore size) and/or less and smaller diameter polymers, or use different polymer materials. We experimentally investigated shrinkage and biomechanical properties of implants with a residual weight of residual non-resorbable fibers (PP or PVDF) at or below 32 g/m². PP- 32 actually {{turned out to be more}} compliant than PP- 8, at least with a structure as we tested it. Following incorporation that difference disappeared. The reason for that remains unclear; we have not yet documented the ultrastructural features of the host response. Also, very light materials were shrinking, which we did not observe when using 32 g/m² implants. In conclusion, though manufacturers, through changing the polymers and/or the structure may change the dry biomechanical properties, not all of these persist after implantation. Again in these experiments we keep on demonstrating that explants by no means have the properties of native tissues. Therefore, there is still a role for innovation and manufacturers may start drawing novel products. Perhaps they should start sketching on their design tables starting from the biomechanical properties of healthy native tissues, rather than incremental small modifications of existing products, which eventually remain far too strong and not as compliant. In the latter study we also made a clinically relevant observation. Dry materials may become structurally so elastic, that they become materials which are difficult if not impossible to handle from a surgical viewpoint. One solution is to enforce the structure by adding resorbable fibers (or sheets), so that handling properties increase. We demonstrated that polyglecaprone fibers did not compromise the biomechanical properties following in growth, whereas sheets did not allow this to happen. In the same experiment on different light weight meshes (&# 8804; 32 g/m²),we fully documented the non-linear stress-strain relationship of the different biological tissues. We adapted the bilinear model, as initially described by Jones et al. for implant materials in dry conditions. We defined the low stress zone or comfort zone as that zone, where physiologic forces and displacements are expected, and perhaps of more functional relevance. We believe this differentiation is also relevant to textile design. It intuitively seems logic that designers should concentrate on the biomechanical properties of future explants in that range of forces. Meanwhile the concept was picked up in the hernia literature as well. Our research addressed another factor which may be important for the ultimate biomechanics of implants following incorporation into the host. The above studies, as well as the bulk of our and other groups research evaluate implants following their use for reconstructing the abdominal wall. The environmental factors in the vagina differ much from that in the abdominal wall and might result in different host response, fibrosis and biomechanical properties of the implanted material. For that reason, one cannot extrapolate such findings to vaginal mesh insertion and it might be better to study vaginal meshes in purpose|$|R
