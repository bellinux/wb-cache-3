5|$|Despite {{the strong}} economy, the Bay Area's housing market {{and cost of}} living is {{becoming}} increasingly expensive. As of 2017, the average income {{needed in order to}} purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000. Because of the high cost of living, many workers in the Bay Area live far from their <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute from neighboring San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily.|$|E

When he returned home, he took a photograph of her body with a four-day-old issue of the Anchorage Daily News, maintaining the illusion {{that she was still}} alive in his ransom demand. After demanding $30,000 in ransom, Keyes dismembered Koenig and disposed of her body in Matanuska Lake north of Anchorage.|$|E
25|$|Forced labour {{can also}} be imposed by governments who “conscript their own {{subjects}} and put them to work for minimal, or no pay, and for varying lengths of time”. When imposed by governments, forced labour does not include military conscription or penal labour. Forced labour can, likewise, be used simply to cut production costs by private and public industries (e.g. cocoa plantations), or can {{be a form of}} involuntary servitude in the private sector – sweatshops. Bales refers to this type of slavery as contract slavery, where “contracts are offered which guarantee employment, perhaps in a workshop or factory, but when the workers are taken to their <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> they discover that they have instead been taken into slavery...it is a way of making slavery seem legitimate and necessary”.|$|E

Salaries should be made in legal tender, however, part payment in kind is not prohibited provided it is appropriate for the personal use and benefit of employee and his family, and the value attributable to such payment in kind is fair and reasonable. The payment in kind should not exceed forty per cent of the total amount paid out to the employee.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, All in the Family added two new neighbors to the neighborhood, Frank Lorenzo and his feisty Irish-American wife, Irene. Lear had been the {{publicity}} man for Call Me Mister, All in the Family writers Bernard West and Mickey West knew Garrett from her days with the American Youth Theatre, and Jean Stapleton {{had been in the}} cast of Bells Are Ringing, so Garrett appeared to be a frontrunner for the role of Irene. It went instead to Sada Thompson, but, unhappy after filming one episode, Thompson asked to be released from her commitment, freeing the role for Garrett. Irene was Catholic -- a source of annoyance for Protestant Archie -- and assumed many of the household duties normally associated with husbands, and she therefore presented a kind of nemesis to Archie Bunker. She later worked with Archie at his <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> driving a forklift, and was paid less than the man she replaced (but more than Archie). Garrett remained with the series from 1973 through 1975. She won the 1974 Golden Globe for her performance on the series.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{problems}} have arisen {{when attempting to}} establish where detours and leave from duty take an employee out of {{the course of his}} employment. One idea which is used in this area is that an employer will only be found liable where an employee is going about his business in a standard way. For example, a minor detour would not take an employee out of the course of his employment, but a 'frolic of his own', which did not at all involve his duties, would. Journeys to and from work, and whether these are regarded as in the course of employment, were considered in Smith v Stages, where Lord Lowry established several factors for determining liability. Ordinarily, employees will not be in the course of employment travelling to and from work, unless their transport is provided by their employer. However, travelling to an alternative place of work or to a workplace, during the employer's time, will be in the course of employment. Where course of employment generally begins with travelling to work has been established in the case of Compton v McClure. Here, an employer was found liable for the negligent driving of an employee, who, in an effort to clock in on time, injured another employee at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> It was stated that the 'least artificial place' to establish employment began was at the gates of the employer's factory, where they established speed limits, and supervised conduct.|$|E
