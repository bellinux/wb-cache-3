30|$|Takayasu {{arteritis}} (TA) is a necrotising and obliterative segmental, large-vessel <b>panarteritis</b> {{of unknown}} cause, involving elastic arteries including the aorta and its branches. T-cell-mediated <b>panarteritis</b> {{starts in the}} adventitial vasa vasorum and progresses inwards, with the unknown antigen triggering monoclonal T-cell expansion [1, 17]. This inflammatory process begins with perivascular cuffing of the vasa vasorum in the early stage of the disease followed by fibrosis and calcifications [18]. Destruction and fibrosis coexist with the former, causing aneurysmal formation and the latter leading to narrowing of the aorta and its branches, resulting in significant stenosis. Takayasu artertitis {{is also known as}} “pulseless disease” from the frequent involvement of subclavian arteries with substantial stenosis and subsequently diminished peripheral pulses [5].|$|E

40|$|Objective. Takayasu’s {{arteritis}} (TA) is a chronic, rare granulomatous <b>panarteritis</b> {{of unknown}} aetiology involving mainly the aorta and its major branches. In this study, genetic susceptibility to TA {{has been investigated}} by screening the functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of PTPN 22 gene encoding the lymphoid-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase. Methods. Totally, 181 patients with TA and 177 healthy controls are genotyped by PCR-RFLP method for the SNP rs 2476601 (A/G) of PTPN 22 gene. Polymorphic region was amplified by PCR and digested with Xcm I enzyme. Results. Detected frequencies of heterozygous genotype (AG) were 5. 1 % (9 / 177) in control group and 3. 8 % (7 / 181) in TA group (P 0. 61, odds ratio: 0. 75, 95 % CI: 0. 3, 2. 0).

40|$|AbstractAneurysms of the aortic {{root and}} {{ascending}} aorta are often due to degenerative disease of media but tuberculosis {{is an important}} but extremely rare cause of aortic root dilatation especially in tropical countries like India where tuberculosis is endemic. Tubercular aneurysmal dilatation of aorta with dissection leading to aortic regurgitation is a rare but important complication of tuberculosis. With worldwide resurgence of tuberculosis due to increasing incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis and its association with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the tubercular aneurysm has become a real clinical entity. Although tubercular aortitis is fairly common, tuberculous mycotic aneurysm of the aorta is rare, with involvement of the aortic root being exceedingly uncommon.

We have developed a sensitive and specific ELISA for human LIF, and tested the circulating cytokine levels in various disease states, some of which are associated with inflammation. LIF was detected in 11 / 20 sera from patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a vasculitis syndrome affecting particularly the temporal artery, characterized by <b>panarteritis</b> with inflammatory cell infiltration. LIF levels were considerably elevated in some patients who also displayed elevated levels of IL- 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP); however, no correlation was observed between the levels of circulating LIF and levels of IL- 6 or CRP.

40|$|Iodine {{derivatives}} {{are used}} as contrast media in radiology and as drugs to treat pulmonary disorders as well as erythema nodosum. Their use may cause side effects such as dysfunction of the tyroid and salivary glands or allergic reaction. Other side effects are the so-called "iodides":, skin eruptions characterized by papules and pustoles. These lesions can evolve towards characteristic nodules, seen in typical vegetating pyodermitis or iododerma. In its initial phase this disease is characterized by papules and pustoles that evolve in paseudotumoral vegetating lesions. Different pathogenetic hipotheses have been proposed to explain the onset of iododerma in patients exposed to contrast media or drugs containing iodine such as an immunological mechanism, suggest by the frequent presence of eosinophils in both skin lesions and peripheral blood, or an direct mechanism : iodine may directly activate eosinophils. Iododerma have been reported associated with multiple myeloma, lymphomas, arthritis, <b>panarteritis</b> nodosa, subacute glomerulonephritis and pulmonary disorders. We observed a 62 -years-old womano with vegetating, soft nodular lesions sited on her ears and fingers, fever and mild dysponea and whistlings and wheezing: a case of vegetating iododerma with noticeable pulmonary infiltration.

Cyclosporin A was started and seemed clinically effective. In contrast to the positive effect on inflammatory parameters, ie, C-reactive protein and white blood cell counts, a novel plasma marker for cytotoxicity (granzyme B) remained elevated. Coronary disease progressed to fatal obstruction and myocardial infarction. Echocardiography, electrocardiograms, and myocardial creatine phosphokinase did not predict impending death. At autopsy an obliterative <b>panarteritis</b> was observed resulting from massive fibrointimal proliferation, affecting the aorta and several large and medium-sized arteries. Immunophenotypic analysis of the inflammatory infiltrates in arteries revealed mainly granzyme-positive cytotoxic T cells and macrophages in the intima and media, as well as nodular aggregates of T cells, B cells, and plasma cells in the adventitia of affected arteries.

40|$|Radiation induced {{carotid artery}} {{stenosis}} (RICS) is a known complication of {{head and neck}} radiation therapy. Latency period of carotid stenosis following radiation is prolonged and sometimes it may be up to 20 years [1]. Underlying pathophysiology of carotid stenosis following radiation {{is thought to be}} accelerated atherosclerosis or <b>panarteritis</b> triggered by radiation [2, 3]. Surgical carotid endarterectomy is diff icult and challenging in this situation because of associated scarring of vessel wall and tissue planes, involvement of long segment, presence of both intracranial and extracranial stenosis and inadequate wound healing and closure following the procedure [4, 5]. Carotid angioplasty and stenting is more appropriate and provide maximum benefit in surgically inappropriate and high risk patients such as RICS [6, 7].

Vision is affected in 25 - 50 % of GCA patients. Affection of vision may be the first GCA symptom or a symptom which occurs weeks or months after the initial symptoms of the disease. Permanent damage to the patient's vision is a serious consequence of GCA. Arteritic Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy (AION) is the most frequent and most serious visual manifestation of GCA. It is manifested by partial or total loss of vision. Arteritic AION therapy in GCA uses high doses ofglucocorticoids, but glucocorticoid therapy has a number of adverse effects.

We report a case of a 55 -year old female with biopsy-verified GCA whose primary manifestation was bilateral arteritic AION resulting in a complete loss of vision in one eye and dramatic worsening of visual acuity in the other eye. Even after diagnosis glucocorticoid therapy could not salvage her vision and led to secondary complications.

When admitted to hospital with a suspected postinfectious glomerulonephritis, he com-plained of spontaneous colic-like pains in the left flank. Laboratory findings were as follows: serum total protein was 63 g/l and albumin, 24 g/l. Blood urea nitrogen was 20 mmol/l and creatinine, 469 mmol/l. On the 17 th day of admission he developed acute abdominal pain, combined with haemorrhagic shock. Hb fell rapidly from 10. 5 to 4 g/dl. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen revealed perirenal haematoma with dubious contrast escape from the right renal capsule. On operation, this {{was found to be}} a rupture of the kidney with perirenal bleeding, which was treated without removing the kidney (Figure 1). No biopsy was taken, but serological tests showed antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (cANCA), indicating Wegener’s granulomatosis as the cause of renal insufficiency and spontaneous renal rupture. Postoperatively, the patient’s condition deteriorated fast and he died 2 days before surgery. Spontaneous renal rupture is rare, but may be the first sign of Wegener’s granulomatosis. To our knowledge, no case of spontaneous renal rupture due to Wegener’s granulomatosis has been reported in the medical literature. Our case had a similar presenta-tion to an acute abdomen, which is a perplexing problem for the physician.

40|$|In a {{significant}} percentage of examined cases of fulminant hepatitis, subacute hepatitis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and chronic persistent hepatitis, Australia (hepatitis-associated) antigen (Au HAA) was identified in the liver and in extrahepatic locations. The several immunofluorescent patterns of Au HAA localization in hepatocytes strongly suggested various stages of Au HAA accumulation and release. Deposits of a mixture of immunoglobulins G and M and occasionally β 1 C-globulin were found in the cytoplasm of Au HAA containing hepatocytes, on their plasma membranes, on or in the nuclei, in the cytoplasm of Kupffer cells and, rarely, in the sinusoids. The accompanying tissue changes were hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis. These intra- and extracellular complexes of Au HAA and immunoglobulins displayed strong affinity for guinea pig complement in the immunohistochemical complement fixation reaction. When tested by immunodiffusion in agar, IgG dissociated from these complexes by potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) treatment showed anti-Au HAA specificity. In fulminant hepatitis neither Au HAA nor immunoglobulins and complement were found in the liver. In chronic aggressive hepatitis and subacute hepatitis the amount of the Au HAA immune complexes identified in the liver was approximately inversely proportional to the extent and severity of the parenchymal lesions. In liver cirrhosis and chronic persistent hepatitis there was a positive correlation between the amount of the Au HAA immune complexes found in the liver and the degree of hepatocellular damage. The deposits of Au HAA, identified in extrahepatic locations including germinal centers of lymph nodes and spleen, kidney glomeruli and blood vessel walls, were as a rule accompanied by deposits of IgG, IgM, β 1 C-globulin and fibrin. All these deposits showed strong affinity for guinea pig complement in the immunohistochemical reaction of complement fixation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Panarteritis</b> nodosa (PAN) is a {{systemic}} vasculitis affecting {{small and medium-sized}} arteries. Neuro-ophthalmological complications of PAN are rare but numerous, and may affect the eye, the visual and the oculomotor pathways. Such complications occur mainly in patients previously diagnosed with PAN. OBSERVATION: A 51 -year-old woman presented with an isolated right trochlear (IV) palsy, {{in the setting of}} headaches and fluctuating fever of unknown etiology. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 13 mm and full blood cell count was normal. Previous chest X-ray and blood studies were negative for an infection or inflammation. Orbital and cerebral CT scan was normal. Spontaneous recovery of diplopia ensued over four days. Two days later, paresthesia and sensory paresis of the dorsal portion of the left foot were present. Lumbar puncture revealed 14 leucocytes (76 percent lymphocytes) with elevated proteins, but blood studies and serologies were negative. A diagnosis of undetermined meningo-myelo-radiculoneuritis was made. Because of a possible tick bite six weeks previously the patient was empirically treated with 2 g intravenous ceftriaxone for 3 weeks. Fever rapidly dropped. Six weeks after the onset of diplopia, acute onset of blindness in her right eye, diffuse arthralgias and fever motivated a new hospitalization. There was a central retinal artery occlusion of the right eye. Blood studies now revealed signs of systemic inflammation (ESR 30 mm, CRP 12 mg/L, ANA 1 / 80, pANCA 1 / 40, leucocytosis 12. 4 G/L, Hb 111 g/L, Ht 33 percent). Biopsy of the left sural nerve revealed arterial fibrinoid necrosis. A diagnosis of PAN was made. CONCLUSIONS: Transient diplopia can be the heralding symptom of {{a systemic}} vasculitis such as PAN, giant cell arteritis and Wegener granulomatosis. In this patient the presence of accompanying systemic symptoms raised a suspicion of systemic inflammation, but the absence of serologic and imaging abnormalities precluded a specific diagnosis initially. A few weeks later, the presence of a second ischemic event (retinal) and positive blood studies led to a further diagnostic procedure. Oculomotor and abducens palsies have rarely been reported in association with PAN. We report the first case of trochlear nerve paresis as the inaugural neurological sign of PAN. This case highlights the importance of considering inflammatory systemic disorders in patients with acute diplopia particularly when they are young, lack vascular risk factors or cause, and complain of associated systemic symptoms...|$|E
