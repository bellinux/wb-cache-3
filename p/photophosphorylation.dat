5|$|Phototrophic archaea use {{light to}} produce {{chemical}} {{energy in the}} form of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of <b>photophosphorylation.</b> The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in the structure of a retinol cofactor buried {{in the center of the}} protein.|$|E
25|$|Cyclic {{electron}} transport or Cyclic <b>photophosphorylation</b> produces only ATP.|$|E
25|$|Noncyclic {{electron}} transport or Non-cyclic <b>photophosphorylation</b> produces NADPH + H+ and ATP.|$|E
25|$|This form of <b>photophosphorylation</b> {{occurs on}} the {{thylakoid}} membrane. In cyclic electron flow, the electron begins in a pigment complex called photosystem I, passes {{from the primary}} acceptor to pheophytin, then to cytochrome b6f (a similar complex to that found in mitochondria), and then to plastocyanin before returning to chlorophyll. This transport chain produces a proton-motive force, pumping H+ ions across the membrane; this produces a concentration gradient {{that can be used}} to power ATP synthase during chemiosmosis. This pathway is known as cyclic <b>photophosphorylation,</b> and it produces neither O2 nor NADPH. Unlike non-cyclic <b>photophosphorylation,</b> NADP+ does not accept the electrons; they are instead sent back to cytochrome b6f complex.|$|E
25|$|In {{bacterial}} photosynthesis, {{a single}} photosystem is used, and therefore {{is involved in}} cyclic <b>photophosphorylation.</b>|$|E

25|$|In <b>photophosphorylation,</b> {{light energy}} {{is used to}} create a high-energy {{electron}} donor and a lower-energy electron acceptor. Electrons then move spontaneously from donor to acceptor through an electron transport chain.|$|E
25|$|Together, these {{proteins}} {{make use}} of light energy to drive electron transport chains that generate a chemiosmotic potential across the thylakoid membrane and NADPH, {{a product of the}} terminal redox reaction. The ATP synthase uses the chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during <b>photophosphorylation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{thylakoid}} lumen is {{a continuous}} aqueous phase enclosed by the thylakoid membrane. It {{plays an important}} role for <b>photophosphorylation</b> during photosynthesis. During the light-dependent reaction, protons are pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen making it acidic down to pH 4.|$|E
25|$|The protons {{from the}} {{oxidized}} water molecules are {{released into the}} thylakoid lumen, thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient {{is the driving force}} for ATP synthesis via <b>photophosphorylation</b> and coupling the absorption of light energy and photolysis of water to the creation of chemical energy during photosynthesis. The O2 remaining after oxidation of the water molecule is released into the atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|Photolytic oxygen {{evolution}} {{occurs in}} the thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic organisms and requires the energy of four photons. Many steps are involved, but {{the result is the}} formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is used to synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via <b>photophosphorylation.</b> The [...] remaining (after production of the water molecule) is released into the atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|In plants, ATP is {{synthesized}} in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. [...] The {{process is}} called <b>photophosphorylation.</b> The [...] "machinery" [...] {{is similar to}} that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force. ATP synthase then ensues exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation. Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the Calvin cycle, which produces triose sugars.|$|E
2500|$|Another redox protein, {{isolated}} from spinach chloroplasts, was termed [...] "chloroplast ferredoxin". The chloroplast ferredoxin {{is involved in}} both cyclic and non-cyclic <b>photophosphorylation</b> reactions of photosynthesis. In non-cyclic <b>photophosphorylation,</b> ferredoxin is the last electron acceptor thus reducing the enzyme NADP+ reductase. [...] It accepts electrons produced from sunlight-excited chlorophyll and transfers them to the enzyme ferredoxin: NADP+ oxidoreductase [...]|$|E
2500|$|While photosystem II photolyzes {{water to}} obtain and {{energize}} new electrons, photosystem I simply reenergizes depleted electrons {{at the end}} of an electron transport chain. Normally, the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP+, though sometimes they can flow back down more H+-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP. This is termed cyclic <b>photophosphorylation</b> because the electrons are recycled. Cyclic <b>photophosphorylation</b> is common in [...] plants, which need more ATP than NADPH.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the process}} of photosynthesis, the {{phosphorylation}} of ADP to form ATP using the energy of sunlight is called <b>photophosphorylation.</b> [...] Only two sources of energy are available to living organisms: sunlight and reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions. [...] All organisms produce ATP, which is the universal energy currency of life.|$|E
2500|$|In {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from a low-energy electron donor (e.g., NADH) to an acceptor (e.g., O2) through an electron transport chain. [...] In <b>photophosphorylation,</b> {{the energy of}} sunlight is {{used to create a}} high-energy electron donor and an electron acceptor. [...] Electrons are then transferred from the donor to the acceptor through another electron transport chain.|$|E
2500|$|The other pathway, non-cyclic <b>photophosphorylation,</b> is a {{two-stage}} process involving {{two different}} chlorophyll photosystems. Being a light reaction, non-cyclic <b>photophosphorylation</b> {{occurs in the}} frets or stroma lamellae. First, a water molecule is broken down into 2H+ + 1/2 O2 + 2e− by a process called photolysis (or light-splitting). The two electrons from the water molecule are kept in photosystem II, while the 2H+ and 1/2O2 are left out for further use. Then a photon is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments surrounding the reaction core center of the photosystem. The light excites the electrons of each pigment, causing a chain reaction that eventually transfers energy {{to the core of}} photosystem II, exciting the two electrons that are transferred to the primary electron acceptor, pheophytin. The deficit of electrons is replenished by taking electrons from another molecule of water. The electrons transfer from pheophytin to plastoquinone, which takes the 2e− from Pheophytin, and two H+ atoms from the stroma and forms PQH2, which later is broken into PQ, the 2e− is released to Cytochrome b6f complex and the two H+ ions are released into thylakoid lumen. The electrons then pass through the Cyt b6 and Cyt f. Then they are passed to plastocyanin, [...] providing the energy for hydrogen ions (H+) to be pumped into the thylakoid space. This creates a gradient, making H+ ions flow back into the stroma of the chloroplast, providing the energy for the regeneration of ATP.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to the {{electron}} transport chain, the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis pump protons into the thylakoid lumen of chloroplasts {{to drive the}} synthesis of ATP by ATP synthase. The proton gradient can be generated through either noncyclic or cyclic <b>photophosphorylation.</b> Of the proteins that participate in noncyclic <b>photophosphorylation,</b> photosystem II (PSII), plastiquinone, and cytochrome b6f complex directly contribute to generating the proton gradient. For each four photons absorbed by PSII, eight protons are pumped into the lumen. The total equation for <b>photophosphorylation</b> is shown: ...|$|E
5000|$|Phosphinothricin is a {{glutamine}} synthetase inhibitor {{that binds}} to the glutamate site. Glufosinate-treated plants die {{due to a}} buildup of ammonia in the thylakoid lumen, leading to the uncoupling of <b>photophosphorylation.</b> [...] The uncoupling of <b>photophosphorylation</b> causes the production of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and membrane destruction.|$|E

50|$|Cytochrome b6f and ATP synthase work {{together}} to create ATP. This process is called <b>photophosphorylation,</b> which occurs in two different ways. In non-cyclic <b>photophosphorylation,</b> cytochrome b6f uses the energy of electrons from PSII to pump protons from the stroma to the lumen. The proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane creates a proton-motive force, used by ATP synthase to form ATP. In cyclic <b>photophosphorylation,</b> cytochrome b6f uses the energy of electrons from not only PSII but also PSI to create more ATP and to stop the production of NADPH. Cyclic phosphorylation is important to create ATP and maintain NADPH in the right proportion for the light-independent reactions.|$|E

50|$|It {{is one of}} the end {{products}} of <b>photophosphorylation,</b> aerobic respiration, and fermentation, and is used by enzymes and structural proteins in many cellular processes, including biosynthetic reactions, motility, and cell division. One molecule of ATP contains adenine, ribose, and three phosphate groups, and it is produced by a wide variety of enzymes, including ATP synthase, from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and various phosphate group donors.

[...] The exact mechanism for how plastoquinone is reduced by ferredoxin is still under investigation. One proposal is that there exists a ferredoxin:plastoquinone-reductase or an NADP dehydrogenase.
