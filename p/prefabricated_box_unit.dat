40|$|Abstract—In popular {{symmetric}} ciphers, S-box substitution is {{the core}} operation that dominates executions of cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, a method of application-specific instruction-set extension is used for accelerating the key operation in symmetric cryptography. Two instructions for S-box access are designed by constructing a novel flexible on-chip parallel substitution <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> that consists of multiple lookup tables and a post-processing module. The <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> is integrated into the 32 -bit configurable Leon 2 processor. Configuration of Leon 2 is presented. Implementing this extended processor core on Virtex-II XC 2 V 3000 FPGA shows that the parallel substitution <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> uses very small amount of hardware resources (1 KB of memory and some logic circuits). Evaluation {{of the performance of}} S-box access instructions for AES is conducted according to Amdahl Law, and the results show that overall speedup of greater than 2 can be achieved. Benefits for other symmetric ciphers using S-box substitution as their core operation are accordingly expected...|$|R

50|$|Electronic {{packaging}} {{is a major}} discipline {{within the}} field of electronic engineering, and includes a wide variety of technologies. It refers to enclosures and protective features built into the product itself, and not to shipping containers. It applies both to end products and to components. Packaging of an electronic system must consider protection from mechanical damage, cooling, radio frequency noise emission, protection from electrostatic discharge, maintenance, operator convenience, and cost. Prototypes and industrial equipment made in small quantities may use standardized commercially available enclosures such as card cages or <b>prefabricated</b> <b>boxes.</b> Mass-market consumer devices may have highly specialized packaging to increase consumer appeal. The same electronic system may be packaged as a portable device or adapted for fixed mounting in an instrument rack or permanent installation. Packaging for aerospace, marine, or military systems imposes different types of design criteria.|$|R

40|$|White <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> {{testing is}} the use of test inputs, derived from source code, to drive test {{coverage}} of a metric on that source code. While approaches based on control flow analysis exist for generating unit test inputs, these approaches are not readily applied to code that embeds control flow as static data. One specific example of such codes are the state machines built by parser generators. Control flow in these machine abstractions is based on static data that encodes a set of state transition rules. However, these rules also correspond to the recognition of productions in the grammar input to the parser generator. It is therefore feasible to develop white box tests for a parser based on an analysis of the input grammar. Using the structure of grammars, a methodology for white <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> testing a parser has been developed and will be presented in this thesis. Furthermore, a tool set that assists in automation of test generation will be described. This tool set is based on the use of a language grammar to create grammatical strings in that language. It will be shown how the set of strings in a language may be navigated in a principled fashion for the purpose of spanning the set of all language productions, and heuristics developed for resolving nonterminal symbols into strings of terminal symbols. A demonstration of how these tools were used to test a simple parser for the C programming language will also be given...|$|R

50|$|A {{box caisson}} is a <b>prefabricated</b> {{concrete}} <b>box</b> (it has sides and a bottom); {{it is set}} down on prepared bases. Once in place, {{it is filled with}} concrete {{to become part of the}} permanent works, such as the foundation for a bridge pier. Hollow concrete structures are usually less dense than water so a box caisson must be ballasted or anchored to keep it from floating until it can be filled with concrete. Sometimes elaborate anchoring systems may be required, such as in tidal zones. Adjustable anchoring systems combined with a GPS survey enable engineers to position a box caisson with pinpoint accuracy.|$|R
50|$|The Scottish-born Robert Gair {{invented the}} pre-cut {{cardboard}} or paperboard box in 1890 - flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes.

5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a <b>box</b> <b>unit,</b> and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mobile steel {{building}} is a prefabricated building built in a factory, with advantages on moving conveniently, simple structure and scalability. There are still not enough relevant standards and requirements to conduct the design and construction {{of this kind of}} buildings. In order to precede to theoretical study on integral structures of mobile steel buildings a method which used to set up finite element analysis model about this kind of structure was proposed. This method is based on finite element analysis software, ANSYS. Using this method a two-story structure model with one <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> in each story was analyzed. Lateral deformations under design load of the integral structure were solved out by these finite element models and were compared with the former experimental results, and the results were discussed...|$|R
