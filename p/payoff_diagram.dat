In {{this paper}} we analyze American style of {{floating}} strike Asian call options {{belonging to the}} class of financial derivatives whose <b>payoff</b> <b>diagram</b> depends {{not only on the}} underlying asset price but also on the path average of underlying asset prices over some predetermined time interval. The mathematical model for the option price leads to a free boundary problem for a parabolic partial differential equation. Applying fixed domain transformation and transformation of variables we develop an efficient numerical algorithm based on a solution to a non-local parabolic partial differential equation for the transformed variable representing the synthesized portfolio. For various types of averaging methods we investigate the dependence of the early exercise boundary on model parameters...|$|E
40|$|A {{covered call}} {{is a long}} {{position}} in a security and a short position in a call option on that security. Equity index covered calls are an attractive strategy to many investors because they have realized returns not much {{lower than those of}} the equity market but with much lower volatility. However, a number of myths about the strategy—from why it works to why an investor should or should not invest—have surfaced, {{and many of them are}} erroneously considered “common knowledge. ” The authors review the underlying risk and returns of covered call strategies and dispel eight common myths about them. A covered call is a combination of a long posi-tion in a security and a short position in a call option on the same security. The combined position caps the investor’s upside on the underlying security at the option’s strike price in exchange for an option premium. Figure 1 shows the covered call <b>payoff</b> <b>diagram,</b> including the option premium, at expiration when the call option is written at a $ 100 strike with a $ 25 option premium. The covered call strategy has generated atten-tion because of its attractive historical risk-adjuste...|$|E

The case considers {{the difficult task of}} introducing a new product into the market. Under consideration is a sophisticated, surface-scanning technology that has applications in the food processing, food retail, and health industry sectors. Management of eMerge Interactive is faced with uncertainties in legislation, demand, and competitor response. The case can be used as part of a course in strategy and/or risk management where tools such as influence <b>diagrams,</b> scenario and <b>payoff</b> matrices, decision trees, and real options are introduced. risk management, influence <b>diagrams,</b> <b>payoff</b> matrices, decision trees, and real options, Marketing,...|$|R
