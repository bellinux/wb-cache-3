40|$|International audienceBovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} was a novel {{spongiform encephalopathy}}, in an hitherto unaffected species, that had {{characteristics of a}} <b>point</b> <b>source</b> <b>epidemic,</b> with an agent {{that could have been}} incorporated into a wide variety of feedstuffs and iatrogenically administered to naïve populations, and there was early evidence that it was not restricted to bovines. It was vital to establish, albeit experimentally, which other species might be affected, and whether the epidemic could be maintained by natural transmission, if the source was removed. In contrast, scrapie has been endemic throughout Great Britain for centuries, is maintained naturally (even if we don't know exactly how) and has a known host range. The principles, process and integration of evidence from different types of studies, however, are similar for both of these transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) and can be applied to any emerging or suspected spongiform encephalopathy. This review discusses the experimental approaches used to determine TSE transmissibility and infectivity and how they relate to natural disease and control measures...|$|E
40|$|Trends in Australian {{heart disease}} {{mortality}} were assessed for {{association with the}} business cycle. Correlation models of mortality and unemployment series were used to test for association. An indicator series of "national stress" was developed. The three series were analyzed in path models to quantify the links between unemployment, national stress, and heart disease. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality and national stress were found to follow the business cycle. The two periods of accelerating IHD mortality coincided with economic recession. The proposed "wave hypothesis" links the trend in IHD mortality to the high unemployment of severe recession. The mortality trend describes a typical epidemic parabolic path from the Great Depression to 1975, with a smaller parabolic trend at the 1961 recession. These findings appear consistent with the hypothesis that heart disease is, to some degree, a <b>point</b> <b>source</b> <b>epidemic</b> arising with periods of severe economic recession. Forecasts under the hypothesis indicate {{a turning point in}} the mortality trend between 1976 and 1978. (Am J Public Health 69 : 772 - 781, 1979) ...|$|E
40|$|In 1987, an {{outbreak}} of primary tuberculosis occurred in a Canadian aboriginal community of 350 people. The source case {{was a young woman}} who had been symptomatic for four months with smear positive cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis. Her 17 siblings and their families were frequent close contacts. Among the 626 persons surveyed in the community and environs, 35 additional active cases of tuberculosis were identified. The mean age of cases was 13 years and the median age 10 years. The method of diagnosis was bacteriological in 20 and radiological in 16. There were 257 positive tuberculin reactors of whom 120 had no previous record of a positive skin test. Isoniazid prophylaxis was recommended to all new reactors, close household contacts, reactors under the age of 35 years and reactors with lung scars. One late case was identified at one year of follow-up in a contact who had refused prophylaxis. The rates of infection and disease were higher in the family (65 % and 46 %, respectively) than in the community and environs (19 % and 5. 6 %, respectively). This report illustrates the nature of a <b>point</b> <b>source</b> <b>epidemic</b> of primary tuberculosis in a susceptible community with a predictable reservoir of infection. The delay in diagnosis of the source case allowed numerous new infections to occur. However, prompt aggressive contact follow-up was successful in containing the epidemic.

40|$|MOPEX (MOsaicking and <b>Point</b> <b>source</b> EXtraction) is {{a package}} {{developed}} at the Spitzer Science Center for astronomical image processing. We report on the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> extraction capabilities of MOPEX. <b>Point</b> <b>source</b> extraction is implemented as a two step process: <b>point</b> <b>source</b> detection and profile fitting. Non-linear matched filtering of input images can be performed optionally to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and improve detection of faint <b>point</b> <b>sources.</b> <b>Point</b> Response Function (PRF) fitting of <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> produces the final <b>point</b> <b>source</b> list which includes the fluxes and improved positions of the <b>point</b> <b>sources,</b> along with other parameters characterizing the fit. Passive and active deblending allows for successful fitting of confused <b>point</b> <b>sources.</b> Aperture photometry can also be computed for every extracted <b>point</b> <b>source</b> for an unlimited number of aperture sizes. PRF is estimated directly from the input images. Implementation of efficient methods of background and noise estimation, and modified Simplex algorithm contribute to the computational efficiency of MOPEX. The package is implemented as a loosely connected set of perl scripts, where each script runs a number of modules written in C/C++. Input parameter setting is done through namelists, ASCII configuration files.

It includes most of the sources included in the standard WMAP 7 -year <b>point</b> <b>source</b> catalogues {{as well as a}} large number of new detections. Here we study the effects on the estimated CMB power spectrum when taking the newly detected <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> into consideration. We create <b>point</b> <b>source</b> masks for all the 2102 sources that we detected as well as a smaller one for the 665 sources detected in the Q, V and W bands.

The extended <b>point</b> <b>source</b> masks and <b>point</b> <b>source</b> cleaned WMAP 7 maps are made publicly available.

40|$|The <b>point</b> <b>source</b> {{approximation}} {{is widely}} used for earthquake representation because it is computationally efficient for certain kinds of synthetic calculations. It {{is based on the}} assumption that the seismic wave-field generated by a realistic source will match up with that generated by the corresponding centroid <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> as long as the waves investigated have sufficiently long wavelengths and periods. It is important to know whether this approximation is valid, otherwise unknown errors can be introduced into results based using the this approximation. In order to get an idea of the validity of the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> approximation, we compare the wave-field generated by various distributions of <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> to that generated by the corresponding centroid <b>point</b> <b>source.</b> While the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> distributions used do not represent the full complexity of seismic sources, these tests are still useful to explore some of the effects of combining multiple <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> into a single centroid <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> which is what the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> approximation is based on. In the case of an event consisting of two <b>point</b> <b>sources,</b> the time difference between the two <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> before the misfit with the centroid becomes significant, is approximately 7 seconds. In reality, this may represent events with durations over half the length of the shortest period investigated, since it is unlikely that all energy is released at the two ends of an event. For the spatial dimensions, the misfit may become significant for an offset close to 40 kilometres, while at 50 kilometres, around one third of the shortest wavelength, the misfit is already very large. Realistic rupture times indicate that for sources with spatial offset closer to 20 kilometres, the misfit should be very small. Events consisting of more than two <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> may interact in a way to create patches of high misfit that could affect stations located at the same location as these patches...|$|R

Over the last 5 years, the Internet, public “right to know”, and environmental justice programs have greatly increased the visibility {{and use of}} emission inventory data.
