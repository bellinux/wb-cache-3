40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{differences}} between adult and adolescent mothers on attachment, <b>parenting</b> style, <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> stress.

Participants included 100 mothers, 67 of whom were adult mothers and 33 were adolescent mothers. Findings indicated that in comparison to adult mothers, adolescent mothers report more security within their attachment to their children, tend to utilize more permissive <b>parenting,</b> <b>and</b> report more <b>parenting</b> stress.

Growth curve modeling was used to estimate changes in substance use and sexual risk across adolescence and test their association with <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> peer factors. <b>Parent</b> <b>and</b> peer risk factors were strongly associated with increasing substance use as youth aged. Substance use and condom use were interrelated. <b>Parent</b> <b>and</b> peer risk factors were indirectly associated with youth condom use; <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> peer promotive factors were directly associated with condom use, after accounting for substance use.

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding the {{influences}} on physical activity is crucial, particularly among important target {{groups such as}} adolescent girls. This study describes cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between <b>parenting</b> style <b>and</b> girls’ participation in organized sport, walking/cycling trips and objectively assessed moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Methods Data were collected from adolescent girls (n= 222) <b>and</b> their <b>parents</b> in 2004 <b>and</b> again in 2006. Parents self-reported their demographic characteristics <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> style. Girls self-reported their organized sport participation and weekly walking/cycling trips, while MVPA was assessed using accelerometers. Linear regression and interaction analyses were performed. Interactions between socio-demographic factors <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> style with organized sport, walking/cycling trips and MVPA are presented. Results There were cross-sectional associations between authoritative (B=− 0. 45, p= 0. 042) and indulgent (B=− 0. 56, p= 0. 002) <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> the number of walking/cycling trips, and authoritarian (B= 0. 27, p= 0. 033) <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> frequency of organized sport. Significant interactions included those between: family status, authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> daily (p= 0. 048) and week day (p= 0. 013) MVPA; education, indulgent <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> MVPA on weekend days (p= 0. 006); <b>and,</b> employment, authoritarian <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> duration and frequency of organized sport (p= 0. 004), highlighting the complexity of these relationships. Longitudinal analyses revealed significant decreases in organized sport and MVPA, significant increases in walking/cycling trips and no significant associations between <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity. Conclusion Parenting styles appear to influence walking and cycling trips among adolescent girls, though not physical activity within other domains. Socio-demographic characteristics interact with the relationships between <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity. While these findings can inform the development of family-based interventions to improve child and adolescent health, {{the direction of the}} observed associations and the number of associations approaching significance suggest the need to further explore this area. </p...|$|R

40|$|Juvenile {{delinquency}} is a noteworthy problem. This thesis {{addressed the}} association between <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> juvenile delinquency by analyzing the concepts of parenting adopted in family research in relation to criminological concepts and measures of delinquent behavior. Four studies were conducted. The first study addressed a meta-analysis on <b>parenting</b> characteristics <b>and</b> styles in relation to delinquency. In this meta-analysis, previous manuscripts were systematically analyzed, computing mean effect sizes for each <b>parenting</b> dimension <b>and</b> investigating the influence of moderators. Concurrent and longitudinal studies analyzing the link between <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> delinquency were examined. Furthermore, the meta-analysis examined whether {{the sex of the}} child moderates the relationship between <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> delinquency. The second study investigated the long-term associations between <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> delinquency. This study focused on <b>parenting</b> characteristics <b>and</b> styles in early adolescence in relation to delinquency in young adulthood, covering a period of about 10 years. In this chapter, we used datasets from the two longitudinal studies, the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS) and the Child-Rearing and Family in the Netherlands Study (CFNS). The third study focused on links between <b>parenting</b> styles <b>and</b> different trajectories of delinquents. Several delinquency trajectories were identified based on self-reported and official delinquency data collected in the PYS during adolescence on the youngest cohort. Furthermore, the links between <b>parenting</b> styles <b>and</b> these different types of delinquents were investigated. In the fourth study, using a subsample from the CFNS of 330 intact families, the relationship between fathers' <b>and</b> mothers' <b>parenting</b> styles <b>and</b> delinquency in adolescence and young adulthood was addressed. Both concurrent links as well as longitudinal links between <b>parenting</b> styles <b>and</b> delinquency were investigated. Separate analyses on fathers' <b>and</b> mothers' <b>parenting</b> as well as combinations of parenting styles of fathers and mothers were studied in relation to delinquency. In addition, sex-differences in the parenting-delinquency link were studied by analyzing interaction-effects between <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> sex on delinquency...|$|R
