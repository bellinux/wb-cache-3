40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{introduction}} {{is to provide a}} brief outline of the scope and the progression of the thesis. Since {{the latter part of the}} nineteenth century, it has been a well-established principle of real property law in England and Wales that the burden of a <b>positive</b> <b>covenant</b> cannot run directly with freehold land at law or in equity. The fact that a <b>positive</b> <b>covenant</b> cannot run directly with freehold land has for many years been acknowledged to be a major defect of English land law. In Chapter I, the rules which govern the enforceability of freehold covenants are examined. Further, the chapter identifies why the Judges in the nineteenth century decided not to permit the burden of a <b>positive</b> <b>covenant</b> to run with freehold land. Conveyancers use a number of techniques and devices in order to circumvent the aforementioned principle. However, none of them are foolproof. In Chapter II, a number of devices which are used by conveyancers in order to circumvent the aforementioned principle are examined and evaluated. The difficulties which can arise from the present law's failure to provide a satisfactory means whereby positive covenants may be made to run with freehold land are identified in Chapter III. Local authorities possess a number of statutory powers to impose positive covenants on freehold land and to enforce them against successive owners. In Chapter IV, consideration is afforded to some aspects of their powers in this regard. The need to reform the present law has long been recognised. However, despite the fact that several Reports have been made and one draft Bill produced reform has still not been achieved. In Chapter V, the major proposals made for reform in the 1960 's and 1970 's are considered. Further, reasons are advanced to explain why reform of the law of positive covenants has proved to be so difficult to secure. One of the main consequences of the present law is that the vast majority of flats in England and Wales are held on long leases. The popular preference is for freehold not leasehold ownership. Several common law countries have comprehensive "condominium" legislation making full provision for rights and obligations, etc., in regard to freehold flats. The relevant legislation of New South Wales and Trinidad and Tobago is examined in Chapters VI and VII respectively. One objective of these chapters is to demonstrate that there are viable alternatives to using leasehold schemes for blocks of flats. In 1984, the Law Commission published their Report on Positive and Restrictive Covenants. Chapter VIII deals with this Report and with a number of other relevant recent development...|$|E
40|$|The {{doctrine}} of benefit and burden - an indirect method for enforcing {{the burden of}} <b>positive</b> freehold <b>covenants</b> – developed as an exception the strict Austerberry rule that the burden of <b>positive</b> <b>covenants</b> cannot bind successors directly at law. Three recent Court of Appeal cases (Davies v Jones; Wilkinson v Kerdene and Elwood v Goodman) confirm the continued existence and application of the doctrine but also reveal its deficiencies and limitations. This article explores the contemporary application of the doctrine, identifies its theoretical, historical and elemental frailty and, drawing on recent reform proposals of the Law Commission, highlights the case for reform. In so doing, this article argues that a vital theoretical issue has been overlooked in the reform debate: the numerus clausus principle...|$|R
40|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>covenants</b> {{imposed on}} {{existing}} landowners, even if registered, do not bind their {{successor in title}} unless the successor actually agrees to be bound. Many statues seek to change this common law rule by providing that all covenants, in a particular agreement or approval, "bind successors in title". Tighe v Pike highlights the continuing influence of this common law principle on the interpretation of statutes seeking to bind successors in title to existing obligations and the hidden risks for legislative drafters...|$|R

40|$|Peter Sparkes’ path-breaking text on {{land law}} has been rewritten with two aims in mind: to {{incorporate}} the seismic changes introduced by the Land Registration Act 2002,along with commonholds, the explosion of human rights jurisprudence, and the unremitting advance of judicial exposition; and to accommodate the author’s developing thinking on the structural aspects of the subject. The book opens {{with a series of}} shorter chapters each exploring a fundamental building block: registration; houses flats and commonholds; land, ownership and its transactional powers; social controls balanced by human rights to property; fragmentation by time (the doctrine of estates), divisions of ownership and proprietary rights. In terms of substantive chapters the book opens with discussion of the new transfer system [...] paper-based transfer alongside the evolution towards electronic conveyancing [...] and the consequent changes to the proof of registered titles and to the registration curtain. The new approach to adverse possession against registered titles has called for extended discussion, as has the authoritative elucidation of the concept of adverse possession in Pye. In terms of proprietary interests the fundamentals are seen as rights to transfer, beneficial interests under trusts which are overreachable, burdens which are endurable, leases, money charges such as mortgages which are redeemable, and the obligations enforcible within the neighbour principle [...] easements, <b>covenants</b> and <b>positive</b> <b>covenants</b> being treated as a semi-coherent whole. An attempt has been made to assist students by moving some of the more arcane learning later into the book or into separate chapters where these matters might be more readily ignored by a candidate concerned primarily to prepare for an examination. "A massive amount of research and scholarship has gone into the book, with impressive citation of cases, articles and case-notes, and of other text-books…This newcomer on the scene is a considerable addition to the ranks of serious text-books on land law and the author is to be congratulated. ...|$|R

40|$|Net-worth covenants, as {{introduced}} by Black and Cox (1976), provide the firm’s bondholders {{with the right}} to force reorganization or liquidation if the value of the firm falls below a certain threshold. In the event of default, however, many bankruptcy codes stipulate an automatic stay of assets that prevent bondholders from triggering liquidation and thus impact many <b>positive</b> net-worth <b>covenants.</b> To consider this impact on a corporation’s capital structure we develop a general model of liquidation driven by a liquidation trigger. This trigger accumulates with time and severity of distress. In addition, current distress periods may have greater weight than old ones. The tractability of the approach stems from its ability to allow parameters appropriate for different legal rules and types of bondholder safety covenants. The proposed model includes several well-known models, like Merton, Black- Cox and others. We show how to valuate various types of corporate securities by using this model. Numerical results and sensitivity analysis are presented for selected basic cases. default, bankruptcy, liquidation trigger, debt pricing, corporate finance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{construct}} option pricing models for real estate development by considering and incorporating institutional arrangements, direct interactions and financial constraints in the model. It extends the application of real option theory from the framework borrowed from financial option pricing, and considers the case where a development company has restrictions from outside environment and financial constraint. It explores the effects of these additional practical factors on real asset project value and development timing. This paper makes contributions to bridge the theoretical models and practical applications. Design/methodology/approach – Real estate development is modelled in the binomial option pricing framework with the considerations of time-to-build, foregone rent if delaying, institutional environment and capital budgeting. The investment timings are derived from the models and sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the effects of these factors. Findings – Apart from the factors in traditional option pricing theory, this paper confirms that the contractual <b>covenants,</b> <b>positive</b> synergies between properties and financial status of the firm, which enhance or restrict real flexibility embedded in the development land, influence project value and investment timing. Numerical examples illustrate the effects of these factors. It is argued that the valuation of real options should place emphasis on industry-specific characteristics and start from the perspective of the firm rather than individual options. Practical implications – The models constructed in this paper and the results can be directly used in the practical real estate development. Originality/value – This paper incorporates many practical factors in real estate development which are not investigated in previous studies. It values the option project from the firm perspective rather than project perspective as previous studies. It also shows the effects of institutional arrangement and firm factors on project value and development timing. postprin...|$|R
