Holstein cows (n = 1, 052) were blocked by parity and BCS at 3 ± 3 d in milk (study d 0 = day of calving) and assigned randomly to 1 of 3 <b>presynchronization</b> treatments. During the <b>presynchronization</b> programs, all cows received 2 injections of PGF 2 α, on study d 35 and 49. Cows enrolled in the control <b>presynchronization</b> treatment received AI after detected estrus from study d 49 to 62. Cows enrolled in the CIDR estrus-detection (CED) <b>presynchronization</b> treatment received a CIDR insert from study d 42 to 49 and AI on detection of estrus from d 49 to 62. Cows enrolled in the CIDR timed AI (CTAI) <b>presynchronization</b> treatment received the same treatment as CED, but were subjected to timed AI on study d 72 after the Ovsynch (GnRH, 7 d PGF 2 α, 2 d GnRH, 24 h timed AI) protocol. The control and CED cows not inseminated by study d 62 were enrolled in the Ovsynch protocol on the same day and received timed AI on study d 72. After first AI, cows were assigned to no resynchronization (RCON) or resynchronization with a CIDR insert (RCIDR) between 14 and 21 d after AI. Blood samples collected on study d 35, 49, and 62 were analyzed for concentrations of progesterone and cows were classified as anestrous when progesterone was 3 ̆c 1. 0 ng/mL in the first 2 samples. On study d 62, anestrous cows with progesterone ≥ 1. 0 ng/mL were classified as having resumed cyclicity. Pregnancy was diagnosed at 31 and 60 d after first AI and at 42 d after second AI. A greater proportion of anestrous cows in CED and CTAI became cyclic by d 62 postpartum than control cows. Resynchronization with the CIDR insert increased the pregnancy rate at 31 d after first AI in CED and CTAI, and at 60 d after AI in all cows because of reduced pregnancy loss.

Holstein cows (n = 512) were assigned randomly to 2 methods of <b>presynchronization,</b> Presynch (2 PGF 2 a given 14 d apart) or CIDR-PS (controlled internal drug releasing inserted for 7 d with an injection of PGF 2 a at removal) and 2 sources of Se, sodium selenite (SS) or selenized yeast (SY) supplemented at 0. 3 mg/kg from 25 d before calving to 80 d in milk (DIM) arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial. Cows were inseminated following the Ovsynch protocol (d 0 GnRH, d 7 PGF 2 a, d 9 GnRH, timed artificial insemination (AI) 12 h after the final GnRH) starting at 12 and 3 d after Presynch and CIDR-PS, respectively. Cows were diagnosed for pregnancy at 28, 42, and 56 d after AI. Source of Se did not influence uterine health and resumption of cyclicity, but fewer CIDR-PS than Presynch cows were cyclic {{at the beginning of the}} Ovsynch, although differences in the proportion cyclic may have been caused by the timing when corpus luteum evaluations were performed in the different pre-synchronization treatments. Ovulatory responses were not influenced by source of Se. However, the CIDR-PS increased ovulation to the first GnRH, double ovulation to the final GnRH, and size of ovulatory follicle at PGF 2 a and final GnRH of the Ovsynch, but did not influence ovulation at the final GnRH of the Ovsynch.

Cows (n = 70) in a single herd were assigned to one of two <b>presynchronization</b> protocols: Pre- 10 or PG- 3 -G. Cows assigned to the Pre- 10 treatment received 2 injections of prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) 14 days apart (Presynch), with the second injection administered 10 days before the onset of a TAI protocol. Cows assigned to the PG- 3 -G treatment received an injection of prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α), then 3 days later an injection of GnRH (GnRH- 1) 7 days before the onset of a TAI protocol. All cows received the first GnRH injection (GnRH- 2) of the Ovsynch protocol and a PGF 2 α injection 7 days later, then cows received the breeding injection of GnRH (GnRH- 3) at either 56 or 72 hours after PGF 2 α, with insemination occurring 12 to 16 hours after the second GnRH injection. Blood samples were collected during the study to monitor serum changes in LH, progesterone, and estradiol to determine why ovulatory responses to GnRH-induced LH release did not approach 100 % when follicle dominance and adequate follicle size was achieved. <b>Presynchronization</b> administration of GnRH- 1 increased the incidence of LH surges and ovulation rates in cows presynchronized with PG- 3 -G compared with Pre- 10.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from research PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 27, 2014). [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Reproductive management {{is an important}} factor for improving reproductive efficiency in the dairy industry. Reproductive efficiency affects the profitability of the dairy herd by decreasing days not pregnant and increasing milk produced in a cow’s lifetime. There are many reproductive programs used to synchronize the estrous cycle. Prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) -based programs synchronize estrus before artificial insemination (AI) after observed estrus. Some disadvantages to PGF 2 α-based reproductive programs are time requirements necessary for estrus detection (2 to 3 times/d for about 30 min) and lack of estrus activity observed in dairy cows (only about 40 % will show estrus). An advantage to PGF 2 α-based reproductive programs is acceptable conception rates (about 45 to 60 %) that can surpass timed AI (TAI). Reproductive programs that employ TAI are achieved by synchronization of ovulation with a series of PGF 2 α and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) injections followed by insemination 16 h later. Some of the advantages to synchronization of ovulation followed by TAI are: no estrus detection and acceptable conception rates (40 to 50 %). Many reproductive programs include a <b>presynchronization</b> step. The advantage to <b>presynchronization</b> is a tightened synchrony by getting more cows and heifers in the same stage of the estrous cycle before estrous synchronization and AI or TAI. There are a variety of <b>presynchronization</b> methods used in cattle. One of the most common programs is two injections of PGF 2 α 14 d apart 12 d before initiation of Ovsynch (d 0 GnRH, 7 d, PGF 2 α, 56 h, GnRH, 16 h, TAI) (Moreira et al., 2001). Another is double Ovsynch where the Ovsynch program is administered 7 d before another Ovsynch program (Giordano et al., 2012). Long-term progestogens can also be used as a means to presynchronize the estrous cycle and has been successful in beef cows and heifers. Long term progestogens, such as a CIDR (controlled internal drug release) for 14 d, will suppress estrus, inhibit ovulation, and induce the development of a persistent dominant follicle that can ovulate after CIDR removal (Ahmad et al., 1995; Revah and Butler, 1996; Roche et al., 1999). Ovulation of the dominant follicle allows for cows and heifers to be late in the luteal stage of the estrous cycle before PGF 2 α and AI or PGF 2 α, 56 h, GnRH, 16 h, TAI. <b>Presynchronization</b> has shown to decrease the days to pregnancy. This is an advantage because it will directly affect the number of days a cow is not pregnant and the amount of milk she will produce in her lifetime. The objective of this research was to evaluate pregnancies per AI, ovarian follicular and luteal development of postpartum dairy cows and dairy heifers in response to long term progestin-based programs (14 dCIDR) compared with PGF 2 α-based programs. Experiment 1 (Chapter 2) evaluated the use of a 14 dCIDR-PGF 2 α program to a PGF 2 α-alone program for synchronizing dairy heifers before AI. Heifers were examined by real-time ultrasonography during treatment to assess the ovarian response. Heifers were also monitored for estrus following <b>presynchronization</b> and treatment of PGF 2 α to assess ovulation response. The 14 dCIDR-PGF 2 α system resulted in more heifers with a larger CL at the time of PGF 2 α. This is ideal because of the greater luteolytic effects of PGF 2 α has on a more mature CL. The 14 dCIDR-PGF 2 α heifers were AI and became pregnant sooner compared with the PGF 2 α-alone heifers. Experiment 2 (Chapter 3) evaluated the use of a 14 dCIDR_TAI program compared with a PGF 2 α-based program in grazing dairy cows. The 14 dCIDR_TAI program employed synchronization of ovulation before TAI and the PGF 2 α-based program employed synchronization of estrus with AI after observed estrus. The evaluation of reproductive efficiency for each program was examined. Cows assigned to the 14 dCIDR_TAI program were AI early in the breeding season and were all AI by the end the breeding season compared with the PGF 2 α-based program. The PGF 2 α-based program had a greater first service conception rate (FSCR) compared with the 14 dCIDR_TAI program but did not achieve a greater number of pregnancies after two inseminations. Experiment 3 (Chapter 4) evaluated the use of a 14 dCIDR_TAI program compared with another common TAI program (Presynch-Oysynch 56) in postpartum lactating dairy cows. Follicular dynamics and luteal development were monitored in both programs. Each program was evaluated for effectiveness to presynchronize the estrous cycle and establish pregnancy. The 14 dCIDR_TAI and the Presynch-Ovsynch 56 programs were comparable in their effectiveness to presynchronize the estrous cycle and establish pregnancy in cows that were cycling. Non-cycling cows treated with the Presynch-Ovsynch 56 program had lesser conception rate compared with those that were cycling. There was no difference in conception rate with non-cycling or cycling cows treated with the 14 dCIDR_TAI. Experiment 4 (Chapter 5) evaluated the use of the 14 dCIDR_TAI program with or without PGF 2 α at CIDR removal. It is possible for cows to still have a CL {{after the end of the}} 14 dCIDR treatment either due to longer estrous cycles or the cow was early in her estrous cycle when the CIDR was inserted. The addition of PGF 2 α may help improve the synchrony and conception rates after <b>presynchronization</b> of the estrous cycle before TAI. The addition of the PGF 2 α at CIDR removal demonstrated an increase in the number of cows that showed estrus after <b>presynchronization</b> but conception rates were comparable. Overall, the use of the 14 dCIDR as means to presynchronize the estrous cycle has been demonstrated as an effective way to enhance the synchrony and decrease the interval to pregnancy in dairy cows and heifers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} a novel <b>presynchronization</b> method, using Ovsynch {{prior to}} the Ovsynch-timed AI protocol (Double-Ovsynch) compared to Presynch-Ovsynch. Lactating Holstein (n = 337) cows, were assigned to two treatment groups: (1) Presynch (n = 180), two injections of PGF 14 d apart, followed by the Ovsynch-timed AI protocol 12 d later; (2) Double-Ovsynch (n = 157), received GnRH, PGF 7 d later, and GnRH 3 d later, followed by the Ovsynch-timed AI protocol 7 d later. All cows received the same Ovsynch-timed AI protocol: GnRH (G 1) at 68 +/- 3 DIM (mean +/- SEM), PGF 7 d later, GnRH (G 2) 56 h after PGF, and AI 16 to 20 h later. Pregnancy was diagnosed 39 - 45 d after timed AI. Double-Ovsynch increased the pregnancies per AI (P/AI) compared to Presynch-Ovsynch (49. 7 % vs 41. 7 %, P = 0. 03). Surprisingly, Double-Ovsynch increased P/AI only in primiparous (65. 2 % vs 45. 2 %; P = 0. 02) and not multiparous (37. 5 % vs 39. 3 %) cows. In a subset of 87 cows, ovarian ultrasonography and progesterone (P 4) measurements were performed at G 1 and 7 d later. Double-Ovsynch decreased the percentage of cows with low P 4 (= 3 ng/mL) at PGF (78. 1 % vs 52. 3 %). Thus, <b>presynchronization</b> of cows with Double-Ovsynch increased fertility in primiparous cows compared to a standard Presynch protocol, perhaps due to induction of ovulation in non-cycling cows and improved synchronization of cycling cows. Future studies are needed, with {{a larger number of}} cows, to further test the hypothesis of higher fertility with Double-Ovsynch, and to elucidate the physiological mechanisms that underlie apparent changes in fertility with this protocol.

Functional perturbation of CENP-E by various methods {{results in a}} consistent phenotype, i. e., unaligned chromosomes during mitosis. One unresolved question from previous studies is whether cells complete mitosis or sustain mitotic arrest {{in the presence of}} unaligned chromosomes. Using RNA interference and video-microscopy, we analyzed the dynamic process of mitotic progression of HeLa(H 2 B) -GFP cells lacking CENP-E. Our results demonstrate that these cells initiated anaphase after a delayed mitotic progression due to the presence of unaligned chromosomes. In some dividing cells, unaligned chromosomes are present during anaphase, causing nondisjunction of some sister chromatids producing aneuploid daughter cells. Unlike in Xenopus extract, the loss of CENP-E in HeLa cells does not impair gross checkpoint activation because cells were arrested in mitosis in response to microtubule-interfering agents. However, the lack of CENP-E at kinetochores reduced the hyperphosphorylation of BubR 1 checkpoint protein during mitosis, which may explain the loss of sensitivity of a cell to a few unaligned chromosomes in the absence of CENP-E.

40|$|Fertility {{of dairy}} cattle is {{generally}} decreasing. Overall estrus detection efficiency in lactating dairy cattle is low, as expression of estrus is often compromised. Consequently, undetected estrus, low AI-submission rates, and long inter-breeding intervals {{are the main}} contributors to poor reproductive efficiency. Although failure to become pregnant {{is the most common}} reason for culling dairy cattle, pregnancy rates could be improved by increasing the AI-submission rate through increased estrus detection efficiency, timed insemination (Timed-AI), or timed embryo transfer (Timed-ET). In these protocols, ovarian follicular development and luteolysis are controlled, culminating in synchronous ovulation in most cows. There are several modifications to improve pregnancy rates in Timed-AI protocols, e. g. <b>presynchronization</b> with 2 doses of PGF 2 a 14 d apart, and starting the Ovsynch protocol 12 d after the 2 nd PGF 2 a. Timed-AI programs ensure a timely first breeding; this should be followed with early pregnancy diagnosis to identify nonpregnant cows, and prompt re-insemination. However, in a recent field study involving 23 dairy herds, the mean interval between 1 st and 2 nd breeding was 42 d; only 28 % of the cows were rebred within 24 d after 1 st breeding. Fortunately, there are several resynchronization protocols to reduce inter-breeding intervals. Anestrus cows, or those with cystic ovarian follicles, {{have a good chance of}} conceiving when subjected to synchronization of ovulation and Timed-AI.

Reproductive season, body condition score (BCS), body weight, uterine tonus, size of the ovaries, serum progesterone level {{at the beginning of the}} protocol and the review with the bulls after the inseminations were also evaluated. Eighty three Murrah buffalo cows were randomly divided in two groups. One group were evaluated in the favorable reproduction season (n= 42) and the other for the unfavorable reproduction season (n= 41). For each season, the groups were subdivided in two, which one was treated with the Ovsynch protocol and the other group for Presynch protocol. There was no statistical difference for artificial insemination pregnancy rates (AIPR) among the protocols and reproductive season. However, there was a difference in the accumulated pregnancy rates (APR) after the reviews with the bull. The BCS did not show influence in the AIPR, while the APR of the buffalos with BCS > 2. 5 (66. 13 %) was superior (P= 0. 003) than the APR animals with BCS 2, 5 (66, 13 %) foi estatisticamente superior à TPA do ECC < 2, 5 (28, 57 %).

Lactating Holstein cows (n= 104, 3 - 5 years old, 450 - 500 kg BW, 27 ± 3 kg/day average milk yield) were enrolled in the study 26 - 41 days postpartum. Fifty of them were taken as the control group and 54 of them were the treated experimental group. The control group was not treated and the cows in estrus were inseminated. In the treated group the cows were injected with two PGF 2 α for <b>presynchronization</b> twice at every 14 days. Fourteen days after the second PGF 2 α, ovsynch protocol was initiated (GnRH, day 0; PGF 2 α, day 7; GnRH, day 9) and cows were inseminated 12 - 16 hours after second GnRH injection. Following AI, cows returning to estrus were inseminated at detected heat. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed by ultrasonography at 33 - 38 days after AI. Calving to first AI (days), calving to pregnancy (day), the number of AI per pregnancy, calving interval (days) for control cows were 96. 08 ± 8. 20, 147. 58 ± 9. 95, 2. 19 ± 0. 20 and 430. 50 ± 10. 90 and for the treated group 70. 13 ± 1. 13, 101. 76 ± 5. 70, 1. 85 ± 0. 12 and 386. 80 ± 5. 70, respectively. Compared to the control group, calving to first AI interval was shorter by 26 days, calving to pregnancy interval by 46 days and the calving interval by 44 days (p 0. 05). As a result, by using the presynch-ovsynch protocol, the need for estrus detection was eliminated and inseminations were performed at a fixed time.

40|$|To compare 2 {{hormonal}} protocols for {{submission of}} lactating dairy cows for timed artificial insemination (TAI), nonpregnant lactating Holstein cows (n = 269) > 60 d in milk {{were randomly assigned}} to each of 2 treatments to receive TAI (TAI = d 0). Cows assigned to the first treatment (Ovsynch, n = 134) received 50 µg of GnRH (d − 10), 25 mg of PGF 2 α (d − 3), and 50 µg of GnRH (d − 1) beginning at a random stage of the estrous cycle. Cows assigned to the second treatment (Presynch, n = 135) receivedOvsynch but with the addi-tion of 2 PGF 2 α (25 mg) injections administered 14 d apart beginning 28 d (d − 38 and − 24) before initiation of Ovsynch. All cows received TAI 16 to 18 h after the second GnRH injection. Ovulatory response after each GnRH injection for a subset of cows (n = 109) and preg-nancy status 42 d after TAI for all cows were assessed using transrectal ultrasonography. Based on serum progesterone (P 4) profiles determined for a subset of cows (n = 109), P 4 concentrations decreased for Pre-synch cows after the first 2 PGF 2 α injections, and Pre-synch cows had greater P 4 concentrations at the PGF 2 α injection on d − 3 compared with Ovsynch cows. Al-though the proportion of cows ovulating after the first and second GnRH injections did not differ statistically between treatments (41. 1 and 69. 6 % vs. 35. 9 and 81. 1 % for Ovsynch vs. Presynch, respectively), pregnancy rate per artificial insemination (PR/AI) at 42 d post TAI was greater for Presynch than for Ovsynch cows (49. 6 vs. 37. 3 %).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate factors associated with resumption of postpartum estrous cycles and embryonic survival in lactating dairy cows. Holstein cows, 6396 from four dairy farms were evaluated to determine the relationships among parity, body condition score (BCS) at calving and at AI, season of year when cows calved, and milk yield on resumption of postpartum estrous cycles by 65 days postpartum, and all the previous variables, estrual or anestrus and AI protocol on conception rates and embryonic survival at the first postpartum insemination. Cows had their estrous cycle pre-synchronized with two PGF 2 α injections given 14 days apart and were inseminated between 69 and 82 days postpartum following either an estrous or ovulation synchronization protocol initiated 12 – 14 days after the <b>presynchronization.</b> Blood was sampled and analyzed for progesterone twice, 12 – 14 days apart, to determine whether cows had initiated onset of estrous cycles after calving. Cows were scored for body condition in the week after calving, and again at AI, between 69 and 82 days postpartum. Pregnancy was diagnosed at 30 ± 3 and 58 ± 3 days after AI. Farm influenced all reproductive outcomes evaluated. More (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) multiparous than primiparous cows had initiated estrous cycles. Onset of estrous cycles was also influenced (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) by BCS at calving and at AI, BCS change, season, and milk yield. More (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) cows that had initiated estrous cycles than anestrous cows were pregnant at 30 and 58 days after AI, but anestrus did not affect pregnancy loss. Conception rates were also influenced (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) by parity, BCS at calving and AI, BCS change, and season; however, milk yield and insemination protocol were not associated with conception rates at 30 and 58 days after AI. Factors that reduced conception rate on day 30 after AI also increased pregnancy loss between 30 and 58 days of gestation. Improving BCS at calving and AI, minimizing losses of BCS after calving, and hastening onset of estrous cycles early postpartum are all expected to increase conception because of enhanced embryonic survival...|$|E
40|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{for passenger}} {{cars and trucks}} are equipped with synchronizer mechanisms. A synchronizer mechanism as {{a key component of}} a transmission system must be able to prevent transmission gears from shocking, reduce the noise and it has a great impact on driving comfort and transmission efficiency. Gear shifting improvement with respect to smooth, quick and energy efficient synchronizer’s performance is still an important issue for automotive industry. A synchronization process comprises several phases within which <b>presynchronization,</b> main synchronization, pre-engagement and engagement phases can be recognized. Aiming an understanding of internal dynamics and existing possibilities for optimization of synchronization processes in transmission systems during the main synchronization phase an engineering model of a generic synchronizer mechanism is proposed. The synchronizer mechanism is modeled by a contacting triple-body system consisting of the selector sleeve, the blocker ring and the gearwheel. The algorithm has developed to solve the direct dynamics synchronization problem for the generic synchronizer mechanism. By using the developed algorithm the rotational motion of the contacting triple-body system and the synchronizing torques between contacting interfaces are determined for given vehicle resistance torque, the drag torque, and the control torque applied to the selector sleeve that all together satisfy the equations of motion and guarantee synchronization of the rotational speeds of the sleeve, the blocker ring and the gearwheel for the final time. It is shown that the solution to the direct dynamics synchronization problem for the generic synchronizer mechanism is not unique and it allows formulation different optimization problems. Mathematical statement of multi-objective Pareto optimal control problem for synchronizer mechanism is given. Within the proposed model of the generic synchronizer mechanism the time-comfort Pareto optimal control problem is considered. Assuming that the resistance torque on the synchronizer owing to the vehicle inertia, the drag torque, and the synchronizing torques at the contacting interfaces are substantially constant during the main phase of a synchronization process, the solution to the time-comfort Pareto optimal control problem has been obtained. It was shown that there exist the external control torque (or shift force) applied to the selector sleeve such that the synchronization of rotational speeds of the sleeve, the blocker ring and the gearwheel is guaranteed and the synchronization process is optimal both with respect to minimal possible synchronization time as well as lowest possible inertial load acting on the synchronizer mechanism. Analysis of the obtained Pareto solution is presented...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryLuis G. MendoncaReproduction is an {{important}} part of a dairy operation that directly affects milk production and profitability. Fertility of high-producing dairy cows is less than desired. Reproductive efficiency is further impaired during summer months and after cows develop postpartum uterine disease. Heat stress and uterine disease act as stressors that negatively influence fertility of dairy cattle through a variety of mechanisms. This dissertation further investigates the negative effects of heat stress and uterine disease on reproduction, as well as examines two potential markers for predicting risk of developing uterine disease. Study 1 investigated the treatment of lactating dairy cows with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) before first insemination during heat stress. Two experiments were performed to compare ovarian responses, pregnancy per artificial insemination (AI), and patterns of insemination of two estrus detection-based <b>presynchronization</b> protocols before first AI during summer heat stress. Treatment of cows with GnRH during summer heat stress altered ovarian response and pattern of insemination, however, did not improve pregnancy per AI. Study 2 evaluated ovarian response to treatment with GnRH and the odds of bearing a corpus luteum or being inseminated in cows with or without purulent vaginal discharge (PVD). Furthermore, hazard of insemination after administration of prostaglandin F 2 α was evaluated in dairy cows with or without PVD. Ovarian response was altered in cows with PVD compared with cows without PVD. Odds of bearing a corpus luteum or being inseminated was not associated with PVD in primiparous cows, whereas it was associated with PVD in multiparous cows. Hazard of insemination after prostaglandin F 2 α was not associated with PVD. Study 3 investigated arginase and matrix metalloproteinase- 8 (MMP- 8) as potential markers for metritis. Activity of arginase 7 days before parturition has been identified as a potential marker for the risk of developing metritis in dairy cows. In contrast, MMP- 8 was not associated with the risk of developing metritis, therefore, MMP- 8 is not a good candidate as a marker for metritis. Further research is warranted in the areas of reproductive physiology, heat stress, and uterine disease because several unanswered questions still exist. Improving fertility during times of heat stress and after the occurrence of postpartum uterine disease will improve milk production, animal welfare, and profitability of dairy farms across the world...|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that pregnancy outcomes may {{be improved by}} inducing luteal regression, ovulation, or both (i. e., altering progesterone status) before initiating a timed–artificial insemination (TAI) program in suckled beef cows. This hypothesis was tested in two experiments in which cows were treated with either PGF[subscript 2 α] (PG) or PG + GnRH before initiating a TAI program to increase the proportion of cows starting the program in a theoretical marginal (< 1 ng/mL; experiment 1) or elevated (≥ 1 ng/mL; experiment 2) progesterone environment, respectively. The control was a standard CO-Synch + controlled internal drug release (CIDR) program employed in suckled beef cows (100 μg GnRH intramuscularly [IM] [GnRH- 1] and insertion of a progesterone-impregnated intravaginal CIDR insert on study Day − 10, 25 mg PG and CIDR insert removal on study Day − 3, and 100 μg GnRH IM [GnRH- 2] and TAI on study Day 0). In both experiments, blood was collected before each injection for later progesterone analyses. In experiment 1, cows at nine locations (n = 1537) were assigned to either: (1) control or (2) PrePG (same as control with a PG injection on study Day − 13). The PrePG cows had larger (P < 0. 05) follicles on study Day − 10 and more (P < 0. 05) ovulated after GnRH- 1 compared with control cows (60. 6 % vs. 36. 5 %), but pregnancy per TAI was not altered (55. 5 % vs. 52. 2 %, respectively). In experiment 2, cows (n = 803) at four locations were assigned to: (1) control or (2) PrePGG (same as control with PG injection on study Day − 20 and GnRH injection on study Day − 17). Although pregnancy per TAI did not differ between control and PrePGG cows (44. 0 % vs. 44. 4 %, respectively), cows with body condition score greater than 5. 0 or 77 or more days postpartum at TAI were more (P < 0. 05) likely to become pregnant than thinner cows or those with fewer days postpartum. Presynchronized cows in both experiments were more (P < 0. 05) likely than controls to have luteolysis after initial PG injections and reduced (P < 0. 05) serum progesterone; moreover, treatments altered the proportion of cows and pregnancy per TAI of cows in various progesterone categories {{before the onset of}} the TAI protocol. In combined data from both experiments, cows classified as anestrous before the study but with elevated progesterone on Day − 10 had increased (P < 0. 05) pregnancy outcomes compared with anestrous cows with low progesterone concentrations. Progesterone concentration had no effect on pregnancy outcome of cycling cows. In summary, luteal regression and ovulation were enhanced and progesterone concentrations were altered by <b>presynchronization</b> treatments before the 7 -day CO-Synch + CIDR program, but pregnancy per TAI was not improved...|$|E
40|$|Dairy Research, 2012 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2012 The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effect of 2 <b>presynchronization</b> treatments on first-service pregnancy rate in 4 dairy herds during warm and cool seasons of the year. Cows with ear tags ending with even digits at calving were enrolled in Presynch- 10 with 2, 25 -mg injections of prostaglandin F 2 α (i. e., PG- 1 and PG- 2) 14 days apart. Cows with ear tags ending with odd digits were enrolled in PG- 3 -G comprising 1, 25 -mg injection of PG (Pre-PG) 3 days before 100 μg gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Pre-GnRH), with the Pre-PG injection administered {{at the same time as}} PG- 2 in the Presynch- 10 treatment in the Presynch- 10 treatment. Ten days after PG- 2 or Pre-PG, all cows were enrolled in a timed artificial insemination (TAI) protocol (Ovsynch- 56; injection of GnRH 7 days before [GnRH- 1] and 56 hours after [GnRH- 2] PG with AI 16 to 18 hours after GnRH- 2). Median days in milk (DIM) at scheduled TAI were 75 days, which did not differ among herds. Cows detected in estrus before the scheduled TAI were inseminated early (early bred; EB). Pregnancy was diagnosed at days 32 to 38 and at days 60 to 66 after TAI by transrectal ultrasonography or transrectal palpation. Data were analyzed with herd as a random effect and with fixed effects of treatment (EB, Presynch- 10, PG- 3 -G), parity (primiparous vs. multiparous), season (hot [June through September] vs. cool-cold [October through May]), DIM, estrus at TAI (0 vs. 1), and all 2 -way interactions with treatment. The pregnancy rate at days 32 to 38 for EB (n = 472), Presynch- 10 (n = 1, 247), and PG- 3 -G (n = 1, 286) were 31. 4, 35. 0, and 41. 2 %, respectively; pregnancy rate at days 60 to 66 was 29. 8, 32. 2, and 37. 3 %, respectively. Season significantly influenced pregnancy rate at days 32 to 38 and days 60 to 66, but a treatment by season interaction was not detected. The pregnancy rate for PG- 3 -G and Presynch- 10 treatments did not differ during cool-cold weather (d 32 to 38 : 46. 8 vs. 44. 3 %; days 60 to 66 : 41. 6 vs. 41. 1 %, respectively), but PG- 3 -G and Presynch- 10 produced a higher pregnancy rate than EB at days 32 to 38. During summer, pregnancy rate in PG- 3 -G was greater than in Presynch- 10 (days 32 to 38 : 35. 9 vs. 26. 7 % or days 60 to 66 : 33. 2 vs. 24. 4 %, respectively), and pregnancy rate in EB cows did not differ from that of Presynch- 10 cows. Although pregnancy loss did not differ for EB, Presynch- 10, and PG- 3 -G treatments (4. 0, 6. 7, and 9. 3 %, respectively), pregnancy loss from days 32 to 38 and days 60 to 66 was 2 -fold greater in thinner cows (< 2. 5 vs. ≥ 2. 5; 9. 0 vs. 4. 4 %). We concluded that presynchronizing estrous cycles with PG- 3 -G produced more pregnancies than inseminating cows at estrus during cooler weather and was superior to Presynch- 10 during summer...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{to enhance}} embryo quality and {{recovery}} rates in superovulated beef cows were investigated. In the first study, uteri from superovulated heifers on day of recovery were harvested immediately following exsanguination and sectioned into 3 segments per horn plus the oviduct (8 sections per total uterus). Each section was thoroughly flushed through individual filters, searched and evaluated. Sectioning of the uterine horns impacted location of embryos {{with the majority}} of embryos located in the tip and middle third of each horn. In comparing these two sections, a greater percentage of the embryos were in the tip than in the middle third. Interestingly, embryos were recovered in both the oviduct and the base of the uterine horns. Based on these data, at time of embryo recovery, an embryo transfer (ET) practitioner should focus their recovery efforts towards the tip and middle third of the horns and potentially incorporating the body of the uterus to be include all potential embryo locations. In the second study, effects of endogenous progesterone (P 4) concentrations on embryo production were evaluated. Beef cows were superovulated following a CIDR-based <b>presynchronization</b> coupled with ultrasound-guided dominant follicle ablation (DFA). Comparison of high progesterone (HP) concentrations to low progesterone (LP) concentrations was achieved by administration of prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) at DFA to the LP group while HP maintained their CL during superstimulation. Superovulation protocol included decreasing dosages of follicle stimulating hormone twice daily over 4 days and timed artificial insemination performed twice (12 hours apart). A greater proportion of quality grade 1 embryos were recovered from the LP cows compared to the HP cows, which had a greater number of quality grade 3 and 4 (degenerate) embryos. Additionally, a greater proportion of embryos recovered were developmental stage 6 and 7 in the LP cows. It should be noted, however, that more total embryos were recovered from HP than LP cows. There were no differences in total transferrable quality embryos between treatments. A third study was designed to evaluate the effects of stage and grade of embryos on embryonic sex. In vivo-derived embryos from d 7 superovulated recoveries were biopsied using a micromanipulator with a microsurgical blade and the sex was determined using PCR techniques. Despite differences in developmental stage between embryos, they were not found to impact sex determination. However, differences in quality grade impacted embryonic sex determination. Specifically, a greater proportion of quality grade 2 embryos were female while a greater proportion of grade 1 embryos were males. In application of these studies, a practitioner with a cattle producer who wants to maximize embryo output and has recipient cows available for transferring fresh embryos at time of recovery could superstimulate the donor under the influence of uninhibited P 4 concentration. This would be followed with recovery on d 7 with placement of the catheter at the base of each horn for horn flushing while potentially incorporating the uterus during the recovery to perform a thorough flush of the entire uterus. Ideally, this scenario should yield a greater number of embryos, however quality may be compromised, yet could be transferred fresh into recipients. Additionally, with the potential for an increase in quality grade 2 embryos from the recovery, our data suggests the potential for an increased number of heifer calves. On the other hand, if a seed stock producer wants to cryopreserve the best embryos from their donor, our data would suggest implementing a superovulation protocol under the influence of LP, followed by horn flushing method in which the catheter is placed at the base of each horn on d 6 - 7. Our results would suggest this recovery would produce a greater proportion of freezable, grade 1 embryos which could increase the probability of producing bulls...|$|E
