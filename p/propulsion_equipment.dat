5|$|While {{the rolling}} stock and Mitsubishi Electric <b>propulsion</b> <b>equipment</b> were {{constructed}} in Japan, many parts were sourced from Europe. The trains were fitted with Stone Platt air-conditioning, Duwag bogies, Sig gangways, Scharfenberg couplers and Westinghouse brakes. Mitsubishi Electric's <b>propulsion</b> <b>equipment</b> was estimated to consume 50% less electricity than Hong Kong's existing MTR M-Train EMU. Its Automatic Train Control (ATC) signalling system was supplied by Westinghouse, capable of running at pre-programmed speeds and activated by the train driver. While theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology, MRT Corporation (MRTC, now SMRT Corporation) decided against this option. The trainsets were assembled in Kobe, Japan, and then shipped to Singapore by Neptune Orient Lines. The first trainset was delivered to MRTC on 8 July 1986 at Bishan Depot, officiated by Yeo Ning Hong.|$|E
25|$|Mayor Dianne Feinstein {{took charge}} of the effort, and helped win federal funding for the bulk of the {{rebuilding}} job. In 1982 the cable car system was closed again for a complete rebuild. This involved the complete replacement of 69 city blocks' worth of tracks and cable channels, the complete rebuilding of the car barn and powerhouse within the original outer brick walls, new <b>propulsion</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the repair or rebuild of 37 cable cars. The system reopened on June 21, 1984, in time to benefit from the publicity that accompanied San Francisco's hosting of that year's Democratic National Convention.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, {{as a result of}} unusually high summertime temperatures, many MARTA rail cars became overheated, {{damaging}} on-board <b>propulsion</b> <b>equipment.</b> As a result, many trains broke down and had to be taken out of service for repair. This was further {{compounded by the fact that}} at any given time up to 50 older rail cars were out of service as part of MARTA's rail car rehabilitation project. To compensate for the reduced number of operating rail cars, MARTA shortened trains from six to four cars in length. This sometimes resulted in almost half of the trains being shortened, creating crowded conditions for passengers.|$|E

25|$|The {{ship was}} one of three Modified Leander-class light cruisers {{constructed}} for the Royal Navy. The main difference to the previous five Leanders was that the newer ships had their machinery and <b>propulsion</b> <b>equipment</b> organised in two self-contained units (separated fore and aft), allowing the ship to continue operating if one set was damaged. The two exhaust funnels, one for each machinery space, gave the modified ships a different profile from the early Leanders, which had a single funnel. To cover the separate machinery spaces, the side armour was extended from , negating the weight reduction created by the separation. During design, it was planned to modify the forward-most and aft-most 6-inch turrets to be fitted with three guns instead of two, but the plan was cancelled when it was determined that the required alterations would cause several negative side effects, including reducing the ship's top speed and causing problems with effective fire control.|$|E

2500|$|The larger {{destroyer}} leader type {{had been}} under active consideration since 1921. Indeed the General Board recommended the construction of five of the type in that year. [...] One factor in favor of leaders was the Navy's total lack of modern light cruisers, only partly alleviated by the ten [...] ships built in the 1920s.

The General Board {{was very interested in}} equipping such a type with the new higher pressure and higher temperature steam <b>propulsion</b> <b>equipment</b> also proposed for the Farragut-class destroyers; this would extend the ships' range. The London Naval Treaty and large French destroyers (France did not sign the treaty and built ships well in excess of its limits) seem to have become the tipping points, with the 1930 recommendations beginning the cycle to actually build ships. The Geneva proposals for destroyers also seem to have influence the design, as the Destroyer Leader proposals limited themselves to 1,850 tons per the proposals; these tonnage limits were eventually included in the London treaty.|$|E
