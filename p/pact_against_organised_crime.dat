40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the policy and}} politics of the fight <b>against</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> {{in the process of}} the European Union’s enlargement to Eastern Europe and the Balkans. It covers the period between the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the second Eastern enlargement in 2007 which saw {{the emergence of a new}} normative base for international relations and the expansion of the international security agenda focusing on ‘soft security’ issues and threats from weak rather than powerful states. The thesis explores this new ‘soft security’ thinking and investigates its practical application in EU’s policy of building member-states in the New Europe with a focus on the case study of the fight <b>against</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in Bulgaria and its EU-guided criminal justice reform. The thesis looks at these developments from both internal and external perspective and focuses on the practicalities of the policy itself such as the development of legislative changes, institutional reform and direct transfer of Western European expertise to Bulgarian institutions. The main findings of the thesis have led to a conclusion which questions the quality and premises of these policies. The thesis argues that the Bulgarian state and the European Union institutions have subscribed to a highly problematic <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> discourse and agenda which has negatively influenced the quality of their relationship with the Bulgarian electorate.

40|$|The {{preventive}} approach <b>against</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> has gained much attention {{since the early}} 1990 s. On an international level {{as well as on}} a national one various preventive measures <b>against</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> have been developed. This is certainly true in the European Union and the Netherlands. This introduction chapter is divided into three sections. The first looks at the developments that led to the {{preventive approach}} to <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> focusing on the growing enthusiasm for the prevention of crime. Subsequently, it highlights the rise of the problem of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> on the political agenda, in particular in the European Union and in the Netherlands. Together these sections illustrate that {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s the merger of these developments led to enthusiasm for a preventative approach to <b>organised</b> <b>crime.</b> The second section provides insight into the content of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> prevention. This section introduces actual preventive measures taken to hinder <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> at least as European Union and Dutch authorities applied them. In an attempt to define <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> prevention, the main characteristics of these measures are highlighted. The third section introduces the aim of this research. Here, the enthusiasm about the merger between crime prevention and the containment of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> is questioned. Moreover, this section details the research questions and methods. Vanaf het begin van de jaren 1990 is er zowel op nationaal als op international vlak geïnvesteerd in een preventieve benadering van georganiseerde criminaliteit. Nederland heeft hier een progressieve rol in gespeeld. Met veel enthousiasme en hoge verwachtingen zijn verschillende preventieve maatregelen ontwikkeld. Sommige van deze maatregelen worden uitgedragen als ‘best practices’ in andere Europese landen. De vraag is echter wat beleidsmakers precies verwachten van de preventieve benadering en of de preventieve maatregelen ook aan deze verwachtingen kunnen voldoen. Kortom, wat is eigenlijk het effect van preventieve maatregelen op het probleem van georganiseerde criminaliteit. Deze vraag behelst de centrale probleemstelling van mijn onderzoek...|$|R

Although positive reaction to foreign pressure for policy change has tended to be made at the risk of losing further legitimacy in the eyes of domestic public opinion, in this case the issue of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> has presented an opportunity to the policy-making elite to develop policy that also aims to bolster the domestic legitimacy of the state by dealing with criminality and presenting the state as a clean and neutral body acting for the common public good...|$|R
