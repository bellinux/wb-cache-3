5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered <b>package</b> <b>deals</b> on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E

500|$|Interplay Entertainment {{released}} the Windows {{version of the}} game on December 7, 2000. Planet Moon later created a special version of the game optimized for the [...] graphics card to display water reflections, soft-edged shadows, and weather effects. This version was not sold as a standalone commercial product but {{as a part of}} certain GeForce3 graphic card <b>package</b> <b>deals.</b> MacPlay announced on November 1, 2000, it was publishing the [...] version of the game. The Omni Group was responsible for the porting of the game; they rewrote the game's software {{to take advantage of the}} symmetric multi-processing capability of Mac OSX. Eleven months later, MacPlay {{released the}} port. Multiplayer mode was initially disabled in the retail release but was re-inserted in a later patch. Giants was also ported to the [...] (PS2), a process overseen by Interplay's division, Digital Mayhem, who posted updates of their progress on IGN. Their greatest challenge for the PS2 port was converting and storing the special effects of the Windows version onto the lesser storage space of the PS2. LightWave 3D was used by the team to convert the graphic resources. Although they had to reduce the image resolution, Digital Mayhem increased the number of polygons that composed the player character models, making them smoother and more detailed in shape. Due to the limited capabilities of the PS2 as compared to the Windows platform and the addition of a save feature, the team focused on enhancing the action gameplay, streamlining the interfaces, and tweaking the Reaper ski races, level designs, and game balance. They redesigned the controls for the PS2's controller, and after finding the analog sticks less easy to aim with than a mouse, implemented a feature to help the player's aim. Digital Mayhem originally intended to retain the multiplayer mode, but discarded it, believing the PS2 environment could not generate the same multiplayer atmosphere as the Windows platform. Interplay released the PS2 port on December 21, 2001. They also announced plans for an Xbox port but nothing resulted from this.|$|E
40|$|Residential {{construction}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important subdivision of construction industry, necessitating advanced procurement methods {{in order to accommodate}} changing requirements. Commonly, residential construction demand is met by the informal sector of construction industry. With the changing environments, a novel trend of <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts is spreading in the context bringing in formalities to the residential construction projects. <b>Package</b> <b>deal</b> is a developed procurement method with unique characteristics. However, in selecting an appropriate procurement method for a specific housing construction project, proper understanding of characteristics of available procurement options are utmost of importance. Therefore, this research aimed to elucidate the suitability of <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts for residential building construction, against time, cost and quality benefits. Study identified 43 time, cost, and quality related expectations through a comprehensive literature survey, which residential construction clients would expect to be born of <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts. The factors were ranked against industry experts' view and further, tested via a survey with a sample of clients with <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> and informal construction experience. Data were analysed for medians and standard deviations in to rank the factors considering the reliability. Consequently, experts appreciated time and cost benefits of <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts over informal construction. Importantly, projects start quickly with known early commitments under <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts. However, informal construction offers better quality with attractive finished products. Therefore, the <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> is suitable for the clients, who are concerned of time and cost benefits, while informal {{construction is}} suitable for the client’s with prime concern of quality benefits...|$|R

2500|$|The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 {{provided}} for the land needed to build the transcontinental railroad. The land given the railroads alternated with government-owned tracts saved for free distribution to homesteaders. In {{an effort to be}} equitable, the federal government reduced each tract to [...] because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line. Railroads had up to five years to sell or mortgage their land, after tracks were laid, after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone. Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve. Nebraska railroads in the 1870s were strong boosters of lands along their routes. They sent agents to Germany and Scandinavia with <b>package</b> <b>deals</b> that included cheap transportation for the family as well as its furniture and farm tools, and they offered long-term credit at low rates. Boosterism succeeded in attracting adventurous American and European families to Nebraska, helping them purchase land grant parcels on good terms. The selling price depended on such factors as soil quality, water, and distance from the railroad.|$|E
