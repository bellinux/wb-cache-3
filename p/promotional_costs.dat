25|$|Despite {{its legal}} troubles, SST {{continued}} to release records by artists including Minutemen, Saccharine Trust, and Meat Puppets. In 1982 Minneapolis hardcore group Hüsker Dü became the label's first non-West Coast signing. Following {{the resolution of}} the debacle with Unicorn Records, SST released four Black Flag albums in 1984. The multiple Black Flag albums, along with the double album releases Zen Arcade and Double Nickels on the Dime by Hüsker Dü and the Minutemen, respectively, stretched the label's resources. While SST believed Zen Arcade would be a sizable underground hit, pressings of over 5,000 copies were unknown territory for the label, so it erred {{on the side of caution}} and did not print over that number in its initial pressing. Awarded critical acclaim by several mainstream media outlets, Zen Arcade sold out quickly and remained out of print for months. Ginn decided to cut the <b>promotional</b> <b>costs</b> of the Black Flag albums by issuing them in quick succession and having the band tour solidly behind the releases.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies online {{cooperative}} {{promotion and}} cost sharing decisions in competing supply chains. We consider {{a model of}} one B 2 C e-commerce platform and two supply chains each consisting of a supplier and an online retailer. The problem is studied using a multistage game. Firstly, the e-commerce platform carries out the cooperative promotion and sets the magnitude of markdown (the value of e-coupon). Secondly, each retailer and his supplier determine the fraction of <b>promotional</b> <b>cost</b> sharing when they have different bargaining power. Lastly, the retailers decide whether {{to participate in the}} cooperative promotion campaign. We show that the retailers are likely to participate in the promotion if consumers become more price-sensitive. However, it does not imply that the retailers can benefit from the price promotion; the promotion decision game resembles the classical prisoner’s dilemma game. The retailers and suppliers can benefit from the cooperative promotion by designing an appropriate cost sharing contract. For a supply chain, the bargaining power between supplier and retailer, consumer price sensitivity, and competition intensity affect the fraction of the <b>promotional</b> <b>cost</b> sharing. We also find that equilibrium value of e-coupon set by the e-commerce platform is not optimal for all the parties...|$|R

Although Makeba Riddick did not serve as the song's vocal producer, Daniels cited her {{as an example of how}} the process works and how much she would charge. It is the responsibility of the vocal producer to tell a singer how to sing the song correctly to achieve the desired sound. Daniels said that Riddick's fee varies from $10,000 to $15,000, and that the final part of the process is for the song to be mixed and mastered, which incurs a similar fee. He {{estimated the}} final cost of writing, producing, vocal producing, mixing and mastering [...] "Man Down" [...] to be $78,000.

40|$|Economic impact studies {{based on}} short-run {{spending}} injections and multipliers lack conceptual ties to measures of economic surplus, fail to capture intangible benefits and generally fail to measure costs. In {{this case study}} of the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) held in Israel in 1999, national benefits from the government-financed televising of the ESC are measured as producer surplus (approximated by private sector incremental profits), consumer surplus (measured as the incremental willingness {{to pay for an}} event staged at home) and government surplus (linked to national implicit benefits in the form of <b>promotional</b> advertising <b>cost</b> savings). The opportunity costs of diverting resources to this particular televised event are expressly included as an offset to these gross surplus benefits.

40|$|Ever {{since its}} {{introduction}} {{in the second}} decade of the past century, the economic order quantity (EOQ) model {{has been the subject}} of extensive investigations and extensions by academicians. The physical characteristics of stocked items dictate the nature of inventory policies implemented to manage and control. The question is how reliable are the EOQ models when items stocked deteriorate one time. This paper introduces a modified EOQ model in which it assumes that a percentage of the on-hand inventory is wasted due to deterioration. There is hidden cost not account for when modeling inventory cost. We study the problem of promotion for a deteriorating item subject to loss of these deteriorated units. The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal time length, optimal units lost due to deterioration, the promotional effort and the replenishment quantity so that the net profit is maximized and the numerical analysis show that an appropriate promotion policy can benefit the retailer and that promotion policy is important, especially for deteriorating items.

50|$|The KT26 {{remained}} unchanged for decades while competitor brands changed their designs, materials and constructions and used built-in obsolescence and short {{product life cycle}} marketing. This enabled the KT26 to establish a consumer following but it also become dated {{in the minds of}} many retailers. Dunlop Footwear's marketing of the KT26 resulted in it becoming dependent on a few major discount department store retailers (DDS) of KMART, Target, Big W etc for retail of the KT26 at a time when the Internet dramatically eroded all retail stores' share of footwear sales and many footwear chains and shops closed. At the same time the DDS retailers were also producing and retailing their own 'home brand' sports shoes. To remain viable in the DDS market space, Dunlop Footwear's primary focus was cost reduction with no brand or <b>promotional</b> activities. <b>Cost</b> pressures saw the production of the KT26 moved offshore to China in the late 1990s and moved between Chinese factories for the next decade to find the cheapest per unit production price. As a result, the quality of the KT26 suffered and the famed fit / last shape varied depending on the factory at the time. Product returns and customer complaints accelerated the KT26's demise and during 2011, all major DDS retailers had dropped or were in the process of dropping the KT26 form their footwear offerings.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to present a method of target market selection developed for the downhill skiing industry of Colorado. A two-dimensional system for strategically classifying alternative markets on the basis of existing sales and incremental sales poten-tial is proposed. Using a regression model of Colorado ski visitation, the 205 nonresident areas of dominant influence (ADIs) in the continental United States are classified. Target market selection and the allocation of promotional efforts across alternative markets are key strategic concerns of destination marketing organizations (Woodside 1990). Given limited <b>promotional</b> resources, increasing <b>costs,</b> and increasing accountability demands, tourism marketers must allocate promotional efforts across alternative markets to achieve two goals: (1) maintenance of important existing mar-kets and (2) penetration of markets with high incremental sales potential (Hawes, Taylor, and Hampe 1991). Through-out this article, tourism markets are defined as geographic origin areas. Specifically, a tourism market is the set of all existing and potential tourists from a specified geographic origin to a destination, given a defined market environment (adapted from Kotler 1986, p. 247).

40|$|This paper {{explored}} how {{to create}} interest for the Danish men’s basketball national team (DMBNT). The objective was to create strategic marketing mix recommendations grounded in sports marketing and sponsorship theories. An interview with the DMBNT manager Rasmus Winkel, provided data that was analyzed with the contingency framework for strategic sports marketing. The framework studies external and internal contingencies, and a SWOT analysis for the DMBNT was conducted based on the findings. It showed positive external opportunities like increasing demand, but also some significant threats from FIBA, the governing body of international basketball, and other competing sports. Internal weaknesses and strengths showed a low budget, but high absolute quality of basketball and a strong partnership with TV 2. The consumer needs and target market selection, which are also parts of the contingency framework, were investigated through an online survey, which showed that the target market for the DMBNT should be 10 - 40 year olds, preferably males, from the basketball environment. The consumer needs of possible sponsors were explored through two interviews with managers from Danish basketball teams, and the A-ERIC model was used to analyze their answers, which showed that sponsors in the Danish basketball market are primarily interested in creating business to business relationships through their sponsorships. All of these findings led to marketing mix recommendations that suggested that the DMBNT should implement a brand identity, create a business network as a secondary product, place games in Aarhus or Copenhagen if the costs allowed it, use a skimming strategy for ticket sales, sell V. I. P ticket to devoted fans, and use low <b>cost</b> <b>promotional</b> tools like online advertising and publicity to reach their desired target market and thus increase interest...|$|R
