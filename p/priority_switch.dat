40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} routing {{protocol}} which takes into ac-count {{the quality of}} service (QoS) in multichannel multihop wireless local area networks (WLANs). In the proposed proto-col, traffic-receiving nodes switch their channels and associate with other access points (APs) based on the load of each AP. Here, the nodes that receive the traffic with high <b>priority</b> <b>switch</b> their channels and associate with other APs only if the available bandwidth is not sufficient. This approach can suppress the variations of the throughput for the high-priority flows. There-fore, the proposed protocol differentiates the communication between the high-priority flows and the low priority ones and achieves the QoS. Network simulations confirm a good perfor-mance of the proposed protocol. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel architecture of internally two priority buffered Multistage Interconnection Network (MIN). First, we compare by simulation the new architecture against a single priority MIN and demonstrate up to N times higher high-priority throughput {{in a hot}} spot situation, when N {{is the number of}} inputs. In addition, under uniform traffic assumption we show an increase in the low priority throughput, without any change in the high priority throughput. Moreover, while in the single priority system the high priority delay and its standard deviation are increased when low priority traffic is present, it is kept constant in the dual priority system. Finally, we introduce a new approach of long Markovian memory performance model to better capture the packets dependency in a single priority MIN under uniform traffic and extend this model for a dual priority MIN. Model results are shown to be very accurate. these previous works, our paper considers for the first time an internal two <b>priority</b> <b>switch</b> fabric architecture and focus on the effect of a two priority input buffered Multistage Interconnection Network (MIN) on the performance of high and low priority traffic. We also suggest a new Markovian model for analyzing the performance of the two priority traffic types, assuming uniform traffic, and present numerical results. II. SINGLE VS.

40|$|A major {{drawback}} of {{the traditional}} output queuing technique is that it requires a switch speedup of N, where N {{is the size of}} the switch. This dependence on N makes the switch non-scalable at high speeds. Input queuing has been suggested instead. The introduction of input queuing creates the necessity for developing switching algorithms to decide which packets to keep waiting at the input, and which packets to forward across the switch. In this thesis, we address various algorithmic aspects of switching. We prove in this thesis, that many of the practical switching algorithms still require a speedup to achieve even a weak notion of throughput. We propose two switching algorithms that belong to a family to which we refer in this thesis as <b>priority</b> <b>switching.</b> These two algorithms overcome some of the disadvantages in existing <b>priority</b> <b>switching</b> algorithms, such as the excessive amount of state information that needs to be maintained. We also develop a practical algorithm that belongs to a family to which we refer in this thesis as iterative switching. This algorithm achieves high throughput in practice and offers the advantage of not requiring more than one iteration, unlike other existing iterative switching algorithms which require multiple iterations to achieve high throughput. Finally, we address the issue of using switches in parallel to accommodate for the need of speedup. We study two settings of parallel switches, one with standard packet switching, and one with flow scheduling, in which flows cannot be split across multiple switches. by Saadeddine Mneimneh.

Multimedia integrates voice and video along with text and images into existing systems. Local area networks were designed to handle regular data traffic which are bursty in nature and for which variable delay is acceptable. Multimedia traffic, on the other hand, requires constant delay in addition to fast (or real time) delivery. Multimedia traffic also requires large amount of bandwidth compared to regular traffic. Since local area networks are widely in use, their modification to integrate multimedia streams is very important.

40|$|The {{distribution}} network restoration {{is one of}} the most important parts in the total power system restoration process. The {{distribution network}} restoration decomposes into the identification of a suitable network configuration, which is defined by the status of switches between the radially arranged power lines and the optimization of the restoration paths, which are schedules for toggling switches and booting network nodes. This paper presents a two-stage approach for the restoration process of radial high voltage distribution network (e. g. HOkV). A Pareto-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to optimize the network configuration regarding the load that can be picked up, load <b>priorities,</b> and <b>switching</b> activity. Then, a multi-objective fuzzy decision method (FDM) selects the restoration paths. FDMs choices rely on performance indexes defined by human experts and harmonized as well as linearized by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP).

40|$|Mobile {{communication}} systems {{have continued to}} evolve beyond the currently deployed Third Generation (3 G) systems with the main goal of providing higher capacity. Systems beyond 3 G are expected to cater {{for a wide variety}} of services such as speech, data, image transmission, video, as well as multimedia services consisting of a combination of these. With the air interface being the bottleneck in mobile networks, recent enhancing technologies such as the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), incorporate major changes to the radio access segment of 3 G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). HSDPA introduces new features such as fast link adaptation mechanisms, fast packet scheduling, and physical layer retransmissions in the base stations, necessitating buffering of data at the air interface which presents a bottleneck to end-to-end communication. Hence, in order to provide end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to multimedia services in wireless networks such as HSDPA, efficient buffer management schemes are required at the air interface. The main objective of this thesis is to propose and evaluate solutions that will address the QoS optimization of multimedia traffic at the radio link interface of HSDPA systems. In the thesis, a novel queuing system known as the Time-Space Priority (TSP) scheme is proposed for multimedia traffic QoS control. TSP provides customized preferential treatment to the constituent flows in the multimedia traffic to suit their diverse QoS requirements. With TSP queuing, the real-time component of the multimedia traffic, being delay sensitive and loss tolerant, is given transmission priority; while the non-real-time component, being loss sensitive and delay tolerant, enjoys space priority. Hence, based on the TSP queuing paradigm, new buffer managementalgorithms are designed for joint QoS control of the diverse components in a multimedia session of the same HSDPA user. In the thesis, a TSP based buffer management algorithm known as the Enhanced Time Space Priority (E-TSP) is proposed for HSDPA. E-TSP incorporates flow control mechanisms to mitigate congestion in the air interface buffer of a user with multimedia session comprising real-time and non-real-time flows. Thus, E-TSP is designed to provide efficient network and radio resource utilization to improve end-to-end multimedia traffic performance. In order to allow real-time optimization of the QoS control between the real-time and non-real-time flows of the HSDPA multimedia session, another TSP based buffer management algorithm known as the Dynamic Time Space Priority (D-TSP) is proposed. D-TSP incorporates dynamic <b>priority</b> <b>switching</b> between the real-time and non-real-time flows. D-TSP is designed to allow optimum QoS trade-off between the flows whilst still guaranteeing the stringent real-time component’s QoS requirements. The thesis presents results of extensive performance studies undertaken via analytical modelling and dynamic network-level HSDPA simulations demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed TSP queuing system and the TSP based buffer management schemes.
