25|$|While Mel Gibson {{financed the}} film through his Icon Productions, Disney {{signed on to}} {{distribute}} Apocalypto for a fee in certain markets under the Touchstone Pictures label. The publicity for the film started with a December 2005 teaser trailer that was filmed {{before the start of}} principal photography and before Rudy Youngblood was cast as Jaguar Paw. As a joke, Gibson inserted a subliminal cameo of the bearded director in a <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt</b> with a cigarette hanging from his mouth posing next to a group of dust-covered Maya. A clean-shaven Gibson also filmed a Mayan-language segment for the introduction of the 2006 Academy Awards in which he declined to host the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Within {{two days}} of these sightings, a man called police to report the {{discovery}} of a body in the river, clothed in a blue <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt,</b> lying face-down, at about 7:00 AM on December 5, 1982. This body is now presumed to be that of the adult woman. Authorities responded to the scene, located along Interstate 10, but instead came across the child's body. The sheriff who found Delta Dawn initially mistook her for his daughter, who was later found to be alive and well at his residence. Authorities immediately believed that the girl had been thrown from the bridge to the area where her body was found, as it was blocked by weeds and it was unlikely that the girl's body had drifted to the location.|$|E
50|$|The use of flannel <b>plaid</b> <b>shirts</b> was at {{peak in the}} 1990s {{with popular}} grunge bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam using them {{as one of the}} {{trademarks}} of their shaggy look. However, few of the mass-produced <b>plaid</b> <b>shirts</b> available at the time were actually made out of flannel. The association between flannel and plaid has lead to the incorrect use of flannel as a synonym for plaid.|$|R

25|$|It was {{not until}} six days later that her remains, which were in an {{advanced}} state of decomposition, {{were found in the}} weeds a few feet off the side of a scarcely traveled road in Holmes County, Ohio. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted with a vibrator and a large plastic bag had been wrapped around her legs. Because of the condition of her remains, police were not able to identify the body until Harrison's father confirmed that it was his daughter. A Budweiser towel, a bloody car seat box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt</b> and jeans were all found {{in the vicinity of the}} dump site. Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather. Krista was buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Marshallville.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the Wizard of Oz references, Underwood {{commented that}} [...] "it {{was all about}} having subtle references," [...] such as the <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt</b> and red shoes she wore on the video. When asked if her aim was to {{generate}} controversy with the storyline, the singer {{said that it was}} not what she were aiming for at all, adding: [...] "I try to stay away from controversy in any form or fashion. It was just such a great story and such a mini-movie, listening to the song, and we really wanted to do it justice in the video." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a short sample of Fantasia's song [...] "Crazy", another track from The Definition Of..., {{accompanied}} by images from a high school yearbook. A teenage Fantasia is introduced discussing love with her friends while having a party in her bedroom. She develops a crush on a classmate, while rejecting the romantic advances from other men. Following a time jump, Fantasia leaves her boyfriend after discovering {{that he has been}} cheating on her with another woman. Close-up images of singers Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin, and girl groups SWV and TLC are used throughout the video. The adult version of Fantasia is costumed in 1990s fashion, such as hoop earrings, a choker, and a <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt,</b> as well as a hairstyle reminiscent of American singer T-Boz. Fantasia's clothing and hair are stylized after [...] "a mix ofTLCmeetsJade". Following the break-up, Fantasia forms a relationship with her childhood male friend. After another time lapse, the video ends with Fantasia marrying her partner in a wedding ceremony.|$|E

500|$|However, in Florida v. J.L., the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} police {{officers}} {{did not have}} reasonable suspicion to detain a suspect based on an anonymous tip “that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt</b> was carrying a gun.” The Court held that the tip [...] "lacked the moderate indicia of reliability present in White and essential to the Court’s decision in that case. The anonymous call concerning J.L. provided no predictive information, and therefore left the police without means to test the informant’s knowledge or credibility.” The Court declined to create a [...] "firearm exception" [...] for anonymous tips, but the court noted in dicta that a tip describing a bomb threat need not bear the indicia of reliability otherwise required of other anonymous tips. The Supreme Court of California would later rely upon this [...] "bomb exception" [...] in People v. Wells, when it ruled that an anonymous tip that accurately described a vehicle “weaving all over the roadway” justified a traffic stop. The California court held that “considerations of public safety and common sense” permit officers to conduct traffic stops based on anonymous tips [...] "to confirm the officer’s reasonable suspicion of intoxicated driving before a serious traffic accident can occur.” ...|$|E
500|$|Freedom of Speech {{depicts a}} scene of a local town meeting in which Jim Edgerton, the lone {{dissenter}} to the town selectmen's announced {{plans to build a}} new school, was accorded the floor as a matter of protocol. The old school had burned down. Once he envisioned this scene to depict freedom of speech, Rockwell decided to use his Vermont neighbors as models for a Four Freedoms series. The blue-collar speaker wears a <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt</b> and suede jacket. He has dirty hands and a darker complexion than others in attendance. The other attendees are wearing white shirts, ties and jackets. Although one of the men is wearing a wedding band, the speaker is not. Edgerton's youth and workmanlike hands are fashioned with a worn and stained jacket, while the other attendees, appear to be older and more neatly and formally dressed. He is shown [...] "standing tall, his mouth open, his shining eyes transfixed, he speaks his mind, untrammeled and unafraid." [...] Edgerton is depicted in a way that resembles Abraham Lincoln. According to Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal, the closest figure in the painting is revealing a subject of the meeting as [...] "a discussion of the town's annual report". According to John Updike, the work is painted without any painterly brushwork. According to Robert Scholes, the work shows audience members in rapt attention with a sort of admiration of this lone speaker.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of the {{apartment}} that Lewis and Haynes shared. Books and a vase lay strewn across the floor, while Lewis weeps in the corner and Haynes watches from a distance teary-eyed. The video switches to several other shots of Lewis singing the first verse, looking morose. In a third shot, Lewis is seen standing on a rooftop against the Los Angeles skyline dressed in a dark red crop top. Then the video switches to Lewis standing in front of projected images of the memorable times of her relationship with Haynes. Lewis and Haynes are seen sat at opposite ends of the sofa looking into the distance, spliced with more scenes of Lewis on the rooftop. The couple are seen during an awkward dinner before switching to images of the couple in bed together, seemingly happy. As the chorus kicks in for the first time, the couple are seen arriving at a party, with Lewis wearing an aqua-coloured dress with a portion of her midriff revealed, meanwhile Haynes wears a <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt</b> and jeans. Initially the couple are content, embracing guests but socialising separately and avoiding contact with each other. The camera switches between these and the earlier scenes of Lewis in front of projected images and the LA skyline throughout the chorus. As Lewis sings [...] "I'm a whole lot of trouble/ We're in a whole lot of trouble", she glances over to see Haynes flirting with another girl.|$|E
50|$|Instead of the {{standard}} of wearing a dress or skirt, particularly hoop skirts and poodle skirts, many young women wore jeans and <b>plaid</b> <b>shirts,</b> or simple plain T shirts in rebellion with the gender roles and societal norms at that time.

500|$|Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; {{the magnet}} for talent {{was not the}} pay, {{generally}} mediocre, but rather the allure of {{taking part in the}} first computer-animated feature. Lasseter said that on the challenges of the computer animation in the film [...] "We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs." [...] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was either created out of clay or was first modeled off of a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design. Once the animators had a model, articulation and motion controls were coded; this would allow each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping. Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth. The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt</b> with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.|$|E

On November 21, it was sung at the 2008 American Music Awards. A critic from ABC stated that Cyrus [...] "fearlessly embraced new creative directions" [...] with her performance of [...] "Fly on the Wall." [...] On November 25, Cyrus performed the song on the season finale of Dancing with the Stars. On New Year's Eve of 2008, Cyrus wore a white T-shirt, pants, boots and a plaid jacket to present FNMTVs New Year's Special with Pete Wentz. She opened the episode by performing the song, paired with [...] "7 Things." [...] On January 19, 2009, the song was performed at the [...] event in celebration of Barack Obama's inauguration. For the event, she had an abundance of background dancers, and Cyrus wore a casual patterned gray T-shirt, black pants, and boots. She also performed the song in London in an Apple Store. The set, with some songs by Cyrus' father, was sold exclusively by the United Kingdom iTunes Store as an extended play titled iTunes Live from London. On June 7, 2009 at the twentieth annual A Time for Heroes Celebrity Carnival, Cyrus performed [...] "Fly on the Wall".|$|E
2500|$|Both Mexican and U.S. {{authorities}} {{suspected that}} Kilroy's disappearance {{was some sort}} of foul play. They speculated that Kilroy could have been a victim of drug-related violence or of robbery-killing, but they were short on leads to make any firm conclusions. When Kilroy's friends reported the disappearance, Customs agents went with them to Matamoros to help retrace their steps. Texan officials contacted the U.S. consulate in Matamoros and asked investigators to carry out a search with Kilroy's description in Matamoros jails and hospitals. Investigators then hired a hypnotist {{to see if he could}} figure out some clues. Under hypnosis, Bradley stated that he saw a young Hispanic man wearing a blue <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt</b> and with a visible scar across his face talking to Kilroy before he disappeared. He recalled that the man walked up to Kilroy and told him, [...] "Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?" [...] though Bill said he was not sure if Kilroy responded back. However, none of the friends were able to precisely recall the exact moment or place where Kilroy disappeared. Investigators deduced by this story that Kilroy was kidnapped for robbery or ransom. The first option seemed the most likely because his abductors had not called for a payment. They believed that Kilroy's body was probably dumped in a remote location. Helicopters and terrain vehicles of the United States Border Patrol were called to look on the Rio Grande River, but his body was not found.|$|E

2500|$|A White 1970 Cadillac De Ville {{convertible}} {{was used}} as Boss Hogg's car, notably with large bull horns as a hood ornament. In early seasons, Hogg was almost always driven by a chauffeur, who was normally nameless and {{had little or no}} dialogue, but identified on occasion as being called [...] "Alex"; and played by several different uncredited actors, including stuntman Gary Baxley. This chauffeur would often be dressed in a red <b>plaid</b> <b>shirt</b> and deep brown or black Stetson hat, but on occasion would be an older man, sometimes dressed in more typical chauffeur attire. Hogg is first seen to drive for himself in the second season opener [...] "Days of Shine and Roses", where he and Jesse challenge each other to one last moonshine race. From the fourth season onward, except for a couple of brief reappearances of the chauffeur (during the fourth season), Hogg drove himself around in his Cadillac (or occasionally driven by Rosco and, in the series' finale, by Uncle Jesse) and frequently challenged others by invoking his driving expertise from his days as a ridge-runner. Unlike other vehicles in the series, Boss Hogg's Cadillac is typically treated with kid gloves. The car is almost always seen with its convertible top down, with the top only being seen in two episodes, [...] "Daisy's Song" [...] (the chauffeur was called [...] "Eddie" [...] in this episode), the second to be produced and broadcast, and briefly in the second-season episode [...] "Witness for the Persecution", when Cooter is returning it to the Court House after repairs.|$|E

Hair styles were relatively short, not a crew cut, but definitely something that would not blow in the wind or require much hair spray {{to hold it in}} place. The look was modelled heavily on the greasers of the 1950s and 1960s, which was also an influence on punk, heavy metal and fetish subcultures.|$|R
