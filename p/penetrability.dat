Influenced by the penultimate shot in Antonioni's The Passenger (1975), on which Tovoli had also been the cinematographer, one of Tenebraes main setpieces is {{the murder of the}} lesbian couple. To introduce the scene, Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a Louma crane to film a several minutes-long tracking shot. Owing to its extreme length, the tracking shot ended up being the most difficult and complex part of the production to complete. It required a maze of scaffolding to be built around the outside of the home. Argento captured all the footage he needed in two takes, but insisted on filming ten more. The scene, which lasts for two-and-a-half minutes on-screen, took three days to shoot. It marked the first time the Louma crane had been used in an Italian production; the crane itself had to be imported from France. According to Gracey, the camera performs [...] "aerial gymnastics", scaling the victims' house in [...] "one seamless take, navigating walls, roofs, and peering in through windows, in a set piece that effortlessly exposes the <b>penetrability</b> of a seemingly secure home". Newman and Jones said that although this type of crane shot became commonplace later, {{at the time it was}} [...] "truly ground-breaking" [...] in the way the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up the building – not quite from the killer's viewpoint. Patrick McAllister of Scifilm said the sequence should be considered [...] "one of the most memorable moments in cinema".

During these calculations some technical parts of the model have been revised. The identification of fission modes is now based on unequivocal and reproducible criteria. The Ralyleigh criterion has consequently been applied to determine each possible scission configuration. The most remarkable new results are, that all physically relevant fission modes branches off in the second potential minimum exhibiting different outer barriers, and that the total kinetic energy distribution of the fission fragments is a direct consequence of the Rayleigh criterion. The fragment characteristics as the mean mass, the mean total kinetic energy and the corresponding width obtained from the fission-mode calculations compare reasonably well with the experimental findings. For the first time the weighted fission cross-sections through each particular fission mode have been analyzed simultaneously using a Hill-Wheeler expression for the transmission through a double-humped fission barrier.

40|$|Bacteria {{communicate}} with each other by the use of signaling molecules, a process called ‘quorum sensing’. One group of quorum sensing molecules includes the oligopeptides, which are mainly produced by Gram-positive bacteria. Recently, these quorum sensing peptides were found to biologically influence mammalian cells, promoting i. a. metastasis of cancer cells. Moreover, it was found that bacteria can influence different central nervous system related disorders as well, e. g. anxiety, depression and autism. Research currently focuses on the role of bacterial metabolites in this bacteria-brain interaction, with the role of the quorum sensing peptides not yet known. Here, three chemically diverse quorum sens-ing peptides were investigated for their brain influx (multiple time regression technique) and efflux properties in an in vivomouse model (ICR-CD- 1) to determine blood-brain transfer properties: PhrCACET 1 demonstrated comparatively a very high initial influx into the mouse brain (Kin = 20. 87 μl/(g×min)), while brain <b>penetrabilities</b> of BIP- 2 and PhrANTH 2 were found to be low (Kin = 2. 68 μl/(g×min)) and very low (Kin = 0. 18 μl/(g×min)), respec-tively.

5000|$|Wishful seeing {{has been}} {{observed}} to occur in early stages of categorization. Research using ambiguous figures and binocular rivalry exhibit this tendency. Perception is influenced by both top-down and bottom-up processing. In visual processing, bottom-up processing is a rigid route compared to flexible top-down processing. Within bottom-up processing, the stimuli are recognized by fixation points, proximity and focal areas to build objects, while top-down processing is more context sensitive. This effect can be observed via priming {{as well as with}} emotional states. [...] The traditional hierarchical models of information processing describe early visual processing as a one-way street: early visual processing goes into conceptual systems, but conceptual systems do not affect visual processes. [...] Currently, research rejects this model and suggests conceptual information can penetrate early visual processing rather than just biasing the perceptual systems. This occurrence is called conceptual or cognitive <b>penetrability.</b> Research on conceptual <b>penetrability</b> utilize stimuli of conceptual-category pairs and measure the reaction time to determine if the category effect influenced visual processing, [...] The category effect is the difference in reaction times within the pairs such as Bb to Bp. To test conceptual <b>penetrability,</b> there were simultaneous and sequential judgments of pairs. The reaction times decreased as the stimulus onset asynchrony increased, supporting categories affect visual representations and conceptual <b>penetrability.</b> Research with richer stimuli such as figures of cats and dogs allow for greater perceptual variability and analysis of stimulus typicality (cats and dogs were arranged in various positions, some more or less typical for recognition). Differentiating the pictures took longer when they were within the same category (doga-dogb) compared between categories (dog-cat) supporting category knowledge influences categorization. Therefore, visual processing measured by physical differential judgments is affected by non-visual processing supporting conceptual <b>penetrability.</b>|$|E
40|$|We generalize {{the theory}} of nuclear decay and capture of Gamow {{that is based on}} {{tunneling}} through the barrier and internal oscillations inside the nucleus. In our formalism an additional factor is obtained, which describes distribution of the wave function of the α particle inside the nuclear region. We discover new most stable states (called quasibound states) of the compound nucleus (CN) formed during the capture of α particle by the nucleus. With a simple example, we explain why these states cannot appear in traditional calculations of the α capture cross sections based on monotonic <b>penetrabilities</b> of a barrier, but they appear in a complete description of the evolution of the CN. Our result is obtained by a complete description of the CN evolution, which has the advantages of (1) a clear picture of the formation of the CN and its disintegration, (2) a detailed quantum description of the CN, (3) tests of the calculated amplitudes based on quantum mechanics (not realized in other approaches), and (4) high accuracy of calculations (not achieved in other approaches). These peculiarities are shown with the capture reaction of α + ^ 44 Ca. We predict quasibound energy levels and determine fusion probabilities for this reaction. The difference between our approach and theory of quasistationary states with complex energies applied for the α capture is also discussed. We show (1) that theory does not provide calculations for the cross section of α capture (according to modern models of the α capture), in contrast with our formalism, and (2) these two approaches describe different states of the α capture (for the same α-nucleus potential).

The model is motivated by the Faddeev approach where {{the form of the}} T matrix is written as a sum of the distinct Jacobi coordinate systems corresponding to particle configurations (α, n-n) and (n; n-α) to describe the final state. The structure in the spectra comes from the resonances of the two-body subsystems of the three-body final state, namely the singlet (T = 1) nucleon-nucleon (NN) anti-bound resonance, and the Nα resonances designated the ground state (Jπ = 3 − 23 ^ - 2) and first excited state (Jπ = 1 − 21 ^ - 2) of the A = 5 systems 5 He and 5 Li. These resonances are described in terms of single-level, single-channel R-matrix parameters that are taken from analyses of NN and Nα scattering data. While the resonance parameters are approximately charge symmetric, external charge-dependent effects are included in the <b>penetrabilities,</b> shifts, and hard-sphere phases, and in the level energies to account for internal Coulomb differences. The shapes of the resonance contributions to the spectrum are fixed by other, two-body data and the only adjustable parameters in the model are the combinatorial amplitudes for the compound system. These are adjusted to reproduce the observed nucleon spectra from measurements at the Omega and NIF facilities. We perform a simultaneous, least-squares fit of the tt neutron spectra and the 3 He 3 He proton spectra.
