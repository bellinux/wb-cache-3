5|$|The <b>Pebbles</b> and Bamm-Bamm Show is an American {{animated}} television series, {{produced by}} Hanna-Barbera, which originally aired for one season on CBS from September 11, 1971 to January 1, 1972. With an ensemble voice cast of Sally Struthers, Jay North, Mitzi McCall, Gay Hartwig, Carl Esser and Lennie Weinrib, the show follows teenage <b>Pebbles</b> Flintstone and Bamm-Bamm Rubble as they encounter problems with {{growing up in}} the fictional town of Bedrock. The <b>Pebbles</b> and Bamm-Bamm Show is the first spinoff series of The Flintstones. After its cancellation in 1972, various segments sharing the same title were broadcast on The Flintstone Comedy Hour, serving as a continuation of the show.|$|E
5|$|Back at Mina, {{the pilgrims}} perform {{symbolic}} stoning {{of the devil}} (Ramy al-Jamarat) by throwing seven stones at only {{the largest of the}} three pillars, known as Jamrat al-Aqabah from sunrise to sunset. The remaining two pillars (jamarah) are not stoned on this day. These pillars are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they can throw their <b>pebbles</b> at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 the pillars were replaced by long walls, with catch basins below to collect the <b>pebbles.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{connection}} between <b>pebble</b> games and complexity. First, we derive complexity results using <b>pebble</b> games. It is shown that three <b>pebble</b> games used for studying computational complexity are equivalent: namely, the two-person <b>pebble</b> game of Dymond-Tompa, the two-person <b>pebble</b> game of Raz-McKenzie, and the one-person reversible <b>pebble</b> game of Bennett have the same <b>pebble</b> costs over any directed acyclic graph. The three <b>pebble</b> games {{have been used for}} studying parallel complexity and for proving lower bounds under restricted settings, and we show one more such lower bound on circuit-depth. Second, the <b>pebble</b> costs are applied to proof complexity. Concerning a family of unsatisfiable CNFs called <b>pebbling</b> contradictions, the <b>pebble</b> cost in any of the <b>pebble</b> games controls the scaling of some parameters of resolution refutations. Namely, the <b>pebble</b> cost controls the minimum depth of resolution refutations and the minimum size of tree-like resolution refutations. Finally, we study the space complexity of computing the <b>pebble</b> costs and of computing the minimum depth of resolution refutations. It is PSPACE-complete to compute the <b>pebble</b> cost in any of the three <b>pebble</b> games, and to compute the minimum depth of resolution refutations...|$|R
25|$|After {{releasing}} the <b>Pebble</b> Smartwatch, on 24 February 2015, <b>Pebble</b> CEO Eric Migicovsky announced the <b>Pebble</b> Time, {{the second generation}} smartwatch of <b>Pebble.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>Pebbles</b> and Bamm-Bamm Show was {{the first}} {{spin-off}} series derived from The Flintstones, minus the theatrical film The Man Called Flintstone in 1966. Several individuals wrote episodes for the series, including Joel Kane, Woody Kling, Howard Morganstern, Joe Ruby, and Ken Spears. Executively produced by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's Hanna-Barbera Productions, Charles A. Nichols served as the director and Iwao Takamoto was an additional producer. The main title theme and music for The <b>Pebbles</b> and Bamm-Bamm Show were composed by Hoyt Curtin and Ted Nichols.|$|E
5|$|High cliffs, sandbars {{and piles}} of <b>pebbles</b> testify to the {{existence}} of strong wave action on the northeastern shore, which was influenced by strong northwesterly winds. Inversely, the gentle southern slopes of the lake bed probably reduced wave action on the lake's southern shores.|$|E
5|$|Lennie Weinrib as Moonrock, one of <b>Pebbles</b> and Bamm-Bamm's {{friends who}} was {{intelligent}} and enjoyed inventing things.

25|$|Fitbit paid $23 {{million for}} <b>Pebble's</b> {{intellectual}} property, despite <b>Pebble's</b> debt and other obligations exceeding that. Fitbit {{is not taking}} on <b>Pebble's</b> debt. The rest of <b>Pebble’s</b> assets, including product inventory and server equipment, will be sold off separately. Following the acquisition, <b>Pebble's</b> offices will be closed {{and it will be}} up to Fitbit to decide whether to continue using the <b>Pebble</b> brand. The former <b>Pebble</b> engineers will relocate to Fitbit’s offices in San Francisco.|$|R

25|$|<b>Pebble</b> had {{announced}} three new watches in May: the <b>Pebble</b> 2, Time 2, and <b>Pebble</b> Core. The <b>Pebble</b> 2 {{has already started}} shipping to people who funded the startup through crowd-funding site Kickstarter. The Time 2 and <b>Pebble</b> Core will be canceled and refunds will be issued to Kickstarter backers.|$|R
5|$|M. nigriceps is a mound {{constructing}} species, although colonies can {{be found}} under logs. Workers decorate the nest {{with a variety of}} items, including lateritic <b>pebbles</b> and soil crumbs, in a similar fashion of meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) nests. Other items used for nest decorating include small stones and plant material.|$|E
5|$|Pilgrims {{must leave}} Arafat for Muzdalifah after sunset without praying maghrib (evening) prayer at Arafat. Muzdalifah {{is an area}} between Arafat and Mina. Upon {{reaching}} there, pilgrims perform Maghrib and Isha prayer jointly, spend the night praying and sleeping {{on the ground with}} open sky, and gather <b>pebbles</b> for the next day's ritual of the stoning of the Devil (Shaitan).|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives on}} hard benthic substrates, {{typically}} rocks. It lives on <b>pebbles,</b> sometimes on boulders, and rarely on dead wood. It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2mg/liter) {{but it does}} not tolerate long periods of droughts, or ice. It lives in mesotrophic waters, and sometimes in oligotrophic waters.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{complexity}} of computing the optimal <b>pebbling</b> number and <b>pebbling</b> number of a graph. We show that deciding whether the optimal <b>pebbling</b> number of G is at most k is NP-complete and deciding whether the <b>pebbling</b> number of G is at most k is Π_ 2 -complete. Additionally, we provide a characterization of when an unordered set of <b>pebbling</b> moves can be ordered to form a valid sequence of <b>pebbling</b> moves. Comment: 24 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the complexity of}} graph <b>pebbling,</b> dealing with both traditional <b>pebbling</b> and the recently introduced game of cover <b>pebbling.</b> Determining whether a configuration is solvable according to either the traditional definition or the cover <b>pebbling</b> definition is shown to be NP-complete. The problem of determining the cover <b>pebbling</b> number for an arbitrary demand configuration is shown to be NP-hard. ...|$|R

5|$|While {{relaying}} the deteriorated {{floor of}} Akbari Gate in April 2007, three floors in the fort were unearthed {{belonging to the}} British, Sikh and Mughal period. The floor of the British, Sikh and Mughal periods were constructed with bricks, burnt bricks and <b>pebbles</b> respectively. The latter either built during Jahangir's or Shah Jahan's era was the hallmark of Mughals.|$|E
5|$|At {{his home}} in Much Hadham, Moore built up a {{collection}} of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, <b>pebbles,</b> rocks and shells, which he would use to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he usually produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final moulding and casting at a bronze foundry. Moore often refined the final full plaster shape and added surface marks before casting.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as <b>pebbles,</b> pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E

40|$|We define {{three new}} <b>pebbling</b> {{parameters}} of a connected graph $G$, the $r$-, $g$-, and $u$-critical <b>pebbling</b> numbers. Together with the <b>pebbling</b> number, the optimal <b>pebbling</b> number, {{the number of}} vertices $n$ and the diameter $d$ of the graph, this yields 7 graph parameters. We determine the relationships between these parameters. We investigate properties of the $r$-critical <b>pebbling</b> number, and distinguish between greedy graphs, thrifty graphs, and graphs for which the $r$-critical <b>pebbling</b> number is $ 2 ^d$.

5|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{the production}} {{was not able}} to shoot the remounted scenes of episode one in the north-east, and they instead had to be filmed in and around Watford. Beach-set scenes were shot at Folkestone rather than Whitley Bay, which was obvious to locals on screen due to the presence of <b>pebbles</b> on the beach, which are not present at Whitley. This led to some critics mockingly referring to the production as Our Friends in the South.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Preclassic {{structures}} were built using volcanic stone {{held together with}} clay, as in the Middle Preclassic. However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented corners and stairways dressed with rounded <b>pebbles.</b> At the same time, old Olmec-style sculptures were moved from their original positions and {{placed in front of}} the new-style buildings, sometimes reusing sculpture fragments in the stone facing.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to improve the landing area by blasting rocks. A small jetty was erected in 1877, but it was washed away in a storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the Napier Commission suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the Congested Districts Board provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shore line are some huge boulders which were known throughout the Highlands and Islands in the 19th century as Doirneagan Hirt, Hirta's <b>pebbles.</b>|$|E

5|$|Inspired by {{the mundane}} sight of <b>pebbles</b> {{rolling in the}} Baltic Sea surf {{in the summer of}} 1921, Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall, {{conducting}} extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process. Although he had originally conceived of it as a hymn to the city and technology, over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature. He finished the manuscript in the summer of 1923, and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year.|$|E
5|$|On 25 December 1978, Sjumandjaja {{announced}} his return {{with a new}} film, Kabut Sutra Ungu (Mist of Purple Silk), an adaptation of the novel by Ike Soepomo. Kabut Sutra Ungu was followed by several more films, including Bukan Sandiwara (Not a Play; 1980), the biopic of female emancipation figure Kartini R. A. Kartini (1981), and Budak Nafsu (Slave to Lust; 1983), {{which was based on}} the novel Fatimah by Titie Said. Sjumandjaja's last film before his death, Kerikil-Kerikil Tajam (Sharp <b>Pebbles)</b> was released in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Sitakunda {{has been}} {{occupied}} by humans since the Neolithic era; tools {{associated with the}} prehistoric Assam group have been found throughout the area. In 1886, shouldered celts manufactured from petrified wood were discovered, as reported by Indian archaeologist Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay in his book Banglar Itihas, or History of Bengal, (volume I, 1914). In 1917, British mineralogist Dr. J. Coggin Brown uncovered more prehistoric celts. Large quantities of <b>pebbles</b> have also been found, but archaeologists have not determined whether they {{were used in the}} construction of prehistoric tools.|$|E
40|$|Bennett's <b>pebble</b> game [1, 2] was {{introduced}} to obtain better time/space tradeoffs in the simulation of standard Turing machines by reversible ones. So far only upper bounds for the tradeoff based on the <b>pebble</b> game have been published. Here we give a recursion for the time optimal solution of the <b>pebble</b> game given a space bound. We analyze the recursion to obtain an explicit asymptotic expression for the best time-space product. 1 Introduction In Bennett's <b>pebble</b> game, we have a board of n squares labeled s 1; : : :; s n. Each square may be empty or contain one <b>pebble.</b> A move in the game consists of adding or removing a <b>pebble.</b> A <b>pebble</b> {{can be added to}} or removed from square s i if i = 1 or if there is a <b>pebble</b> on square s iΓ 1. Initially, the board is empty. The desired final configuration has exactly one <b>pebble</b> on the board on square s n. For the motivation and application to reversible computing, we refer the reader to [1, 2]. The <b>pebble</b> game is trivial without resource [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Pebble</b> Time uses <b>Pebble</b> OS version 3.0. This OS is {{compatible}} with its color e-paper display. The OS features updated transitions between screens which [...] "morph" [...] into other features due to the constrained space of the watch's face. The OS version is also backward compatible with other features in previous versions of <b>Pebble</b> OS. It works with apps, watchfaces, and settings tailored for <b>Pebble</b> OS v. 2 or lower, {{as well as its}} predecessors. <b>Pebble</b> Time still retains most of the features from the original <b>Pebble</b> smartwatch, such as Bluetooth connectivity, and is currently only compatible with the smartwatch itself.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} generalizations of <b>pebbling</b> {{numbers and}} of Graham’s <b>pebbling</b> conjecture that π(G□H) ≤π(G) π(H), where π(G) is the <b>pebbling</b> {{number of the}} graph G. We develop new machinery to attack the conjecture, which is now twenty years old. We show that certain conjectures imply others that initially appear stronger. We also find counterexamples that shows that Sjöstrand’s theorem on cover <b>pebbling</b> does not apply if we allow the cost of transferring a <b>pebble</b> from one vertex to an adjacent vertex {{to depend on the}} weight of the edge and we describe an alternate <b>pebbling</b> number for which Graham’s conjecture is demonstrably false...|$|R
