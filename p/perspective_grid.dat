Demonstrations will show how to draw in measured perspective and finally how to render your completed drawings. Some of the films are supported by additional learning materials to help you practice your new skills. The materials you will need are listed at the start of each film. The entire package of resources including video, audio, images and documentation can be downloaded as a zip file. To view all resources on the project website, click the link below. Many of the longer films are broken into manageable chunks or ‘chapters’ so that you can easily repeat parts of the demonstration as required.

40|$|High quality volume {{rendering}} of SPH data requires a complex order-dependent resampling of particle quantities along the view rays.

We propose {{a new technique}} that leverages a <b>perspective</b> <b>grid</b> to adaptively discretize the view-volume, giving rise to a continuous level-of-detail sampling structure and reducing memory requirements compared to a uniform grid.

40|$|Abstract—Raytracing dynamic scenes at {{interactive}} {{rates have}} {{received a lot of}} attention recently. We present a few strategies for high performance raytracing on a commodity GPU. The construction of grids needs sorting, which is fast on today’s GPUs. The grid is thus the acceleration structure of choice for dynamic scenes as per-frame rebuilding is required. We advocate the use of appropriate data structures for each stage of raytracing, resulting in multiple structure building per frame. A <b>perspective</b> <b>grid</b> built for the camera achieves perfect coherence for primary rays. A <b>perspective</b> <b>grid</b> built with respect to each light source provides the best performance for shadow rays. Spherical grids handle lights positioned inside the model space and handle spotlights. Uniform grids are best for reflection and refraction rays with little coherence. We propose an Enforced Coherence method to bring coherence to them by rearranging the ray to voxel mapping using sorting. This gives the best performance on GPUs with only user-managed caches. We also propose a simple, Independent Voxel Walk method, which performs best by taking advantage of the L 1 and L 2 caches on recent GPUs. We achieve over 10 fps of total rendering on the Conference model with one light source and one reflection bounce, while rebuilding the data structure for each stage. Ideas presented here are likely to give high performance on the future GPUs as well as other manycore architectures...|$|E

40|$|I {{present a}} novel drawing system for {{composing}} and rendering perspective scenes. The proposed approach uses a projective two-dimensional representation for primitives {{rather than a}} conventional three-dimensional description. This representation is based on points that lie {{on the surface of}} a unit sphere centered at the viewpoint. It allows drawings to be composed with the same ease as traditional illustrations, while providing many of the advantages of a three-dimensional model. I describe a range of user-interface tools and interaction techniques that give the drawing system its three-dimensional-like capabilities. The system provides vanishing point guides and <b>perspective</b> <b>grids</b> to aid in drawing freehand strokes and composing perspective scenes. The system also has tools for intuitive navigation of a virtual camera, as well as methods for manipulating drawn primitives so that they appear to undergo three-dimensional translations and rotations. The new representation also supports automatic shading of primitives using either realistic or non-photorealistic styles. My system supports drawing and shading of extrusion surfaces with automatic hidden surface removal and emphasized silhouettes. Casting shadows from an infinite light source is also possible with minimal user intervention. I describe a method for aligning a sketch drawn outside the system using its vanishing points, allowing the integration of computer sketching and freehand sketching on paper in an iterative manner. Photographs and scanned drawings are applied to drawing primitives using conventional texture-mapping techniques, thereby enriching drawings and providing another way of incorporating hand-drawn images. I demonstrate the system with a variety of drawings. by Osama S. Tolba. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Architecture, 2001.

40|$|With ever-new {{technologies}} emerging {{also the}} amount of information to be stored and processed is growing exponentially and is believed to be always at the limit. In contrast, however, huge resources are available in the IT sector alike e. g. the renewable energy sector, which are often even not at all used. This under-usage bares any rational especially in the IT sector where e. g. virtualisation and grid approaches could be fast implemented due to the great technical and fast turnover opportunities. Here, we describe this obvious paradox {{for the first time as}} the Inverse Tragedy of the Commons, in contrast to the Classical Tragedy of the Commons where resources are overexploited. From this <b>perspective</b> the <b>grid</b> IT sector attempting to share resources for better efficiency, reveals two challenges leading to the heart of the paradox: i) From a macro <b>perspective</b> all <b>grid</b> infrastructures involve not only mere technical solutions but also dominantly all of the autopoietic social sub-systems ranging from religion to policy. ii) On the micro level the individual players and their psychology and risk behaviour are of major importance for acting within the macro autopoietic framework. Thus, the challenges of grid implementation are similar to those of e. g. climate protection. This is well described by the classic Human Ecology triangle and our extension to a rectangle: environment-individual-society-environment. Extension of this classical interdisciplinary field of basic and applied research to an e-Human Grid Ecology rational, allows the Inverse Tragedy of the Commons of the grid sector to be understood and approached better and implies obvious guidelines in the day-to-day management for grid and other (networked) resources, which is of importance for many fields with similar paradoxes as in (e-) society...|$|R

One common approach is to resample the quantities carried by the particles to a regular grid and to render the grid via volume ray-casting.

In this paper we demonstrate that even in these extreme cases such approaches perform surprisingly well, {{both in terms of}} memory requirement and rendering performance. We resample the particle data to a multiresolution multiblock grid, where the resolution of the blocks is dictated by the particle distribution. From this structure we build an octree grid, and we then compress each block in the hierarchy at no visual loss using wavelet-based compression. Since decompression can be performed on the GPU, it can be integrated effectively into GPU-based out-of-core volume ray-casting.

40|$|One {{approach}} used {{to better understand}} the impact of visual flow on control tasks has been to use synthetic perspective flow patterns. Such patterns are the result of apparent motion across a grid or random dot display. Unfortunately, the optical flow so generated is based on a subset of the flow information that exists in the real world. The danger is that the resulting optical motions may not generate the visual flow patterns useful for actual flight control. Researchers conducted a series of studies directed at understanding the characteristics of synthetic perspective flow that support various pilot tasks. In the first of these, they examined the control of altitude over various <b>perspective</b> <b>grid</b> textures (Johnson et al., 1987). Another set of studies was directed at studying the head tracking of targets moving in a 3 -D coordinate system. These studies, parametric in nature, utilized both impoverished and complex virtual worlds represented by simple perspective grids at one extreme, and computer-generated terrain at the other. These studies are part of an applied visual research program directed at understanding the design principles required for the development of instruments displaying spatial orientation information.
