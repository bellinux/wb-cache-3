40|$|Both {{agricultural}} research and national seed systems are undergoing increasing privatisation. Although {{there are a}} number of possibilities for making public {{agricultural research}} more efficient and better able to interact with the private sector, the major opportunities are in plant breeding. This paper examines the possibilities and limitations associated with revenue generation through <b>public</b> <b>plant</b> breeding; the opportunities for moving the products of <b>public</b> <b>plant</b> breeding through the private sector; and the need for increased contacts with, and contributions from, private research. Policy conclusions Increasing the emphasis on opportunities for private agricultural research must be balanced by sharpening the focus and defining the comparative advantage of public research programmes. Public breeding programmes should explore opportunities to recover some costs, but not at the expense of generating broad social benefits, their basic mandate. <b>Public</b> <b>plant</b> breeding can be made more efficient through a flexible strategy that tests varieties from a range of sources while shifting from national towards regional testing and release approaches. <b>Public</b> <b>plant</b> breeding must improve its links with the commercial seed sector, becoming more proactive in promoting its products and moving them through appropriate private channels to the ultimate user.

40|$|This study {{estimates}} a {{cost function}} for fossil fuel-based electricity generating plants operating in Pakistan during 2006 – 11. It employs a six-year panel dataset for 31 plants {{to estimate the}} cost function parameters. In {{the absence of any}} current evidence on comparative cost performance, the study’s attempt to document the economic efficiency of power plants in a large electricity sector is an important contribution to the literature. We find that on average, private nonutility plants (IPPs) are about 17 years younger than utility-owned plants and that the average capacity utilization, as measured by load factor, is higher for private IPPs than for <b>public</b> <b>plants.</b> After controlling for observables, the results show that, for {{a large part of the}} system, private plants produce electricity at a lower unit fuel cost than utility-owned <b>public</b> <b>plants.</b> The low efficiency of <b>public</b> <b>plants</b> is likely a result of the lack of operational maintenance and routine repairs. We find that the average fuel price (PRs per MMBTU) is lower for <b>public</b> <b>plants</b> and utility-owned private plants compared to nonutility-owned private plants which is mainly due to the composition of the fuel mix used for power generation. We also find that (i) the partial effect of fuel price changes on the average unit cost is higher for private <b>plants</b> than for <b>public</b> <b>plants</b> and (ii) on average, private plants use relatively expensive fuels compared to <b>public</b> <b>plants.</b> On an average fuel cost comparison, the private sector plants may be better base load <b>plants</b> than <b>public</b> sector <b>plants,</b> though the private sector plants may not be being used as base load plants because of the higher tariffs they change...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies dynamic labor {{demand by}} private and <b>public</b> {{manufacturing}} <b>plants</b> in China. It contributes along two dimensions. First, it uncovers {{the objectives of}} public enterprises and compares them to private enterprises. Second, it estimates adjustment costs of these plants and thus their (dynamic) labor demand. One of our principal findings is that <b>public</b> <b>plants</b> maximize the discounted present value of profits without a soft-budget constraint. There is strong evidence of both quadratic and linear firing costs at the plant level. Costs of adjusting hours are small and lower for private compared to <b>public</b> <b>plants.</b> The private plants operate with considerably lower quadratic adjustment costs. The higher quadratic adjustment costs of the <b>public</b> <b>plants</b> may reflect their internalization of social costs of employment adjustment.

40|$|China is {{developing}} the largest <b>public</b> <b>plant</b> biotechnology capacity outside of North America. The list of GM technologies in trials, including rice, cotton, tomato, wheat, potatoes and peanuts, is impressive.

This paper provides an economy-wide assessment of these issues and analyses the impact of adopting GM crops on production, trade and welfare of China and the rest of world under various scenarios. A main feature of this paper is that productivity impacts of GMOs are based on empirical micro-level data for the cotton and on field trial data for rice in China. Biotechnology leads to crop specific factor biased technical change, and our scenarios take this important aspect fully into account.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} using intellectual property rights (IPRs) in public sector breeding, and the potential impact on breeding strategies and on the costs and benefits. The paper {{is based on a}} study on the impact of IPRs in the breeding industry in developing countries. There are three main reasons for national agricultural research institutes (NARIs) to embrace IPRs: recognition, technology access and transfer, and revenue. Introducing the concept of revenue generation in <b>public</b> <b>plant</b> breeding is likely {{to have an impact on}} the distribution of funds within the NARI and on the breeding strategies applied. A second possible impact is that funds will be distributed more to crops with a high value in seed production. The third level of impact is within breeding programs themselves, where researchers have to choose which ecological areas or client groups to target. The paper concludes with suggestions: Policymakers and research managers need to be aware of potential difficulties of matching revenue generation through IPRs and the public tasks of the NARIs. Explicit national and institutional policies are needed to guide choices regarding the management of IPRs in breeding. Research institutes need to prepare for managing IPRs, whether they intend to protect their own inventions or not. Human and financial resources need to be made available, and the institutional culture needs to be adapted to the new developments...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{biotechnology}} {{seems to}} be in its infancy in Africa, some national researchers are well trained in this area but lack of funding from their national governments does not allow them take advantage of their knowledge and professional skills. Among the agro-biotechnology tools, tissue culture ranks first in the micro-propagated and tree crops. DNA marker-aided breeding for a range of traits (particularly to overcome diseases and pests or low input environments) should become the second most important application of agro-biotechnology in the mid-term. Molecular markers are being used worldwide to tag specific chromosome segments bearing the desired gene(s) to be transferred (or incorporated) into breeding lines (or populations). In this way, indirect selection with co-dominant molecular markers tightly linked to the gene(s) controlling the characteristic(s) of interest improves response to selection, because heritability for co-dominant markers equals to 1. Molecular markers are therefore descriptors that offer reproducible results for characterizing genotypes. Similarly, applied plant genomics also improves the understanding of crop gene pools, which are being enlarged by including transgenes and “native ” gene pools. Furthermore, finding new genes adds value to traditional agricultural products. There are many on-going applications of DNA markers in research-for-development and crop improvement for crops grown by African farmers. Marker-assisted selection and –aided introgression are being employed by private and <b>public</b> <b>plant</b> breeders mostly to locate and select genes for controlling important quality and disease or pest resistant traits...|$|E

40|$|The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) {{proteins}} {{form one}} of the largest protein families in land plants. They are characterised by tandem 30 - 40 amino acid motifs that form an extended binding surface capable of sequence-specific recognition of RNA strands. Almost all of them are post-translationally targeted to plastids and mitochondria, where they play important roles in post-transcriptional processes including splicing, RNA editing and the initiation of translation. A code describing how PPR proteins recognise their RNA targets promises to accelerate research on these proteins, but making use of this code requires accurate definition and annotation of all of the various nucleotide-binding motifs in each protein. We have used a structural modelling approach to define 10 different variants of the PPR motif found in plant proteins, in addition to the putative deaminase motif that is found at the C-terminus of many RNA-editing factors. We show that the super-helical RNA-binding surface of RNA-editing factors is potentially longer than previously recognised. We used the redefined motifs to develop accurate and consistent annotations of PPR sequences from 109 genomes. We report a high error rate in PPR gene models in many <b>public</b> <b>plant</b> proteomes, due to gene fusions and insertions of spurious introns. These consistently annotated datasets across a wide range of species are valuable resources for future comparative genomics studies, and an essential pre-requisite for accurate large-scale computational predictions of PPR targets.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} the Indian seed system in the context of high volume, low value seed, using the case studies of potato and groundnut. In theory, public sector should be able to address seed needs of farmers growing these crops. However, the ability of the public sector is constrained by a number of institutional and technical factors, and farmers largely depend upon traditional sources of seed. The traditional sources meet {{more than two-thirds of the}} total seed demand, and the rest is met by the formal seed system, mainly public seed agencies. Most of the farmers buy fresh seed for quality reasons, and only 12 - 15 percent farmers purchase seed to change variety. In potato, technological innovation provided options to enhance multiplication rate and improve quality of seed, and therefore attracted the private sector in the production and delivery of seed to farmers. Availability of source seed from <b>public</b> <b>plant</b> breeding programs further encouraged the private sector's participation. However, it is very unlikely that the crops under study will attract private investment in plant breeding because of inadequate incentives even under the new IPR regime. Therefore, public research system should continue to shoulder the responsibility of plant breeding, and develop partnership with the private sector to strengthen decentralized seed activities. Coordination among public seed corporations of different states may help augment seed supply in the deficit regions, and offer greater choice to farmers. Efforts to develop supply chain, especially for premium market, will eventually attract private sector in the product, as well as seed market.

40|$|About 40 % of the {{proteins}} encoded in eukaryotic genomes are proteins of unknown function (PUFs). Their functional characterization {{remains one of}} the main challenges in modern biology. In this study we identified the PUF encoding genes from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using a combination of sequence similarity, domain-based, and empirical approaches. Large-scale gene expression analyses of 1, 310 publicly available Affymetrix chips were performed to associate the identified PUF genes with regulatory networks and biological processes of known function. To generate quality results, the study was restricted to expression sets with replicated samples. First, genome-wide clustering and gene function enrichment analysis of clusters allowed us to associate 1, 541 PUF genes with tightly coexpressed genes for proteins of known function (PKFs). Over 70 % of them could be assigned to more specific biological process annotations than the ones available in the current Gene Ontology release. The most highly overrepresented functional categories in the obtained clusters were ribosome assembly, photosynthesis, and cell wall pathways. Interestingly, the majority of the PUF genes appeared to be controlled by the same regulatory networks as most PKF genes, because clusters enriched in PUF genes were extremely rare. Second, large-scale analysis of differentially expressed genes was applied to identify a comprehensive set of abiotic stress-response genes. This analysis resulted in the identification of 269 PKF and 104 PUF genes that responded {{to a wide variety of}} abiotic stresses, whereas 608 PKF and 206 PUF genes responded predominantly to specific stress treatments. The provided coexpression and differentially expressed gene data represent an important resource for guiding future functional characterization experiments of PUF and PKF genes.
