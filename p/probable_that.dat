5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians have tried to reconstruct the most likely sequence of {{events leading up to}} the battle. It is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Olaf Tryggvason was indeed sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably play up the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, it seems more <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he was expecting war and seeking allies in Wendland, but met with little success. The character of Sigvaldi remains enigmatic, though there is evidence from skaldic poetry that he did indeed betray Olaf.|$|E
5|$|As a diplodocid, it is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Dinheirosaurus {{possessed a}} whip-tail. If it did, {{it is likely}} that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with {{supersonic}} speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{from the}} Crusader period {{indicate}} that Ashdod {{belonged to the}} lordship of Ramla, and it appears <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> in 1169 the old Arab sea fort was given by Hugh, lord of Ramla, to his knight Nicolas de Beroard. From this period the fort is known as Castellum Beroart.|$|E

(Penal Code § 836).|$|R
25|$|Whisner was {{credited}} with five FW-190s and two <b>probables</b> <b>that</b> day. His score later was revised by the Air Force Historical Research Agency to six destroyed, making that day {{one of the best}} for any USAAF pilot in the skies over Europe. For that achievement, Whisner was awarded his first Distinguished Service Cross—second only to the Medal of Honor.|$|R
5000|$|On April 5, 2017, the Ethics Commission found <b>probable</b> cause <b>that</b> Bentley had {{committed}} four Class B felonies; the Commission determining in four separate votes that [...] "there was <b>probable</b> cause <b>that</b> Bentley violated {{one count of}} state ethics law and three counts of the Fair Campaign Practices Act (state campaign finance law). Two of the votes were decided 4-0, while two others were 3-1.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} morning {{surprise}} attack, on June15, 1914, Thomson {{was shot in the}} chest (despite the fact that rebels were attacking behind him) and died within a few minutes. It is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> an Italian sniper was responsible.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the {{sarcophagus}} {{was installed}} on or shortly before May 2, 1426, when the Calimala contracted for two chaplains {{to say a}} daily mass for Cossa's soul. The records of the Duomo workshop indicate that on January 28, 1427 Valori bought four white marble blocks for the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Seated at {{an ornate}} wooden table, wearing a pearl tiara and flowing silk, is Sigismunda (called Ghismonda in Boccaccio's {{original}} tale), the heroine {{of one of}} the novelle. It is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Hogarth modelled her on his wife, Jane. She clasps a golden goblet containing the heart of her murdered husband, Guiscardo.|$|E

Probable passwords of any given length can be generated. ...|$|R
5|$|Ancient sources present {{disparate}} casualty {{figures for}} the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, {{in contrast with the}} 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus. In any case, it is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle; Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge {{was simply}} {{assigned}} a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{improvements}} in engineering and economics are enabling {{more of the}} renewable resources to be utilised. Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, it is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> {{there has been a}} significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.|$|E

50|$|Denecke finally {{noted that}} it had been {{consistently}} held that the jury may make a finding of malice based upon a lack of <b>probable</b> cause. Given <b>that</b> <b>probable</b> cause was not established, sufficient evidence of malice was found upon the part of the defendant to enable the jury to find for the plaintiff.|$|R
5|$|During Morgan's {{absence from}} Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid. The pact aimed to {{establish}} {{peace in the}} Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement to revoke all letters of marque and similar commissions. The historian Violet Barbour considers it <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> one of the Spanish conditions was the removal of Modyford from the Governorship. Modyford was arrested and sent to England by Sir Thomas Lynch, his recent replacement.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> in {{the early}} 1660s Morgan was active {{with a group of}} privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and {{settlements}} in the Caribbean and Central America. In 1663 it is likely that Morgan captained one of the ships in Myngs' fleet, and took part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba and the Sack of Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Lichton's death {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. It fell between 11 November (Martinmas) 1440, and 11 January 1441; it is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> {{he died on}} either 12 or 14 December, because these were the anniversaries given {{to him in the}} 15th century and the 16th century respectively. He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John the Evangelist. As a churchman, Lichton could never marry and did not; he did however father a bastard, a daughter named Janet, who appeared in the records receiving papal dispensation to marry in 1432.|$|E
50|$|Thurgood & LaPolla (2003) {{included}} Kham in LaPolla's speculative 'Rung' proposal, {{but found}} {{the inclusion of}} Magar and Chepang less <b>probable,</b> suggesting <b>that</b> the evidence for even a Magar-Kham connection is far from clear-cut.|$|R
50|$|The {{inhabitant}} of {{the pyramid}} can not yet be identified, since no direct evidence, like inscriptions, remain. It is <b>probable,</b> however, <b>that</b> Nyuserre had the pyramid built {{for one of his}} wives, perhaps Reptynub.|$|R

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the work's {{provenance}} before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early diptychs—it seems <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across {{all areas of the}} panels.|$|E
5|$|Philip's {{campaign}} in Greece became linked with a new, fourth, Sacred War. The citizens of Amphissa in Ozolian Locris had begun cultivating land sacred to Apollo on the Crisaean plain south of Delphi; after some internal bickering the Amphictyonic council decided {{to declare a}} sacred war against Amphissa. A Thessalian delegate proposed that Philip should be made leader of the Amphictyonic forces, which therefore gave Philip a pretext to {{campaign in}} Greece; it is, however, <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Philip would have gone ahead with his campaign anyway.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene parrot {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1674, and live specimens were later brought to Europe, {{where they lived}} in captivity. The species was scientifically described in 1771. Only two stuffed specimens exist today, in Paris and Vienna. The date and cause of extinction for the Mascarene parrot is unclear. The latest account from 1834 is considered dubious, so it is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the species became extinct prior to 1800, and may have become extinct in the wild even earlier.|$|E
50|$|Besides, Lawrence {{collaborated with}} others to further develop the Bayesian {{statistical}} approaches to RNA secondary structure prediction, which greatly facilitate the predictions on the full ensemble of <b>probable</b> structures <b>that</b> an RNA molecule may adopt.|$|R
50|$|Among these versions, the {{one which}} seam <b>probable</b> is <b>that</b> which states that Isin was coined from the word “Ile-Isinmi” (land of rest) because Aina did {{experience}} unrest before he finally got to Igbole at Odo-Owa.|$|R
60|$|Ronald {{knew enough}} of the natives to feel <b>that</b> it was <b>probable</b> enough <b>that</b> the fowls were stolen; but his sense of {{morality}} was not sufficiently keen for him to hurt the woman's feelings by rejecting her offerings.|$|R
5|$|The Theban Hills are {{dominated}} by the peak of al-Qurn, known to the Ancient Egyptians as ta dehent, or 'The Peak'. It has a pyramid-shaped appearance, and it is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> this echoed the pyramids of the Old Kingdom, {{more than a thousand}} years prior to the first royal burials carved here. Its isolated position also resulted in reduced access, and special tomb police (the Medjay) were able to guard the necropolis.|$|E
5|$|The earthen mound {{that once}} covered the tomb is now visible {{only as an}} {{undulation}} approximately 46 centimetres (1 foot, 6 inches) in height. In the 19th century, the mound was higher on {{the western end of}} the tomb, although during the 1920s this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath. It is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb-stones now sit.|$|E
5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. It is <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> there was an ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, {{it may have been}} quarried.|$|E
25|$|The date of {{his death}} is unknown, the Muzaka chronicles says there were no {{descendants}} and that his lands {{were assigned to the}} Muzaka family after his death, however, the most <b>probable</b> is <b>that</b> they were given to Marko.|$|R

30|$|The lack of {{oestrogen}} and progesterone receptors {{makes it}} difficult to explain why these lesions can respond to ovarian/placental hormones but clearly in this and other cases this does occur. It is <b>probable</b> therefore <b>that</b> these hormones act via another mechanism.|$|R
