5|$|Their scheme {{has been}} to inject their Stalinist conciliationism <b>piecemeal</b> and {{likewise}} in <b>piecemeal</b> fashion, {{get rid of those}} who come to see what is happening and raise objections.|$|E
5|$|All tracks {{except the}} few yards {{embedded}} in the quayside at Watchet were removed by 1920, but other features were removed or altered <b>piecemeal</b> over time. By 1940, for example, no trace remained of Washford station, but both sets of level crossing gates remained in place.|$|E
5|$|Burnside fought at {{the battles}} of Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House, {{where he did}} not perform in a {{distinguished}} manner, attacking <b>piecemeal</b> and appearing reluctant to commit his troops to the frontal assaults that characterized these battles. After North Anna and Cold Harbor, he took {{his place in the}} siege lines at Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Critics of the {{argument}} include Averroes, who objected to its methodology, Al-Ghazali, who disagreed with its characterization of God, and modern critics who state that its <b>piecemeal</b> derivation of God's attributes allows people to accept parts of {{the argument}} but still reject God's existence. There is no consensus among modern scholars on the classification {{of the argument}}; some {{say that it is}} ontological while others say it is cosmological.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1948, {{the goods}} hoist to the Waterloo and City line began to sink while a M7 class tank engine was pushing loaded coal wagons onto it. The engine {{dropped into the}} hoist's shaft, ending up {{upside-down}} and spurting steam over it. The driver and fireman managed to jump free, and the locomotive was rescued <b>piecemeal</b> and used for spares.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that a major}} Japanese {{attack was}} underway, Puller {{requested}} reinforcement. At 03:45, the 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall and being held in reserve, was fed <b>piecemeal</b> into Puller's line. In spite of the darkness and intermittent heavy rain, the Army National Guard troops were placed in Puller's defences before daybreak.|$|E
5|$|The Commission met from April 1968 – January 1, 1969, {{and former}} Governor Albertis S. Harrison, Jr. was {{appointed}} its chair. After seven decades since the previous unlimited convention, a constitutional commission {{was called by}} Governor Mills E. Godwin, Jr. to consolidate <b>piecemeal</b> amendments and to conform with U.S. statutory and constitutional law, especially {{in the areas of}} education, voter rights and representation in Congressional and General Assembly districts.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Welsh Highland Railway, {{the track}} bed was sold off <b>piecemeal</b> - often {{reverting}} {{to the original}} owners, paying much less than they had sold it for originally. Although there has been minor development on parts of the route, and Wistlandpound Reservoir has flooded the track bed close to its mid-point, much is still in open countryside, with many sections identifiable.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Station was {{designed}} in a <b>piecemeal</b> fashion to help {{address this problem}} for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB) and the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LC). It consisted of two adjacent main line railway stations which, {{from the viewpoint of}} passengers, were unconnected.|$|E
5|$|After the Qing {{government}} {{defeated the}} Ming loyalist forces {{maintained by the}} Zheng family in 1683, parts of Taiwan became increasingly integrated into the Qing Empire. Qing forces ruled areas of Taiwan's highly populated western plain for over two centuries, until 1895. This era was characterized by a marked {{increase in the number}} of Han Chinese on Taiwan, continued social unrest, the <b>piecemeal</b> transfer (by various means) of large amounts of land from the aborigines to the Han, and the nearly complete acculturation of the Western Plains Aborigines to Taiwanese Han customs.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{southern}} foes {{were still}} very alive, Cao Cao focused {{to the north}} to crush Ma Chao and his rebels at Tong Gate in 211 AD ("Tales"). He also chooses to defend against Lu Bu, who is terrorizing Xiapi, and in a fireattack, he ends Lu Bu's Offensive ("Tales"). Cao Cao's generals then destroy {{the army of the}} alive Dong Zhuo <b>piecemeal</b> at Ji Province ("Tales"), and he eradicates all of his foes. Cao Cao then chooses to go after Shu or Wu, depending on the result of the Chibi fire attack.|$|E
5|$|As {{construction}} {{of schools and}} hiring of teachers continued in Ravalomanana's second term, additional measures were adopted to improve education quality, including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades one to five, expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling and {{an overhaul of the}} national curriculum, which had been modified <b>piecemeal</b> since independence from France in 1960. In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{increasing}} Muslim resentment {{against the use}} of the mosque as a military garrison, the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re-establish it as a place of religious worship. From then onwards, <b>piecemeal</b> repairs were carried out {{under the supervision of the}} Badshahi Mosque Authority. The building was officially handed back to the Muslim community by John Lawrence, who was the Viceroy of India. The building was then re-established as a mosque.|$|E
5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing <b>piecemeal</b> restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E
5|$|Holocene {{lava flows}} are more alkalic than the Pleistocene lava flows and {{comprise}} several xenoliths of chromium-spinel lherzolite, spinel clinopyroxenite, and rare ferroan websterite and spinel wehrlite. Xenoliths {{do not exist}} in the older lava flows. However, chemical evidence indicates that every lava flow was produced in a similar way by low degrees of <b>piecemeal</b> melting. The melts originally came from the upper mantle which, over time, was progressively depleted by every following melting event.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show {{to host a}} {{spin-off}} series entitled The Colbert Report, {{a parody}} of personality-driven political pundit programs such as Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor that center largely on the personal views of their hosts. Because of this enlarged role, the personality and beliefs of the Stephen Colbert character have become more clearly defined {{over the course of}} the show, complete with a fictitious backstory that has been revealed <b>piecemeal</b> in short monologues accompanying a part of the program.|$|E
5|$|Japanese carrier {{doctrine}} {{preferred the}} launching of fully constituted strikes rather than <b>piecemeal</b> attacks. Without confirmation of whether the American force included carriers (not received until 08:20), Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire. In addition, the arrival of another land-based American air strike at 07:53 gave weight {{to the need to}} attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{of country}} estates became common around the 1920s. The annual tax payable had spiralled and was twenty {{times greater than}} in 1870 {{resulting}} in the break-up of many larger land-holdings. Pitfour was no exception and the dispersal of the estate continued <b>piecemeal</b> after the sequestration of George Arthur, the sixth laird. The main estate policies including the lake and other land were purchased by Bernard Drake in November 1926 when he bought Saplinbrae, the former minister's house. Drake was {{a partner in the}} electrical engineering company, Drake and Gorham.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} <b>piecemeal</b> amendments {{have been}} added in response to federal developments. Amendments ratified by the voters reduced the voting age to eighteen to conform with the Twenty-sixth Amendment, removed residency requirements for voting, and conformed voter registration to the Motor Voter Act. A legislative session now may be called after a Governor's veto. Virginia joined thirty-two other states in 1996 by amending its Constitution to provide for rights of victims of crime. Since 1996 Virginia and other states have adopted a provision protecting {{the right of the}} people to hunt, fish and harvest game.|$|E
5|$|The Poor Law system {{fell into}} decline at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century owing to factors such as the introduction of the Liberal welfare reforms and the availability of other sources of assistance from friendly societies and trade unions, as well as <b>piecemeal</b> reforms which bypassed the Poor Law system. The Poor Law system was not formally abolished until the National Assistance Act 1948, with parts of the law remaining on the books until 1967.|$|E
5|$|The war-time {{deployment}} of the Territorial Army envisioned it being deployed <b>piecemeal,</b> to reinforce the regular army {{that had already been}} deployed to the European mainland, as equipment became available. The plan envisioned the {{deployment of}} the whole force in waves, as divisions completed their training, with the final divisions not being deployed until a year had elapsed from the outbreak of war. As a result, the division did not leave the United Kingdom as the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from France during May and June 1940.|$|E
5|$|Trading in BIH shares was {{suspended}} in June 2011 after Yeung's arrest {{on charges of}} money-laundering. Publication of financial results was repeatedly delayed, which led the Football League to impose a transfer embargo, and offers for the club were entertained from 2012 onwards. After Yeung resigned his positions with both club and company in early 2014, share trading resumed, and following his conviction, efforts intensified {{to dispose of the}} club, which had to be done <b>piecemeal</b> in order to retain BIH's share listing.|$|E
5|$|At 09:24 on {{the morning}} of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the {{original}} tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated <b>piecemeal.</b> Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week. While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the {{fighting}} ceased for almost two weeks and during this time the 39th was joined by the 53rd and the 30th Brigade headquarters; and Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner arrived from Ilolo to take command. Reaching the battalion at Isurava on 16 August, he subsequently began organising the battalion's defence of Isurava. On 23 August Brigadier Arnold Potts took over command of Maroubra Force and further reinforcements arrived as first the 2/14th, 2/16th and later the 2/27th Battalions from the 7th Division's 21st Brigade also reached the area. Despite this, the situation remained bleak as the supply issue was becoming a serious problem for the Australians and the reinforcements that had arrived were also {{in a state of}} disarray having been committed to the battle in a <b>piecemeal</b> fashion and suffering badly from hunger and disease.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a monopoly {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced <b>piecemeal</b> by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{emphasis}} placed on cooperation with Britain, relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region after 1940. Measures were taken to improve Australia's defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941, but these proved inadequate. The 8th Division was subsequently dispatched to Singapore in February 1941, while plans were made for a Militia battalion to be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island. An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul, and another brigade would be dispersed <b>piecemeal</b> to Timor and Ambon. Meanwhile, in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain {{in order to protect}} the airfield, while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka Passage in Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, <b>piecemeal</b> necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Inglis {{returned}} to 4th Brigade, now in Italy, in March 1944. For {{much of the}} Italian Campaign the brigade {{did not participate in}} large-scale operations; instead, his armoured regiments were deployed <b>piecemeal</b> in support of infantry operations. In the absence of Inglis while he recovered from his illness the previous three months, Kippenberger had become the preferred acting divisional commander. Kippenberger, commanding the division while Freyberg commanded the New Zealand Corps, was wounded shortly after Inglis arrived in Italy. Command of the division passed to another brigade commander, despite Inglis' seniority. Again overlooked as temporary divisional commander in September, Inglis requested to be relieved of his command and he was promptly sent home to New Zealand. For his wartime services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines of criticism. He {{pointed out that}} Avicenna adopts a <b>piecemeal</b> approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E
5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's <b>piecemeal</b> statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E
5|$|The British defeat was {{the worst}} the Royal Navy {{suffered}} during the entire war, and it left the Indian Ocean and its vital trade convoys exposed to attack from Hamelin's frigates. In response, the British authorities sought to reinforce the squadron on Île Bourbon under Josias Rowley by ordering all available ships to the region, but this <b>piecemeal</b> reinforcement resulted {{in a series of}} desperate actions as individual British ships were attacked by the more powerful and confident French squadron. In December 1810 an adequate reinforcement was collected, with the provision of a strong battle squadron under Admiral Albemarle Bertie, that rapidly invaded and subdued Isle de France.|$|E
5|$|The defeats {{suffered}} in February and March accelerated {{the disintegration of}} the GUNT. When in March, at a new round of OAU-sponsored talks held in the People's Republic of Congo, Goukouni failed to appear, many suspected the hand of Libya. These suspicions caused the defection from the GUNT of its vice president, Kamougué, followed by the First Army and the <b>piecemeal</b> FROLINAT Originel. In August, it was the CDR's turn to leave the coalition, seizing the town of Fada. When in October Goukouni's FAP attempted to retake Fada, the Libyan garrison attacked Goukouni's troops, giving way to a pitched battle that effectively ended the GUNT. In the same month, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, while his troops rebelled against Gaddafi, dislodging the Libyans from all their positions in the Tibesti, and on 24 October went over to Habré.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lairds {{transformed}} the estate into a valuable asset. Lord Pitfour, the second laird, purchased additional lands including Deer Abbey and Inverugie Castle. Pitfour's son, James Ferguson, {{who became the}} third laird, continued to improve and expand the estate by adding the lake and bridges, and establishing planned villages. The third laird died a bachelor with no children, so the estate passed to the elderly George Ferguson, who was only in possession of the property for a few months. George was already a wealthy man, owning lands in Trinidad and Tobago, but despite not directly improving the Pitfour estate he added considerable value to the inheritance passed to his illegitimate son. The extravagant lifestyles of the fifth and sixth lairds led to the sequestration of the estate, which was sold off <b>piecemeal</b> to pay their debts.|$|E
5|$|The story reveals that, long ago, the Bridge {{had been}} closed to vehicle traffic (for three years) and that the {{pressure}} to find somewhere to live had forced homeless people to seize the bridge {{and set up a}} squatters' town there. The community that arose was vibrant and was watched by the world's media. The town grew in a <b>piecemeal</b> fashion, built from salvaged parts as well as from material apparently donated by more wealthy nations. At {{the end of the story}} Skinner has a dream in which he remembers being at the front of the crowd who seized the bridge (Skinner is the first onto the bridge) and scaled the towers.|$|E
5|$|The war-time {{deployment}} of the Territorial Army envisioned it being deployed <b>piecemeal,</b> to reinforce the regular army already deployed to the European mainland, as equipment became available. The plan envisioned the {{deployment of}} the whole force in waves, as divisions completed their training, with the final divisions being deployed {{a year after the}} outbreak of war. As a result, the division did not leave the United Kingdom as the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from France during May and June 1940. On 28 October, Major-General Noel Irwin, who had commanded the 2nd Infantry Division during the latter stages of the fighting in France, was given command of the 38th.|$|E
5|$|There, Troglita {{positioned}} himself between the Matmata plateau and the coast, and awaited the Moors. He also sent for ships to bring supplies, but adverse winds made this impossible. When the Moorish army appeared nearby it was likewise exhausted from hunger {{and made for}} some sources of water, which Troglita set out to reach first. The Byzantines camped at Marta {{in the district of}} Gallica, where battle was joined. It was a disastrous defeat for the Byzantines, whose army broke and fled. Corippus, possibly in an attempt to exculpate his hero Troglita, attributes the defeat to the indiscipline of some soldiers, who attacked the enemy before the army was ready, leading to a disorganized <b>piecemeal</b> engagement. According to Corippus's account, the Moorish allies of the Byzantines panicked first and retreated, causing the entire army to disintegrate, despite the personal intervention of Troglita and the other Byzantine leaders.|$|E
