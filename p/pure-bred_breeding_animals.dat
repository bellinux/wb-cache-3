50|$|The country's {{breeding}} stock was primarily Spanish criollo, although {{over the years}} considerable crossbreeding with English breeds and zebu cattle from Brazil had taken place. Although cattle were numerous in Paraguay, the country lacked {{a sufficient number of}} <b>pure-bred</b> <b>breeding</b> cattle. The livestock sector also suffered from a low calving percentage, a high mortality rate, and a long fattening period for steers. Artificial insemination was increasingly common. To a certain extent, cattle raising reflected the disparities in agriculture in general. There were numerous farmers who owned only a few head of relatively unproductive cattle that were slaughtered for the local market under relatively poor sanitary conditions. By contrast, extremely large cattle ranches typically were owned by expatriates and butchered more productive animals for both national and international markets.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Accounting for and {{quantifying}} the associative {{effect of}} each animal could improve both {{welfare of animals}} and response to selection. Because of the limitation of REML, Gibbs Sampling could be an alternative technique to estimate the variance component of the associative effect. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the estimation accuracy of the variance component of associative effect by using simulation via Gibbs Sampling. The simulated data comprised five generations of pigs. The <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> of each generation were selected randomly. In the simulation, variations were introduced for the methods of assigning pens (random, mixed sib and full sib), the number of pigs per pen (5 or 10), the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> per generation (162 or 324) and the correlation between genetic direct effect and genetic associative effect (- 0. 5, 0. 1 or + 0. 5). Each set of simulation was run for 30 replications. Results Random assignment or mixed sib assignment resulted in bias of estimated variance components in only 3 of 24 combinations. Furthermore, these 3 cases occurred with 162 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> With full sib assignment, 9 out of 12 groups of estimates significantly deviated from the true parameter value. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with the full sib assignment were higher than with the other two methods of pen assignment in most of the cases. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with datasets with 324 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> were notably smaller than the datasets from 162 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> Within each method of pen assignment, the relative bias of the associative effect was significantly smaller with group size 10 than with group size 5. Conclusion Full sib assignment caused difficulties to estimate variance components in most of the cases, due to a lack of identifiability. With random and mixed assignment, most data structures yielded unbiased results but increasing the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> or group size improves the estimation. Thus to get identifiable and unbiased estimates of the genetic associative effect, it is recommended to avoid close genetic relationship between animals within one pen and to use sufficient numbers of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> and sufficient group sizes. </p...|$|R
