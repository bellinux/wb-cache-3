Mike Ross's Jet Kiss consists {{of a pair of}} disassembled, pink and yellow fighter jets that hang suspended above the platform. The piece, initially met with public backlash over its use of war planes, references both the city's aviation industry and the city bird, the Blue heron. Capitol Hill cartoonist Ellen Forney has two murals in the station's north and west entrances, Crossed Pinkies and Walking Fingers, which consist of simple, large hands outlined against a bright red background. The murals, which consist of <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> on steel panels, are meant to evoke a sense of [...] "coming together [...] pulling apart" [...] and playfully leading passengers from street level into the station, respectively. Forney designed Crossed Pinkies to echo Ross's Jet Kiss, sharing a common theme of [...] "coming together". The station also has a pictogram that identifies it on maps and signage, featuring the rainbow flag to honor the neighborhood's longtime gay and lesbian community.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} characteristic of <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel,</b> from an industrial perspective, is its resistance to corrosion. Mild steel {{is used in}} almost every industry and a huge array of products; <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> is a very economic way of protecting this, and other chemically vulnerable materials, from corrosion. It can also produce very smooth, glossy finishes in {{a wide array of}} colours; these colours will not fade on exposure to UV light, as paint will. Being a fired ceramic, <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> is also highly heat-resistant; this allows it to be used in high-temperature applications where an organic anti-corrosion coating or galvanization may be impractical or even dangerous (see Metal fume fever).|$|E

50|$|The {{ability to}} apply <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> to sheet steels was not {{developed}} until 1900, {{with the discovery}} that making {{minor changes to the}} composition of the enamel, such as including cobalt oxides as minor components, could drastically improve its adhesion ability to carbon steels. Concurrent with this development was the first use of wet-slurry enamel application; this allowed <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> to be applied to much more complex shapes by dipping the shape into the liquid enamel slurry.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} of <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamelled</b> products on an industrial scale first began in Germany in 1840. The method used was very primitive compared to modern methods: {{the product was}} heated to a very high temperature and dusted with enamel, then immediately fired. This frequently resulted in poor adhesion or a spotty coat; two coats were always required to achieve a continuous, corrosion-resistant surface. It could only be applied to cast- and wrought-iron, and only used for relatively simple products like pots and pans.|$|R
