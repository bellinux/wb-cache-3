50|$|Many {{people have}} {{indicated}} {{that they have a}} side effect related to an allergic reaction to penicillin. It has been proposed that as many as 90% of those claiming to have an allergy to penicillin are able to take it. Identifying an allergy to penicillin requires a hypersensitivity skin test which diagnoses IgE-mediated immune responses caused by penicillin. This test is typically performed by an allergist who uses a skin-prick and intradermal injection of <b>penicilloyl-polylysine,</b> a negative control (normal saline), and a positive control (histamine).|$|E
50|$|Alain de Weck {{grew up in}} Crans-Montana, {{attended}} the Collège Calvin in Geneva and later completed his Baccalauréat in classical studies at the Collège Saint-Michel in Fribourg in 1947. He obtained his M.D. degree from the University of Geneva in November 1953 after medical studies in Fribourg, Lausanne and Geneva. He did his residency in Paris at various hospitals including the Hôpital Bichat, and the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. During {{this time he was}} an early resident at the Pavillon Suisse designed by the architect Le Corbusier at the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris. Starting in 1954, he came under the tutelage of Professor Werner Jadassohn, then the head of the Department of Dermatology in Geneva, the son of dermatologist, Joseph Jadassohn. There he started investigating the occurrence and root causes of inflammation as well as contact dermatitis due to lymphocytes using the guinea pig nipple {{as a model for the}} human skin. This led to the first histopathological demonstration that contact dermatitis is due to sensitized lymphocytes. He then stayed - as the first U.S. Public Health Service funded foreign research fellow from Switzerland - at Barnes Hospital at Washington University in St. Louis from 1958 to 1960 under the guidance of Prof. Herman Eisen. During this time, Alain de Weck made initial contributions to what later became one of his signature research areas: penicillin allergy. In particular he developed <b>penicilloyl-polylysine</b> (PPL) as a test reagent for detecting penicillin allergy.|$|E
40|$|A 24 year-old man {{developed}} an anaphylactic reaction within thirty minutes of an oral administration of penicillin V. He suffered from recurrent streptococal pharyngitis that was usually treated with penicillin V with good tolerance. Skin prick and intradermal tests with <b>penicilloyl-polylysine,</b> minor determinant mixture, amoxicillin, ampicillin and cefuroxima were negative. However, a {{skin prick test}} with penicillin V was positive in the patient and negative in 10 controls. Determination of specifi c (Immunogloblulin (Ig) E to penicillin V was 0. 64 kU/L. Specifi c IgE to penicillin G, amoxicillin and ampicillin were all negative. Single blind controlled oral challenge with amoxicillin and cefuroxime were both negative. This is an exceptional case of an anaphylactic reaction induced by phenoxymethylpenicillin with positive allergologic study in vivo and in vitro tests and with negative allergological study to other β-lactams...|$|E
40|$|Rabbits and guinea-pigs {{have been}} immunized with low {{molecular}} weight <b>penicilloyl—polylysines</b> (BPO 1 —PLL 1 2, BPO 6 —PLL 1 2) {{with varying degrees of}} substitution and with monovalent penicilloyl—bacitracin (BPO 1 —BAC). The immune response to the penicilloyl (BPO) determinant has been followed by skin tests, passive haemagglutination, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis...|$|R
40|$|Multifunctional {{derivatives}} of penicillenic acid {{are effective}} elicitors of wheal-and-erythema skin responses in humans allergic to penicillin. Of the effective derivatives, <b>penicilloyl-polylysines</b> are particularly attractive as skin test reagents because {{they appear to}} be incapable of inducing antibody formation. The skin responses are specifically inhibitable in most instances by homologous unifunctional haptens. The penicillenic acid derivatives which appear to be determinants of human allergic reactions to penicillin are: penicilloyl, penicillenate, and groups of the penamaldate-penilloaldehyde type. Of these, the most significant appears to be the penicilloyl-lysyl determinant...|$|R
