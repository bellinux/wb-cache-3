They {{approached}} American Research and Development Corporation, an early venture capital firm, which had been founded by Georges Doriot, and founded Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). In the 1960s, Olsen received patents for a saturable switch, a diode transformer gate circuit, an improved version of magnetic core memory, and the line <b>printer</b> <b>buffer.</b> (Note that MIT professor Jay W. Forrester is generally credited with inventing the first practical magnetic core memory).|$|E

50|$|In 1969, Busicom asked Intel, {{a company}} founded one year earlier in 1968 {{for the purpose}} of making solid state random-access memory (RAM), to {{finalize}} and manufacture their calculator engine. Intel, which was more of a memory company back then, had facilities to manufacture the high density silicon gate MOS chip Busicom required. Shima went to Intel in June 1969 to present his design proposal. Due to Intel lacking logic engineers to understand the logic schematics or circuit engineers to convert them, Intel asked Shima to simplify the logic. Intel wanted a single-chip CPU design, influenced by Sharp's Tadashi Sasaki who presented the concept to Busicom and Intel in 1968. The single-chip microprocessor design was then formulated by Intel's Marcian Hoff in 1969, simplifying Shima's initial design down to four chips, including a single-chip microprocessor CPU. Due to Hoff's formulation lacking key details, Shima came up with his own ideas to find solutions for its implementation. Shima was responsible for adding a 10-bit static shift register to make it useful as a <b>printer's</b> <b>buffer</b> and keyboard interface, many improvements in the instruction set, making the RAM organization suitable for a calculator, the memory address information transfer, the key program in an area of performance and program capacity, the functional specification, decimal computer idea, software, desktop calculator logic, real-time I/O control, and data exchange instruction between the accumulator and general purpose register. Hoff and Shima eventually realized the 4-bit microprocessor concept together, with the help of Intel's Stanley Mazor to interpret the ideas of Shima and Hoff. Busicom's management agreed to the new proposal. The architecture and specifications of the four chips were designed over a period of a few months in 1969, between an Intel team led by Hoff and a Busicom team led by Shima.|$|R
50|$|In later models, a 1443 {{line printer}} could be attached, which could print {{faster than the}} data could be put out on punch cards. The line printer could print 120 or 144 columns. The {{character}} width was fixed, so it was the paper size that changed; the printer printed 10 characters to the inch, so a printer could print a maximum of 12 inches or 14.4 inches of text. In addition, the <b>printer</b> had a <b>buffer,</b> so the I/O delay for the processor was reduced. However, the print instruction would block if the line had not completed.|$|R
5000|$|... 3270 {{displays}} and <b>printers</b> had a <b>buffer</b> containing one byte for every screen position. For example, a 3277 model 2 featured a screen size of 24 rows of 80 columns for a buffer size of 1920 bytes. Bytes were addressed {{from zero to}} the screen size minus one, in this example 1919. [...] "There is a fixed relationship between each ... buffer storage location and its position on the display screen." [...] Most orders started operation at the [...] "current" [...] buffer address, and executing an order or writing data would update this address. The buffer address could be set directly using the Set Buffer Address (SBA) order, often followed by Start Field. For a device with a 1920 character display a twelve bit address was sufficient. Later 3270s with larger screen sizes used fourteen or sixteen bits.|$|R
50|$|In theory, the Centronics port could {{transfer}} data {{as rapidly}} as 75,000 characters per second. This was far faster than the printer, which averaged about 160 characters per second, meaning the port spent much of its time idle. The performance was defined by how rapidly the host could respond to the printer's BUSY signal asking for more data. To improve performance, <b>printers</b> began incorporating <b>buffers</b> so the host could send them data more rapidly, in bursts. This not only reduced (or eliminated) delays due to latency {{waiting for the next}} character to arrive from the host, but also freed the host to perform other operations without causing a loss of performance. Performance was further improved by using the buffer to store several lines and then printing in both directions, eliminating the delay while the print head returned to {{the left side of the}} page. Such changes well over doubled the performance of an otherwise unchanged printer, as was the case on Centronics models like the 102 and 308.|$|R
