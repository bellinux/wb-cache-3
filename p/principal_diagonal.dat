40|$|Unreinforced masonry in fills {{has long}} been known to affect the {{strength}} and stiffness of frame. Under the action of a lateral load the <b>principal</b> compressive <b>diagonal</b> acts as a strut or bracing and increases the initial lateral stiffness of the framed structure. However, in the presence of openings in walls, which is more practical, the behavior of infill changes. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} study the variation of lateral stiffness, <b>principal</b> compressive <b>diagonal</b> strut width with modulus of masonry infill, with and without openings. In the study a non-linear (multi-linear) analysis is performed, since it is more realistic. From the analysis performed using ANSYS Version 10. 0 it is seen that linear analysis over-estimates the lateral stiffness of the infill frame. Further, it is observed that the width of compressive diagonal generally decreases with increase in the modulus of masonry. It is also seen that incase of two frames with equal area of openings, the frame with larger width of opening exhibits slightly more initial lateral stiffness due to possibility of formation of single diagonal strut...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Automotive dampers are an {{important}} element of a vehicle's suspension system for controlling road handling and passenger ride comfort. Many automotive dampers have non-linear asymmetric characteristics to accommodate the incompatible requirements between ride comfort and road handling, thus the ride comfort engineer requires techniques that can characterize this non-linear behaviour and provide models of the dampers for use in ride performance simulations of the full suspension system. The work presented in this paper is concerned with developing a frequency domain technique using higher order frequency response functions (HFRFs) to characterize a Monroe automotive damper. The <b>principal</b> <b>diagonals</b> and multidimensional surfaces of the HFRFs up to third order are obtained. Non-linear damping coefficients for the damper are derived from the HFRFs and the energy transfer properties are investigated. The results show {{that the majority of the}} HFRFs contain no peaks or resonances, indicating that the damper has no preferred frequencies for energy transfer. The accuracy of the damping coefficients determined from the HFRFs is poor. This is due to the inability of the technique to measure the pure HFRFs and separate the effects of non-linearities in the input actuator from those in the damper. It is concluded that these constraints currently impose some limit on the use of the methodology...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPart II of {{this study}} is {{concerned}} with the modeling of all aspects of the compressive response and crushing of the open-cell Al foam studied in Part I. The foam microstructure is modeled using the regular cell of Kelvin with cell anisotropy and ligament geometry established by X-ray tomography. The ligaments are modeled as shear-deformable beams and the material is elastoplastic calibrated to the properties of the Al alloy base material. It is demonstrated that the initiation stress of measured responses is associated with a limit load instability that results from plastification of foam ligaments due to combined bending and axial compression. The periodicity of the Kelvin cell enables calculation of the initial elastic properties as well as the initiation stress with just a single fully periodic characteristic cell. The crushing response is evaluated by considering finite size 3 D domains that allow localized deformation to develop. Localization {{is in the form of}} shear buckling that develops along the <b>principal</b> <b>diagonals</b> of the Kelvin cell foam. Localized crushing is arrested by contact between the ligaments of the buckled cells. Contact is approximated by limiting the amount a cell can collapse in the direction of the applied load. This arrests local collapse and causes it to spread to neighboring material at a nearly constant stress level as in the experiments. The stress picks up when the whole domain has crushed. Although the calculated collapse patterns differed from the more random ones observed in the experiments, the calculated force–displacement responses match very well the experimental ones in all aspects...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for the modeling, analysis and design of automatic control systems in fully fuzzy environment based on the normalized fuzzy matrices. The approach is also suitable for determining the propagation of fuzziness in automatic control and dynamical systems where all system coefficients are expressed as fuzzy parameters. A new consolidity chart is suggested based on the recently newly developed system consolidity index for testing the susceptibility of the system to withstand changes due to any system or input parameters changes effects. Implementation procedures are elaborated for the consolidity analysis of existing control systems and the design of new ones, including systems comparisons based on such implementation consolidity results. Application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through illustrative examples, covering fuzzy impulse response of systems, fuzzy Routh–Hurwitz stability criteria, fuzzy controllability and observability. Moreover, {{the use of the}} consolidity chart for the appropriate design of control system is elaborated through handling the stabilization of inverted pendulum through pole placement technique. It is also shown that the regions comparison in consolidity chart is based on type of consolidity region shape such as elliptical or circular, slope or angle in degrees of the centerline of the geometric shape, the centroid of the geometric shape, area of the geometric shape, length of <b>principal</b> <b>diagonals</b> of the shape, and the diversity ratio of consolidity points for each region. Finally, it is recommended that the proposed consolidity chart approach be extended as a unified theory for modeling, analysis and design of continuous and digital automatic control systems operating in fully fuzzy environment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a comprehensive methodology for solving and analyzing quadratic and nonlinear programming problems in fully fuzzy environment. The solution approach {{is based on}} the Arithmetic Fuzzy Logic-based Representations, previously founded on normalized fuzzy matrices. The suggested approach is generalized for the fully fuzzy case of the general forms of quadratic and nonlinear modeling and optimization problems of both the unconstrained and constrained fuzzy optimization problems. The constrained problems are extended by incorporating the suggested fuzzy logic-based representations assuming complete fuzziness of all the optimization formulation parameters. The robustness of the optimal fuzzy solutions is then analyzed using the recently newly developed system consolidity index. Four examples of quadratic and nonlinear programming optimization problems are investigated to illustrate the efficacy of the developed formulations. Moreover, consolidity patterns for the illustrative examples are sketched to show the ability of the optimal solution to withstand any system and input parameters changes effects. It is demonstrated that the geometric analysis of the consolidity charts of each region can be carried out based on specifying the type of consolidity region shape (such as elliptical or circular), slope or angle in degrees of the centerline of the geometric, the location of the centroid of the geometric shape, area of the geometric shape, lengths of <b>principals</b> <b>diagonals</b> of the shape, and the diversity ratio of consolidity points. The overall results demonstrate the consistency and effectiveness of the developed approach for incorporation and implementation for fuzzy quadratic and nonlinear optimization problems. Finally, it is concluded that the presented concept could provide a comprehensive methodology for various quadratic and nonlinear systems’ modeling and optimization in fully fuzzy environments...|$|R
