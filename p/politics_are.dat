5|$|Nauru {{does not}} have any formal {{structure}} for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First, and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than party affiliation.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{dominated by}} the Republican Party. Since statehood, Republicans have carried the state's electoral votes in all but five presidential elections: 1896, 1912 (By Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party), 1932, 1936 and 1964. Only Alaska has been carried fewer times by Democrat presidential candidates. Not even George McGovern, the Democratic nominee in 1972 {{as well as a}} native South Dakotan, was able to carry the state. Additionally, a Democrat has not won the governorship since 1974. As of 2016, Republicans hold a 15% voter registration advantage over Democrats and hold large majorities in both the state House of Representatives and Senate.|$|E
5|$|Przemysł II's foreign <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> more known {{during this}} time. His {{friendly}} relations with Henry IV Probus survived, despite the momentary interruption, even after 1273. This alliance was maintained without significant changes, and {{only as a}} result of the events that taken place on 18 February 1277 in the town of Jelcz near Wrocław, the Duke of Poznań was forced to explicitly stand at the side of the Wrocław ruler, his cousin. Henryk IV was kidnapped and imprisoned in the Legnica castle by his uncle, Duke Bolesław II Rogatka. The pretext used by the Duke of Legnica to do this was the demands of the Duke of Wrocław over one-third of his domains, which, according to him, were part of his inheritance as legacy from both his father Henry III the White (died in 1266) and uncle Władysław (died in 1270). Bolesław II used in his favor the political weakeness of Henryk IV's guardian, King Otakar II of Bohemia, who in September 1276 was forced to submit to King Rudolph I of Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Grimaldi's {{occupation}} of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, {{the absence of}} alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted {{in their use of}} the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> directly reflected {{in the evolution of the}} palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.|$|E
50|$|Diaspora <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> the {{political}} behavior of transnational ethnic diasporas, {{their relationship with}} their ethnic homelands and their host states, and their prominent role in ethnic conflicts.

50|$|Religious {{rejection}} of <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> {{a philosophy that}} can be found in several religions, such as Christianity, Islam, Taoism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Followers of this philosophy may withdraw from politics for several reasons, including the view that <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> artificial, divisionary, or corrupt.|$|R

25|$|The Iron Heel is {{interesting}} {{as an example}} of a dystopian novel that anticipates and influenced George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. London's socialist <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> explicitly on display here. The Iron Heel meets the contemporary definition of soft science fiction. The Star Rover (1915) is also science fiction.|$|E
25|$|Arizona <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> {{dominated}} by a longstanding rivalry between its two largest counties, Maricopa and Pima—home to Phoenix and Tucson, respectively. The two counties have almost 75 percent of the state's population and cast almost 80 percent of the state's vote. They also elect a substantial majority of the state legislature.|$|E

25|$|Most {{commentary}} on Manning and his Reform Party ignores his political thinking and portrays him {{in terms of}} traditional western-based political protest movements. Sigurdson (1994) argues that Manning should be regarded instead as a postmodern conservative whose <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> {{a response to the}} process of postmodernization that has characterized Canada in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Votebank <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> {{common in}} India, usually based on {{religion}} or caste. Indeed, the term itself was coined by the Indian sociologist, M. N. Srinivas.

25|$|This {{model of}} a secularist state protects the {{religious}} institutions from state interference, but with public religious expression to some extent frowned upon. This aims {{to protect the public}} power from the influences of religious institutions, especially in public office. Religious views which contain no idea of public responsibility, or which consider religious opinion irrelevant to <b>politics,</b> <b>are</b> not impinged upon by this type of secularization of public discourse.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamics}} of New Brunswick <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> {{different from those}} of other Canadian provinces. The lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province. In addition, the presence of a large Francophone minority dictates that consensus politics is necessary, even when there is a majority government present. In this manner, {{the ebb and flow of}} New Brunswick provincial politics parallels the federal stage.|$|E
