40|$|<b>Pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in {{children}} and teenagers* Ultrassonografia pélvica em crianças e adolescentes Wellington de Paula Martins 1, Stael Porto Leite 2, Carolina Oliveira Nastri 3 The knowledge of uterine and ovarian changes in the puberty is essential in the investigation changes in the female pelvis of children and teenagers. In these patients, <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is routinely performed with a full bladder to produce an acoustic window, although this examination may also be performed with endovaginal approach in sexually active teenagers. Main indications for <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> {{in children}} and teenagers are either early or delayed puberty, pelvic pain or tumors, ambiguous genitalia, vaginal bleeding in children, and primary amenorrhea. In the present paper, the authors describe the scanning technique and the most frequent sonographic findings...|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Any patient, {{after the}} menarche, {{presenting}} {{symptoms such as}} dysmenorrhea, acute or chronic pelvic pain may develop endometriosis in the future. The patient must be submitted to directed propaedeutics, such as serum CA- 125 {{at the beginning of}} the menstrual cicle and <b>pelvic</b> perimenstrual <b>ultrasonography.</b> The sooner the treatment is started, the larger are the chances to avoid the progressing of the disease and it's complications.|$|R
30|$|Material: A {{case of a}} 67  years old {{patient who}} {{complains}} of a hyperandrogenism with a Ferriman–Gallwey index of 16. Testosterone: 5.1  ng/ml. <b>Pelvic</b> transvaginal <b>ultrasonography</b> was normal and neither the CT scan nor the pelvic MRI showed any finding of interest, with the ovaries smaller than 2  cm. Attending the clinical findings, a decision not to ask for hormonal suppression tests and to perform a laparoscopy was taken.|$|R
30|$|Patients {{underwent}} a full structured interview and abdominopelvic examinations by a senior doctor {{at their first}} admission to establish whether they needed an urgent surgical intervention. Deciding which patient needed surgical exploration was done by considering {{the characteristics of the}} adnexal mass on <b>pelvic</b> examination, <b>ultrasonography,</b> and laboratory evaluation. Vital signs were noted and blood drawn for serum alpha-fetoprotein, quantitative ßhCG, Ca 125, carcinoembriyogenic antigen, eloctrolytes, and liver function test, and urine analysis was performed preoperatively.|$|R
30|$|Objective: Management of non-tubal ectopic gestations {{remains an}} inadequately {{explored}} clinical field {{due to the}} rarity of the presentations. A major disadvantage of two-dimensional <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is its inability to reconstruct the uterine coronal axis.|$|E
30|$|Material and Methods: A 31 {{year old}} {{nulliparous}} patient presented with irregular vaginal bleeding and anemia. <b>Pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> revealed a 4.5 cm well vascularized intramural uterine tumor, occupying the posterior {{aspect of the}} uterine cavity. She was managed with laparoscopic excision and uterine reconstruction.|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} who {{developed}} ovarian and uterine leukaemic relapse while in bone marrow remission is described.

40|$|We report {{two cases}} of uterine lipoleiomyoma in {{postmenopausal}} women of ages 52 and 55 years, who presented with complaints of leukorrhea and lower abdominal pain, respectively. Lipoleiomyoma {{is a rare}} benign variant of leiomyoma, having an incidence of 0. 03 %– 0. 2 %. These are benign pelvic tumors which are usually asymptomatic and commonly occur in obese postmenopausal women. However, they can occasionally present with typical leiomyoma symptoms. Imaging {{plays a crucial role}} in the diagnosis of benign <b>pelvic</b> tumors. <b>Ultrasonography</b> is the first imaging modality for diagnosis of pelvic tumors in females. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are specific in demonstrating the uterine origin and fat component...|$|R
50|$|Besides a {{physical}} examination, the physician will need imaging techniques {{to determine the}} character of the malformation: gynecologic <b>ultrasonography,</b> <b>pelvic</b> MRI, or hysterosalpingography. A hysterosalpingogram is not considered as useful due to the inability of the technique to evaluate the exterior contour of the uterus and distinguish between a bicornuate and septate uterus. In addition, laparoscopy and/or hysteroscopy may be indicated.In some patients the vaginal development may be affected.|$|R
40|$|Malacoplakia {{is a rare}} {{inflammatory}} condition {{most often}} affecting the genitourinary system. We report {{the case of a}} 24 -year-old man who presented with gross hematuria, nocturia, frequency, dysuria and considerable weight loss during the preceding three months. Digital rectal examination showed a solid <b>pelvic</b> mass. <b>Ultrasonography</b> and computed tomography showed calyceal dilatation on the right side and a solid bladder mass 10 cm in diameter suspicious of bladder cancer. Transurethral resection of the tumor was incomplete, due to the large volume of the bladder mass. Histological examination of the resected specimen revealed malacoplakia of the bladder. The patient was treated with fluoroquinolone and vitamin C. Follow-up at 3 months showed marked regression of the bladder mass and complete resolution of the calyceal dilatation...|$|R
30|$|A 38 -year-old {{woman and}} her male partner had been under our care for primary infertility, at the Centre for Reproduction of Uppsala University Hospital, for 3  years. She had a normal body mass index (BMI; 22  kg/m 2) and regular ovulatory menstrual cycles. Previously, she had used {{combined}} oral contraceptives followed by an intrauterine device for 10  years. Baseline infertility investigations, including hormonal assessments for TSH and prolactin, <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> and semen analysis, were unremarkable. Tubal perviousness and no abnormalities were seen at hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography.|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with severe}} {{idiopathic}} constipation are almost exclusively women. Common presenting features include lower abdominal pain, irregular and painful menstruation, and a past history of gynaecological surgery. <b>Pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was undertaken in 26 patients with severe idiopathic constipation and 21 age matched control women to detect any gynaecological abnormality. No {{difference was found}} in ovarian, uterine or pelvic vein morphology or size. The abdominal pain in these patients {{is related to the}} bowel disorder, and minor abnormalities of pelvic morphology on ultrasound are probably incidental findings...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of a {{congenital}} seminal vesicle cyst with ipsilateral hypoplastic kidney in a 51 year-old Indian man presenting with features of bladder outlet obstruction. Abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>Ultrasonography</b> (USG), computed tomography revealed a retrovesical cystic mass measuring 10 cm x 9 cm with indentations over the left infero-lateral wall of the urinary bladder. On USG and radionuclide renal scanning the ipsilateral kidney was not found, which was located only on the CT scan. The cyst and the hypoplastic kidney was excised with an uneventful recovery...|$|E
40|$|Ten male {{patients}} with ultrasonographic {{evidence of an}} internal genital anomaly associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis are presented. The abnormalities consist of seminal vesicle agenesis in 4, seminal vesicle cyst in 3, Wolffian duct remnant in 2, and Mullerian duct remnant in 1. Such developmental defects are due to a primary anomaly of the mesonephros. Due to its capability of visualizing the lumbar and <b>pelvic</b> regions simultaneously, <b>ultrasonography</b> {{appears to be the}} first-choice imaging modality for the screening of such genitourinary developmental malformations...|$|R
40|$|A 32 -year-old {{primigravida}} {{was referred}} to our hospital at 36 weeks of gestation with a fetal <b>pelvic</b> mass. <b>Ultrasonography</b> showed the fluid-filled area to be a 9 × 4 × 5 -cm pear-shaped retrovesical mass with a funnel-shaped blind pouch at the distal end of the fetal vagina. Marked left hydronephrosis resulting from mass compression was also detected. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging further defined a pelvic lesion extending cephalically into the abdomen and caudally into the vagina. Membranal protrusion of the introitus was clearly identified. Therefore, the diagnosis of congenital imperforate hymen with hydrocolpos was established. At 38 weeks of gestation, a 2, 966 -g female infant was delivered vaginally with good Apgar scores. Physical examination of the neonate revealed a bulging membrane covering the vaginal opening. The presence of syndromic disorders (McKusick-Kaufman, Ellis-van Creveld or Bardet-Biedl syndromes), genitourinary and anorectal anomalies were excluded. The karyotype was 46, XX. A hymenotomy {{was performed on the}} second day of life. The infant recovered fully after hymenotomy...|$|R
40|$|Intermittent {{pelvic pain}} caused by ovarian cysts in {{adolescence}} {{may be due}} to torsion or partial torsion of the ovary.

40|$|Transverse vaginal septum is {{the result}} of faulty {{canalization}} of the embryonic vagina. We described a case of transverse vaginal septum with a small central aperture diagnosed during labor. An 18 -years-old girl at 28 weeks of gestation presented to our obstetric department complaining of symptoms of preterm delivery. <b>Pelvic</b> and vaginal <b>ultrasonography,</b> with gynecologic examination established a diagnosis of transverse vaginal septum in mid-vagina. An incision in the vaginal septum allowed us to see the head of the fetus in the vagina. The diagnosis of transverse vaginal septum was confirmed during labor and excision of the septum prevented the uterine rupture...|$|R
30|$|The {{available}} pre-operative diagnostic tools {{include the}} patient’s history, <b>pelvic</b> examination, transvaginal <b>ultrasonography</b> (TVUS), and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) [3, 4]. A negative imaging workup does not exclude endometriosis. An average diagnostic delay from symptom onset till definitive diagnosis can be up to 12  years [5, 6]. Chronic pelvic pain and infertility significantly affect the patient’s {{quality of life and}} carry a high economic burden [7]. It is imperative that a prompt and accurate diagnosis is reached in order to bypass the diagnostic delay and refer patients for adequate care by endometriosis specialists in dedicated centers [8], to improve counseling and preoperative preparation and to determine the multidisciplinary team to be present in order to allow definitive surgical treatment.|$|R
40|$|Rectal leiomyosarcoma is rare, often {{large and}} {{found in the}} distal third of the rectum. Most {{symptoms}} {{differ from those of}} an adenocarcinoma. Staging is difficult and should include tumour size, necrosis, cellularity, number of mitoses and anaplasia. Abdominoperineal excision (APE) remains the only effective treatment. A 66 year old asymptomatic female presented with painless rectal bleeding after a fall. Digital examination and proctoscopy revealed a mass on the posterior rectal wall. <b>Pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> arteriography and CT-Scan showed a huge retro-rectal lesion. Following APE, histopathology confirmed a leiomyosarcoma. No adjuvant therapy was given; there is no recurrence 4 years later...|$|E
40|$|Benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} (BPH) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common processes affecting elderly men. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of PR- 2000, an herbal preparation in the treatment of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The trial included 68 patients who were diagnosed with BPH and graded accordingly using the American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score, uroflowmetric study and <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> to determine the sonographic size of prostate. PR- 2000 was administered orally at a dose of 2 tablets thrice daily for six months. All the patients were periodically evaluated for the entire study period. Following six months of treatment, the patients showed encouraging improvement in the AUA score along with an increase in peak flow rate and a subsequent decrease in sonographic size of prostate. The average AUA score showed an improvement from an initial 21. 6 to 11. 46 at the end of 6 months. Uroflometry measured at the first month showed an average of 10. 6 ml/sec and increased to an average of 15. 06 by the end of six months. <b>Pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> revealed that the average size of prostate decreased from 33. 30 g at the first month to 26. 11 g by 6 months. No change in biochemical markers were observed and no untoward side effects were noticed during the trial.

30|$|Case: 26  year old {{patient was}} {{referred}} to our clinic with suspicion of cornual pregnancy. At admission vital signs were stable. Both <b>pelvic</b> and transvaginal <b>ultrasonography</b> revealed a gestational sac and live fetus with a CRL of 9  weeks of gestation located on the right corneal region adjacent to tubal orifice. Laparoscopy was planned. 2 hours prior to operation vaginal misoprostol was administered in a dose of 400  mcg. During laparoscopy, pelvic inspection showed a high-volume hypervascularized mobile uterus, with a 3  cm subserosal fundal congested and soft right mass. We performed an incision over the right corneal mass with a monopolar dissector and removed gestational material by grasping forceps.

He had a history suggestive of bladder outflow obstruction for past 1 -year, but no history of retention of urine. Radicular pain and marked constipation were of recent onset. There was no history suggestive of urinary tract infection or significant weight loss. There was no past history of surgery, trauma or other major illness. On examination, the bladder was distended and digital rectal examination revealed an anteriorly placed immobile, nontender, extra luminal soft, cystic <b>pelvic</b> mass. <b>Ultrasonography</b> revealed a cystic mass within pelvis with back pressure changes of the kidneys and ureters, while contrast enhanced computed tomography of abdomen revealed a 10. 5 cm × 10 cm thick-walled, nonenhancing, unilocular lesion occupying the pouch of Douglas pressing on the bladder neck anteriorly. An ELISA test for echinococcus antigen was negative. Laparotomy revealed an immobile, retroperitoneal, tense, cystic swelling occupying the entire pelvic cavity containing crystal clear fluid suggesting possibility of hydatid cyst. Exploration of the cyst with scrupulous precautions to avoid spillage showed an endocyst. Endocystectomy with partial pericystectomy was done. Patient had an uneventful recovery.

50|$|Penile Artery Shunt Syndrome (PASS) was {{initially}} {{described in a}} patient who underwent Penile Revascularization Surgery for isolated left cavernosal artery stenosis {{in the absence of}} systemic vascular risk factors. An end-to-end anastomosis of the left inferior epigastric artery to the left dorsal penile artery was created using a previously described technique. After technically successful revascularization surgery, the patient continued to have post-operative erectile dysfunction despite documented patency of the surgical graft by Penile Duplex <b>Ultrasonography.</b> <b>Pelvic</b> angiography was performed on the patient, revealing an aberrant obturator artery originating from the inferior epigastric artery. The study revealed markedly sluggish forward flow visualized through the anastomosis to the left dorsal penile artery, with dominant flow in the left inferior epigastric artery to the obturator artery and its branches. This culminated in reduced blood flow to the penis.|$|R

During the follow-up of patients who had undergone pelvic surgery, imaging should be performed to detect recurrent disease, postoperative fibrosis, adhesions and more specific complications related to prosthetic material. Current guidelines recommend using <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> as the first line imaging modality whereas the use of pelvic computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging should be restricted to specific situations, depending on local availability of equipment and suspected disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Perineural cysts formed {{within the}} nerve-root sheath at the dorsal root ganglion. They are most {{commonly}} {{located in the}} arachnoid covering the junction of the dorsal ganglion and nerve root. They are usually asymptomatic, incidental findings, usually located in the lumbar and sacral region of the spinal canal. It is important to consolidate the imaging findings of this rare disease so clinicians can become more clinically relevant {{in the evaluation of}} these cysts. Case: Herein we report a case of perineural cyst misdiagnosed with hydrosalpinx by <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and finally diagnosed with magnetic resonance image. Conclusion: Perineural cyst should be considered, in the presence of bilateral adnexal masses separated from the ovaries in pelvic sonography...|$|E
40|$|Adenomyotic cysts are {{uncommon}} findings, {{usually in}} the context of diffuse adenomyosis and < 5 mm in diameter. Herein we report a 4. 5 -cm adenomyotic cyst in a 25 -year-old nulliparous woman with severe dysmenorrhea and <b>pelvic</b> pain. Transvaginal <b>ultrasonography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-circumscribed hypoechogenic mass in the posterior uterine wall, well separated from the uterine cavity. Pathologic analysis demonstrated that the cyst was lined with endometrial epithelium and stroma and was surrounded by smooth muscle hyperplasia. In the literature, we found 30 reports of cysts with similar characteristics. Because this cyst has not been clearly defined, it has been called by various names including adenomyotic cyst, cystic adenomyosis, and cystic adenomyoma. We believe this lesion should not be called an adenomyoma, but is more correctly called an adenomyotic cyst or, depending on age at onset, a juvenile adenomyotic cyst...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{clinical}} {{staging of}} bladder tumors {{is of utmost}} importance for selecting the most suitable treatment measure for each clinical case. We evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of <b>pelvic</b> angiography, transabdominal <b>ultrasonography,</b> transurethral ultrasonography and computed tomography for estimation {{of the extent of}} bladder tumor infiltration. During the past 12 years, we experienced 232 bladder tumor cases. Among them, 30 patients were evaluated with pelvic angiography, 52 with transabdominal ultrasonography, 14 with transurethral ultrasonography and 84 with computed tomography. Pelvic angiography enabled correct diagnosis in 24 of the 30 patients (80 %), transabdominal ultrasonography in 8 of the 52 patients (15 %), transurethral ultrasonography in 7 of the 14 patients (50 %) and computed tomography in 62 of the 84 patients (74 %).
