40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} pelleting temperatures on {{the activity of}} cellulase, bacterial amylase, fungal amylase, and <b>pentosanase</b> were tested. Samples of a commercial barley-wheat-soybean diet containing different enzyme preparations were pelleted at 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 C (pellet temperature measured at the die outlet) through a die containing holes 2. 5 mm in diameter. Enzymatic analyses were conducted on either soluble substrates or by measuring {{the ability of the}} tested enzymes to decrease the viscosity of the diet. Measurements made on soluble substrates suggest that cellulase, fungal amylase, and <b>pentosanase</b> maintained activity when being pelleted at temperatures up to 80 C and bacterial amylase maintained activity at temperatures up to 90 C. <b>Pentosanase</b> and amylases showed little or no effect on the viscosity of the diet. Cellulase addition decreased the viscosity at all temperature levels, even after being pelleted at 90 and 100 C (P < 0. 05). No cellulolytic activity was detected on the soluble substrate after these pelleting temperatures. Measurements on a soluble substrate might therefore not always reflect the true stability of a preparation because the ability of a carbohydrase to decrease the viscosity of the digesta is important to its effect in the gastrointestinal tract. Measurements on soluble substrates suggest that cellulase, fungal amylase, and <b>pentosanase</b> can be pelleted at temperatures up to at least 80 C and bacterial amylase up to 90 C without a considerable loss in analyzed activit...|$|E
40|$|Tartary buckwheat, rich in {{bioactive}} components such as flavonoids, {{has been}} proved beneficial to human health and prevention from many diseases. However, its utilization is limited due to bitterness, roughness, and hardness. The {{present study was to}} develop a kind of Tartary buckwheat enriched steamed bread with blends of Tartary buckwheat flour, wheat flour, gluten, glucose oxidase, and <b>pentosanase,</b> using response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the formula. The independent variables investigated {{in the present study were}} the additive amount of gluten, glucose oxidase, and <b>pentosanase,</b> with bread volume and sensory evaluation value as response variables. Based on a basic formula consisting of 250 [*]g Tartary buckwheat flour, 250 [*]g wheat flour, 15 [*]g yeast, and 300 [*]mL water, the obtained optimum formula was 41. 20 [*]g gluten, 1032 [*]U glucose oxidase, and 56 [*]U <b>pentosanase.</b> Gluten and GOD demonstrated statistically significant effects on Tartary buckwheat steamed bread volume and sensory evaluation values. The validation test results of the optimum formula, with relative error as 0. 98 % and 2. 55 %, were consistent with the theoretically predicted values, demonstrating the reliability of equation and effectiveness of RSM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the effect of feeding different processed pigeon pea seeds on broilers performance. Four isocaloric and iso-nitrogenous diets containing (10 %) of soaked pigeon pea seeds, decorticated with added enzyme (multi enzymes with high content of <b>pentosanase),</b> decorticated roasted and control diet were formulated. Parameters measured weekly were feed intake, body weight gain and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR). Overall body weight, hot carcass weight and dressing percentage were recorded. Results revealed that inclusion of 10 % soaked pigeon pea seed, decorticated with added enzyme (multi enzyme with a high content of <b>pentosanase)</b> and decorticated roasted had no significant (p> 0. 05) effects on feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, final live body weight, hot carcass weight and dressing percentage. Inclusion of 10 % processed pigeon pea seeds resulted in a similar performance of broiler chicks {{when compared with the}} control group...|$|E
40|$|Digestive {{capacity}} of early-weaned pigs may be insufficient to fully digest many ingredients currently used in weaner diets. Ihe {{aim of this}} experiment {{was to determine whether}} an exogenous enzyme preparation with broad carbohydrase activity could benefit pigs that developmentally might be immature at weaning, especially with regard to gastrointestinal development. Eighty Large White x Landrace pigs were used in a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 factorial experiment with the factors being: weaning age (14 or 24 days), weaning weight (heavy or light), sex (boar or gilt), and dietary Biofeed Plus CT (0 or 500 μg/g), which contained fungal xylanases, <b>pentosanases,</b> and β-glucanases. Pigs were housed individually and given a wheat-based (550 g/kg) diet containing 15. 0 MJ DE and 15. 9 g lysine/kg on an ad libitum basis for 21 days. The diet also contained 50 g/kg of soybean meal and 50 g/kg of lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) kernels. The liveweights of heavy (H) pigs weaned at 24 or 14 days and light pigs (L) weaned at 24 or 14 days were 7. 9 and 5. 3 and 5. 2 and 3. 9 kg, respectively. Pigs weaned at 14 days grew slower (157 v. 345 g/day) than those weaned at 24 days, although there was a suggestion of an interaction between age and weight at weaning (P = 0. 081). Thus, H and L pigs weaned at 14 days grew at 148 and 166 g/day, whereas H and L pigs weaned at 24 days grew at 374 and 315 g/day, respectively. Although there was no main effect of enzymes on daily gain (248 v. 254 g/day, P = 0. 80), feed intake (278 v. 284 g/day, P = 0. 79), or feed conversion ratio (1. 19 v. 1. 25, P = 0. 35), there were interactions with weaning age on daily gain (P = 0. 050) and feed intake (P = 0. 060). Pigs weaned at 14 days grew slower (176 v. 138 g/day) and ate less (206 v. 174 g/day), whereas pigs weaned at 24 days grew faster (321 v. 369 g/day) and ate more (351 v. 394 g/day), when supplemented with enzymes. During the third week after weaning there were interactions between dietary enzymes and sex (P = 0. 060) and dietary enzymes and age (P = 0. 023) on daily gain. Thus, pigs weaned at 24 days and supplemented with Biofeed Plus CT grew more quickly during the third week (559 v. 460 g/day), whereas the converse was true for pigs weaned at 14 days (286 v. 334 g/day). Also, enzyme-supplemented boars grew better over this period (457 v. 371 g/day), whereas the converse was true, for gilts (388 v. 423 g/day). In conclusion, these data clearly indicate that the greatest determinant of post-weaning performance under the present conditions was the age of the pigs at weaning. Dietary enzyme supplementation appeared most efficacious in boars weaned at an older age, although benefits did not become apparent until 2 weeks after weaning...|$|R
40|$|M. TechIn South Africa, {{the gross}} margins {{currently}} achieved on normal pan breads are minimal. For {{a number of}} years manufacturers have been trying to improve this situation with added ingredients. Probably one of the simplest of ways {{to do this is to}} increase the water absorption, without adversely affecting the quality of the bread such as loaf volume and shelf life. Another means to possibly increase profits is to extend the shelf life on bread. The ultimate would be to supplement the standard formulation with one extra ingredient in order to enhance all aspects. White pan bread was supplemented with three different concentration levels of each lipase, <b>pentosanase,</b> guar gum, к-carrageenan, calcium caseinate and whey. The effects of the different additives were measured against a control. In terms of the water absorption the gums prove to be the best additives, which is mainly due to their ability to function as water binders. К-carrageenan was most excellent at both the medium and high concentration levels, whereas guar gum only performed best at the high concentration level. Both lipase and <b>pentosanase</b> gave good loaf volumes compared to the rest of the additives and the control. The positive effect due to <b>pentosanase</b> could probably be explained by way of two main pathways – oxidative gelation or spiralling effect of the hydrolysis of water in the dough. Lipase is believed to strengthen the gluten and therefore ultimately increases loaf volume. Calcium caseinate was a good anti-staling agent. The mode of action is probably through its water holding ability, though more work is needed since the water absorption results did not correlate. Although к-carrageenan showed increased water absorptions, it also slowed down mould growth tremendously, possibly since the water is in a “bound” form and not available for microbial activity. In the search for one additive to obtain best results for water absorption, loaf volume and shelf life, it seems that к-carrageenan would be the additive of choice...|$|E
40|$|O experimento foi realizado com o objetivo de determinar o desempenho e o rendimento de carcaça de frangos de corte alimentados com dietas contendo níveis crescentes de farelo de arroz {{integral}} (FAI), suplementadas ou não com enzimas. Foram utilizados 960 pintos de corte, machos e fêmeas da linhagem Cobb distribuídos em um delineamento experimental inteiramente casualizado, com oito tratamentos e seis repetições de 20 aves. Utilizaram-se 4 níveis de FAI (0 %, 10 %, 20 % e 30 %), com e sem suplementação de um complexo multienzimático composto pelas enzimas protease, <b>pentosanase</b> e fitase. As dietas experimentais foram isoenergéticas, isoproteicas, isofosfóricas e isocálcicas para todos os tratamentos. Com a utilização de níveis crescentes de farelo de arroz integral, houve redução significativa (P 0, 05) nenhum dos parâmetros avaliados, entretanto, as rações suplementadas com o complexo multienzimático, promoveram um índice bio-econômico (IBE) 1, 4 % superior em relação às dietas não suplementadas. This {{experiment was}} conducted to determine the performance and carcass yeld of broilers fed diets based on increasing whole rice meal levels (WRM), with or without multienzyme complex supplementation. Nine hundred and sixty Cobb chicks, males and females, were allocated in a completely randomized design with eight treatments and six replicates with 20 birds. Four levels of WRM (0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 %), with and without supplementation of a multienzyme complex composed of protease, <b>pentosanase</b> e phytase enzymes {{were used in the}} experiment. The diets had the same levels of energy, protein, calcium and phosphorus in all the treatments.

40|$|From the {{completion}} of the baking process, loaf breads undergo changes which result in their appeal diminishing. Pentosans in wheat flour consist primarily of arabinoxylans with smaller levels of arabinogalactan often present. Commercial <b>pentosanase</b> preparations contain a range of xylanase and arabinase activities that are believed to act synergistically to produce the improving effects observed in breads when these preparations are added. The purpose of this study has been to investigate the significance of various carbohydrate hydrolases as anti-staling agents. Initially breads were treated with five purified endoxylanase preparations at a range of treatment levels to establish suitable levels of addition. Whilst it was found that changes at a molecular level impacted significantly on crumb and crust characteristics for some of the preparations, it appears that not all endoxylanases have beneficial effects when used alone in a basic bread formulation...|$|E

One hundred and sixty un-sexed one-day old broiler chicks Ross (308) were used. Four experimental diets were formulated to meet the nutrient requirements of broiler chicks according to NRC (1994). Diet (A) was the control diet with 0 % Hyacinth bean seeds {{and there were other}} three diets, each containing 15 % Hyacinth bean seeds with different treatment. Diet(B),soaked seed+ enzyme; the seeds were soaked in water for 24 hours then boiled for 15 minutes and multi enzyme was added: (Bergazym P) contains Endo- 1, 4 -B-Xylanase, Endo <b>Pentosanase,</b> protease and amylase.

30|$|The alkali-treated {{rice straw}} was {{partially}} hydrolyzed for 2 h at 50 °C, prior to yeast inoculation, {{to decrease the}} viscosity of the suspension and to improve the reproducibility of the results. For the saccharification of rice straw, a combination of cellulase (Celluclast 1.5 L), β-glucosidase (Novozyme 188), and enzyme complex (Ultraflo L) was used for enzymatic saccharification. All enzymes were obtained from Novozymes Japan (Chiba, Japan). The enzyme activity of Celluclast 1.5 L was 80 FPU/mL; β-glucosidase with an enzyme activity of 322 CBU/mL was used to hydrolyze cellobiose. Ultraflo L contained cellulase, xylanase, <b>pentosanase,</b> and arabanase, with an activity of 45 FBG/g. To evaluate the SSF performance of the selected strain, S. cerevisiae NBRC 0224, S. stipitis NBRC 10063, and C. shehatae ATCC 22984 were used as control strains. Subsequent to a 2 h partial hydrolysis, the rice straw was cooled {{as quickly as possible}} by immersion in cold water. Cells were cultured and pelleted using centrifugation. The flask was then aseptically inoculated with 2.3 g (dry cell weight) of yeast cells, corresponding to an OD 600 of 20, and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h in a rotary shaker (150 rpm). The SSF were carried out in the same flask as the pretreatment. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The amount of glucose and xylose released from the rice straw were determined to be 33.1 g/L and 12.8 g/L, respectively, following incubation without yeasts at 50 °C for 24 h. The ethanol yield was calculated as a percentage of a maximum theoretical ethanol yield of 0.51 g ethanol per gram of glucose or xylose.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The effect of wheat flour substitution with sorghum flour (SF) on the quality of cookies was evaluated. The three point bending test and sensory panels were used to evaluate changes in cookie texture and acceptability. The formulations used were a Mexican style, standard AACC recipe, and a chocolate chip type. The Mexican style cookie was optimum to evaluate changes in SF on cookie quality. Mexican style cookies made with 100 % SF were very gritty, dry and fragile. The chocolate chip cookies had improved palatability, although they remained fragile. Intensive milling methods increased the amount of damaged starch, reduced particle size and moisture in the flour in hopes of improving cookie quality. Milling detoxicated sorghum with a Udy cyclone mill was the best alternative. Flours with higher damaged starch (1 x and 2 x Udy milled, 11 and 16 % DS) produced better cookies than flour with low damaged starch (Sr. milled, 7 % DS). Substitution with native corn or sorghum starch did not improve cookie texture. Substituting 5 % of SF with pregelatinized waxy corn starch (PCS) or with 10 % vital wheat gluten improved the Mexican style cookie quality, making them less gritty and more resistant to breakage during handling, having bending force values close to wheat flour control. Enzymes (?-amylase, xylanase, <b>pentosanase,</b> and protease) and two reducing agents (L-cysteine and sodium metabisulfite) at different concentrations did not have detectable effects on Mexican style cookies made with 100 % SF. Environmental SEM analysis was helpful in detecting the continuous starch/lipid phase in the chocolate chip formulation that coated the sharp edges of SF particles in the cookie. The Mexican style cookie crumb improved when 5 % PCS was added; more air tunnels developed within the crumb with thicker walls and a starchy continuous matrix that functioned like gluten did in the wheat flour cookie. Sensory evaluation confirmed the improvement in cookie texture for sorghum flours with higher damaged starch levels and when 5 % PCS- 95 % SF ratios were used. Sorghum flour can be used in various cookie formulations to levels as high as 95 % in combination with 5 % PCS and up to 50 % in combination with 50 % wheat flour...|$|E
