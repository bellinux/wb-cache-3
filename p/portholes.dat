5|$|Still {{relatively}} inexperienced, Low ordered {{too many}} {{men to the}} outside of the boat to work on the buildup, and the Rose Pink tipped over too far. The <b>portholes</b> had been left open, and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men. The Rose Pink had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low—by now captaining a captured schooner, the Squirrel—and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a pint (around 275ml) per man, per day.|$|E
5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional <b>portholes</b> were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder {{were placed in the}} ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E

5|$|Unlike its sister, {{which was}} {{intended}} for emergency use only, this light was constantly manned by Coast Guard personnel, after the Coast Guard {{took charge of the}} lighthouses in the United States in 1939, who served two-week rotating tours. These men lived in the circular portion of the lighthouse. The dwelling encompassed not only the superstructure, but also part of the foundation, as shown by the ring of <b>portholes</b> in its side.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} trials Sissoi Veliky {{was ordered to}} join the Mediterranean Squadron which was engaged in the naval {{blockade}} of Crete {{in the wake of}} the 1896 Cretan riots and the Hamidian massacres. Her maiden voyage revealed more problems; the lack of ventilation in the steering compartment was so appalling that during the first port call the captain purchased electric fans with his own money and the electrical systems failed one by one before reaching Gibraltar. The copper rings for sealing the <b>portholes</b> were left in Kronstadt and were not found until February 1897.|$|E
5|$|Breslau {{was built}} in 1901 by the Bremer Vulkan yard at Vegesack for the North German Lloyd line as the fourth of seven ships of the Köln class. The Köln-class ships, all named after German cities, were {{designed}} for the Bremen to Baltimore and Galveston route, and were specially fitted for steerage traffic. Though the class was designed with accommodations for 120 cabin-class passengers and up to 1,850 steerage passengers for service from Germany, Breslaus capacity was somewhat lower, with room for 66 cabin-class and 1,660 in steerage. The Köln-class steerage compartments had <b>portholes</b> for better light and ventilation than was typical, and included cabins that housed from four to ten passengers. Köln-class ships were specially designed to carry large freight loads on return voyages to Germany, with holds customized for carrying wheat and cotton.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlers}} took shelter {{inside the}} fort {{while the men}} and boys took up their positions at the <b>portholes</b> inside the fort. A vicious firefight erupted, involving around 150 of Black Hawk's British Band. The battle raged {{for about an hour}} with heavy gunfire from both sides. At the battle's onset many of the settlement's women had been huddled in and around the cabins, but several married woman, including Elizabeth Armstrong, rallied the women and older children to provide support to the soldiers. She assigned the unmarried young women, boys, and girls as young as eight years old to such tasks as cutting and rolling gunpowder cartridges and molding rifleballs. The married women reloaded the weapons while the soldiers tried to maintain an increased rate of fire.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut <b>portholes</b> in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E

25|$|In 1946 {{modifications}} {{were carried}} out by Middle Docks & Engineering Co Ltd in England to improve crew accommodation, {{which resulted in a}} raised bridge and more <b>portholes.</b> The gross tonnage changed to 1156.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the ship}} was broken up and {{disposed}} of in 1961, some bits of her outer plating, bearing the ship's name and a few <b>portholes</b> were salvaged and put into display at the Italian Naval Museum in La Spezia, along with other Decima Flotilla MAS artifacts (a barchino assault explosive motor boat and a maiale manned torpedo).|$|E

25|$|A {{retractable}} rectangular radiator descended {{between and}} {{just in front of}} the undercarriage legs. The pressurized cabin had five small <b>portholes</b> for the pilot, two forward, two sideways and one overhead, and there were two more, one on each side for the second crew member. The forward view was so poor that a periscope was fitted with a downward view for landing.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} damaged {{watertight}} {{door of the}} firemen's tunnel, the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly. Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. Britannic had reached her flooding limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) with her first six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising {{all the way up}} to B Deck. Those measures had been taken after the Titanic disaster. (Titanic could float with her first four compartments flooded.) The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. However, there were open <b>portholes</b> along the lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those <b>portholes</b> to ventilate the wards. As the ship's angle of list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1934 model year, a {{significant}} portion of the LaSalle was more closely related to the Oldsmobile, than to senior Cadillacs. Again, Earl's work with the LaSalle resulted in a graceful vehicle, led by an elegant and thin radiator grille. Earl's other contribution was the modern, airplane-styled, semi-shielded <b>portholes</b> along the side of the hood. All bodies were now made by Fleetwood.|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{propagation}} loss due to di®raction and insertion losses for indoor scenario at 5. 6 GHz band are measured using directive antenna and a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). It is {{shown that the}} insertion loss of a metallic door with <b>porthole</b> window varies from several dB due to {{the propagation}} loss via the <b>porthole</b> glass up to 50 dB due to the di®raction by the <b>porthole</b> boards when {{the line between the}} transmitting antenna and receiving one is outside the <b>porthole</b> glass. It is shown that the insertion loss of a 12 cm brick wall is 4. 8 dB for vertical polarization while it is 6. 3 dB for horizontal polarization. Also it is shown the di®raction loss due single or double concrete columns depends on the distance between the transmitting and receiving antennas...|$|R
40|$|Boal BV and the University of Twente {{participate}} in research projects focused on improvement of die design methods for aluminum extrusion dies. Within this research empirical knowledge {{is combined with}} insights gained from numerical process simulations. Design rules for improvements to the geometry and functionality of flat and <b>porthole</b> dies have been defined. For <b>porthole</b> dies {{this has led to}} enhanced die stability and significant reduction of scrap. For both flat and <b>porthole</b> dies an increase in production speed and a reduction of wear has been obtained.

25|$|G Deck, the Lower Deck, was {{the lowest}} {{complete}} deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest <b>portholes,</b> just above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the traveling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by orlop (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.|$|E
25|$|On 4 August 1914, the First World War began. Olympic {{initially}} {{remained in}} commercial service under Captain Herbert James Haddock. As a wartime measure, Olympic was painted in a grey colour scheme, <b>portholes</b> were blocked, and lights on deck were turned off {{to make the}} ship less visible. The schedule was hastily altered to terminate at Liverpool rather than Southampton, and this was later altered again to Glasgow.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} torpedo damage alone, {{striking the}} ship on the starboard coal bunker of boiler room no. 1, {{would probably have}} sunk the ship without a second explosion. This first blast was enough to cause, on its own, serious off-centre flooding, although the sinking would possibly have been slower. The deficiencies of the ship's original watertight bulkhead design exacerbated the situation, as did the many <b>portholes</b> which had been left open for ventilation.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} first {{excavated}} in 1868. By {{that time the}} capstones {{had fallen into the}} chamber. The excavators lifted these and a <b>porthole</b> stone, and restored the dolmen to what the excavators believed was its original form. In 1919, the Société Jersiaise moved the <b>porthole</b> stone to its current position at the eastern end of the chamber. However, archeologists believe that originally <b>porthole</b> stone may have stood within the chamber, dividing it into two segments of unequal length, each with its own entrance. Finds at the site included a few flint flakes and pottery fragments.|$|R
