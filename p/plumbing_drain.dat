Individuals who work in sanitation industries or on farms might be exposed on the job if they clean or maintain municipal sewers, manure storage tanks, or septic tanks.|$|E
5000|$|During the mid-1800s, when indoor {{plumbing}} was being developed, {{it was believed}} by many that disease was spread by miasmas, or literally [...] "bad air." [...] Originally, traps in <b>plumbing</b> <b>drain</b> pipes were designed to help keep this bad air from passing back into living spaces within buildings. However, during the Broad Street cholera outbreak in London, in the Summer of 1854, physician John Snow, among others, worked to prove that polluted water was the culprit, not the foul smells from sewage pipes. Subsequently, even as the germ theory of disease developed, society was slow to accept the idea that odors from sewers were relatively harmless {{when it came to}} the spread of disease.|$|E
50|$|Many {{portable}} dehumidifiers {{can also}} be adapted to connect the condensate drip output directly to a drain via a hose.

5000|$|The actual {{construction}} of the Icyball is slightly more complex than described above, to improve the efficiency: The connecting tube runs to {{the lower part of}} the warm ball, allowing the ammonia vapor to bubble through the water speeding absorption, and also serving to stir the solution so heat is better transported to the finned walls. This [...] "bubbler" [...] was bypassed by a liquid (no moving parts) check-valve during regeneration, so that only gas, and not liquid solution was transferred to the cold side. The operation of the liquid check valve was somewhat similar to the water seals (J-traps) used in <b>plumbing</b> <b>drains.</b> Mechanical check valves require too much pressure to function properly in this application. To minimize the amount of water transferred to the cold ball during the recharge cycle, trapping structures were placed in the upper part of the connecting tube, allowing only gas to pass, and directing water back to the warm side ball.|$|R

40|$|Pharmaceuticals and {{personal}} care products (PPCPs) may be introduced to the environment via household disposal through <b>plumbing</b> <b>drains,</b> followed by conveyance to municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). PPCP residuals contained in WWTP effluent may be discharged to aquatic systems (e. g., rivers, lakes, estuaries), while PPCP residuals in sludge may enter the terrestrial system through land application of sludge-derived biosolids. Rarely are the potential effects of those PPCP residuals on aquatic and terrestrial species considered. An ecological risk assessment framework was therefore developed to allow the quantitative evaluation of potential ecological risks posed by PPCPs in WWTP effluent and land-applied biosolids. In this framework, a fugacity and bioaccumulation model is employed to estimate distributions of potential ecological exposure under various environmental conditions. The predicted exposure estimates are then compared to measured or estimated effects concentrations for each ecological species of interest, in order to calculate potential risk from aquatic or terrestrial exposures. Additionally, the estimated dietary doses to mammalian and avian species {{can be compared to}} toxicity reference values derived from the primary or proprietary literature in order to determine risk from food chain exposures...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that plumbing systems might serve as a significant environmental reservoir of human-pathogenic isolates of Fusarium. We tested this hypothesis by performing the first extensive multilocus sequence typing (MLST) survey of plumbing drain-associated Fusarium isolates and comparing the diversity observed to the known diversity of clinical Fusarium isolates. We sampled 471 drains, mostly in bathroom sinks, from 131 buildings in the United States using a swabbing method. We found that 66 % of sinks and 80 % of buildings surveyed yielded at least one Fusarium culture. A total of 297 isolates of Fusarium collected were subjected to MLST to identify the phylogenetic species and sequence types (STs) of these isolates. Our survey revealed that the six most common STs in sinks were identical to the six most frequently associated with human infections. We speculate that the most prevalent STs, {{by virtue of their}} ability to form and grow in biofilms, are well adapted to plumbing systems. Six major Fusarium STs were frequently isolated from <b>plumbing</b> <b>drains</b> within a broad geographic area and were identical to STs frequently associated with human infections...|$|R

50|$|Most {{municipal}} building codes mandate that <b>drain</b> <b>plumbing</b> increase in diameter {{as it moves}} closer to the municipal sewer system. I.E., most kitchen sinks evacuate water with a -inch drain pipe, which feeds into a larger 4-inch drain pipe on the main plumbing stack before heading to a septic tank or to the city sewage system. This means that, barring intrusion by tree roots or other debris into buried piping, {{the vast majority of}} household drain clogs occur in the smallest-diameter piping, usually in the pop-up or drain trap, where they can be reached easily by a hydro-mechanical device's water hose.|$|R

Social Work/Maatskaplike Werk, 42 (2) : 127 - 146. The original publication {{is available at}} [URL] its first decade of democracy South Africa lost {{a considerable number of}} its social workers to the United Kingdom. In general the reality of this fact and its impact are acknowledged both informally and officially. However, little empirical or comprehensive data is available on the phenomenon and its implications. Research on the migration of South African social workers to the United Kingdom was consequently undertaken to uncover generalisations and identify challenges that social service providers will need to meet in future if South African social workers are to be retained in the country. A sample consisting of 65 South Africans currently practising as social workers in the UK was investigated. The key finding of the research was that the social workers who migrated to the UK represent a lost generation, who may not easily be regained for social service delivery in South Africa. The challenges that local service providers will need to meet in order to retain the generation of remaining and prospective social workers in South Africa are presented as {{the other side of the}} effect of the brain drain phenomenon on local social work. These challenges entail, among other things, that social service providers need to establish a culture of healthy human resource management, including practices aimed at collective retention strategies that are sustainable and proactive.
