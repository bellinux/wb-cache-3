40|$|The {{perceived}} {{importance and}} utilization of 'party line' information by air carrier flight crews was investigated through pilot surveys and a flight simulation study. The Importance, Availability, and Accuracy of <b>party</b> <b>line</b> information elements were explored through surveys of pilots of several operational types. The survey identified numerous traffic and weather <b>party</b> <b>line</b> information elements which were considered important. These elements were scripted into a full-mission flight simulation which examined {{the utilization of}} <b>party</b> <b>line</b> information by studying subject responses to specific information element stimuli. The awareness of the different <b>Party</b> <b>Line</b> elements varied, and awareness was also affected by pilot workload. In addition, pilots were aware of some traffic information elements, but were reluctant to act on <b>Party</b> <b>Line</b> Information alone. Finally, the importance of <b>party</b> <b>line</b> information appears to be greatest for operations near or on the airport. This indicates that caution should be exercised when implementing datalink communications in tower and close-in terminal control sectors...|$|R

5|$|After Milne's announcement, Independent State Representative Paul Poirier, {{a liberal}} whose {{district}} voted for Milne by a 2-to-1 margin, {{announced that he}} would vote for Milne. One Democrat, State Representative Jim Condon, said that he would vote for Milne, also citing his district's support for Milne over Shumlin. Political science professors Eric Davis and Garrison Nelson and House Minority Leader Don Turner expected the General Assembly vote to roughly follow <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> with Milne receiving about one-third of the votes, including most of the Republicans and a few Democrats and Independents.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} the 33rd {{governor}} of Oregon in 1986, serving a single term. He faced significant challenges, particularly a rising anti-tax movement (leading to Measure 5 in 1990) and {{a doubling of}} the state's prison population. He worked across <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> to reduce regulation and to repair the state's infrastructure. During his term, Oregon emerged from nearly eight years of recession. His reforms to the State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF), a state-chartered worker's compensation insurance company were heralded at the time, but drew strong criticism in later years.|$|E
5|$|In February 2005, Brown {{announced}} his candidacy for Mayor of Buffalo. On April 29, 2005 three-term Democratic Mayor Anthony Masiello {{announced he would}} not seek a fourth four-year term. Masiello had run on both major <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> for his final two terms and had twice endorsed Republican Governor George Pataki. During his tenure, the city population and industrial tax base had decreased. Six candidates, including Brown, entered the race to replace him, with Brown accumulating many endorsements and the backing of organized labor.|$|E
40|$|Air/ground digital {{datalink}} communications are {{an integral}} component of the FAA's Air Traffic Control (ATC) modernization strategy. With the introduction of datalink into the ATC system, there is concern over the potential loss of situational awareness by flight crews due to {{the reduction in the}} "party line" information available to the pilot. "Party line" information is gleaned by flight crews overhearing communications between ATC and other aircraft. In the datalink environment, <b>party</b> <b>line</b> information may not be available due to the use of discrete addressing. Information concerning the importance, availability, and accuracy of <b>party</b> <b>line</b> elements was explored through an opinion survey of active air carrier flight crews. The survey identified numerous important <b>party</b> <b>line</b> elements. These elements were scripted into a full-mission flight simulation. The flight simulation experiment examined the utilization of <b>party</b> <b>line</b> information by studying subject responses to the specific information elements. Some <b>party</b> <b>line</b> elements perceived as important were effectively utilized by flight crews in the simulated operational environment. However, other <b>party</b> <b>line</b> elements stimulated little or no increase in situational awareness. The ability to assimilate and use <b>party</b> <b>line</b> information appeared to be dependent on workload, time availability, and the tactical/strategic nature of the situations. In addition, the results of both the survey and the simulation indicated that the importance of <b>party</b> <b>line</b> information appeared to be greatest for operations near or on the airport. This indicates that caution must be exercised when implementing datalink communications in these high workload, tactical sectors. This document is based on the thesis of Alan H. Midkiff submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

Further, District Judge John Pickering was impeached and {{removed from office}} on a party-line vote. The following day, the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase, but six Democratic-Republicans crossed <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> in the Senate to prevent his conviction by a single vote.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{volatile}} issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone. The issue cut across <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission {{began its}} {{work and the}} {{proceedings}} were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford did not commute Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment. The vote was split along <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.|$|E

Gillibrand ran for a full six-year term in November 2012. In the general election, Gillibrand faced challenger Wendy E. Long, an attorney running on both the Republican Party and Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>lines.</b> Gillibrand was endorsed by The New York Times and the Democrat and Chronicle. She won the election with 72.2% of the vote, the largest victory margin for a statewide candidate in New York history, better than Schumer's 71.2% victory in 2004. She carried all counties except for two in western New York.|$|E

However, Coppola remained {{on the ballot in}} the general election on the Conservative Party of New York, Working Families Party and Green <b>Party</b> <b>lines.</b> The Republican Party nominee was the politically inexperienced Harrison R. Woolworth. Although Brown began the race without organized political support, he earned endorsements from many veteran non-Western New York politicians such as H.

5|$|Movies {{were popular}} in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over {{a billion people}} in 1942, 1943 and 1944. By 1934, German {{regulations}} restricting currency exports {{made it impossible for}} American film makers to take their profits back to America, so the major film studios closed their German branches. Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies, Universum Film AG and Tobis, were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> regarding themes and content. Scripts were pre-censored.|$|E

The issue cut across <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply. Owing to worldwide deflation in the late 19th century, however, a strict gold standard had resulted in reduction of incomes without the equivalent reduction in debts, pushing debtors and the poor to call for silver coinage as an inflationary measure.|$|E
5|$|Reddy was succeeded as President by Giani Zail Singh who {{was sworn}} in on 25 July 1982. In his {{farewell}} address to the nation, Reddy criticised the failure of successive governments in improving {{the lives of the}} Indian masses and called for the emergence of a strong political opposition to prevent governmental misrule. Following his presidential term, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka Ramakrishna Hegde invited Reddy to settle down in Bangalore but he chose to retire to his farm in Anantapur. He died of pneumonia in Bangalore in 1996 at the age of 83. His samadhi is at Kallahalli near Bangalore. The Parliament mourned Reddy's death on 11 June 1996 and members cutting across <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> paid him tribute and recalled his contributions to the nation and the House.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Fraser's accession, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} Whitlam government's actions {{in trying to}} restart peace talks in Vietnam. As the North prepared to end the civil war, Whitlam sent cables to both Vietnamese governments, telling Parliament that both cables were substantially the same. The Opposition contended he had misled Parliament, and a motion to censure Whitlam was defeated along <b>party</b> <b>lines.</b> The Opposition also attacked Whitlam for not allowing enough South Vietnamese refugees into Australia, with Fraser calling for the entry of 50,000. Freudenberg alleges that 1,026Vietnamese refugees entered Australia in the final eight months of the Whitlam government, and only 399 in 1976 under Fraser. However, by 1977, Australia had accepted over five thousand refugees.|$|E

5|$|The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges. The Senate {{refused to}} meet to hold an {{impeachment}} trial {{before the end of}} the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{investigation}} {{lasted from}} May 1911 to April 1912. At its conclusion, the committee split along <b>party</b> <b>lines.</b> Stanley authored the majority report which condemned alleged price fixing by U.S. Steel and censured President Theodore Roosevelt {{for his role}} in U.S. Steel's purchase of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. The minority report, authored by Republican Augustus P. Gardner, absolved Roosevelt and downplayed the price fixing charges. Stanley's report also recommended a number of changes to strengthen the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Though his recommendations were not enacted into law during his time in the House, many of them were eventually included in the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Senate's {{committees}} varies and {{has been the subject}} of debate. The work of the committees is frequently more consensual and less partisan than activity in the parliamentary chambers, and unanimous committee reports that agree recommendations across <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> are not uncommon. As a result, these recommendations may contribute to subsequent government policy announcements and occasionally to changes in government actions. The work of the regulations and ordinances committee has led to revisions of subordinate legislation in significant respects. Committee scrutiny of bills has contributed to them being amended or withdrawn. The impact of committees on legislation overall has however been described as 'rather limited', particularly as the committees that review bills are controlled by a government majority.|$|E
