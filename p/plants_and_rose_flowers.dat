Most of these disorders are characterized by stunting or dwarfing of plants accompanied by a partial wilt and dieback of shoots. Proliferation and epinasty often occurred.

It seems likely that rose degeneration disorders in spite of symptom similarities are due to a complex of interacting factors including probably viruses...|$|R
