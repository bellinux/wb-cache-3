Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the <b>power</b> <b>wiring</b> found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural <b>power</b> <b>wiring,</b> power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the large}} {{geometry}} of through-silicon-vias (TSVs) and their connections to the power grid, significant current crowding can oc-cur in 3 D ICs. Prior works model TSVs and <b>power</b> <b>wire</b> segments as single resistors, which cannot capture the detailed current distri-bution and may miss trouble spots associated with current crowd-ing. This paper studies DC current crowding {{and its impact on}} 3 D power integrity. First, we explore the current density distribution within a TSV and its <b>power</b> <b>wire</b> connections.
