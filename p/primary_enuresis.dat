50|$|In the United States, {{approximately}} 15 to 20 {{percent of}} 5 year old children will develop symptoms related to disorder. Prevalence changes significantly with age. To be more specific, about 33 percent of 5 year-olds, 25 percent of 7 year olds, 15 percent of 9 year olds, 8 percent of 11 year olds, 4 percent of 13 year-olds, and 3 percent of 15 to 17 year-olds. Numbers show that diurnal enuresis {{is much less}} common. Overall, about 60 percent of those suffering are male. However, this too depends on age. From ages 4 to 6, the number {{of boys and girls}} is about equal. However, the ratio changes so that by 11 years of age there are twice as many boys as girls. Incidence varies with social class with more incidences among those with low socioeconomic status. No evidence has been found related to ethnic differences. Approximately 85% of children with enuresis have <b>primary</b> <b>enuresis</b> because they have never maintained consistent bedwetting behaviors for at least 6 months.|$|E

40|$|This pre-specified sub-study of the {{desmopressin}} {{response in}} <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> study (DRIP study) evaluates the safety {{profile of the}} oral desmopressin tablet in children with <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b> Endpoints are adverse events and change in body mass index. The DRIP study was an open-label, intention-to-treat, phase IV, multi-national study. Overall, 936 patients were screened and 744 children aged 5 - 15 years with previously untreated <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> were eligible to receive the study medication desmopressin once daily as an oral tablet formulation. At each visit, adverse events were questioned and observed signs or symptoms were recorded. Overall, 222 (30 %) patients experienced 404 treatment-emergent adverse events. The proportion of patients experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events was similar regardless of patient gender or age. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were experienced in three system organ classes: gastrointestinal disorders; infections and infestations; and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and were considered unrelated to the study drug.

40|$|Objectives. Nocturnal {{enuresis}} {{has been}} associated with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing mostly in hospital-referred adults and children. To investigate whether <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> is significantly associated with habitual snoring in the general pediatric population irrespective of subjects' age and sex, we studied children attending six randomly selected schools in a city in central Greece. Methods. A questionnaire regarding the symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and the presence of nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting for at least one night per week) was answered by the children's parents. Results. A total of 1821 children (age 5 to 14 years; 896 girls) were included in the study. Of these, 135 (7. 4 %) were snoring more frequently than three nights per week (habitual snorers). The habitual snorers had a history of <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> more often than did nonhabitual snorers (7. 4 % versus 2 %; odds ratio 4. 00, 95 % confidence interval 1. 93 to 8. 32).

40|$|Objective: Nocturnal {{enuresis}} is {{a common}} developmental-behavioral problem in children. The present {{study was conducted to}} estimate the prevalence of <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> and to determine its impact on physical growth of the first grade elementary school children. Material & Methods: This is a cross-sectional study carried out on 350 first-grade children (6 to 6. 5 yr old) elementary schools in Gonabad through random stratified sampling. All children had <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b> A questionnaire containing demographic criteria and various factors that {{may play a role in}} bed-wetting was filled out; a digital scale and a non-expanding measuring tape were used to collect data. Diagnosis of enuresis considered nocturnal voiding twice a week for at least three consecutive months. Findings: The prevalence of <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> was 21 % for boys and 14. 9 % for girls, and the overall prevalence was 17. 5 %. The average weight of enuretic children was lower than that of the non-affected ones. In addition, these children were in average shorter compared to those without enuresis. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that growth failure is a coexisting problem in children with <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b> Since enuresis and other stressful conditions in family can cause growth failure in children, the treatment of enuresis eliminating a stressful condition could be an effective measure in improving childrens physical growth...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Nocturnal {{enuresis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common diagnoses in a pediatric clinic. Recently, linkage analysis revealed a 2 -point lod score of 4. 2 in 6 families with dominant <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> around the aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) water channel locus. Since <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> is ameliorated by desmopressin, AQP 2 expression is increased by desmopressin and AQP 2 is essential for concentrating urine, we determined whether a mutation in the AQP 2 gene could cause <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> in these families. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNAs of several patients from the 6 families were analyzed for disease causing mutations in the 4 exons of the AQP 2 genes. RESULTS: In 1 family a G to A transition in the intron 1 splice donor site was found but it was also found in healthy subjects. In another family a C to T transition in the intron 1 splice acceptor region was identified but it was often found in splice acceptor sites. In 2 families a C to T transition was identified in the coding region of exon 3 but this mutation did not lead to a changed amino acid. CONCLUSIONS: Since no mutation in the AQP 2 coding sequence was found, while this is essential for involvement in dominant <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis,</b> the AQP 2 gene is excluded as a candidate for autosomal dominant PNE in these families in which the disease co-segregates with chromosome 12 q...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Two {{percent of}} {{adolescents}} and young adults suffer from therapy-resistant enuresis, with considerable negative impact on self-esteem and relationships. We evaluated the effect of a Modulated Dry Bed Training (MDBT) in a previously therapyresistant group of adolescents with enuresis, provided by a specialized enuresis-centre. MATERIAL & METHODS: Descriptive, retrospective cohort study. Between January 2003 and July 2013, 907 patients were treated by MDBT: a 5 -days/ 4 -nights in-hospital group training consisting of enuresis-anamnesis, explanation, alarm treatment, day-time activities with the purpose of increasing self-esteem and group contact. Structured follow-up was performed by telephone contact. Patients data were collected from the medical files. At 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months success of treatment was determined using ICCS-definitions. Secondary measurements included use of medication after treatment. Sensitivity analyses were performed to control for missing values. Differences between the subgroups gender, age and degree of enuresis were tested by Chi-Square test. RESULTS: Patients were aged 11 - 42 years (median 15, IQR 3. 5), 34 % female. At baseline, 81 % had non-monosymptomatic enuresis, 65 % <b>primary</b> <b>enuresis,</b> and 46 % frequent enuresis (≥ 4 days/week). After 6 weeks, 46 % (CI 95 % 43 - 50) and 41 % of patients had a full or partial response, respectively. After 6 months this accounted for 68 % (CI 95 % 65 - 72) and 25 %.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of presence of desmopressin in treating <b>primary</b> <b>enuresis</b> (PE) for children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Materials and Methods. Children aged from 5 to 12 years with the chief complaint of PE treated with desmopressin were enrolled in pediatric urology clinics. The parent-reported SNAP-IV questionnaire was used to evaluate ADHD symptoms (cut-off value: 90 th percentile). Voiding symptoms were assessed by the Dysfunctional Voiding Scoring System (DVSS) questionnaire. The responses to desmopressin were analyzed in children with and without ADHD symptoms. Results. The study sample comprised 68 children; 27 (39. 7 %) presented with ADHD symptoms and 41 (60. 3 %) with non-ADHD symptoms. The children collected from a tertiary referral center may explain the high prevalence of ADHD symptoms in the present study. The total DVSS score in the ADHD symptoms group was significantly higher than in the non-ADHD symptoms group (7. 72 versus 5. 65, P= 0. 05). In the ADHD symptoms group, there were significantly higher score in the “pee 1 - 2 times/day” and “can’t wait” subscales of DVSS and lower sleep quality based on the Pediatric Sleep Quality questionnaire, as well as significantly lower peak flow rate and voided volume. The responses to desmopressin for enuresis were comparable between children with ADHD and non-ADHD symptoms. Conclusions. Approximately 39. 7 % of PE children presented with ADHD symptoms at urologic clinics. PE children with ADHD symptoms had higher risk of daytime LUTS and comparable response to desmopressin treatment for PE.

40|$|Background: Nocturnal {{enuresis}} {{is considered}} a common urological complaint especially among children. Respiratory obstructive diseases {{have been one of}} the possible etiologies of such a condition. The most common type of upper respiratory obstructive diseases in childhood is adenotonsillar hypertrophy. In this study, it was tried to estimate the prevalence of nocturnal enuresis in adenotonsillar hypertrophy as an upper obstructive airway disease and cure rate after corrective operation. Materials and Methods: In this longitudinal study, 184 children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy as case group and 200 healthy children as control group were randomly compared for nocturnal enuresis incidence and risk factors. Then they were followed after 6 months to estimate the cure rate after corrective operation. Results: In case group, nocturnal enuresis was more common than control group (26 % vs. 17 %, P = 0. 1). Factors which had a role in enuresis in case group were family history (P = 0. 03) and male sex (P = 0. 05). Three months after surgery, 48 % of children totally cured from enuresis (P = 0. 001) and 71 % cured both partially or totally (P = 0. 03). The response rate after moderate obstruction relieving was 100 % while that in severe cases was 60 % (P = 0. 2). Conclusions: Nocturnal enuresis due to upper obstructive airway disease occurs more in male and in the presence of family history. The cure rate after 6 months of operation was more prominent in moderate obstruction which suggests enuresis in severe airway obstruction may need a longer time to subside. Cure rate of <b>primary</b> <b>enuresis</b> due to obstructive airway disease after 6 months of relieving was 48 % in children over 5 years old...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis/aims {{of study}} Two percent of {{adolescents}} and adults suffers from enuresis. In this age group, social problems can arise. We evaluated {{the effect of}} a Modulated Dry Bed Training (MDBT) in a previously therapy-resistant group of adolescents and adults with enuresis, provided by a specialized enuresis-centre. Study design, materials and methods Descriptive, retrospective cohort study. Between January 2003 and July 2013, 907 patients were treated by MDBT: a 5 -days/ 4 - nights in-hospital training in small groups consisting of enuresis-anamnesis, explanation, alarm treatment, day-time activities with the purpose of increasing self-esteem and group contact. We contacted patients by phone during follow-up. Patient data were retrospectively derived from medical files and put in a database. Success of treatment was determined using International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) -definitions, at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcome was the medication use after treatment. Sensitivity analyses were performed to control for missing values, and expressed in a best case and a worst case scenario. Results Patients were aged 11 - 42 years (median 15, IQR 3. 5), 34 % female. At baseline, 65 % had <b>primary</b> <b>enuresis,</b> 81 % nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, and 46 % frequent enuresis (≥ 4 days/week). After 6 weeks, 46 % (CI 95 % 43 - 50) and 41 % of patients had a full or partial response, respectively. After 6 months this was 68 % (CI 95 % 65 - 72) and 25 %. Results from the sensitivity analysis are shown in the table. Interpretation of results The treatment response at six months can be considered to be quite high, as this is a formerly therapy-resistant group of enuresis patients. However, the sensitivity analysis shows that, owing to the large amount of missing values, the real number of patients having a full response after six months will lie between 43 % and 80 %. Concluding message MDBT was shown to have an adequate short term effect in therapy resistant adolescents and adults with enuresis. (Table Presented) ...|$|E
25|$|<b>Primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> (PNE) is {{the most}} common form of bedwetting. Bedwetting counts as a {{disorder}} once a child is old enough to stay dry, but continues either to average at least two wet nights a week with no long periods of dryness or to not sleep dry without being taken to the toilet by another person.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of two {{patients}} with multiple sclerosis (MS) and <b>primary</b> nocturn <b>enuresis</b> (PNE) treated with modafinil for MS-induced fatigue with improvement of enuretic episodes. As adult patients with PNE have {{a significant increase in}} the EEG delta power component during baseline sleep, compared with controls [9], we suggest that a change in enuretic patient sleep pattern, resulting from modafinil, may improve their symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Studies of {{desmopressin}} {{in children}} with <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> show a greater than 90 % decrease in wet nights in 20 % to 30 %, a 50 % to less than 90 % decrease in 20 % to 40 % and less than a 50 % decrease in up to 60 %. Insufficient response to desmopressin is attributable to various factors, including differences in the <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> definition, underlying bladder dysfunction and/or desmopressin pharmacokinetic characteristics. However, {{little attention has been}} given to poor compliance with therapy as a possible explanatory factor. For a drug with an effect duration limited to the night after administration a high degree of compliance is essential to ensure consistent therapeutic effects. Materials and Methods: This was a substudy of an international investigation of treatment for 6 months or less with desmopressin tablets {{in children with}} <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b> Medication was dispensed at each visit as required and collected at each subsequent visit. Compliance was determined by pill counts by study staff. Results: Compliance data were available on 723 patients. Of the patients 81 % to 91 % ingested all medication as instructed during the initial run-in phases. However, this decreased to 77 % and 71 % during the first and second 3 -month treatment periods, respectively. Conclusions: Patient motivation and compliance are generally stronger in clinical trials than in clinical practice. However, this study shows that some patients were poorly compliant with medication even at study initiation and only 71 % were fully compliant with long-term treatment. Decreased compliance was associated with a lower response rate. Patients should be encouraged to comply fully with treatment to achieve an optimal outcome...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> using DDAVP {{is based}} upon the {{hypothesis}} that antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion is insufficient at night. The known efficacy of the treatment on the one hand, and persisting doubts about its theoretical basis on the other, formed the background of the present study. Ten children (mean age 10. 5 years) with <b>primary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> were compared with a corresponding control group of eight patients. Diurnal and nocturnal urine production, ADH secretion, and plasma osmolality were determined. No {{differences between the two groups}} were found for urine production, ADH levels during day and night, or plasma osmolality. However, in order to regulate plasma osmolality the enuretic children required a markedly greater output of ADH: 2. 87 (95 % confidence interval 0. 091 to 40. 35) pg/ml/mmol/kg v 0. 56 (0. 08 to 1. 03) in the controls (p < 0. 01). The results are consistent with the established fact that ADH secretion is a function of plasma osmolality, and they contradict the hypothesis that urine production is increased at night in enuretics because of lower ADH secretion. The findings do not solve the uncertainties in the pathogenesis of enuresis but they suggest there might be a difference between enuretic children and controls at the ADH receptor level...|$|R
