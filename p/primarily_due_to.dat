5|$|Igman was {{included}} in the Sarajevo bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Despite Sarajevo being the only previous host city to bid, it was largely regarded as the weakest bid, <b>primarily</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its lack of infrastructure after the war.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{military}} veterans have a 25–50% {{higher rate}} of lung cancer <b>primarily</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> higher rates of smoking. During World War Two and the Korean War asbestos also played a part and Agent Orange may have caused some problems during the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen, {{like the}} alkali metals, has one valence {{electron}} and reacts easily with the halogens, but the similarities end {{there because of}} the small size of a bare proton H+ compared to the alkali metal cations. Its placement above lithium is <b>primarily</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its electron configuration. It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, Isis {{destroyed}} over 700houses {{and killed}} 14people; this is <b>primarily</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its heavy rainfall which peaked at over 20inches (500mm) in southern Baja California Sur.

5|$|In most fish, the {{esophagus}} is extremely short, <b>primarily</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the length of}} the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true stomach, so that {{the esophagus}} effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.|$|E
5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (blue light), 606nm (red light) and 814nm (near-infrared). Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is <b>primarily</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted {{at times when}} high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E

5|$|The Iron Duke-class {{ships were}} 622feet 9inches (189.9metres) long overall, {{and had a}} beam of 90ft (27.4m) and a draught of 29ft (8.8m).

This was some 2,000tons (2,032tonnes) heavier than the preceding King George Vs, and was <b>primarily</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the increase in calibre of the secondary battery.|$|E
5|$|The idea of token {{identity}} {{is that only}} particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events. Anomalous monism (see below) and most other non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories.

5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process {{was not one of}} the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project, and was developed independently by Philip H.
