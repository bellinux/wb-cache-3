5|$|Some of {{the best-known}} peninsulas in Ireland are in County Kerry; the Dingle <b>peninsula,</b> the {{aforementioned}} Iveragh <b>peninsula</b> and the Beara <b>peninsula.</b> The Ards <b>peninsula</b> {{is one of the}} larger peninsulas outside Kerry. The Inishowen <b>peninsula</b> in County Donegal includes Ireland's most northerly point, Malin Head and several important towns including Buncrana on Lough Swilly, Carndonagh and Moville on Lough Foyle. Ireland's most northerly land feature is Inishtrahull island, off Malin Head. Rockall Island may deserve this honour but its status is disputed, being claimed by the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Denmark (for the Faroe Islands) and Iceland. The most southerly point is the Fastnet Rock.|$|E

5|$|After the {{economic}} slump of the 1990s, {{the economy of}} the oblast started to rebound during {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, although at a rate below the country's average. Today the Kola <b>Peninsula</b> is the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia. The major port of the <b>peninsula</b> is Murmansk, which serves as the administrative center of Murmansk Oblast and does not freeze in winter. Although the strategic importance of the Kola <b>Peninsula</b> has diminished since the Cold War, the <b>peninsula</b> nevertheless still has the highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia, with the number of nuclear reactors alone exceeding any other region of the world.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower <b>Peninsula</b> and the eastern and western Upper <b>Peninsula,</b> with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region One, the southern Lower <b>Peninsula,</b> is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand, and deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region Two, the northern Lower <b>Peninsula,</b> has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in Region Two than Region One. Region Three, the eastern Upper <b>Peninsula,</b> has a climate profile similar to Region Two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, and tend to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region Four, the western Upper <b>Peninsula,</b> provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat {{is the loss}} of large sections of the Larsen Ice Shelf on the Antarctic <b>Peninsula.</b> The recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf, Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Mueller Ice Shelf, Jones Ice Shelf, Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice Shelf on the Antarctic <b>Peninsula</b> has raised awareness of how dynamic ice shelf systems are.|$|E
50|$|The {{main body}} of the island, known as Muttland, is {{surrounded}} by several <b>peninsulas.</b> To the north lie the <b>peninsulas</b> of Wittow and Jasmund, connected to each other by the Schaabe sandbar and to Muttland by the Schmale Heide, an embankment at Lietzow and the Wittow Ferry. The northern <b>peninsulas</b> are separated from Muttland by several lagoons or bodden, the largest of which are the Großer Jasmunder Bodden and Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden. Major <b>peninsulas</b> in the south are Zudar and Mönchgut which both face the Bay of Greifswald.|$|R
40|$|To {{provide a}} better {{understanding}} of hantavirus epidemiology in China, Korean field mice (Apodemus <b>peninsulae)</b> and striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) were captured in Jilin province, China, where haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic. Hantavirus antigens were detected in eight of the 130 A. <b>peninsulae</b> individuals and in four of the 193 A. agrarius individuals by using an immunofluorescence assay. Partial S and M segments were amplified from all of the antigen-positive samples. Furthermore, two hantaviruses (CJAp 89 and CJAp 93) were isolated successfully in cell culture and the entire S and M segments were amplified from one of them (CJAp 93). Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences (partial or complete) showed that hantaviruses carried by A. <b>peninsulae</b> and A. agrarius form two distinct lineages, although viruses carried by A. <b>peninsulae</b> are similar to those isolated previously from A. agrarius in China and from HFRS patients in Russia. However, the viruses detected in A. <b>peninsulae</b> in China are genetically different from those detected in A. <b>peninsulae</b> in other countries. These data suggest that A. <b>peninsulae</b> is also a natural host for HTNV in north-eastern China. Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a...|$|R

5|$|As {{implemented}} in October 1970, the CDH system {{is divided into}} eight zones: six in the Lower <b>Peninsula</b> and two in the Upper <b>Peninsula.</b> This contrasts to the state highway system that makes no attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each <b>peninsula.</b> Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, numbers are assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd numbers and east–west highways have even numbers. Lower numbers are used to the south or west sides of the zones.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{of modern}} human {{habitation}} in Malaysia dates back 40,000years. In the Malay <b>Peninsula,</b> the first inhabitants {{are thought to}} be Negritos. Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns {{in the second and third}} centuries. Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay <b>Peninsula</b> adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the fourth or fifth century. The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay <b>Peninsula,</b> lasting until about the 15th century. Between the 7th and 13th centuries, much of the southern Malay <b>Peninsula</b> was part of the maritime Srivijayan empire. By the 13th and the 14th century, the Majapahit empire had successfully wrested control over most of the <b>peninsula</b> and the Malay Archipelago from Srivijaya. Islam began to spread among Malays in the 14th century. In the early 15th century, Parameswara, a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the Malacca Sultanate. Melaka was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region.|$|E
