Yeast filtration through membranes depends on applied <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> and on slurry concentration. It was found that for a yeast volume fraction in suspension above 0. 06 the porosity of the yeast cake becomes weakly dependent on the suspension concentration. For highly diluted suspension the specific cake resistance approaches to the minimum value, which is sensitive to the <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure.</b> Correlation functions of the cake porosity and specific cake resistance were obtained in the investigated concentration range.

In the range of moderate yeast concentration, manipulation of <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> and of slurry concentration might increase the filtrate flux.

In hydropenia, average single nephron glomerular filtration rate was 29. 3 nl/min, glomerular hydrostatic pressure (stop-flow pressure + plasma colloid osmotic pressure) was 70 cm H 2 O and mean glomerular effective <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> was 12. 7 - 14. 3 cm H 2 O, approaching zero at the efferent {{end of the}} glomerulus. Thus, the glomerulus is extremely permeable, having a filtration coefficient {{four to five times}} greater than previously estimated. Mean effective <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> and single nephron glomerular filtartion rate fell with elevated ureteral pressure and rose with volume expansion, more or less proportionately. Changes in effective <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> were due primarily to increased intratubular pressure in ureteral obstruction and to reduced plasma colloid osmotic pressure in volume expansion; glomerular hydrostatic pressure remained constant in both conditions and thus played no role in regulation of filtration rate...|$|R

40|$|Pressure and vacuum {{filtration}} experiments using A 16 SG alumina {{with and without}} homogenization of formed cake and suspension are carried out. Homogenization involving mixing of formed cake with the suspension {{on top of the}} cake enhances filtration process performance in terms of reduction in filtration time without any alteration in the equilibrium solids volume fraction. A model is developed and validated based on the Mean-Phi model of <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> to simulate the filtration behavior in the presence of continuous and intermittent homogenization. It is demonstrated that a single batch <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> experiment is sufficient to provide the necessary information to simulate an enhanced <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> process involving homogenization.

Advantages regarding time and equilibrium solids fraction can be availed where homogenization along with change in the state of suspension aggregation by using additive(s) or pH change is carried out. Under such a scheme, a filtration process should start with a flocculated/aggregated condition along with mixing. With progress of the process, the suspension should be gradually converted to dispersed type by modulating the slurry chemistry, to achieve a maximum equilibrium solids volume fraction...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics of glomerular ultrafiltration: VI. Studies in the primate. Pressures {{and flows}} were {{measured}} in accessible surface glomeruli of the squirrel monkey {{under conditions of}} normal hydropenia. Mean glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and the mean glomerular transcapillary hydrostatic pressure difference (ΔP) averaged approximately 45 mm Hg and 35 mm Hg, respectively. These findings are in close accord with recent direct estimates in the rat. The net driving force for ultrafiltration was found to decline from a maximum value of about 12 mm Hg at the afferent end of the glomerular capillary network essentially to zero by the efferent end, indicating that, in the monkey as in the rat, <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> equilibrium is achieved under normal hydropenic conditions. The monkey differs from the rat in one important respect, however, in that, as has long been recognized, the monkey tends to have higher systemic total plasma protein concentrations (CA) than the rat. This is of interest since monkey, like man, is found to have lower filtration fractions than the rat. Since ΔP {{is found to be}} essentially similar in monkey and rat, and since, at <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> equilibrium, <b>filtration</b> fraction is determined by ΔP and CA, these observed differences in filtration fraction between rodent and primate must therefore be due to these differences in CA...|$|R

Contrary to normoten-sive subjects, there was no significant increase in the PAFP values with age in the hypertensives.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> is {{a generic}} {{manufacturing}} stage carried {{out across the}} process industry however unit efficiency and product quality are diminished {{by the lack of}} qualitative, real-time, monitoring techniques. This paper opens by outlining the control issues associated with <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> and introduces electrical impedance tomography (EIT) as a potential solution. To verify the feasibility of this approach an initial investigation was carried out on a commercial 1. 5 m 3 pressure filter. A description is given of the engineering challenges which were met and the areas which were compromised, in lieu of future development. Specific reference is made to operation within metal walled vessels, hazardous area implications, novel sensor array and interconnection design to facilitate retrofitting, measurement within an electrically noisy environment, materials of construction, multi-modal operation and the characteristic requirements on speed, spatial resolution and signal sensitivity dictated by the batch manufacturing industry. Selected pertinent images are presented and their ramifications for control are highlighted.

40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common solid-liquid {{separation}} techniques in use in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Typically pressure filtrations are conducted within the same unit operation as agitated drying, thus the opportunity to study the individual effects of filtration are often negated. Recent findings have shown <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> to be a major cause of particle breakage, which has consequences for product quality, bioavailability and downstream operations like formulation. A new method for the investigation of the effect of hydrodynamic stress on static crystals has been developed by continuously recirculating fluid through a bed of freshly crystallised particles. The method is compared to traditional batch <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> tests with good correlation between results. Levels of breakage of needle-like glutamic acid crystals are found to increase with rises in pressure and fluid flow rate. Particle size and shape data obtained from optical microscopy is critically analysed in order to determine the type and extent of crystal breakage. Automated methods have also been developed to filter particle data in order to provide a more representative measurement. Small-scale centrifugal testing of particle beds has been conducted with an analytical photo-centrifuge. Needle-like crystal beds are found to consolidate to greater extents than more rounded particles, and also show evidence of inelastic behaviour. The more isometric particles conversely display elastic behaviour in response to the application of stress. Modelling of particle data has simulated algorithmic breakage events to predict the breakage observed under <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration,</b> with good agreement between modelled and experimental particle size distributions. The structure of particle beds has also been modelled by generation of simulated needle-beds from particle length data...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> and vacuum {{agitated}} drying on cellobiose octaacetate (COA) particles in methanol slurries were studied by making Raman measurements {{through the glass}} wall {{at the side of}} a filter drier beneath the oil jacket. The change in intensity of methanol peaks in the spectra allowed the removal of the solvent from the particle bed to be monitored. Also, drying curves for COA generated from the Raman measurements gave an indication of the changing physical status of the particle bed during continuous or intermittent agitation. The intensity of the Raman signal for COA depended on the bulk density of the particle bed, which changed due to aggregation and attrition that occurred during solvent removal and particle motion induced by agitation during vacuum drying. Loss on drying (LOD) measurements of samples removed {{at the end of the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> and vacuum agitated drying stages established the degree of wetness and confirmed the end point of drying (< 0. 5 % w/w solvent), respectively. Dynamic image analysis confirmed that minimum attrition of COA was achieved when (a) the majority of the methanol was removed during <b>pressure</b> <b>filtration</b> at 0. 5 bar N 2 and (b) intermittent agitation was applied during the vacuum drying stage...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Data are {{reported}} on particulate and process variables which influence {{the formation of}} compressible filter cakes. Variables such as surface charge, particle size and size distribution, <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> and solids concentration have been investigated.

The majority of the results from these tests are shown through solids concentration profiles as functions of suspension/cake height and time, and specific cake resistance and porosity as functions of pressure.

For a yeast volume fraction above 0. 06 (∼ 21. 8 kg/m 3), the porosity of the yeast cake is {{less dependent on}} the suspension concentration. For highly diluted suspensions, the specific cake resistance approaches a minimum {{that depends on the}} <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure.</b> Correlation functions of cake porosity and specific cake resistance were obtained for the concentration range investigated showing that the Kozeny–Carman coefficient increases when the applied <b>pressure</b> increases. Both <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> and slurry concentration can be process controlled. In the range of moderate yeast concentration, the filtrate flux may be increased by manipulating the <b>filtration</b> <b>pressure</b> and the slurry concentration, thereby improving the overall process efficiency. The complex behavior of yeast cakes at high slurry concentration can be described by a conventional model as long as part of yeast cells are assumed to form aggregates, which behave as single bigger particles.

40|$|A rapid, {{reliable}} and cheap method of characterizing the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) {{of commercial and}} in-house fabricated membranes used in aqueous applications has been developed. MWCO can be determined by performing a single run of <b>pressure</b> <b>filtrations</b> {{with a mixture of}} polyethylene glycols (PEGs) in aqueous solution using one of two PEG oligomer mixtures: PEG 200 to PEG 1000 for nanofiltration membranes or PEG 1000 to PEG 6000 for low MWCO ultrafiltration membranes. Analysis is via a repeatable and accurate reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method through a cheap chemical-bonded silica-based C 8 column which finely resolves each of the PEG oligomers. Detection is via a low temperature evaporative light scanning detection (ELSD) method that resolves peaks to a molecular weight difference of just 44 gmol- 1 (corresponding to the CH 2 -O-CH 2 structural unit difference between the oligomers), allowing the most precise ever one-filtration determination of MWCO. MWCO testing of commercially available membranes (from Koch, Filmtec and Hydranautics) confirmed the method gives MWCO in the expected range. Consequently, this new and refined method can effectively replace the previously required time consuming and costly multiple filtrations of individual PEG oligomers and other compounds for the determination of membrane MWCO for aqueous applications...|$|R
