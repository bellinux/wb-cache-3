5|$|Greed has {{sometimes}} been said to be over 100 reels long. Stroheim said that his initial edit was 42 reels, although several of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> this cut remembered it as being anywhere from 42 to 47 reels. Grant Whytock remembered the edited version that Stroheim initially sent to him as between 26 and 28 reels. MGM's official studio files list the original cut of the film at 22 reels. As recently as 1992, former MGM Story Editor Samuel Marx erroneously claimed that the original version of Greed was 70 reels.|$|E
5|$|When King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without {{surviving}} legitimate issue, William succeeded him as King William IV. Aged 64, he was {{the oldest}} person yet to assume the British throne. Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended {{to spend most of}} his time in Windsor Castle, William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton. Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing, he was very popular among the <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> him as more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.|$|E
5|$|Winehouse's {{battles with}} {{substance}} abuse were {{the subject of much}} media attention. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. In various interviews, she admitted to having such problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E

25|$|By this time, {{the body}} of the creatures had become finely evolved. There was already the {{distinction}} between male and female. The man became preoccupied with women and vice versa. Then, as they were deeply attracted to each another, passion and desire was aroused, and they engaged in sexual relationships. The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> a couple engaged in sexual activity scolded them, and usually the couple were forbidden from entering the village for a certain period of time. Owing to this, the indulgent couples built closed dwellings where they indulged in sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|During the {{turbulent}} 1960s, Phi Delta Theta {{along with other}} social fraternities dealt with strong anti-fraternity sentiment from <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the Greek lettered communities as old world established institutions. This sentiment was not without reason. Although Phi Delta Theta attempted to revise its restrictive membership codes {{in the wake of}} World War II, as late as 1961 the national office made headlines by rejecting the pledge of a Jewish student at Lake Forest College. Later that same year the University of Wisconsin banned Phi Delta Theta from campus for barring Jews, African-Americans, and other minorities from membership.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} Canada's centennial year in 1967, Prime Minister Pearson {{announced}} his intention to step down, and Trudeau entered {{the race for the}} Liberal leadership. His energetic campaign attracted massive media attention and mobilized many young <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> Trudeau as a symbol of generational change. Going into the leadership convention, Trudeau was the front-runner and a clear favourite with the Canadian public. However, many Liberals still had reservations given that he joined the Liberal Party in 1965 and that his views, particularly those on divorce, abortion, and homosexuality, were seen as radical and opposed by a substantial segment of the party. During the convention, prominent Cabinet Minister Judy LaMarsh was caught on television profanely stating that Trudeau wasn't a Liberal.|$|E

He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in a back room of the hotel. He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets. Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the burned and blackened bodies were only able to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart by their size. They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and photographed. Three Glenrowan people held hostage inside the hotel died during the siege.|$|E
25|$|Other {{actions were}} {{believed}} to offend fairies. Brownies {{were known to be}} driven off by being given clothing, though some folktales recounted that they were offended by inferior quality of the garments given, and others merely stated it, some even recounting that the brownie was delighted with the gift and left with it. Other brownies left households or farms because they heard a complaint, or a compliment. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the fairies were advised not to look closely, because they resented infringements on their privacy. The need to not offend them could lead to problems: one farmer found that fairies threshed his corn, but the threshing continued after all his corn was gone, and he concluded that they were stealing from his neighbors, leaving him the choice between offending them, dangerous in itself, and profiting by the theft.|$|E
25|$|As Nixon {{began his}} second term, {{the economy was}} plagued by a stock market crash and a surge in inflation. With the {{legislation}} authorizing price controls set to expire on April 30, the Senate Democratic Caucus recommended a 90-day freeze on all profits, interest rates, and prices. Nixon re-imposed price controls in June 1973, echoing his 1971 plan, as food prices rose; this time, he focused on agricultural exports and limited the freeze to 60 days. The price controls became unpopular with the public and business <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy. Business owners, however, now saw the controls as permanent rather than temporary, and voluntary compliance among small businesses decreased. The controls and the accompanying food shortages—as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss—only fueled more inflation. Despite their failure to rein in inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed. Ultimately, inflation would rise to 12.1% {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E

25|$|Granger {{returned}} to civilian life and {{was pleased to}} discover his parents had curbed their drinking and were treating each other more civilly. Goldwyn increased his weekly salary to $200 and presented him with a 1940 Ford Coupe. The actor was introduced to Saul Chaplin and his wife Ethel, who became his lifelong mentor, confidante and best friend. Through the couple, Granger met Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein and Gene Kelly, who invited him to join his open house gatherings that included Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Frank Sinatra, Betty Garrett, Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen and Stanley Donen. Most influential among his new acquaintances was director Nicholas Ray, who cast Granger in his film noir Thieves Like Us. The film was nearing completion in October 1947 when Howard Hughes acquired RKO Radio Pictures, and the new studio head shelved it {{for two years before}} releasing it under the title They Live by Night in a single theater in London. Enthusiastic reviews led RKO to finally release the film in the States in late 1949. During the two years it had remained in limbo, it had been screened numerous times in private screening rooms, and one of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> it during this period was Alfred Hitchcock, who was preparing Rope.|$|E
25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the Russo-Japanese War (1904/05), Japanese {{influence}} replaced Russia's in Inner Manchuria. During the war with Russia, Japan had mobilized one million soldiers to fight in Manchuria, meaning that one out of every eight families in Japan had a member fighting the war. During the Russian-Japanese war, the losses were heavy with Japan losing half-million men dead or wounded, making Manchuria into a sacred land for the Japanese people, a place hallowed with the blood of so many Japanese soldiers. From time of the Russian-Japanese war onward, many Japanese people came to have a proprietary attitude to Manchuria, taking the viewpoint that a land where so much Japanese blood had been lost in some way now belonged to them. In 1906, Japan laid the South Manchurian Railway to Port Arthur (Japanese: Ryojun). Under the terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Kwantung Army had the right to occupy southern Manchuria while the region fell into the Japanese economic sphere of influence. The Japanese owned South Manchurian Railroad company had a market capitalization of 200 million yen, making it into Asia's largest corporation, which went beyond just running the former Russian railroad network in southern Manchuria to owning the ports, mines, hotels, telephone lines, and sundry other businesses, dominating the economy of Manchuria. With the growth of the South Manchuria Railroad company went growth in number of Japanese living in Manchuria from 16, 612 Japanese civilians in 1906 to 233,749 in 1930. The majority of the blue collar employees for the Mantetsu were Chinese, and the Japanese employees were mostly white collar, meaning the most of the Japanese living in Manchuria were middle-class <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> themselves as an elite. Between World War I and World War II Manchuria became a political and military battleground between Russia, Japan, and China. Japan moved into Outer Manchuria as a result of the chaos following the Russian Revolution of 1917. A combination of Soviet military successes and American economic pressure forced the Japanese to withdraw from the area, however, and Outer Manchuria returned to Soviet control by 1925.|$|E

500|$|As {{originally}} envisioned, {{the purchase}} would have encompassed {{a much larger}} region, extending far enough south to include most of the current Mexican states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas.
