50|$|A review from Wolverhampton University {{identified}} the several criticisms of <b>pre-pack</b> sales. There {{is a general}} concern that the <b>pre-pack</b> administrator, in agreeing to the <b>pre-pack</b> {{in consultation with the}} company’s management team (and usually its secured creditors), favours the interests of the managers and secured creditors ahead of those of the unsecured creditors. The speed and secrecy of the transaction often lead to a deal being executed, about which the unsecured creditors know nothing and offers them little or no return.|$|E

5000|$|Pre-packaged {{insolvency}} (a [...] "pre-pack") {{is a kind}} {{of bankruptcy}} procedure, where a restructure plan is agreed in advance of a company declaring its insolvency. In the United States <b>pre-packs</b> are often used in a Chapter 11 filing. In the United Kingdom, <b>pre-packs</b> have become popular since the Enterprise Act 2002, which has made administration the dominant insolvency procedure. Such arrangements are also available in Canada under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act.|$|R

50|$|The reasons an {{administrator}} sells on a <b>pre-pack</b> basis, rather than after post-appointment marketing, vary from case to case, {{but they often}} involve the following considerations. A <b>pre-pack</b> sale avoids the costs of trading (which means creditors receive more back), and indeed, {{the company and the}} administrator may not have the funds to trade. It also avoids the administrator taking on the risks associated with trading. The value of the business may deteriorate during administration trading.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate <b>pre-packing</b> cooling and types of packages in the maintenance of the physiological quality of soybean seeds during storage. The completely randomized experimental design was used, with four replications, considering a factorial arrangement involving or not the <b>pre-packing</b> cooling of the seed mass, three types of packages (multi-layer paper bag, big bag, and polyethylene container), and five storing periods (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 months). The physiological quality was evaluated by the tests of first germination count, germination, accelerated aging, electrical conductivity, emergence speed index and emergence. The use of packages with larger amount of seeds (big bag and polyethylene container) did not favor the maintenance of the <b>pre-packing</b> cooling temperature. The types of packages did not show significant differences in the seeds viability during storage, up to eight months, regardless the <b>pre-packing</b> cooling. The cultivars seeds showed different tolerance to storing, i. e. seeds of the cultivar TMG 1176 had lower storing potential comparing to the seeds from the cultivar SYN 9074...|$|R

50|$|A <b>pre-pack</b> {{administration}} offers {{quite a few}} advantages but it {{also has}} a downside. The main benefit is the 'continuity' of the business - the company is protected by the Court. This gets rid of debts and contracts. It does not get rid of employees due to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006|TUPE. Another big advantage is that the cost of the process is lower than trading administration, as the administrators do not need to find funding to trade the business. The downside of a <b>pre-pack</b> administration is that it can attract negative publicity if the former directors are seen to be shedding liabilities.|$|E

40|$|Fashion discounters {{face the}} problem of {{ordering}} {{the right amount of}} pieces in each size of a product. The product is ordered in <b>pre-packs</b> containing a certain size-mix of a product. For this so-called lot-type design problem, a stochastic mixed integer linear programm was developed, in which price cuts serve as recourse action for oversupply. Our goal is to answer the question, whether the resulting supply strategy leads to a supply that is significantly more consistent with the demand for sizes compared to the original manual planning. Since the total profit is influenced by too many factors unrelated to sizes (like the popularity of the product, the weather or a changing economic situation), we suggest a comparison method which excludes many outer effects by construction. We apply the method to a real-world field study: The improvements in the size distributions of the supply are significant. Comment: 5 pages, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|High patient {{load and}} understaffing {{in public health}} care {{facilities}} preclude the provision of optimal pharmaceutical services in South Africa. A Service Learning in Pharmacy (SLIP) programme for the University of the Western Cape's final year pharmacy students was implemented in health care facilities to assist in service provision. Students rotated between a pharmacotherapy (patient-oriented) and pharmaceutical formulation (product-oriented) activities to develop skills in prescription analysis, manufacturing and packaging of hospital pharmaceuticals. Structured focus group sessions were held with students and pharmacists to assess the integrated service learning experiences. Student feedback was positive, as the 'real world' experiences enabled them to adapt to intense work pressures, developed a sense of 'personal responsibility' towards patient health and they were sensitized to issues of social injustice. Students became competent in prescription analyses, counseling on medication use, manufacturing and <b>pre-packing</b> procedures. Pharmacists fully supported increased student involvement in the health services. Service learning in pharmacy schools is needed to contextualize learning and to address health care needs in South Africa...|$|R
50|$|A <b>pre-pack</b> is {{the process}} of selling the assets of a company {{immediately}} after it has entered administration. It is sometimes the case that the previous directors or management purchase the assets of the company from the administrator and set up a new company.|$|E

[...] Criticism of this nature had been levelled at <b>pre-pack</b> sales by John Moulton of Alchemy Partners in January 2009, saying 'Pre-packs could be very easily abused. Bad management can plan for a prepack months in advance, line up an administrator - and then be back running the business immediately. It means when retailers fail they are often being kept with the same directors when it would be much healthier if new management arrived and with fresh money to invest".|$|E
40|$|With {{respect to}} the Food Labelling Ordinance of the FRG, a report is given from {{practice}} on the minimum durability.

Nutritive value, enjoyment value and usefulness determine their properties. The enjoyment value, i. e. shape, colour, smell, taste and consistency, is of particular interest to the customer. Even with a relatively low designated traffic limit, which allows noticeable impairments of the sensory properties and slight faults, only a few of the product batches investigated reached the "best before" (minimum durability) date without clear losses of their enjoyment value. The majority of the foods investigated had an overstreched "best before" dating.

40|$|The {{intention}} to cool refined sugar prior to <b>pre-packing</b> at Hulett Refineries prompted {{an investigation into}} the influence that cooled sugar at 32 'C would have on the performance of the conditioning silo. A number of batch tests were conducted using two pilot conditioning silos arranged in parallel and assembled such that the conditioning air and silo temperature could be changed and accurately maintained. During each test the sugar and conditioning air temperatures and moisture profiles were monitored and caking tests were conducted. The conditioning times for various combinations of sugar and air temperatures were determined. The results showed that for cooled sugar and air of the same temperature, conditioning time is extended by 25 %, whilst conditioning cooled sugar at a higher air temperature results in caking taking place within the silo. It is concluded that both sugar and air conditioning temperatures ofat least 40 'C are required to achieve the optimum conditioning time of 72 hours. Large temperature differences between the sugar and conditioning air should be avoided to prevent caking within the silo...|$|R
