5|$|Isolationist <b>Paraguay</b> {{was more}} {{difficult}} to win over. Brazil made the initial overtures, becoming the first country to formally recognise Paraguayan independence in 1844. This soon led {{to the establishment of}} excellent diplomatic relations. The Brazilian ambassador in <b>Paraguay,</b> Pimenta Bueno, became a private councilor to President Carlos Antonio López. A defensive alliance was signed on 25 December 1850 between Brazil and <b>Paraguay,</b> in which López agreed to supply the Empire with horses for its army. But <b>Paraguay</b> refused to contribute troops to fight Rosas, believing that Justo José Urquiza (who had invaded Uruguay in 1839 and in 1845), the ruler of the Argentine Entre Rios province, secretly wished to annex <b>Paraguay.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three {{months after}} the {{creation}} of the Primera Junta, Manuel Belgrano was appointed Chief Commander of an army sent to gather support at Corrientes, Santa Fe, <b>Paraguay,</b> and the Banda Oriental. A few days later his goal was made more specific: he must aim for <b>Paraguay.</b> The Junta had been informed that the patriotic party was strong, and a small army would suffice to take control. Trusting this information, Belgrano went to <b>Paraguay</b> with two possible goals: get acknowledgment for the Junta in <b>Paraguay</b> or promote a new government that would stay on friendly terms with Buenos Aires. Belgrano was unaware that on 24 July a general assembly in <b>Paraguay</b> discussed the Junta of Buenos Aires, and decided to reject it and pledge allegiance to the Regency Council of Spain.|$|E

Chavez tried to woo the president with promises to fill <b>Paraguay's</b> imported oil gap. President Lugo has supported Venezuela's entry into Mercosur; however, the Colorado Party's influence in <b>Paraguay's</b> Congress and Senate retards this expansion.|$|R

5|$|Bert Patenaude was {{the first}} player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, on 17 July 1930 against <b>Paraguay.</b> However, until 10 November 2006 the first hat-trick that FIFA {{acknowledged}} had been scored by Guillermo Stábile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude. In 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as teammate Tom Florie's goal in the match against <b>Paraguay</b> was reattributed to him.|$|E

5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{native to}} {{tropical}} northern and central South America. It {{is present in the}} drainages of the Orinoco River, the São Francisco River and the Amazon River, and {{the upper reaches of the}} Paraná River and the <b>Paraguay</b> River. The countries in which it is found include Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia and <b>Paraguay.</b> The range of this species is rather larger than that of the sympatric smooth-fronted caiman, as it extends into <b>Paraguay</b> and includes a larger area of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|<b>Paraguay</b> is a {{landlocked}} country and {{for much of}} its history it was difficult of access, except by sailing from the Atlantic up the River Paraná and hence the River <b>Paraguay</b> (see map) as the early Spanish explorers had done. There were other means of ingress, but they would have required an invading force to be resupplied through difficult and hostile country. So the command of the river was key {{to the security of}} <b>Paraguay,</b> who feared and distrusted its two much larger neighbours Brazil and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The Jesuits in the Chiquitania had a {{secondary}} objective, {{which was to}} secure a more direct route to Asunción than the road then being used via Tucumán and Tarija to link the Chiquitania with the Jesuit missions in <b>Paraguay.</b> The missionaries in Chiquitos founded their settlements increasingly further east, towards the <b>Paraguay</b> River, while those south of Asunción {{moved closer to the}} <b>Paraguay</b> River by establishing their missions increasingly farther north, thereby avoiding the impassable Chaco region. Although Ñuflo de Chávez had attempted a route through the Chaco on an expedition as early as 1564, subsequent Jesuit explorations from Chiquitos (e.g. in 1690, 1702, 1703, and 1705) were unsuccessful. The Jesuits were stopped by the hostile Payaguá and Guaycuru tribes, and by the impenetrable swamps of Jarayes. In 1715, de Arce, the co-founder of the first mission in San Xavier, set out from Asunción on the <b>Paraguay</b> River with the Flemish priest Fr. Bartolomé Blende. Payaguá warriors killed Blende during the journey, but de Arce struggled on to reach San Rafael de Velasco in the Chiquitania. On the return trip to Asunción he too was killed in <b>Paraguay.</b> Not until 1767, when the missions had encroached sufficiently on the hostile region and just before the Jesuits were expelled from the New World, did Fr. José Sánchez Labrador manage to travel from Belén in <b>Paraguay</b> to Santo Corazón, the easternmost Chiquitos mission.|$|E

5|$|The League {{failed to}} prevent the 1932 war between Bolivia and <b>Paraguay</b> over the arid Gran Chaco region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it {{contained}} the <b>Paraguay</b> River, which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean, {{and there was also}} speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum. Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio López at Lake Pitiantuta. <b>Paraguay</b> appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the Pan-American Conference offered to mediate instead. The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for <b>Paraguay,</b> whose population was approximately one million. It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on 12 June 1935, <b>Paraguay</b> had seized control of most of the region, as was later recognised by the 1938 truce.|$|E
5|$|The allies invaded <b>Paraguay</b> in April 1866, {{but their}} advance by land {{was blocked by}} fortifications at Humaitá and naval forces faced the {{obstacle}} of entrenched defenses along the <b>Paraguay</b> River. The Progressive cabinet decided to create a unified command over Brazilian land and naval forces operating in <b>Paraguay.</b> It entrusted the command to Caxias, who in turn requested that Joaquim Inácio head the Brazilian fleet in <b>Paraguay.</b> On 22 December, Joaquim Inácio replaced his close friend Vice-Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then-Baron and later Marquis of Tamandaré) as fleet commander. For the sake of appearances, the new position was nominally pro tempore, since Tamandaré had virtually been forced to resign. On 5 February 1867, Joaquim Inácio was promoted to vice-admiral (equivalent to present-day squadron vice-admiral), and sixteen days later he was made permanent commander-in-chief.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} to <b>Paraguay</b> {{was a complete}} military defeat for Belgrano. However, {{the aftermath of the}} conflict led the Paraguayans to replace Belazco with a local junta, and declare independence from Spain. Under the rule of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, <b>Paraguay</b> broke ties with Buenos Aires as well, and stayed isolated for several years afterwards.|$|E
