40|$|Background—Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) {{is widely}} used {{for the removal of}} stones from the bile duct, but stones recur in about one fifth of patients.  Aims—To {{investigate}} hepatic clearance by quantitative cholescintigraphy (QC) in patients after EST and to discern the relationship between biliary emptying and stone recurrence.  Methods—One hundred and forty nine patients who had EST and clearance of the bile duct for choledocholithiasis were selected. All patients were confirmed to have complete EST by sphincter of Oddi manometry and underwent QC soon after normalisation of liver function. Regular clinical follow up was performed for each patient.  Results—During a mean 36 month follow up, 22 (14. 8 %) patients developed recurrent stones in the bile duct. Irrespective of the status of the gall bladder, patients with recurrent stones had a slower hepatic clearance of radioisotope during QC compared with patients without stone recurrence, but only the differences in cholecystectomised patients had statistical significance. After carrying out multivariate analysis, one parameter of QC, <b>percentage</b> <b>clearance</b> of maximal count at 45 minutes, was found to be the only significant factor for stone recurrence. All recurrent stones in the common bile duct were successfully removed at endoscopy.  Conclusion—Slower hepatic clearance as shown by QC is an important factor responsible for stone recurrence after sphincter ablation. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the value of {{radionuclide}} esophageal transit time (RET) in prediction of the results of pneumatic dilation in patients with achalasia. Patients and methods: Thirty patients (13 males) with a mean age of 37 &#x 00 B 1; 15. 6 years (range 17 - 73 years) were included in the study. All patients were diagnosed to have idiopathic achalasia of the cardia and selected for pneumatic dilation. Each patient had three RET, two the same day of dilation (pre-and postdilation) and a third follow up one within three months of dilation (4 patients failed to come for follow up and were excluded). Results: Several parameters were derived from RET studies, T/ 50 : time required for 50 &#x 0025; of activity in the esophagus to be cleared, T/ 10 : time required for 90 &#x 0025; of activity in the esophagus to be cleared and <b>percentage</b> <b>clearance</b> at 10 min.

40|$|Background: High dose {{interferon}} {{induction treatment}} of hepatitis C viral infection blocks viral production over 95 %. Since dose reduction is often performed due to clinical considerations, {{the effect of}} dose reduction on hepatitis C virus kinetics was studied. Methods: A new model that allowed longitudinal changes in the parameters of viral dynamics was used {{in a group of}} genotype- 1 patients (N = 15) with dose reduction from 10 to 3 million units of interferon daily in combination with ribavirin, in comparison to a control group (N = 9) with no dose reduction. Results: Dose reduction gave rise to a complex viral kinetic pattern, which could be only explained by a decrease in interferon effectiveness in blocking virion production. The benefit of the rapid initial viral decline following the high induction dose is lost after dose reduction. In addition, in some patients also the second phase viral decline slope, which is highly predictive of success of treatment, was impaired by the dose reduction resulting in smaller <b>percentage</b> of viral <b>clearance</b> in the dose reduction group.

We {{examined the effects of}} IGF- 1 on hepatic damage and function (transaminases, <b>percentage</b> of sulfobromophthalein <b>clearance</b> in bile and vascular resistance). We also studied other factors associated with the poor tolerance of fatty livers to cold ischemia reperfusion injury such as mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and mitogen-activated protein kinases. RESULTS: Steatotic livers preserved in IGL- 1 ® solution supplemented with IGF- 1 showed lower transaminase levels, increased bile clearance and a reduction in vascular resistance when compared to those preserved in IGL- 1 ® solution alone. These benefits are mediated by activation of AKT and constitutive endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), as well as the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α.

40|$|Background. Congenital and {{acquired}} vascular lesions {{of the skin}} and subcutis are a common health problem from aesthetic and also from psycho-social point of view. However, recent advances in laser technology have enabled an efficient and safe treatment. This study presents our experience with treatment of cutaneous vascular lesions using modern laser systems. Most common benign cutaneous vascular lesions are described. Patients and methods. In years 2002 and 2003, 109 patients, 4 to 80 (mean 39) years old, Fitzpatrick skin type 1 – 4, with 210 benign cutaneous vascular lesions were treated using the Dualis VP® laser system (Fotona, Slovenia) which incorporates the KTP and Nd:YAG lasers. Vascular lesions in the upper layers of the skin with diameter up to 1  mm were treated with the KTP laser (wavelength 532 nm). For larger vessels in deeper layer we used the Nd:YAG laser (wavelength 1064 nm). Patients graded the pain during treatment {{on a scale of}} 1 – 10. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 1 – 3 months after the last treatment: according to the <b>percentage</b> of <b>clearance</b> of the lesion compared to the adjacent normal skin and for the presence of adverse effects. According to these criteria each lesion was assigned a score: poor (0 – 25 %), fair (26 – 50 %), good (51 – 75 %), excellent (76 – 100 %). Results. Immediate response after application of a laser beam with proper characteristics was whitish-grey discoloration of treated area. Treatment results after 1 – 3 months were excellent in 48. 1 %, good 40. 9 %, fair in 8. 6 % and poor in 2. 4 %. Patients without prior anaesthesia graded pain during treatment from 1 to 8 (mean 4. 0) and patients with EMLA® anaesthesia from 1 to 6 (mean 2. 6). Side effects were frequent but minimal and transient. Erythema disappeared in several days after treatment while crusting persisted for 14 days. 3 permanent hyperpigmentations, 2 permanent hypopigmentations, 2 hypertrophic scars and 1 beam sized atrophic scar were detected at last follow-up visit. Conclusions. In addition to clinical experience and correct diagnosis of the lesion, at least two lasers with different wavelengths are necessary for safe and efficient treatment of various cutaneous vascular lesions. The combination of the KTP (532 nm) and Nd: YAG (1064 nm) lasers incorporated in the Dualis VP® system offers great possibilities for treatment of various vascular anomalies on face, lower limbs, as well as other regions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a risk}} factor for respiratory infections, and one of its main components is particulate matter (PM), which is comprised of a number of particles that contain iron, such as coal fly ash (CFA). Since free iron concentrations are extremely low in airway surface liquid (ASL), we hypothesize that CFA impairs antimicrobial peptides (AMP) function and can be a source of iron to bacteria. We tested this hypothesis in vivo by instilling mice with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA 01) and CFA and determine the <b>percentage</b> of bacterial <b>clearance.</b> In addition, we tested bacterial clearance in cell culture by exposing primary human airway epithelial cells to PA 01 and CFA and determining the AMP activity and bacterial growth in vitro. We report that CFA is a bioavailable source of iron for bacteria. We show that CFA interferes with bacterial clearance in vivo and in primary human airway epithelial cultures. Also, we demonstrate that CFA inhibits AMP activity in vitro, which we propose as a mechanism of our cell culture and in vivo results. Furthermore, PA 01 uses CFA as an iron source with a direct correlation between CFA iron dissolution and bacterial growth. CFA concentrations used are very relevant to human daily exposures, thus posing a potential public health risk for susceptible subjects. Although CFA provides a source of bioavailable iron for bacteria, not all CFA particles have the same biological effects, and their propensity for iron dissolution is an important factor. CFA impairs lung innate immune mechanisms of bacterial clearance, specifically AMP activity.

The pumpage of dialysis machine in the first session was put on 200 ml/min and in the second session on 250 ml/min. During the hemodialysis, the hemodynamic status and vital signs of patient’s were controlled. When hemodialysis finished a blood sample was taken from the artery set, in a section before dialyzer (4 blood sample for each patients), weight was controlled again and the sample was sent to a laboratory for urea control. Then the efficiency of dialysis was determined. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used for analysis of the data. Results: Results showed the mean KT/V (K=Clearance dialyzer T= Time V=Volume of distribation of urea) of patients whose pumping cycle were 200 ml/min, had 0. 943 ± 0. 335 and URR (Urea Reduction Ratio) 53. 3 ± 13. 5 wereas mean KT/V patients with 250 pumping cycle had 1. 195 ± 0. 45 and URR 60. 17 ± 10. 47. Paired t-test with % 95 confidence interval showed that there was a significant difference in dialysis efficiency between the two groups (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Our data suggests that increasing blood flow rate by 25 % of previous flow rate is effective in achieving higher dialysis adequacy in hemodialysis patients...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundFalls {{sustained}} when descending stairs are {{the leading}} cause of accidental death in older adults. Highly visible edge highlighters/friction strips (often set back from the tread edge) are sometimes used to improve stair safety, but there is no evidence for the usefulness of either. ObjectiveTo determine whether an edge highlighter and its location relative to the tread edge affect foot placement/clearance and accidental foot contacts when descending stairs. MethodSixteen older adults (mean± 1 SD age; 71 ± 7 years) with normal vision (experiment 1) and eight young adults (mean± 1 SD age; 24 ± 4 years) with visual impairment due to simulated age-related cataract (experiment 2) completed step descent trials during which a high contrast edge highlighter was either not present, placed flush with the tread edge, or set back from the edge by 10 mm or 30 mm. Foot placement/clearance and the number of accidental foot contacts were compared across conditions. ResultsIn experiment 1, a highlighter set back by 30 mm led to a reduction in final foot placement (p< 0. 001) and foot clearance (p< 0. 001) compared to a highlighter placed flush with the tread edge, and the <b>percentage</b> of foot <b>clearances</b> that were less than 5 mm increased from 2 % (abutting) to 17 % (away 30). In experiment 2, a highlighter placed flush with the tread edge led to a decrease in within-subject variability in final foot placement (p= 0. 004) and horizontal foot clearance (p= 0. 022), a decrease in descent duration (p= 0. 009), and a {{decrease in the number of}} low clearances (< 5 mm, from 8 % to 0 %) and the number of accidental foot contacts (15 % to 3 %) when compared to a tread edge with no highlighter present. ConclusionsChanges to foot clearance parameters as a result of highlighter presence and position suggest that stairs with high-contrast edge highlighters positioned flush with the tread edge will improve safety on stairs, particularly for those with age-related visual impairment...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 27 / 08 / 2002. The dynamic response of turbine flowmeters in low pressure gas flows (i. e. where the rotational inertia of the fluid is negligible) is well understood and methods for correcting meter signals {{for a lack of}} response are available. For liquid flows there has been a limited amount of experimental work on the response of meters to step changes but no reports have been found of the response of meters to sinusoidally pulsating flows. "Small" turbine meters are expected to behave differently from "large" meters for a number of reasons: a smaller meter would generally have: (1) a larger <b>percentage</b> of tip <b>clearance</b> leakage flow; (2) less fluid momentum between the meter blading; and, (3) less fluid friction forces on the effective surface area. In this research, arbitrarily, meters up to size 25 mm were defined as small; and within this study, meters of size 6 mm to 25 mm were investigated. The aim of the research was to investigate and to understand the response of small turbine meters to pulsating liquid flows and to provide methods for correction. Three approaches were used: (1) application of an existing theoretical model of turbine meter behaviour; (2) an experimental investigation of meter performance in pulsating flows; and (3) simulation of flow behaviour through one selected meter using CFD and extending the simulation to predict the rotor dynamics and, hence, the response of this meter to specified cases of pulsating flow. A theoretical model developed by Dijstelbergen (1966) assumes frictionless behaviour and that flow is perfectly guided by meter blading through the rotor and that fluid within the rotor envelope rotates as a "solid body". Results from this theoretical model applied for pulsating flows showed that there was likely to be positive error in predicted mean flow rate (over-registration) and negative error for predicted values of the amplitude of the pulsations (amplitude attenuation). This behaviour is due to the fundamental asymmetry between flows with increasing and decreasing angle of attack relative to the meter blades, throughout a pulsation cycle. This qualitative behaviour was confirmed by experimental work with meters up to size 25 mm working with pulsation frequencies up to 300 Hz. For low frequency pulsations (below 10 Hz), the over-registration errors were within the limits of specified meter accuracy. At higher frequencies and larger pulsation amplitudes, the largest over-registration observed was 5. 5 % and amplitude attenuation could be as large as 90 %. The dependence of these errors on both the flow pulsation amplitude and frequency were investigated. The theoretical model was also used as a basis for generating correction procedures, to be applied to both the mean flow and the pulsation amplitude measurements. The results from the CFD simulation showed qualitative good agreement with the experimental data. The same kind of meter error trends were observed and it was shown to provide a better correlation with the experimental trends than the theoretical model derived from Dijstelbergen. From the CFD simulation, the causes of over-registration and amplitude attenuation in turbine flowmetering were understood through the investigation of rotor dynamics coupled with fluid behaviour around meter blading within the pulsation cycle. The CFD results were used to evaluate fluid angular momentum flux and to review the validity of the assumption that fluid within the rotor "envelope" rotated as a solid body. For the case investigated, whilst the assumption that flow is perfectly guided is not inappropriate, the volume of fluid assumed to rotate as a "solid body" was found to be significantly less than the rotor envelope volume...|$|R
