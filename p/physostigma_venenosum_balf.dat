5|$|Julian also {{extracted}} stigmasterol, {{which took}} {{its name from}} <b>Physostigma</b> <b>venenosum,</b> the west African calabar bean that he hoped could serve as raw material for synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time, in 1934, Butenandt and Fernholz, in Germany, had shown that stigmasterol, isolated from soybean oil, could be converted to progesterone by synthetic organic chemistry.|$|R
50|$|<b>Physostigma</b> <b>venenosum</b> (the Calabar bean or ordeal bean) is {{the seed}} of a leguminous plant, a native of {{tropical}} Africa, poisonous to humans. It derives {{the first part of}} its scientific name from a curious beak-like appendage {{at the end of the}} stigma, in the centre of the flower; this appendage, though solid, was supposed to be hollow (hence the name from , a bladder, and stigma).|$|R
50|$|Robertson {{made several}} {{contributions}} {{in the field of}} ophthalmology; in 1863 he researched the effects on the eye made by physostigmine, an extract from the Calabar bean (<b>Physostigma</b> <b>venenosum),</b> which is found in tropical Africa. He correctly predicted that physostigmine would become very important in the treatment of eye disorders. He also described a symptom of neurosyphilis that affects the pupils of the eye, a condition known today as Argyll Robertson pupils.|$|R
50|$|The {{plants that}} are rich in non-isoprenoid indole {{alkaloids}} include harmal (Peganum harmala), which contains harmane, harmine and harmaline, and Calabar bean (<b>Physostigma</b> <b>venenosum)</b> containing physostigmine. Some {{members of the family}} Convolvulaceae, in particular Ipomoea violacea and Turbina corymbosa, contain ergolines and lysergamides. Despite the considerable structural diversity, most of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is localized in three families of dicotyledon plants: Apocynaceae (genera Alstonia, Aspidosperma, Rauwolfia and Catharanthus), Rubiaceae (Corynanthe) and Loganiaceae (Strychnos).|$|R
6000|$|Followed {{an equally}} rough descent to a water set in fetid mud, its {{iridescence}} declaring {{the presence of}} iron; oozing out of the ground, it discharges during rains into the river: and, throughout the dry season, it keeps its little valley green with trees and shrubs. I observed {{what appeared to be}} the Esere or Calabar bean (<b>Physostigma</b> <b>venenosum),</b> whose hairy pod is very distasteful to the travelling skin: it was a [...] "Mucuna urens." ...|$|R

60|$|This fine {{concession}} is {{a rectangular}} parallelogram, whose dimensions are 2,000 yards long {{from north to}} south, by a breadth of half. The village stands outside the south-western angle, and the Fía rivulet runs through the south-eastern corner. The surface is rolling ground, with a rise and a depression trending from south-west to north-east. The whole extent, except where 'bush' lingers, is an old plantation of bananas, manioc, and ground-nuts. There is an ample supply of good hard timber, but red pitch-pine or creosoted teak from England would last much longer. Amongst the trees are especially noted the copal, the gamboge, rich in sticky juice, the brovi, {{said to be the}} hardest wood, and the dum, or African mahogany (Oldfieldia africana), well known in Ceylon as excellent material for boat-building. There was an abundance of the Calabar-bean (<b>Physostigma</b> <b>venenosum),</b> once used for an ordeal-poison, and now applied by surgery in ophthalmic and other complaints. The 'tie-tie,' as Anglo-Africans call the rope-like creepers, was also plentiful; it may prove valuable for cordage, and possibly for paper-making. I was pleased to see the ease with which the heaped-up jungle-growth is burnt at this season and the facility of road-making. Half a dozen Kru-boys with their matchets can open, at the rate of some miles a day, a path fit to carry a 'sulky;' and the ground wants only metalling with the stone which lines every stream. At the same time I hold that here, as in Mexico, we should begin with railways and tramways. Nor will there be any difficulty in keeping down the jungle. The soft and silky Bahama-grass has been brought from Sá Leone to Axim, where it covers the open spaces, and it grows well at Akankon. There is no trouble except to plant a few roots, which extend themselves afar; and the carpet when thick allows, like the orange-tree, no undergrowth.|$|R
