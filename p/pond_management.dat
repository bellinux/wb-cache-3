40|$|A {{review of}} some basic {{principles}} in fishpond management was reviewed to educate fish culturist, {{private and public}} sector to effectively manage culture fisheries. Successful <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> requires more than just stocking fish. It {{is also important to}} maintain the proper environmental conditions, to monitor fish harvest and growth, check for successful fish reproduction, and to keep out unwanted fish. This is the science of fish management, the solid basis for ensuring good fishing. Good fish management begins with an understanding of your pond’s physical, chemical, and biological features. Pond ecology, fish biology, site selection. Construction, liming, fertilization, brackish water <b>pond</b> <b>management,</b> culture species, stock management, managing fish population, management system, harvesting, fresh water <b>pond</b> <b>management,</b> fish species selection, fish stocking in fresh water ponds, stocking density, feeding, pond testing, diagnosing problems in pond, correcting muddy ponds, fish kills, aquatic weed control, managing other animals, habitat, pond renovation, fish harvesting in fresh water ponds, marketing and legal considerations are other important fish <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> principles the fish culturist need to know...|$|E

The research work was carried out at nine farmers ’ ponds covering area of 0. 12 ha each in Farming Systems Research and Development (FSRD) site, Goyeshpur, Pabna during the year 2000 - 01 to 2002 - 03 to assess integrated pond based production, income and employment opportunity of the rural farm households. Three different components like fish, poultry and pattern based vegetables production were employed in the investigation. The results indicated that in integrated <b>pond</b> <b>management,</b> two additional enterprises viz., poultry and year round vegetables exhibited encouraging production over traditional management. The average fish production obtained from integrated <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> was 330. 92 % higher over the traditional management. The total economic return in terms of gross return and gross margin achieved from integrated <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> was Tk. 59 133 and 38684 which were 1297. 94 and 1496. 53 % higher over traditional <b>pond</b> <b>management.</b> The utilization of family labour round the year in pond based integrated production system contributed to improve the production as well as to create employment opportunity for income generation.

40|$|Freshwater ponds {{deliver a}} broad range of {{ecosystem}} services (ESS). Taking into account this broad range of services to attain cost-effective ESS delivery is an important challenge facing integrated <b>pond</b> <b>management.</b> To assess {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} an ESS approach to support decisions in integrated <b>pond</b> <b>management,</b> we applied it on a small case study in Flanders, Belgium. A Bayesian belief network model was developed to assess ESS delivery under three alternative <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> scenarios: intensive fish farming (IFF), extensive fish farming (EFF) and nature conservation management (NCM). A probabilistic cost-benefit analysis was performed that includes both costs associated with <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> practices and benefits associated with ESS delivery. Whether or not a particular ESS is included in the analysis affects the identification of the most preferable management scenario by the model. Assessing the delivery of a more complete set of ecosystem services tends to shift the results away from intensive management to more biodiversity-oriented management scenarios. The proposed methodology illustrates the potential of Bayesian belief networks. BBNs facilitate knowledge integration and their modular nature encourages future model expansion to more encompassing sets of services. Yet, we also illustrate the key weaknesses of such exercises, being that the choice whether or not to include a particular ecosystem service may determine the suggested optimal management practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> on fish feed, growth, yield, survival, and water and effluent quality, during tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) juvenile production. Fish were distributed in nine 600 m 2 earthen ponds, at a density of 8 fish per m 2; the rearing period was 60 days. Three different <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> were applied: limed and fertilized (LimFer), limed (Lim), and natural (Nat). Fish were fed with a commercial ration containing 34 % crude protein three times daily. There {{were no significant differences}} in fish growth or yield. Three main items found in tambaqui stomach were insect, zooplankton and ration, without a significant difference among treatments in proportion. Alkalinity, hardness, and CO 2 were greater in LimFer and Lim ponds. Chlorophyll a, transparency, ammonia, nitrite, temperature, and dissolved oxygen of pond water were not significantly different among treatments. Biochemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, ammonia, and nitrite were significantly greater in effluents from LimFer ponds. Pond fertilization should be avoided, because growth and yield were similar among the three <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> systems tested; besides, it produces a more impacting effluent. 200...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>pond</b> <b>management</b> on water quality for drip-irrigated crops was studied throughout a field survey and a mesocosm experiment. Water sources were pooled into two groups: ground or surface water (GW/SW) and recycled wastewater. Pond covering, which {{was limited to}} {{about a quarter of}} them, improved water quality by reducing phytoplankton biomass. However, biocide applications and pond dredging were ineffective at improving in-pond water quality. Dredging did not reduce the concentrations of planktonic chlorophyll a or total suspended solids (TSS) in GW/SW fed ponds, whereas biocide applications increased both parameters. Field and experimental data proved that the two predominant taxa of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) found in ponds (Potamogeton pectinatus and Chara spp.) improved water quality by increasing water oxygenation and decreasing chlorophyll a and TSS concentrations. Preserving SAV (especially Chara spp.) appears to be an environmentfriendly, cost-effective and recommendable alternative strategy for irrigation <b>pond</b> <b>management...</b>|$|E
