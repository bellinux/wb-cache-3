40|$|This {{review is}} aimed to {{introduce}} a comprehensive survey on the most prominent and sustainable techniques and methods that could abate the environmental worries as well as financial insecurities in treating petroleum emulsions, since the existence of water is not desired because of the paramount troubles it may cause on the processing streamlines, as well as financial cost associated with transporting water mixed with petroleum. Currently, {{the most commonly used}} method for treating <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsion</b> is the application of chemical additives, known as demulsifiers. Althogh, there are many other methods that are claimed to be more favorable from economic and environmental perspectives, yet, have not being fully put into real life practice, because of the drawbacks and disadvantages. In this review, several techniques have been surveyed including, chemical, electrical, membrane, centrifuge, bacteria, air floatation, ultrasonic, and microwave. Based on this Theoretical survey, silcone based demulsifiers were reported to be very effective and environmental friendly, but expensive. Also microwave and ultrasonics were reported to be very effective in treating <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsion</b> and could be recommended as future ulternatives for treating petroleum emulsions...|$|E

In particular, applications of microwave irradiation technology for petroleum processing have been developed in the last twenty years.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwave}} dehydrator (modified domestic microwave oven) {{different types of}} petroleum oils were investigated in this paper, since microwave heats material selectively and volumetrically in relatively short time, and since its application in treating <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsion</b> is tremendously recommended, thereof, it is {{the aim of this}} paper to investigate the microwave induced heating capacities of the individual components of the <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsion</b> mixture. Three types of crude petroleum oils and water samples were put into test, from the result of this study, the temperature profile was observed to proceed as follow, at the first 20 seconds, all samples had similar temperature profiles in the range (50 - 60 C), however, beyond 20 seconds there was a clear distinct trend for every sample, in the interval from 20 seconds to 110 seconds, water sample had the curve with the highest temperature profile followed by UAE crude oil, then Saudi Arabia oil. Beyond 110 seconds, Kuwait crude oil had the maximum temperature profile continued sharply without reaching any plateau, followed by UAE then Saudi Arabia crude oil. The volumetric rate of heat generation also found to be {{in such a way that}} water sample had the maximum numerical value in the range (1 - 1. 2 cal/s. cm 3) at the beginning then decays as the heating time goes on, followed by that of Kuwait oil (0. 8 - 1 cal/s. cm 3), then Saudi Arabia crude oil (0. 6 - 0. 8 cal/s. c...|$|E
30|$|As {{a type of}} biosurfactant, a biodesemulsifier {{is usually}} {{efficient}} in breaking down <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsions,</b> {{as well as other}} industrial emulsions because of their unique functional groups, which cannot be chemically synthesized. Neu (1996) correlated the molar mass of the biosurfactants with their characteristics, concluding that most of the microorganisms produce emulsifiers with high molar mass, while a smaller portion produces compounds with reduced molar mass, which have demulsifying characteristics.|$|R
30|$|Compared with {{conventional}} chemical demulsifiers, bioemulsifiers have lower toxicity, environmental compatibility and high efficiency under extreme conditions (Huang et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2010). However, studies on biodemulsifiers still remain at a preliminary stage. Most studies {{focus only on}} the selection of bacteria producing biodemulsifiers and on the evaluation of demulsification performance. Kerosene-water type emulsions are generally used in these studies, whereas studies with crude oil emulsions are rarely seen so that the results cannot be extrapolated as {{to the performance of}} the biodemulsifiers in the demulsification of <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsions.</b> In addition, the yield of the production of biodemulsifiers is a crucial issue to allow its industrial application.|$|R
30|$|Emulsions are {{colloidal}} system of two immiscible liquids, wherein a liquid phase is dispersed and {{suspended in the}} form of small droplets, the dimensions of which range from 1  nm to 1  μm, in a second liquid (continuous phase). This is only possible in the presence of sufficient emulsifying agent and energy input. Depending on the liquid arrangement in the continuous phase, the emulsions are classified as water-in-oil (W/O) or oil-in-water (O/W). The most common type of oil emulsion is W/O because of the hydrophobic nature of stabilizing agents present in <b>petroleum.</b> <b>Emulsions</b> can be generated in various industries such as aluminum, steel, textiles, leather, food, petrochemicals and metal finishing industries, among others (Wen et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} paper is to select {{suitable}} filtering material which would be effective for {{the separation of the}} aqueous <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsion.</b> Furthermore, the paper discusses the principles and conditions for separation using filtering materials of different natures. During the experiments, the influences of several factors on the degree of separation were studied: 1) filler material 2) period of contact between emulsion and filler (by varying the model emulsion feeding rate and reactor size) 3) emulsion flow direction through the reactor (to study the effect of gravitation during separation). The experiments were performed with a cylindrical reactor. It was found that the effective separation of water and petroleum requires periods of contact between the emulsion and the filler. Besides, filler should have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties...|$|E
40|$|Whole {{asphaltenes}} (WA) were fractionated by the E-SARA method {{according to}} their adsorption characteristics at oil−water interfaces from either toluene or heptol solutions. Heptol, a mixture of n-heptane and toluene at a 1 : 1 volume ratio, is a less aromatic solvent than toluene. The effect of solvent aromaticity on the composition of resulting asphaltene subfractions at oil−water interfaces was studied to determine the key functional groups that are critical to the asphaltene-induced stabilization of water-in-oil (W/O) <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsions.</b> The interfacially active asphaltenes (IAA) were extracted as materials irreversibly adsorbed onto emulsified water droplets, while the asphaltenes remaining in the oil phase were considered as remaining asphaltenes (RA). Although toluene-extracted interfacially active asphaltenes (T-IAA) accounted for only 1. 1 ± 0. 3 wt % of WA, this subfraction of asphaltenes exhibited a greater interfacial activity and formed more rigid films at the oil−water interface than IAA extracted using heptol, known as HT-IAA which accounted for 4. 2 ± 0. 3 wt % of WA. The increased potential of T-IAA to stabilize W/O emulsions was attributed to their higher content of oxygen, resulting in a higher content of sulfoxide groups, as verified by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Although the toluene-extracted remaining asphaltenes (T-RA) and heptol-extracted remaining asphaltenes (HT-RA) were shown to contain similar H/C ratios and nitrogen contents to those of T-IAA and HT-IAA, the two RA subfractions contained a much less amount of sulfur and oxygen, leading to a much reduced interfacial activity as {{compared with that of}} IAA subfractions. In spite of the small proportions in asphaltenes, oxygen-containing functional groups, in particular sulfoxides, were believed to contribute significantly to the increased stability of asphaltene-stabilized W/O <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsions...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that colloids can show phase {{transitions}} similar to the ones observed in molecular systems. Colloid-diluted and colloid-concentrated phases can coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium at certain conditions. In a previous work, the authors of this research have used this concept to study <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsions</b> stability, applying thermodynamic perturbation theories to calculate a phase diagram of water-in-oil emulsions under the influence of an electric field. In this work, it was used a similar thermodynamic formalism coupled with the Lifshitz theory to perform a qualitative analysis of the influence of some variables on emulsion stability. Among the variables studied were temperature, applied electric field, and salt concentration. This research found that droplet diameter is a key parameter in studying thermodynamic stability. Variables like temperature and oil composition can have an opposite effect on thermodynamic and kinetic stability. The application of an electric field can destabilize thermodynamically the emulsion. It can also induce meta-stable transitions, which are important for the calculation of droplet coagulation rate. The results presented in this work are in accordance with trends of experimental and industrial observations, and seek to promote a better understanding of water-in-oil emulsion stability...|$|R
40|$|Adsorption of {{asphaltenes}} at the water-oil interface {{contributes to}} the stability of <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsions</b> by forming a networked film that can hinder drop-drop coalescence. The interfacial microstructure can either be liquid-like or solid-like, depending on (i) initial bulk concentration of asphaltenes, (ii) interfacial aging time, and (iii) solvent aromaticity. Two techniques [...] interfacial shear rheology and integrated thin film drainage apparatus [...] provided equivalent interface aging conditions, enabling direct correlation of the interfacial rheology and droplet stability. The shear rheological properties of the asphaltene film {{were found to be}} critical to the stability of contacting drops. With a viscous dominant interfacial microstructure, the coalescence time for two drops in intimate contact was rapid, on the order of seconds. However, as the elastic contribution develops and the film microstructure begins to be dominated by elasticity, the two drops in contact do not coalescence. Such step-change transition in coalescence is thought {{to be related to the}} high shear yield stress (~ 10 (4) Pa), which is a function of the film shear yield point and the film thickness (as measured by quartz crystal microbalance), and the increased elastic stiffness of the film that prevents mobility and rupture of the asphaltene film, which when in a solid-like state provides an energy barrier against drop coalescence...|$|R
40|$|The {{breaking}} (demulsification) of 50 - 50 % w/o <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsions</b> of two oils (A and B) by Green (chemical and centrifuge) {{methods were}} studied {{in comparison to}} conventional (chemical) method. The green methods consisted of silicon based chemical demulsifiers and high-speed centrifuge operated at 12, 000 RPM, while the conventional method consisted of Amine group based demulsifiers. In chemical method, the concentrations were varied (0. 5 %, 1. 5 % and 3 %), while in centrifuge method, the processing time was varied (10 and 30 minutes). The efficiency of these methods was determined by measuring {{the amount of water}} separated from the emulsion after being treated. The maximum separation efficiencies for Silicon demulsifiers were 93 and 88 % for oils A and B respectively, and that of Amine group demulsifiers were 72 and 86 % for oils A and B respectively, While centrifuge demulsification gave maximum separations of 39 and 24 % for oils A and B respectively. Based on these results, Silicon based demulsifiers are very effective and reliable method to treat emulsions for different types of oils with different composition, and have the potential to be used as an alternative method in the demulsification or breaking of water-in-crude oil emulsions...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of water-in-crude oil (W/O) emulsion can be encountered at many stages during drilling, producing, transporting and processing of crude oils.

In this study, both chemical and physicochemical properties of W/O emulsions that prepared by using cocamide DEA (non-ionic and biodegradable surfactant that synthesized from coconut oil) and three types of conventional chemical emulsifiers (span 83, SDDS, triton X- 100) were investigated. 50 - 50 % W/O emulsions were prepared at 800 rpm (mixing speed) with three different concentrations of each emulsifier. These emulsions were tested for relative rates of water separation (stability test), viscosity, shear stress, and shear rate at varied temperature and stirring speed of Brookfield viscometer. Results shown that span 83 and cocamide DEA were both effective.

The fluorescence of the emulsion manifests itself in the spectral range from 260 to over 400 nmand is much less intensive in the visible light region.

40|$|Metalworking fluids (MWFs) are <b>petroleum</b> <b>emulsions</b> {{employed}} for metal machining processes as coolants and lubricants. To date, {{they have been}} irreplaceable in modern heavy and manufacturing industries, with annual usage exceeding two billion litres worldwide. However, {{the large amount of}} MWFs, the highly concentrated complex recalcitrant and toxic petroleum components contained in them continue to cause significant concern in terms of sustainable routes of end-of-life treatment and disposal. Compared with other treatment methods, the anaerobic treatment method has significant advantages, such as the low capital, operating and maintenance costs and energy recovery. This latter factor has the potential benefit of generating bio-energy from waste organic matter whilst aerobic route leads to CO 2 emission. However, the bio-toxicity of MWFs is a huge challenge in terms of employing bio-treatment of waste MWFs. In this study, the anaerobic biodegradability of a typical MWF was investigated employing an activated sludge experimental system. Furthermore, the toxic effects of the MWF on the anaerobic ecosystem, particularly on methanogen species, were investigated using bio-molecular analytical methods and a biosensor. In order to overcome its toxicity, the indigenous anaerobic bacteria isolated from spent MWFs were employed in the treatment of the MWF since they were assumed to be acclimated to the conditions. The major findings include: (1) approximately 80 % of the MWF (5, 000 mgCOD/L) was found to be anaerobically biodegradable, with around 35 % of the biodegraded COD could be converted to methane; (2) the MWF appeared to be toxic to the anaerobic ecosystem, especially to methanogen species; and (3) however, treatment employing the anaerobic bacteria successfully reduced the toxicity of the MWF and enhanced the methane production in the process.

In the experiment range, the increases of water content and surfactant concentration were beneficial to the stability of emulsion, and the optimal emulsifying time was 20 min and emulsifying velocity was 4000 r·min - 1. The stabilities of water in oil emulsions formed by six different kinds of solvent as oil phases, such as n-hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, o-xylene, petroleum ether and kerosene, were studied and compared.

40|$|Crude oil is {{produced}} as water-in-oil emulsion, and asphaltenes {{have been considered}} the main responsible by their stabilization.

Model water-in-oil emulsions were prepared: aqueous phase of brine and oil phase of asphaltenes in toluene. Different asphaltenes fractions were used. The emulsions' stability was assessed by the bottle test, with and without adding demulsifier. The results show that a sample of asphaltenes with broad polarity distribution promotes greater emulsion stability than a sample with narrow distribution and intermediate polarity. Besides this, the efficiency of demulsifiers in separating the emulsions {{is directly related to the}} original stability of the emulsion. Measurements of the interfacial tension revealed the efficiency of displacement of the asphaltenes by the demulsifiers, which occurred more efficiently for the emulsions containing asphaltenes fractions with narrow distribution and intermediate polarity...|$|R

A system consists of modified domestic microwave oven and silicon based chemical demulsifiers {{was used to}} dehydrate two types of petroleum crude oils from Middle East. Silicone based additives which claimed to be nontoxic are {{used in conjunction with}} the modified microwave oven. The currently available demulsification techniques that consist mainly of chemicals together with mechanical, heating and electrical methods have some drawbacks, since chemicals are costly and harmful to the environment, mechanical techniques such as gravity settling tank, hydro cyclone vessel, centrifugal separators, and steam stripping are large requiring more space, time and cost, electrical techniques almost always work in a very high voltage that can easily cause fire via short circuit. Therefore, the objective of this project is to introduce the Microwave Dehydrator (MD) as a step forward to the commercialization of the microwave treatment of <b>petroleum</b> based <b>emulsions.</b> This is to replace or reduce the use of chemical dehydrators in the oil field. Simulated experimental model emulsions of various crude oils were produced to mimic the real emulsions.

40|$|Understanding the {{behavior}} of petroleum films at the air/water interface is crucial for dealing with oil sticks and reducing the damages to the environment, which has normally been attempted with studies of Langmuir films made of fractions of petroleum. However, the properties of films from whole petroleum samples may differ considerably from those of individual fractions, Using surface pressure and surface potential measurements and Brewster angle and fluorescence microscopy, we show that petroleum forms it nonhomogeneous Langmuir film at the air-water interface. The surface pressure isotherms for petroleum Langmuir films exhibit gas (G), liquid-expanded (LE), and liquid-condensed phases, with almost no hysteresis in the compression-decompression cycles. Domains formed upon compression from the G to the LE phase were accompanied {{by an increase in}} fluorescence intensity with excitation at 400 - 440 nm owing to an increase in the surface density of the chromophores in the petroleum film. The surface pressure and the fluorescence microscopy data pointed to self-assembling domains into a pseudophase in thermo-dynamic equilibrium with other less emitting petroleum components. This hypothesis was supported by Brewster angle microscopy images, whereby the appearance of water domains even at high surface pressures confirms the tendency of <b>petroleum</b> to stabilize <b>emulsion</b> systems. The results presented here suggest that, for understanding the interaction with water, it may be more appropriate to use the whole petroleum samples rather than its fractions.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to produce a pellet fuel from low-sulfur Illinois coal fines which could burn with emissions of less than 1. 8 lbs SO{sub 2 }/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu in stoker-fired boilers. The significance of 1. 8 lbs SO{sub 2 }/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu is that in the Chicago (9 counties) and St. Louis (2 counties) metropolitan areas, industrial users of coal currently must comply with this level of emissions. For this effort, we will be investigating the use of fines from two Illinois mines which currently mine relatively low-sulfur reserves and that discard their fines fraction (minus 100 mesh). The research will involve investigation of multiple unit operations including column flotation, filtration and pellet production. The end result of the effort will allow for an evaluation of the commercial viability of the approach. Previously it has been decided that corn starch would be used as binder and a roller-and-die mill would be used for pellet manufacture. A quality starch binder has been identified and tested. To potentially lower binder costs, a starch that costs about 50 % of the high quality starch was tested. Results indicate that the lower cost starch will not lower binder cost because more is required to produce a comparable quality pellet. Also, a <b>petroleum</b> in water <b>emulsion</b> was evaluated as a potential binder. The compound seemed to have adhesive properties but was found to be a poor binder.

40|$|The {{production}} of acidic or sometimes heavier crudes {{often leads to}} the formation of either calcium naphthenate or sodium carboxylate soap emulsions during oil production operations. This problem has been recognised as a major flow assurance problem in the oil industry. In this work, both harder calcium naphthenates and more emulsion–like sodium carboxylates have been studied and these are viewed as “end members” in the spectrum of field naphthenate deposits which may occur. In this thesis, four related aspects of naphthenate deposits are studied, as follows: (i) Characterization of various field naphthenates samples from different parts of the world, involving naphthenic acid extraction method development and subsequent extract analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (APCI MS) techniques. It was observed that different naphthenic acid extraction and analysis methods affected the naphthenic acid identification and apparent composition; (ii) Geochemical studies have been carried out on various crude oils which form calcium naphthenate deposits, sodium carboxylate soaps and emulsions. Biomarker correlation analysis was employed on the aliphatic and aromatic fractions of the crude oil samples using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS); (iii) Thermodynamic modelling of naphthenate formation was carried out, and both a simple thermodynamic pH change naphthenate model and a full naphthenate precipitation model have been developed. This thermodynamic model describes the chemistry of a simple partitioning “pseudo” naphthenic acid which may form calcium naphthenate “precipitate”, according to a solubility product type description. This model has been used in a wide sensitivity study which makes some predictions about the way a precipitating Ca-Naphthenate (CaN) system behaves and these predictions have been confirmed experimentally; (iv) Naphthenate chemical inhibition studies have been performed in order to develop a methodology for the mitigation of these deposits. Static “inhibition efficiency” tests have been conducted using 8 different naphthenate inhibitors {{in order to determine the}} most appropriate methodology for testing and also the effectiveness of these chemicals in preventing the formation of calcium naphthenates and sodium carboxylate soap <b>emulsions.</b> <b>Petroleum</b> Technology Development Fund (PTDF...|$|R

During the desalting process, the challenge is to overcome the existence of an emulsion layer at the interface between oil and water. In <b>petroleum</b> industry normally <b>emulsions</b> encountered are some kind of water droplets dispersed in a continuous phase of oil. In crude oil emulsions, emulsifying agents are present at the oil-water interface, hindering this coalescence process. Such agents include scale and clay particles, added chemicals or indigenous crude oil components like asphaltenes, resins, waxes and naphthenic acids. Many techniques made available to gas oil separation plant operators to minimize the effect of tight emulsions. These techniques include injection of demulsifier, increasing oil temperature, gravity separation in large vessels with high retention time as well as electrostatic voltage. From experience and studies these variables have been already optimized to a good extent; however, from the believe that knowledge never stop, this study is conducted targeting enhancing the demulsifier control and optimizing the wash water rate.
