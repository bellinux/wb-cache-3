5000|$|<b>Phyllomedusa</b> <b>sauvagii,</b> {{commonly}} known as the waxy monkey tree frog, waxy monkey frog or painted-bellied tree frog is a hylid frog belonging to the subfamily of South and Central American leaf frogs, Phyllomedusinae, that inhabits the Chaco of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil. The subfamily consists of around 50 species in three well-known genera, Phyllomedusa, Agalychnis, and Pachymedusa. The vast majority of known species, including Phyllomedusa sauvagei, belong to the genus Phyllomedusa. [...] <b>Phyllomedusa</b> <b>sauvagii</b> has adapted {{to meet the demands of}} life in the trees. It does not need to return to the ground during the mating season; rather, it lays its eggs down the middle of a leaf before folding the leaf, sandwiching the eggs inside. Its nest is attached to a branch suspended over a stream, so the hatching tadpoles drop into the water. In common with other phyllomedusines, it has physiological and behavioural adaptations to limit water loss, including reducing water loss through the skin by lipid secretions, excretion of uric acid (uricotelism), and diurnal torpor. Lipid secretions are produced in a special type of cutaneous gland, and are spread over the surface of the skin by the legs in a complex sequence of wiping movements.|$|E

40|$|Searching for {{bioactive}} peptides, {{we analyzed}} acidic extracts of <b>Phyllomedusa</b> <b>sauvagii</b> skin and found two new proteins, PSKP- 1 and PSKP- 2, of 6. 7 and 6. 6 kDa, respectively, which, by sequence homology, {{belong to the}} Kazal family of serine protease inhibitors. PSKP- 1 and PSKP- 2 exhibit the unprecedented feature of having proline at P 1 and P 2 positions. A gene encoding PSKP- 1 was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant PSKP- 1 was purified from inclusion bodies, oxidatively refolded to the native state, and characterized by chemical, hydrodynamic andoptical studies. PSKP- 1 shows inhibitoryactivity against a serumprolyl endopeptidase, but is unable to inhibit trypsin, chymotrypsin, V 8 protease, or proteinase K. In addition, PSKP- 1 can be rendered active against trypsin by active-site site-specific mutagenesis, has bactericidal activity, and induces agglutination of red cells at micromolar concentra-tions. PSKP- 1 might protect P. sauvagii teguments from microbial invasion, by acting as an inhibitor of an as-yet unidentified prolyl endopeptidase or directly as a micro-bicidal compound...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTranscriptomic and peptidomic {{analysis}} of skin secretions from the Painted-belly leaf frog <b>Phyllomedusa</b> <b>sauvagii</b> {{led to the}} identification of 5 novel phylloseptins (PLS-S 2 to -S 6) and also of phylloseptin- 1 (PSN- 1, here renamed PLS-S 1), {{the only member of}} this family previously isolated in this frog. Synthesis and characterization of these phylloseptins revealed differences in their antimicrobial activities. PLS-S 1, -S 2, and -S 4 (79 - 95 % amino acid sequence identity; net charge = + 2) were highly potent and cidal against Gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug resistant S. aureus strains, and killed the promastigote stage of Leishmania infantum, L. braziliensis and L. major. By contrast, PLS-S 3 (95 % amino acid identity with PLS-S 2; net charge = + 1) and -S 5 (net charge = + 2) were found to be almost inactive against bacteria and protozoa. PLS-S 6 was not studied as this peptide was closely related to PLS-S 1. Differential scanning calorimetry on anionic and zwitterionic multilamellar vesicles combined with circular dichroism spectroscopy and membrane permeabilization assays on bacterial cells indicated that PLS-S 1, -S 2, and -S 4 are structured in an amphipathic a-helix that disrupts the acyl chain packing of anionic lipid bilayers. As a result, regions of two coexisting phases could be formed, one phase rich in peptide and the other lipid-rich. After reaching a threshold peptide concentration, the disruption of lipid packing within the bilayer may lead to local cracks and disintegration of the microbial membrane. Differences in the net charge, a-helical folding propensity, and/or degree of amphipathicity between PLS-S 1, -S 2 and -S 4, and between PLS-S 3 and -S 5 appear to be responsible for their marked differences in their antimicrobial activities. In addition to the detailed characterization of novel phylloseptins from P. sauvagii, our study provides additional data on the previously isolated PLS-S 1 and on the mechanism of action of phylloseptins...|$|E
