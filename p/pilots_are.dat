5|$|A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat (The Germans traditionally set the threshold at 10 victories.). During World War II, hundreds of German Luftwaffe fighter pilots achieved this feat flying contemporary piston engine fighter aircraft. However, only 28 <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft while flying a jet-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The 1977 {{science fiction}} film Close Encounters of the Third Kind {{featured}} a {{depiction of the}} Flight 19 planes being discovered in the Sonoran Desert, apparently set there by extraterrestrial forces and later their <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> returned to Earth by peaceful alien captors. In the film, the returned fliers are depicted at the age {{they would have been}} {{at the time of their}} disappearance, but have fictional names.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> {{required}} {{to stay within}} gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E

50|$|From its {{founding}} in the 1980s until 1994, <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> an independent software company. In 1994 <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> acquired by Dun & Bradstreet corporation. Over time D&B began to break itself apart, {{and as part of}} that reorganization <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1997 to Platinum Equity Holdings. In 2000 <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> again sold, this time to Accrue Software. Accrue later went through significant business challenges, and in 2002 the assets of <b>Pilot</b> <b>were</b> purchased by <b>Pilot</b> management and Pilot again became an independent software company.|$|R
5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be {{replaced}} often because the <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|E
5|$|Staff {{working for}} British Airways are {{represented}} {{by a number of}} trade unions, <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> represented by British Air Line Pilots' Association, cabin crew by British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (a branch of Unite the Union), while other branches of Unite the Union and the GMB Union represent other employees. Bob Ayling's management faced strike action by cabin crew over a £1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA cabin crew would strike until 2009, although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident. In an effort to increase interaction between management, employees, and the unions, various conferences and workshops have taken place, often with thousands in attendance.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{recommended}} that the FAA revise the procedures for ATC facilities {{in the area to}} facilitate the process for VFR traffic that wishes to transit Class B airspace. This included establishing procedures to coordinate such requests between facilities; requiring controllers to instruct pilots to self-announce on the VFR corridor frequency if they are unable to immediately enter Class B airspace; adding information to area Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts reminding pilots to use the self-announce frequency; and ensuring that <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> provided with traffic advisories if they are in contact with a controller.|$|E
50|$|Early on, <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> {{normally}} fabricated of bars {{mounted on}} a frame; later on, sheet metal <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> often used for their additional smoothness, and some cast steel <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> employed for their mass and smooth shape. Early diesel locomotives followed the same plan.|$|R
50|$|A second TV <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} in 2000, {{with a different}} cast and a professional television director involved. Again, the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> not taken up.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>is</b> an unincorporated {{community}} in Montgomery County, Virginia, United States. <b>Pilot</b> <b>is</b> 5.9 mi south-southeast of Christiansburg. Pilot has {{a post office}} with ZIP code 24138.|$|R
5|$|Winch {{launches}} {{are much}} cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch {{may also be}} used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of {{the shape of the}} field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> trained.|$|E
5|$|According to {{government}} regulations concerning seagoing ships, the larger ones can carry several hundred men, {{and the smaller}} ones may {{have more than a}} hundred men on board. One of the most important merchants is chosen to be Leader (Gang Shou), another is Deputy Leader (Fu Gang Shou), and a third is Business Manager (Za Shi). The Superintendent of Merchant Shipping gives them an unofficially sealed red certificate permitting them to use the light bamboo for punishing their company when necessary. Should anyone die at sea, his property becomes forfeit to the government...The ship's <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars, and in the day-time by the sun. In dark weather they look at the south-pointing needle (i.e. the magnetic compass). They also use a line a hundred feet long with a hook at the end which they let down to take samples of mud from the sea-bottom; by its (appearance and) smell they can determine their whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Army Air Forces {{originally}} favoured officer {{pilots and}} the few enlisted <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> usually civilian-qualified. The adoption of transport and strategic bombing missions meant that {{a larger number of}} <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> needed to perform monotonous and gruelling jobs. Officer <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> usually assigned to fly fighters and fighter-bombers and commanded units. Enlisted <b>pilots</b> usually <b>were</b> assigned to fly light reconnaissance and artillery-spotter aircraft, cargo aircraft, and medium- and heavy-weight bombers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>is</b> a single-user, {{multitasking}} {{operating system}} designed by Xerox PARC in early 1977. <b>Pilot</b> <b>was</b> written in the Mesa programming language, totalling about 24,000 lines of code.|$|R

5|$|Major interplanetary {{corporations}} {{known as}} Hammond Robotics—a major manufacturing, aerospace and defense contractor—used {{resources of the}} Frontier to make builds of mecha-combatants such as Titans and Spectres. Titans are descendants of present-day fledgling military exoskeletons. In addition to the obvious combat applications, unarmed forms of Titans are used in heavy industries like cargo transport and deep space ship salvage. They are also used in special applications such as deep space search and rescue, and are very effective in inhospitable environments. The use of Titans is widespread throughout the Frontier in both combat and civilian life. As with Titans, the Frontier contains Pilots of many different styles and experiences. Titan <b>Pilots</b> <b>are</b> rated by 'certifications', most of which apply to civilian applications, such as construction, shipping, and heavy salvage industries. The most prestigious {{of these is the}} Full Combat Certification - a widely published series of tests that grade a Titan Pilot's abilities. Because of the extreme physical and mental challenges of mastering both Titan combat & dismounted parkour movement, a fully combat certified Titan pilot is a rare find, and the combat skills of active Pilots in the field varies widely throughout the Frontier.|$|E

25|$|In Jetstream, a 2007 {{television}} series airing on Discovery Canada about pilots training {{to fly the}} CF-18 Hornet in the Canadian Forces, seven of the eight <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> graduates of the RMC.|$|E
25|$|Its front-line {{air defence}} asset {{consists}} of 30 F-18 Hornets and 53 F-5 Tiger IIs (originally 110 purchased in 1978–85). The F/A-18 <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> all full-time professional military; the F-5 <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> largely reservists. These reservists are mostly airliner or freight-liner pilots {{who also have}} an F-5 rating. During reserve duty periods, they are assigned to military duties and must refresh their operational live flying training. In 2008, the Swiss Hornet component reached the 50,000 flight hour milestone. All Swiss Hornets remain highly capable due to the Upgrade 21 (UG21) programme conducted between 2004 and 2009 at RUAG, while another Mid-Life Update (MLU) will begin shortly.|$|E
50|$|A safety <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> a rated <b>pilot</b> {{who helps}} {{maintain}} visual separation from other aircraft, clouds, and terrain while another <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> wearing view limiting devices {{for the purposes}} of simulating instrument conditions.|$|R
5000|$|This {{term was}} used {{originally}} in aviation: when a <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> prevented from flying an aircraft due to misconduct, illness, technical {{problems with the}} aircraft, or other reasons, the <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> [...] "grounded".|$|R
