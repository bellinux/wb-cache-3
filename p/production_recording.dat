30|$|Research into W&N’s pigment {{manufacture}} {{using the}} W&N 19 th century archive database {{resulted in the}} identification of 103 <b>production</b> <b>records</b> for yellow chromate pigments based on barium, zinc and strontium (compared with 183 <b>productions</b> <b>records</b> found for yellow lead chromate pigments [25]). There are 71 <b>production</b> <b>records</b> for Lemon Yellow (also under the names Chromate Barytes and Permanent Primrose) corresponding to barium chromate, 26 for Citron Yellow (or Chromate of Zinc) which correspond to zinc potassium chromate, and six for Strontian Yellow (or Chromate Strontia) resulting in strontium chromate. Contrary to the wide range of names used for lead chromate pigments in W&N’s <b>production</b> <b>records</b> [25], further variations on naming for these three pigments were not found in the W&N archive.|$|R

30|$|Four <b>production</b> <b>records</b> {{were found}} where a {{buffered}} chromate solution (potassium dichromate with potassium carbonate) was used. A single experiment with potassium chromate alone (this {{would result in}} a basic final pH) was also conducted. Barium nitrate was also tried in two <b>production</b> <b>records</b> to substitute for barium chloride.|$|R
40|$|Background: New meal pattern {{requirements}} {{have recently}} been introduced and emphasize the serving of vegetable subgroups. These regulations ensure students are offered certain food items, and the selection and consumption of these items are essential to track their progress and effectiveness. This study investigates whether <b>production</b> <b>records</b> are a feasible tool in tracking selection across time by comparing <b>production</b> <b>records</b> with direct observation of food selection in the lunchroom. Methods: Food selection was measured through direct observation and <b>production</b> <b>records</b> for two consecutive weeks. The frequencies of daily items served were entered into Excel and each food item was coded into the appropriate food group for each method of data collection. The proportion of each food group selected was calculated by taking {{the total number of}} servings in each category and diving that number {{by the total number of}} items served. Results: Entrées represented the food category that was served the most, followed by vegetables and fruits. Eleven out of fifteen values for food selection derived from <b>production</b> <b>records</b> fell outside the 95 % direct observation confidence intervals. The confidence intervals tended to be relatively narrow because the sample was so large. Conclusion: <b>Production</b> <b>records</b> have potential to track longitudinal changes in food selection. Using <b>production</b> <b>records</b> as a measurement tool is more feasible when tracking changes in meal component selection than changes in specific fruit and vegetable subgroups. The use of <b>production</b> <b>records</b> present challenges to measurement and should be used in conjunction with other measurement tools...|$|R
