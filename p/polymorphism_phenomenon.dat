40|$|Introduction Structural {{determination}} of biological macromolecules {{is of great}} significance for various aspects in biology and medicine. However, studies on the solution structure of single-stranded DNA/RNA remain relatively di#cult due to the hyper-diversity of conformations {{as well as the}} shortage of experimental methods. Especially, there has been left unsolved the SSCP (Single strand conformation <b>polymorphism)</b> <b>phenomenon</b> [1] problem: That is, what is the true cause of this phenomenon and how can it be quantitatively expressed? To solve this problem in a general and basic manner, we studied systematically the e#ect of single base substitution in a dodecanucleotide by gel-electrophoretic experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here we found that simulation statistics could be correlated with the experimental observations. 2 Methods 2. 1 Gel Electrophoresis The slab gel electrophoresis without denaturation was carried out using polyacrylamide gel (20 %T and 5 %C) in 90 m...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} {{expression}} of Resistin mRNA in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and its gene polymorphism in coding region in a small range population in Zhejiang Province of China. Methods: Eighty-three cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus and 53 healthy people were included. The expression of Resistin mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was detected by RT-PCR and semi-quantitative PCR assay. The sequencing work was done in Resistin cDNA and gene polymorphism was analyzed. Results: At the same condition, in 83 diabetes patients, Resistin mRNA was detected in 23 cases (11 males and 12 females). There was no Resistin mRNA expression in 53 healthy people. The ratio of PCR products between Resistin and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was from 0. 564 to 1. 238, averaging 0. 804 ± 0. 436. The sequence of Resistin cDNA is almost identical {{with each other and with}} that in GenBank with no single nucleotide polymorphism being found. Conclusion: Resistin mRNA is expressed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in some type 2 diabetes mellitus, but its expression is at a low level.

In this study, {{and for the first}} time, a host plant is registered and the immature stages and the captivity life cycle are described using a Cuban population. Larvae feed on fowlsfoot, Serjania diversifolia (Jacq.) Radlk (Sapindales: Sapindaceae). One complete cohort was obtained from December of 2004 to February of 2005 and about 57 days lapsed from oviposition to adult emergence. The egg is light green-yellowish and semi-spherical. Most larvae developed through 6 or 7 instars, although there were individuals with 8 instars. The last instar has a cephalic capsule width of 2. 04 ± 0. 06 mm (n = 29) irrespective of the number of instars. The cephalic capsule growth curves of the larvae with 6 and 7 instars have different slopes, but both follow a geometric pattern consistent with the Dyar's rule. In each larval molt the setae types and the larvae coloration change. Adult females have two color morphs, one orange-reddish and the other blue.

Despite the great interest that cocrystals are currently gaining for their application {{to the design of}} new supramolecular structures with desired functional properties, studies concerning new experimental strategies capable of controlling <b>polymorphism</b> <b>phenomena</b> of a given system are scarcely reported. We propose herein the use of polymer-assisted grinding (POLAG) as a new method for the selective control of the product polymorphic form in a mechanochemical cocrystallization reaction. Specifically, to the model system selected in this study formed by caffeine and glutaric acid, we demonstrate that the polymorphic outcome can be controlled by modifying the number of monomer units of the catalyst from the shortest dimer to a polymer with chains of approximately 1000 units. The characteristics of each polymorphic form were investigated by low-dose high-resolution TEM, and the mechanistic aspects of the cocrystal formation were studied through a series of ex situ and interconversion experiments. The results suggest that for this system the modification of the catalyst chain length and, consequently, modification of polarity drives cocrystal formation toward the more stable polymorph. The approach proposed in this paper can be readily applied to each system, where polarity is the main issue for polymorph control without the risk of solvate formation...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} herein {{focus upon}} crystal engineering of nutraceutical cocrystals. Cocrystals are considered unique solid dosage form which has many advantages over other traditionally known solid forms. Furthermore, cocrystals {{have proven to}} improve stability, solubility and bioavailability of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) {{as shown in the}} case of carbamazepine and other APIs in previous studies. Crystal engineering is commonly used to design new solid forms based on the bases of supramolecular chemistry. In this study, crystal engineering based on intensive Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) analysis used to predict and design new cocrystals of targeted nutraceuticals. Two nutraceuticals were selected for this study; resveratrol and citric acid. The rationale behind selecting resveratrol was to improve its solubility and, accordingly, bioavailability. On the other hand, citric acid is known as a highly soluble and safe nutraceutical, and thus it {{can be used as a}} coformer. Five new cocrystals were prepared and characterized using a variety of techniques that include single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), FT-IR, and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). Most of the reported cocrystals were obtained using different techniques; solvent slow evaporation, mechanichemical approach, slurry, and from melt. Moreover, dissolution test has been performed on resveratrol and two of its cocrystals, using UV-vis spectrophotometer, where the data demonstrate that through cocrystallization with different cocrystal formers, solubility of resveratrol could be greatly modified, and further controlled. The <b>polymorphism</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is encountered, and accordingly addressed, herein where four novel polymorphs were obtained during cocrystallization attempts. Polymorphism has a significant importance in industry, in general, and in pharmaceutical industry, in particular, due to the vast differences in physical properties of polymorphs.

Both NMR studies and inelastic neutron scattering results indicate a low barrier double-well potential for the shorter and stronger hydrogen bond in the triclinic form. A model based on differences in zero-point energies can be constructed {{to account for the}} relative stability of crystal forms upon isotope substitution. ^ A single crystal NMR study of 17 O was performed on potassium hydrogen maleate-d 2. Potassium hydrogen maleate has a short intramolecular O–H…O hydrogen bond that is believed to be symmetric. The strong hydrogen bond affects the quadrupole tensors of oxygen in the molecule, especially the neighbor oxygen on the COH sites. The principal values of the 17 O quadruple coupling tensors on C=O and COH sites were determined by simulating the rotation plots of quadrupole splitting on satellite transitions. The CQ values are close to experimental values from other methods; the directions of three principal components, determined for the first time, are very close to the local axes of symmetry, which is similar to the results of other carboxylic acids and salts. ^ 2 H powder NMR experiments were performed at very low temperature for the Zundel cation (H 5 O 2 +) in deuterated H 2 SO 4. 4 H 2 O. Zundel cation is a very common form of the hydronium ion in solution; it contains a strong hydrogen bond in the center and forms 4 weak hydrogen bonds with anions in the solid. By simulating the Pake patterns for the powder spectra, quadrupole coupling tensors of deuterons on 2 different hydrogen bond sites were determined. Deuterons were found preferentially occupy weak hydrogen bonding sites at low deuteration levels. This thermodynamic isotope effect {{can be explained by the}} different vibrational zero-point energies for different isotopomers. The quantum chemical calculations fully support this point, especially by using an improved, anharmonic vibrational potential model (VSCF) into the theoretical calculations. ...|$|E

To relieve the high supersaturation that is generally created in precipitation processes molecules may follow different polymorphic pathways for nucleation and growth.

Because they can be easily chemically modified, TTF-derivatives are ideal candidates to perform molecule-property correlation studies and, especially, to elucidate the impact of molecular and crystal engineering on device performance. A brief introduction into the state-of-the-art of the field-effect mobility values achieved with TTF derivatives employing different fabrication techniques is provided. Following, structure-performance relationships are discussed, including <b>polymorphism,</b> a <b>phenomenon</b> which is crucial to control for ensuring device reproducibility. It is also shown that chemical modification of TTFs has a strong influence on the electronic structure of these materials, affecting their stability as well as the nature of the generated charge carriers, leading to devices with p-channel, n-channel, or even ambipolar behaviour. TTFs have also shown promise in other applications, such as phototransistors, sensors, or as dopants or components of organic metal charge transfer salts used as source-drain contacts. Overall, TTFs are appealing building blocks in organic electronics, not only because they can be tailored to perform fundamental studies, but also because they offer a wide spectrum of potential applications. Tetrathiafulvalenes are promising active materials in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), in which they exhibit high performances. An overview is provided of the use of this family of materials as a model building block for OFETs to highlight general concepts of organic semiconductors and their use in devices.

40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmIn this study, new solid supramolecular derivatised {{forms of}} bis(adamantine- 1 -aminium) {{carbonate}} (ADTCO 3) were prepared. ADTCO 3 is a derivative of amantadine used for Parkinson’s disease and has antiviral properties against influenza-A, dengue fever and pharmacological activity towards Parkinson’s disease. The new forms prepared were polymorphic and co-crystal forms of ADTCO 3. <b>Polymorphism</b> is a <b>phenomenon</b> where {{the ability of}} a substance to exist in two or more crystalline forms occurs when crystallised under different conditions and co-crystallization is the process of formation of multicomponent crystals of a drug substance. New solid forms often display different mechanical, physicochemical and thermal properties that can remarkably influence the bioavailability, hygroscopicity and stability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). For the formation of polymorphs of ADTCO 3, techniques such as dry grinding, solvent-drop grinding, co-precipitation, sublimation and vapour diffusion were applied. For the development of co-crystals and/or complex formation, ADTCO 3 was treated in combination with ten selected co-formers viz; benzoic acid, 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, cinnamic acid, 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, salicylic acid, L-glutamic acid, citric acid monohydrate and L-glutaric acid using similar techniques as applied in the polymorphism study. The first four co-formers were selected for their potential biological activity and the latter six were selected for their generally regarded as safe (GRAS) status. All products were isolated and characterized using different analytical techniques to assess the thermal behaviour of the products by hot stage microscopy (HSM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). FTIR spectroscopy and proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (1 HNMR) were used to identify and determine the purity of the parent compounds and the modified forms. X-ray powder diffraction was used to determine the formation of a new phase and single crystal X-ray diffraction was applied at the initial stages to identify ADTCO 3 by its unit cell parameters. Furthermore, the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and other resources were used to generate information on the molecular structures of all elucidated parent compounds, their polymorphs and reported co-crystals. Four different polymorphic forms of ADTCO 3 were identified (viz. ADTCO 3 Forms I to IV) and sixteen co-crystals (viz. ADTCO 3 BA 1 to ADTCO 3 BA 5, ADTCO 3 HBA, ADTCO 3 CIN, ADTCO 3 HCIN, ADTCO 3 SUC, ADTCO 3 LTTA, ADTCO 3 SA, ADTCO 3 CA, ADTCO 3 GLA, ADTCO 3 GA) were synthesised. Of the sixteen co-crystals 5 were identified as ADTCO 3 BA “salt” co-crystal polymorphic forms and 2 as ADTCO 3 SUC co-crystal polymorphic forms. Two solvated “salt” co-crystal forms were also identified, namely; ADTCO 3 GLA and ADTCO 3 LTTA. ADTCO 3 GLA had a mass loss of 10. 3 % (n = 2. 4) and ADTCO 3 LTTA had a mass loss of 5. 25 % (n = 0. 86).

40|$|Protein {{crystals}} populate diverse conformational ensembles. Despite {{much evidence}} that there is widespread conformational polymorphism in protein side chains, most of the xray crystallography data are modelled by single conformations in the Protein Data Bank. The ability to extract or to predict these conformational polymorphisms is of crucial importance, as it facilitates deeper understanding of protein dynamics and functionality. This dissertation describes a computational strategy capable of predicting side-chain polymorphisms. The applied approach extends a particular class of algorithms for side-chain prediction by modelling the side-chain dihedral angles more appropriately as continuous rather than discrete variables. Employing a new inferential technique known as particle belief propagation (PBP), we predict residue-speci c distributions that encode information about side-chain polymorphisms. The predicted polymorphisms are in relatively close agreement with results from a state-of-the-art approach based on x-ray crystallography data. This approach characterizes the conformational polymorphisms of side chains using electron density information, and has successfully discovered previously unmodelled conformations. Furthermore, {{it is known that}} coupled uctuations and concerted motions of residues can reveal pathways of communication used for information propagation in a molecule and hence, can help in understanding the " phenomenon in proteins. In order to characterize the coupled motions, most existing methods infer structural dependencies among a protein's residues. However, recent studies have highlighted the role of coupled side-chain uctuations alone in the allosteric behaviour of proteins, in contrast to a common belief that the backbone motions play the main role in allostery. These studies and the aforementioned recent discoveries about prevalent alternate side-chain conformations (conformational polymorphism) accentuate the need to devise new computational approaches that acknowledge side chains' roles. As well, these approaches must consider the polymorphic nature of the side chains, and incorporate e ects of this <b>phenomenon</b> (<b>polymorphism)</b> in the study of information transmission and functional interactions of residues in a molecule. Such frameworks can provide a more accurate understanding of the allosteric behaviour. Hence, as a topic related to the conformational polymorphism, this dissertation addresses the problem of inferring directly coupled side chains, as well. First, we present a novel approach to generate an ensemble of conformations and an e cient computational method to extract direct couplings of side chains in allosteric proteins. These direct couplings are used to provide sparse network representations of the coupled side chains. The framework is based on a fairly new statistical method, named graphical lasso (GLASSO), iii devised for sparse graph estimation. In the proposed GLASSO-based framework, the sidechain conformational polymorphism is taken into account. It is shown that by studying the intrinsic dynamics of an inactive structure alone, we are able to construct a network of functionally crucial residues. Second, we show that the proposed method is capable of providing a magni ed view of the coupled and conformationally polymorphic side chains. This model reveals couplings between the alternate conformations of a coupled residue pair. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst computational method for extracting networks of side chains' alternate conformations. Such networks help in providing a detailed image of side-chain dynamics in functionally important and conformationally polymorphic sites, such as binding and/or allosteric sites. This information may assist in new drug-design alternatives. Side-chain conformations are commonly represented by multivariate angular variables. However, the GLASSO and other existing methods that {{can be applied to the}} aforementioned inference task are not capable of handling multivariate angular data. This dissertation further proposes a novel method to infer direct couplings from this type of data, and shows that this method is useful for identifying functional regions and their interactions in allosteric proteins. The proposed framework is a novel extension of canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which we call partial CCA" (or simply KPCCA). Using the conformational information and uctuations of the inactive structure alone for allosteric proteins in the Ras and other Ras-like families, the KPCCA method identi ed allosterically important residues not only as strongly coupled ones but also in densely connected regions of the interaction graph formed by the inferred couplings. The results were in good agreement with other empirical ndings and outperformed those obtained by the GLASSO-based framework. By studying distinct members of the Ras, Rho, and Rab sub-families, we show further that KPCCA is capable of inferring common allosteric characteristics in the small G protein super-family...|$|R
40|$|FOR FIGURES REFER THE MAIN PDF FILE) Supramoleculr chemistry, aptly termed by Lehn as {{the study}} of {{molecular}} sociology, is the chemistry of the intermolecular bond, focusing on the structures and functions of “supermolecules” –chemical system formed by the association between two or more molecular components. While interrelated, this discipline forges beyond the domain of traditional molecular chemistry, which seeks to master the manipulation of the covalent bond between atoms and uncover the principle that governs the structures and properties of molecular species. Supramolecular chemistry assayas to blend the comprehensive resources of molecular chemistry with designed control of the intermolecular interactions to engineers supramolecular with features as well defined {{as those of the}} constituent molecular themselves. Not surprisingly, it has been stated that supramoleculars are to molecules and the intermolecular bond what molecules are to atoms and the covalent bond. In the realm of molecular crystals, the focus of supramolecular chemistry and indeed, the scope of the present thesis coverings with that of a rather recent, but rapidly emerging scientific discipline, namely crystal engineering. Coined nearly four decades ago in connection with photodimerization reaction in crystalline cinnamic acids, the term” crystal engineering” has since then broadened its expanse considerably and is, at present, most appropriately defined as“the understanding of intermolecular interactions in the context of crystal packing and the utilization of such understanding in the design of new solids with desired physical and chemical properties”. It would be befitting to remark that it is very pursuit (and more often than not, the elusive target) of being able to make functional solids by design that has allowed crystal engineering to evolve from an object of mere Scientific curiosity to a subject of tremendous utilization value. No proof for this assertion might be greater than that which lies in the fervent efforts put forth by pharmaceutical companies in understanding and controlling drug polymorphism, especially {{in the wake of the}} contemporary legal implications attendant with observing such a <b>phenomenon.</b> <b>Polymorphism</b> in molecular crystals results from the possibility of at least two different arrangements of the molecular of a given compound in the solid state and has therefore often been regarded as the” dark side” of crystal engineering. On one hand, polymorphism presents itself as an important probe in {{the study of}} structure-property relationship and allows elucidation of the varied macroscopic properties of the same molecule self-assembled in different crystalline environments. On the other hand, the phenomenon poses an implicit complication when predicating the product of a crystallization process forms the goal of a crystal engineering project. This is particularly true in case of crystal structure prediction (CSP) from the molecular structure of a given compound, where the experimentally obtained polymorphic modification may be a kinetic form and therefore, need not correspond to the one ranked lowest in energy from the computational studies. Indeed, this dichotomy between a thermodynamically and a kinetically controlled crystallization process reflects the underlying uncertainty associated with judging the outcome of a crystallization event. In this concept of a supramolecular synthon has been postulated to assimilate both thermodynamic and kinetic alternative, and therefore provide a working model for heuristic crystal design. By analogy with corey’s definition of a molecular synthon, a supramolecular synhon has been described” a structural unit within a supramolecule which can be formed and/or assembled by known or conceivable synthetic operations involving intermolecular interactions”. Being entirely probabilistic in nature, the robutness and thus, the transferability of a particular synthon to a designed crystal is assessed from a systermatic evolution of its recurrence in crystal structures of representative molecules. The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), which announced the inclusion of the 500000 th crystal structures in its archives last year, provides an invaluable cache of experimentally determined structures and the foundation for crystal design in this regard. The practically of the supramolecular synthon approach, now almost synthymous with crystal engineering, has been demonstrated not only in the successful design of a number of functional solids, but also in its possible application in CSP as a knowledge-based alternative. Irrespective of the approach, a basic paradigm can however be constructed from any crystal engineering strategy, viz. construct the molecular building blocks and assemble these, with a prior knowledge of the possible non-covalent interactions, in a manner that leads to the desired crystal structure. This premise will form the central theme of the present thesis, entitled “From molecular to supramolecular: Probing solid state self –assemblies of conformatonally locked polycyclitos and structural siblings”. The dissertation will deal with the nuances of the self-assemblies of four classes of structurally related crystalline polycyclie compounds, all fashioned from a prototypical rigid trans-decalin backbone derived from commonly available aromatic precursors like naphthalene and anthracene. The thesis will be presented in four chapters, each based on one of the four functional make-ups present in the molecular under study. • Chapter 1. Relating intramolecular O-H…Ohydrogen bondigs to conformational locking: Design and self-assemblies of crystalline polyclitols. • Chapter 2. Preferences of supramolecular assemblies towards competing inter- and intramolecular O-H…O hydrogen bonds: A case study in crystalline acyldervaeives of conformarionally locked polyclitols. •Chapter 3. Synthesis of novel polyhydroxylated flustrates: Probing fluorine interactions in a conformatonally constructed environment. • Chapter 4. Strength vs. accessiblity: Universe the patterns of self-recognition in designer conformationally locked aminoacohols. A brief overview of each chapter is presented below. The first chapter of the thesis investigates the supramolecular chemistry of an O-H…O Hydrogen Bond formed between hydroxyl groups that have been constrained to occupy spatiality invariant position in the crystal structure of a polycyclitol (a portmanteau word derived from polycyclic cyclitol). Having been constructed on a grid trans-decalin carbocyclic backbone, the polycyclitols under study 1 - 6 are conformatonally locked and destined to exhibit an axial rich disposition of the hydroxyl groups, so that the OH functionalities in 1, 3 -relationship are automatically brought into a favorable geometry for the formation of intramolecular O-H…O hydrogen bonds. Working within this paradigm, which was formulated both logically and on the basis of the observed H-bonding patterns in the crystal structures of several conformationally locked polyols, we were able to demonstrate that intramolecular H-bonding between 1, 3 -syndisxial OH groups can be used as a tool to preordain the position of the intermolecular O-H…O-bond donors and accepts in the specially crafted polycyclitols 1 - 3. this observation not only simplified a qualitative visualization of the various packing patterns in 1 - 3, but also allowed us to propose, based on previously reported CSD analysis, the packing motifs mostlikely to converge with the experimental results. Despite its qualitative nature, the O-H…O hydrogen bonding patters, proposed for 1 - 3 were found to conform well with those observed experimentally for the tetrols 1 and 3, and even for the two polymorphic modifications of the hexol 2 [Figure 1] The determination role played by intramolecular O-H…O bonding in the supramolecular assembly of 2, a novel bicycle C 2 h symmetric hexol having an all axial disposition of the six hydroxyl functionalities, prompted us to study the crystal packing of the three diastereomeric perhydro- 2, 3, 4 q, 6, 6, 8 a-naphthalenehexols 4 - 6. the end-to-end co-operative intramolecular O-H…O-H hydrogen bonding chain on both faces of the molecule, as observed in case of 2, through an axial-equatorial.

With increased freedom now allowed to the OH groups in the choice of their H-bonding partners, as a compared to 2 crystal packing in the polycyclitols 4 - 6 evolved from the simplistic model of hydrogen bonding proposed and observed for 2,to ivoke more complex patterns of self assembly mediated through O-H…O-bonds In the second chapter, the crystal structures of four conformationally locked esters, namely tetraaccetate 7 /tetrabenzoate 8 of hexol 2 and the diacetate 9 /dibenzoate 10 of tetrol 1,have been analyzed in order to examine the preference of their supramolecular assemblies towards competing inter and intramolecular O-H…O hydrogen bonds. To this end, all the four esters under study were specially crafted on a trans-decalin backbone with the objective of relegating the O-H…O H-bond donors(in form of the 30 OH groups) to the molecular interior and having the peripheral H-bond accepters (in form of the 20 acyl groups) in 1, 3 -syndiaxial relationship. It was anticipated that this common design element would allow the supramolecular assembly of the easters to evolve along two possible pathway, namely one which employs intermoleculars O-H…O H-bonds (pathway 1) and the other that sacrifises those for intramolecular O-H…O H-bonds and settles for a crystal packing dictated by weak intermolecular interactions alone (pathway|$|R
