The most significant contributor to application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> project failure lies in the misalignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality of the application <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> While various IT control frameworks that may assist in the implementation of application <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> are available, the question arises why industry still reports that the success rate of application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implementation projects remains low. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the extent to which the Projects in Controlled Environment (PRINCE 2) framework assists in the alignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality provided by the application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implemented. This study investigated whether PRINCE 2 addresses all the reasons for project failure. It identifies the shortcomings and weaknesses in PRINCE 2 which may contribute to the misalignment between the business processes of the organisation and the functionality of the application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implemented. The study recommends how these weaknesses identified in PRINCE 2 can be addressed. By taking these recommendations into account when using PRINCE 2 to implement application <b>software</b> <b>packages,</b> proper alignment between the organisation’s business processes and the functionality of the application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> may be achieved.
