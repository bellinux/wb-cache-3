5|$|In May 1783, General Matthews {{was accused}} of <b>procrastination</b> and {{suspended}} by the Bombay Government. Thereafter Colonel John Campbell received provisional command of the strategic fort of Mangalore on 5 May 1783. Tipu made several assaults on the Mangalore fort up until January 1784, all of which resulted in failure. Looking at the wounded embattled garrison, Colonel Campbell considered it futile to hold out any longer. He finally delivered the Mangalore fort to Tipu when the British capitulated on 30 January 1784. On 11 March 1784, Tipu and the British East India Company signed the Treaty of Mangalore, thus bringing {{an end to the}} Second Anglo-Mysore War.|$|E
5|$|The Dardanelles Commission, {{including}} Fisher, interviewed {{witnesses in}} 1916 and 1917 and issued its final report in 1919. It {{concluded that the}} expedition was poorly planned and executed and that difficulties had been underestimated, problems which were exacerbated by supply shortages and by personality clashes and <b>procrastination</b> at high levels. Some 480,000 Allied troops had been dedicated to the failed campaign, with around half in casualties. The report's conclusions were regarded as insipid with no figures (political or military) heavily censured. The report of the Commission and information gathered by the inquiry remain a key source of documents on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian <b>procrastination</b> on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.|$|E

5|$|The same day, Bottomley {{wrote to}} Smith, {{saying that he}} and Wilson were disheartened {{by the lack of}} {{progress}} regarding both independence and the Lisbon appointment. He was willing to visit Rhodesia personally, but could not come until October because he had to be in Blackpool to attend the Labour Party Conference, due to commence on 26 September. The next morning, on 8 September, Johnston told Smith that if Reedman proceeded to Portugal in open disregard for Britain's wishes, it would negatively affect future independence negotiations. Rhodesia's delay in justifying the appointment was also having a detrimental affect, Johnston asserted. Finally, he threatened to evict the Rhodesian envoys from Washington, Bonn and Tokyo if Rhodesia did not desist. Smith was yet again unmoved. Any <b>procrastination</b> regarding Lisbon was Britain's fault, he insisted. He told Johnston to wait for the afternoon session in Rhodesia's Legislative Assembly to hear Dupont's official announcement of Reedman's appointment, as well as the full Rhodesian explanation behind it.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. <b>Procrastination,</b> which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
25|$|To {{a certain}} degree it is normal to procrastinate {{and it can be}} {{regarded}} as a useful way to identify what is important, due to a lower tendency of <b>procrastination</b> on truly valued tasks (for most people). On the other hand, excessive <b>procrastination</b> can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, <b>procrastination</b> has been found to result in health problems, stress, anxiety, sense of guilt and crisis as well as loss of personal productivity and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further <b>procrastination</b> and for some individuals <b>procrastination</b> gets almost chronic. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to <b>procrastination</b> itself, but also social stigma and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of willpower or low ambition. In some cases problematic <b>procrastination</b> might be a sign of some underlying psychological disorder, but not necessarily.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more as a warning to the young sovereigns. Her <b>procrastinations</b> and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|R
40|$|Responsibility for {{the future}} is very often a matter of {{foresight}} and foresight is always based on insight, as we all know. What does my insight tell me about this whole issue or problem? It informs me that the modern Arabs are truly the Hamlet of the 20 th century. Like the endlessly celebrated prince, they seem able continually to join the underlying passion of the elemental to the brooding intellectuality of the cerebral to the lyrical sensitivity of the poetic but only to end up in unrelieved tragedy. The tragedy consists of unending hesitations, <b>procrastinations,</b> oscillations and waverings between the old and the new, between asalah and muca sarah (authenticty and contemporaneity), between turath and tajdid (heritage and renewal), between huwiyyah and hadathah (identity and modernity), between religions and secularity...|$|R

25|$|Procrastinators {{have been}} found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al. (1997) report that {{more than one-third of the}} {{variation}} in final exam scores could be attributed to <b>procrastination.</b> The negative association between <b>procrastination</b> and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used <b>procrastination</b> scales were not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of <b>procrastination</b> on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.|$|E
25|$|For some people, <b>procrastination</b> can be {{persistent}} and tremendously disruptive to everyday life. For these individuals, <b>procrastination</b> may be symptomatic of a psychological disorder. <b>Procrastination</b> {{has been linked}} to a number of negative associations, such as depression, irrational behaviour, low self-esteem, anxiety and neurological disorders such as ADHD. Others have found relationships with guilt and stress. Therefore, it is important for people whose <b>procrastination</b> has become chronic and is perceived to be debilitating to seek out a trained therapist or psychiatrist to see if an underlying mental health issue may be present.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} study to empirically analyze the economics of private (out-of-court) debt restructurings of financially distressed Japanese companies spanning the period from the burst of the bubble economy of Japan in 1990 {{to the time when}} the excessive bad debt problems of major firms were recognized as resolved in March 2005 {{on the basis of the}} stock prices of more than 200 restructurings. In Japan the mechanism of corporate monitoring is not market based (shareholder and public bondholder based) but large-investor based (large stakeholder based) —typically, banks and affiliated companies. These stakeholders are expected to efficiently resolve potential bankruptcy or collapse with better information resulting from their long-term relationship with the distressed firms. In contrast, however, this study finds that out-of-court restructurings led by banks or affiliated companies failed to gain the trust of the market because of their <b>procrastinations</b> in implementing fundamental solutions; and therefore, there is a need for third-party monitoring. Compared to the analysis of out-of-court settlements in the United States by Gilson et al. (1990), this study finds that agreements on out-of-court restructuring in Japan are attained more easily than in the United States. However, without third-party mediation, no fundamental changes can be expected from the restructurings. This forbearance by banks and affiliated companies in addressing the needs of distressed firms indicates the weakness of banks and affiliated companies in instituting discipline among themselves, thereby showing the importance of instituting a system to “monitor the monitor”...|$|R

60|$|Our {{friends in}} Washington watched the weary days go by, {{while they waited}} for Pete and covered his name with reproaches because of his calamitous <b>procrastinations.</b> Meantime, Sally Sellers, who was as {{practical}} and democratic as the Lady Gwendolen Sellers was romantic and aristocratic, was leading a life of intense interest and activity and getting the most she could out of her double personality. All day long {{in the privacy of}} her work-room, Sally Sellers earned bread for the Sellers family; and all the evening Lady Gwendolen Sellers supported the Rossmore dignity. All day she was American, practically, and proud of the work of her head and hands and its commercial result; all the evening she took holiday and dwelt in a rich shadow-land peopled with titled and coroneted fictions. By day, to her, the place was a plain, unaffected, ramshackle old trap just that, and nothing more; by night it was Rossmore Towers. At college she had learned a trade without knowing it. The girls had found out that she was the designer of her own gowns. She had no idle moments after that, and wanted none; for the exercise of an extraordinary gift is the supremest pleasure in life, and it was manifest that Sally Sellers possessed a gift of that sort in the matter of costume-designing. Within three days after reaching home she had hunted up some work; before Pete was yet due in Washington, and before the twins were fairly asleep in English soil, she was already nearly swamped with work, and the sacrificing of the family chromos for debt had got an effective check.|$|R
25|$|In 2005 a study {{conducted}} by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi was published in the Journal of Social Psychology, in which they intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of <b>procrastination</b> as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis & Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional <b>procrastination</b> which they denote as passive, and active <b>procrastination</b> where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active <b>procrastination</b> positive <b>procrastination,</b> as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological <b>procrastination</b> traits were avoided.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the reasons}} for the {{relationship}} are not clear, there also exists a relationship between <b>procrastination</b> and eveningness; that is, those who procrastinate more are more likely to go to sleep later and wake later. It is known that conscientiousness increases across the lifespan, as does morningness. <b>Procrastination</b> too decreases with age. However, even controlling for age, there still exists a relationship between <b>procrastination</b> and eveningness, which is yet to be explained.|$|E
25|$|<b>Procrastination</b> is {{considerably}} more widespread in students {{than in the}} general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting <b>procrastination</b> for assignments at some point. A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic <b>procrastination</b> increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct. This study argues that academic misconduct {{can be seen as}} a means to cope with the negative consequences of academic <b>procrastination</b> such as performance impairment.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to help Telefonica, a Spanish {{integrated}} operator, reduce time-to-market of its new offer or product/service innovation by closely observing and evaluating the current development process of its new offer. The research includes the review of current literature on product and service characteristics and new product and service development model, and participant observation conducted in relevant units actively involved in development process. The contributions of this thesis are threefold: First, characteristics of Telefonica’s offer to its multinational customers were examined and the finding indicated that the offer is categorized as product/service with service dominance. That added value to the next exercise of the improvement of new offer or product/service development speed. Second, investigation of the firm’s current new product/service development process with an attempt to perform evaluation and consequently recommendations were made based on the literature review stated above by closely looking at {{the interaction of the}} involved participants in development process and how the firm carried out its development process was conducted. The findings indicated that Telefonica selected the right development model for its new product/service innovation, yet there exist some weaknesses in its current development process. Therefore, implications were made so that Telefonica is able to get the best from its adopted model, Stage-gate. Third, from the investigation a generic view of new product/service development process in telecommunication industry was formed. The beneficiaries of this last finding are the practitioners in the product/service development in telecommunication market because from that pattern they could clearly view core elements to be carefully considered during the development period. The research recommends practitioners to encourage informal internal communication between project members of new product/service development process as it helps them to build up knowledge for problem solving as well as for finishing deliverables fast. Moreover, management involvement is strongly advised in order to ensure quality of the tasks done by the teams, accurately assess resources that will be needed throughout the project, and prevent <b>procrastinations</b> of the project members...|$|R

25|$|Perfectionism {{is a prime}} {{cause for}} <b>procrastination</b> because {{demanding}} perfection usually results in failure. Unrealistic expectations destroy self-esteem and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness.

25|$|Several studies {{investigated}} {{factors that}} influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic <b>procrastination</b> predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic <b>procrastination.</b> It {{has been argued that}} by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic <b>procrastination</b> such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize. When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|Research on the {{physiological}} roots of <b>procrastination</b> {{have been concerned}} {{with the role of}} the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain that is responsible for executive brain functions such as impulse control, attention and planning. Which is consistent with the notion that <b>procrastination</b> is strongly related to exactly these functions, or lack of them. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli, from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this area of the brain can reduce an individual's ability to filter out distracting stimuli and result in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased <b>procrastination.</b> This is similar to the prefrontal lobe's role in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, where it is commonly underactivated.|$|E

25|$|According to an Educational Science Professor, Hatice Odaci, {{academic}} <b>procrastination</b> is {{a significant}} problem during college years in part because many college students lack efficient time management skills in using the Internet.
