Regardless of the application, {{the objective is to}} open pores in the cell membrane and hence either facilitate the delivery of foreign materials inside the cell, or to kill the cell completely. Pulsed power supplies are needed for electroporation, which is the process of applying pulsed electric fields to biological cells to induce a temporary permeability in the cell membrane. The applications of pulsed electric fields are dependent on the output pulse shape and pulse parameters, both of which can be affected by the circuit parameters of the pulsed power supply and the conductivity of the media being treated.

40|$|The {{power supply}} designs {{discussed}} in the accompanying article are those of-hp-’r Harrison laboratories division. H-Labs was formed in 1954 to design and build specialized equipment for TV studios, the first product being an aperture equal-izer for TV camera chains. In 1955 H-Labs designed a power supply {{as a part of}} a TV equipment package, the specifications requiring that the power supply have low impedance at the color sub-carrier frequency. The H-Lab supply designed far this requirement performed so well and so reliably that addi-tional orders came. As H-Labs ‘ reputation grew, power supplies came to be the major item in H-Labs ‘ product line. Growing at a very high rate, Harrison Labs turned to outside sources in expanding its facilities, resulting in its association with-hp-. Harrison Laboratories of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, with William Harrison as manager, is now a division of Hewlett-Packard. It is expected that-hp-’s future efforts in the d-c solid-state power supply field will be centered at H-Labs. c OPHISTICATION in laboratory power supply design is bringing more flexibility to these instruments and new conveniences to the user. Remote programming, remote sensing, and the ability to operate with one-knob control either in series or in parallel with other supplies are some of the features presently being designed into power supplies. Power supply performance now includes full overload protection through adjustable cur-rent limiting, low output impedance over a wide band of frequencies, short recovery time to instantaneous changes in line voltage or load current and no overshoot on turn-on, turn-off or power failures. At the same time, better use of components results in compact units of high efficiency and low heat dissipation.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{power consumption}} and power density demands of modern technologies {{have increased the}} technical requirements of DC/DC and AC/DC power supplies. In this regard, the primary objective of the power supply researcher/engineer is to build energy efficient, high power density converters by reducing the losses and increasing the switching frequency of converters respectively. Operating the converter circuits at higher switching frequencies reduces {{the size of the}} passive components such as transformers, inductors, and capacitors, which results in a compact size, weight, and increased power density of the converter. Therefore, the thesis work is focussed on the design, analysis and evaluation of isolated converters operating in the 1 - 5 MHz frequency region {{with the assistance of the}} latest semi conductor devices, both coreless and core based planar power transformers designed in Mid Sweden University and which are suitable for consumer applications of varying power levels ranging from 1 – 60 W. In high frequency converter circuits, since the MOSFET gate driver plays a prominent role, different commercially available MOSFET gate drivers were evaluated in the frequency range of 1 - 5 MHz in terms of gate drive power consumption, rise/fall times and electromagnetic interference (EMI) and a suitable driver was proposed. Initially, the research was focused on the design and evaluation of a quasi resonant flyback converter using a multilayered coreless PCB step down transformer in the frequency range of 2. 7 – 4 MHz up to the power level of 10 W. The energy efficiency of this converter is found to be 72 - 84 % under zero voltage switching conditions (ZVS). In order to further improve the energy efficiency of the converter in the MHz frequency region, the new material device GaN HEMT was considered. The comparisons were made on a quasi resonant flyback DC-DC converter using both the Si and GaN technology and it was found that an energy efficiency improvement of 8 – 10 % was obtained with the GaN device in the frequency range of 3. 2 – 5 MHz. In order to minimize the gate drive power consumption, switching losses and to increase the frequency of the converter in some applications such as laptop adapters, set top box (STB) etc., a cascode flyback converter using a low voltage GaN HEMT and a high voltage Si MOSFET was designed and evaluated using a multi-layered coreless PCB transformer in the MHz frequency region. Both the simulation and experimental results have shown that, with the assistance of the cascode flyback converter, the switching speeds of the converter can be increased with the benefit of obtaining a significant improvement in the energy efficiency as compared to that for the single switch flyback converter. In order to further maximize the utilization of the transformer, to reduce the voltage stress on MOSFETs and to obtain the maximum power density from the converter circuit, double ended topologies were considered. Due to the lack of high voltage high side gate drivers in the MHz frequency region, a gate drive circuitry utilizing the multi-layered coreless PCB signal transformer was designed and evaluated in both a half-bridge and series resonant converter (SRC). It was found that the gate drive power consumption using this transformer was around 0. 66 W for the frequency range of 1. 5 - v 3. 75 MHz. In addition, by using this gate drive circuitry, the maximum energy efficiency of the SRC using multilayered coreless PCB power transformer was found to be 86. 5 % with an output power of 36. 5 W in the switching frequency range of 2 – 3 MHz. In order to further enhance the energy efficiency of the converter to more than 90 %, investigations were carried out by using the multiresonant converter topology (LCC and LLC), novel hybrid core high frequency planar power transformer and the GaN HEMTs. The simulated and experimental results of the designed LCC resonant converter show that it is feasible to obtain higher energy efficiency isolated DC/DC converters in the MHz frequency region. The peak energy efficiency of the LCC converter at 3. 5 MHz is reported to be 92 % using synchronous rectification. Different modulation techniques were implemented to regulate the converter for both line and load variations using a digital controller. In order to realize an AC/DC converter suitable for a laptop adapter application, consideration was given to the low line of the universal input voltage range due to the GaN switch limitation. The energy efficiency of the regulated converter operating in the frequency range of 2. 8 – 3. 5 MHz is reported to be more than 90 % with a load power of 45 W and an output voltage of 22 V dc. In order to determine an efficient power processing method on the secondary side of the converter, a comparison was made between diode rectification and synchronous rectification and optimal rectification was proposed for the converters operating in the MHz frequency range for a given power transfer application. In order to maintain high energy efficiency for a wide load range and to maintain the narrow switching frequency range for the given input voltage specifications, the LLC resonant converter has been designed and evaluated for the adapter application. From the observed results, the energy efficiency of the LLC resonant converter is maintained at a high level for a wide load range as compared to that for the LCC resonant converter. Investigations were also carried out on isolated class E resonant DC-DC converter with the assistance of GaN HEMT and a high performance planar power transformer at the switching frequency of 5 MHz. The simulated energy efficiency of the converter for the output power level of 16 W is obtained as 88. 5 % which makes it feasible to utilize the designed isolated converter for various applications that require light weight and low profile converters. In conclusion, the research in this dissertation has addressed various issues related to high frequency isolated converters and has proposed solution by designing highly energy efficient converters to meet the current industrial trends by using coreless and core based planar transformer technologies along with the assistance of GaN HEMTs. With the provided solution, in the near future, it is feasible to realize low profile, high power density DC/DC and AC/DC converters operating in MHz frequency region suitable for various applications.
