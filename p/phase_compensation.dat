We then showed that our dynamical model can reproduce the heart remodeling during these two <b>phases</b> (<b>compensation</b> and decompensation of the right ventricle). After the <b>compensation</b> <b>phase,</b> the right ventricle can no longer maintain the cardiac output without the help of the left ventricle, which produces a part of the required work with the side effect of inflating the right ventricle.|$|R

The hybrid mitigation algorithm is optimized to approach to high phase noise and low phase noise environment, and a hybrid half-blind <b>phase</b> noise <b>compensation</b> algorithm is proposed, {{which could be}} suitable to shifty DFB laser linewidth. 4 QAM and 16 QAM are used to modulate binary signal. The new proposed <b>phase</b> noise <b>compensation</b> algorithm is considered a mitigation method which has the ability of half-blind self-adaptation. It deduces the coefficient matrix in high and low <b>phase</b> noise <b>compensation</b> matrix and could improve performance under high or low modulation index situation...|$|R

Number on top of figure 1 corresponds with the Q number, 1=Q1, 2=Q2 etc. The results {{are close to the}} results presented in Wang’s book (each trace is scaled individually, so artefacts are stronger on trace 5 than on trace 4). However, Wang also considered <b>phase</b> <b>compensation.</b> Computations here are for amplitude only inversion since the <b>phase</b> <b>compensation</b> is unnecessary to demonstrate instability because it is always stable.|$|E

40|$|For {{constant}} voltage constant frequency pulse-width modulation (PWM) inverter system, repetitive control (RC) can achieve zero steady-state tracking error for any periodic signal. Multi-rate repetitive control (MRC), which is featured by a fast system sampling rate and a reduced RC rate, {{is able to}} lower CPU computation load while achieving low tracking error and fast convergence speed. To accurately compensate the phase lag of MRC, this paper proposes a fractional-order <b>phase</b> lead <b>compensation</b> solution to further improve the tracking performance. Implemented with a Lagrange polynomial, the fractional-order phase lead compensator has more accurate and flexible <b>phase</b> lead <b>compensation</b> than traditional <b>phase</b> lead compensator.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} recent {{advances}} in digital signal processing techniques for compensation of the laser phase noise and fiber nonlinearity impairments in coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) transmission. For laser <b>phase</b> noise <b>compensation,</b> we focus on quasi-pilot-aided (QPA) and decision-directed-free blind (DDF-blind) <b>phase</b> noise <b>compensation</b> techniques.

40|$|A radio {{frequency}} (RF) carrier {{can be used}} to mitigate the phase noise impact in n-level PSK and QAM systems. The systems performance is influenced by the use of an RF pilot carrier to accomplish <b>phase</b> noise <b>compensation</b> through complex multiplication in combination with discrete filters to compensate for the chromatic dispersion (CD). We perform a detailed study comparing two filters for the CD compensation namely the fixed frequency domain equalizer (FDE) filter and the adaptive least-mean-square (LMS) filter. The study provides important novel physical insight into the equalization enhanced phase noise (EEPN) influence on the system bit-error-rate (BER) versus optical signal-to-noise-ratio (OSNR) performance. Important results of the analysis are that the FDE filter position relative to the RF carrier <b>phase</b> noise <b>compensation</b> module provides a possibility for choosing whether the EEPN from the Tx or the LO laser influences the system quality. The LMS filter works very inefficiently when placed prior to the RF <b>phase</b> noise <b>compensation</b> stage of the Rx whereas it works much more efficiently and gives almost the same performance as the FDE filter when placed after the RF <b>phase</b> noise <b>compensation</b> stage...|$|R

50|$|With {{this system}} a phase-compensated, waveguiding {{system could be}} produced.

Furthermore, by changing the index {{of any of the}} DPS-DNG pairs, the speed at which the beam enters the front face, and exits the back face of the entire stack-system changes. In this manner, a volumetric, low loss, time delay transmission line could be realized for a given system.|$|E

Assume {{that the}} intrinsic impedance of the DPS dielectric material (d1) {{is the same}} as that of the outside region and responding to a normally incident planar wave. The wave travels through the medium without any reflection because the DPS impedance and the outside impedance are equal. However, the plane wave at the end of DPS slab is out of phase with the plane wave at the beginning of the material.|$|E

40|$|Repetitive control (RC) with linear <b>phase</b> lead <b>compensation</b> {{provides}} {{a simple but}} very effective control solution for any periodic signal with a known period. Multirate repetitive control (MRC) with a downsampling rate can reduce the need of memory size and computational cost, and then leads to a more feasible design of the plug-in repetitive control systems in practical applications. However, with fixed sampling rate, both MRC and its linear phase lead compensator {{are sensitive to the}} ratio of the sampling frequency to the frequency of interested periodic signals: (1) MRC might fails to exactly compensate the periodic signal {{in the case of a}} fractional ratio; (2) linear <b>phase</b> lead <b>compensation</b> might fail to enable MRC to achieve satisfactory performance in the case of a low ratio. In this paper, a universal fractional-order design of linear <b>phase</b> lead <b>compensation</b> MRC is proposed to tackle periodic signals with high accuracy, fast dynamic response, good robustness, and cost-effective implementation regardless of the frequency ratio, which offers a unified framework for housing various RC schemes in extensive engineering application.

5000|$|In the Bode plot of a {{transimpedance}} amplifier {{that has a}} compensation capacitor in the feedback path, the compensated feedback factor, plotted as a reciprocal, 1/β, starts to roll off before fi, reducing the slope at the intercept. The loop gain is still unity, but the total phase shift is not a full 360°. One of the requirements for oscillation is eliminated {{with the addition of}} the compensation capacitor, and so the circuit has stability. This also reduces the gain peaking, producing a flatter overall response. There are several methods used to calculate the compensation capacitor's value. A compensation capacitor that has a too large value will reduce the bandwidth of the amplifier. If the capacitor is too small, then oscillation may occur. [...] One difficulty with this method of <b>phase</b> <b>compensation</b> is the resulting small value of the capacitor, and the iterative method often required to optimize the value. There is no explicit formula for calculating the capacitor value that works for all cases. A compensation method that uses a larger-value capacitor that is not as susceptible to parasitic capacitance effects can also be used.|$|E
50|$|Microwave imaging is {{a science}} which has been evolved from older detecting/locating {{techniques}} (e.g., radar) in order to evaluate hidden or embedded objects in a structure (or media)using electromagnetic (EM) waves in microwave regime (i.e., ~300 MHz-300 GHz). Microwave imaging techniques can be classified as either quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative imaging techniques (are also known as inverse scattering methods) give the electrical (i.e., electrical and magnetic property distribution) and geometrical parameters (i.e., shape, size and location) of an imaged object by solving a nonlinear inverse problem. The nonlinear inverse problem is converted into a linear inverse problem (i.e., Ax=b where A and b are known and x (or image) is unknown) by using Born or distorted Born approximations. Despite the fact that direct matrix inversion methods can be invoked to solve the inversion problem, this will be so costly when {{the size of the}} problem is so big (i.e., when A is a very dense and big matrix). To overcome this problem, direct inversion is replaced with iterative solvers. Techniques in this class are called forward iterative methods which are usually time consuming.On the other hand, qualitative microwave imaging methods calculate a qualitative profile (which is called as reflectivity function or qualitative image) to represent the hidden object. These techniques use approximations to simplify the imaging problem and then they use back-propagation (also called time reversal, <b>phase</b> <b>compensation,</b> or back-migration) to reconstruct the unknown image profile. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and frequency-wave number migration algorithm {{are some of the most}} popular qualitative microwave imaging methods1.|$|E
50|$|The {{plane wave}} then enters the {{lossless}} NIM (d2). At certain frequencies ε < 0 and µ < 0 and n < 0. Like the DPS, the NIM has intrinsic impedance that {{is equal to}} the outside, and, therefore, is also lossless. The direction of power flow (i.e., the Poynting vector) in the first slab should be the same as that in the second one, because the power of the incident wave enters the first slab (without any reflection at the first interface), traverses the first slab, exits the second interface, enters the second slab and traverses it, and finally leaves the second slab. However, as stated earlier, the direction of power is anti-parallel to the direction of phase velocity. Therefore, the wave vector k2 is in the opposite direction of k1. Furthermore, whatever phase difference is developed by traversing the first slab can be decreased and even cancelled by traversing the second slab. If the ratio of the two thicknesses is d1 / d 2 = n2 / n1, then the total phase difference between the front and back faces is zero. This demonstrates how the NIM slab at chosen frequencies acts as a phase compensator. It {{is important to note that}} this <b>phase</b> <b>compensation</b> process is only on the ratio of d1 / d 2 rather than the thickness of d1 + d1. Therefore, d1 + d1 can be any value, as long as this ratio satisfies the above condition. Finally, even though this two-layer structure is present, the wave traversing this structure would not experience the phase difference.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{repetitive}} control (RC) with linear <b>phase</b> lead <b>compensation</b> {{to precisely}} track periodic trajectories in piezo-based scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). Quite often, the lateral scanning motion in SPMs during imaging or fabri-cation is periodic in time. Because of hysteresis and dynamic {{effects in the}} piezoactuator, the tracking error repeats from one scanning period to the next. Commercial SPMs typically em-ploy PID feedback controllers to minimize the tracking error; however, the error repeats from one operating cycle to the next. Furthermore, the residual error can be excessively large, espe-cially at high scan rates. A discrete-time repetitive controller was designed, analyzed, and implemented on an experimental SPM. The design of the RC incorporates two phase lead compensators to provide stability and to minimize the steady-state tracking er-ror. Associated with the lead compensators are two parameters that can be adjusted to control {{the performance of the}} repetitive controller. Experimental tracking results are presented that com-pare the performance of PID, standard RC, and the modified RC with <b>phase</b> lead <b>compensation.</b> The results show that the mod-ified RC reduces the steady-state tracking error to less than 2 % at 25 Hz scan rate, an over 80 % improvement compared to PID control. ...|$|R
