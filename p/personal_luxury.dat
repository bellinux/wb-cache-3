25|$|VAM {{executives}} and engineers sought {{to move the}} two-door 1976 American ECD from the limited edition status into a regular production model, and also change its concept from general luxury into a <b>personal</b> <b>luxury</b> vehicle, which VAM no longer offered since the mid-1976 discontinuation of the Classic Brougham (Matador Brougham coupe) model. Taking advantage of this upcoming new model was a plan of this group of employees to make a homage to VAM's general manager Gabriel Fernández Sáyago, {{one of the most}} respected men in the Mexican auto industry at the time and leader of the company since 1946. The new <b>personal</b> <b>luxury</b> compact was named after him using his initials as a designation. The model was presented to him as a surprise in late 1976, which he appreciated highly but opting for a more humble stance, he requested the model not to carry his name. The group of VAM employees respected his decision, but managed an indirect way to keep their original plan. Te general manager's initials were retained, but the meaning was changed into Grand Formula Sport. The model was introduced along with VAM's 1977 lineup as a two-door alternative to the American ECD and a luxury one to the sporty American Rally.|$|E

The general satisfaction was more marked as at that very time none of the family were, for several reasons, inclined to find favourable anything or any place over the Scottish border. Though the family was a large one, the prosperity of the business allowed them all sorts of <b>personal</b> <b>luxuries,</b> amongst which was a wide latitude in the way of dress. The frequency of the Markam girls' new frocks was a source of envy to their bosom friends and of joy to themselves.|$|R

Succeeding generations became larger until the line was downsized in 1977, again in 1980, and once again in 1983. Sales were good until the 1990s, when large 2-door coupes became unpopular; production ceased {{at the end of}} 1997. In 2002 production of the Thunderbird started again, a revived 2-seat model was launched, which was available {{through the end of the}} 2005 model year.
