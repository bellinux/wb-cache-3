50|$|The {{imperial}} <b>pint</b> (≈ 568 ml) {{is used in}} the United Kingdom and Ireland and to {{a limited}} extent in Commonwealth nations. In the United States, two <b>pints</b> are used: a liquid <b>pint</b> (≈ 473 ml) and a less-common dry <b>pint</b> (≈ 551 ml). Each of these <b>pints</b> is one-eighth of its respective gallon, but the gallons differ and the imperial <b>pint</b> is about 20% larger than the US liquid <b>pint.</b> This difference dates back to 1824, when the British Weights and Measures Act standardised various liquid measures throughout the British Empire, while the United States continued to use the earlier English measures. The imperial <b>pint</b> consists of 20 imperial fluid ounces and the US liquid <b>pint</b> is 16 US fluid ounces, making the imperial fluid ounce about 4% smaller than the US fluid ounce.|$|R
