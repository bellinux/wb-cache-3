5000|$|Victor [...] "Vic" [...] Poor (July 12, 1933 - August 17, 2012) was an {{engineer}} whose designs of {{hardware and software}} led to many innovations. At Computer Terminal Corporation (later renamed Datapoint Corporation), he co-created the architecture that was ultimately implemented in the first successful computer microprocessor, the Intel 8008. Subsequently, Computer Terminal Corporation created the first personal computer, the Datapoint 2200 <b>programmable</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Intel 8008 ("eight-thousand-eight" [...] or [...] "eighty-oh-eight") is {{an early}} byte-oriented {{microprocessor}} designed and manufactured by Intel and introduced in April 1972. It was an 8-bit CPU with an external 14-bit address bus that could address 16 KB of memory. Originally known as the 1201, the chip was commissioned by Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) to implement an instruction set of their design for their Datapoint 2200 <b>programmable</b> <b>terminal.</b> As the chip was delayed and did not meet CTC's performance goals, the 2200 ended up using CTC's own TTL-based CPU instead. An agreement permitted Intel to market the chip to other customers after Seiko {{expressed an interest in}} using it for a calculator.|$|E
5000|$|The Datapoint 2200 was a mass-produced <b>programmable</b> <b>terminal,</b> {{designed}} by Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) founders Phil Ray and Gus Roche [...] and announced by CTC in June 1970 (with units shipping in 1971). It was presented by CTC {{simply as a}} versatile and cost-efficient terminal for connecting {{to a wide variety}} of mainframes by loading various terminal emulations from tape rather than being hardwired as most contemporary terminals, including their earlier Datapoint 3300. However, enterprising users in the business sector (including Pillsbury Foods) realized that this so-called [...] "programmable terminal" [...] was equipped to perform any task a simple computer could and exploited this fact by using their 2200s as standalone computer systems. Its industrial designer John [...] "Jack" [...] Frassanito has later claimed that Ray and Roche always intended the Datapoint 2200 to be a full-blown personal computer, but that they chose to keep quiet about this so as not to concern investors and others. Also significant is the fact that the terminal's multi-chip CPU (processor) became the basis of the x86 architecture used in the original IBM PC and its descendants.|$|E

40|$|As {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} for some time, the computing and telecommunications technologies are converging. This has meant different things at different times. In this review paper, we describe {{the current state of}} convergence, and speculate about what it may mean in coming years. In particular, we argue {{that as a result of}} the horizontal integration of all media (voice, audio, video, animation, data) in a common network and terminal infrastructure, telecommunications and networked-computing applications are no longer distinguishable. Considering that the old terminology is no longer meaningful, we attempt to codify networked applications in accordance with their functionality and immediacy. As application functionality is increasingly defined in software, with commensurate cost-effective <b>programmable</b> <b>terminals</b> and means for distribution of applications over the network itself, we argue that user-to-user applications will be greatly impacted, moving into the rapid-innovation regime [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Released in June 1970, the <b>programmable</b> <b>terminal</b> {{called the}} Datapoint 2200 is the {{earliest}} known device that bears some significant resemblance to the modern personal computer, with a screen, keyboard, and program storage. It was made by CTC (now known as Datapoint) and was a complete system in a small case bearing the approximate footprint of an IBM Selectric typewriter. The system's CPU was constructed {{from a variety of}} discrete components, although the company had commissioned Intel to develop a single-chip processing unit; there was a falling out between CTC and Intel, and the chip Intel had developed wasn't used. Intel soon released a modified version of that chip as the Intel 8008, the world's first 8-bit microprocessor. The needs and requirements of the Datapoint 2200 therefore determined the nature of the 8008, upon which all successive processors used in IBM-compatible PCs were based. Additionally, the design of the Datapoint 2200's multi-chip CPU and the final design of the Intel 8008 were so similar that the two are largely software-compatible; therefore, the Datapoint 2200, from a practical perspective, functioned as if it were indeed powered by an 8008, making it a de facto microcomputer.|$|E

5000|$|In 1972, Intel {{launched}} the 8008, the first 8-bit microprocessor. It implemented an instruction set designed by Datapoint corporation with <b>programmable</b> CRT <b>terminals</b> in mind, which also {{proved to be}} fairly general-purpose. The device needed several additional ICs to produce a functional computer, {{in part due to}} it being packaged in a small 18-pin [...] "memory package", which ruled out the use of a separate address bus (Intel was primarily a DRAM manufacturer at the time).|$|R
40|$|The ADP-system LIBRIS-II is {{described}} {{with emphasis on}} its network structure. The connection of 10 libraries within the organization under the National Swedish Board of Universities and Colleges (UHÄ) and four other libraries is outlined. The coverage of acquired literature in the connected llbrarles is discussed, {{as well as the}} extension of the coverage which is achieved by a decentralized reporting of accessions in a large number of other Swedish research and special libraries to the Royal Library which submits centralized input to the system. Three possible models are presented how to offer access for searches to LIBRIS outside the family of LIBRIS-libraries through 1) the existing <b>programmable</b> <b>terminals,</b> 2) dial-up ports in the front-end computer, 3) packet-switching networks such as SCANNET. Figures on data traffic in the network as weIl as error statistics are given, and possible conclusions are drawn. Variations in how the central processing unit is affected by LIBRIS usage are illustrated and analyzed. Response time and factors influencing on the response time are discussed. Facilities to indicate the system status at the terminals are described. The possibility to diminish (minimize) effects of system breakdown by indicating when the system is open again is emphasized. The expansion and the changeover to another computer and the problems involved in this work is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{individual}} trainer {{for giving}} {{students in the}} radar intercept observer (RIO) schools concentrated practice in procedures for air-to-air intercepts was designed around a <b>programmable</b> graphics <b>terminal</b> with two integral minicomputers and 8 k of core memory. The trainer automatically administers practice in computing values of variables in the intercept triangle, and in making the turns required to put the fighter into position for a sidewinder attack. In an initial field trial at the RIO school, Glynco, Georgia, each of 29 students received 10 hours of practice on this trainer. Data for the values of 33 variables were automatically recorded and were analyzed. It was concluded that this form of computer assisted instruction does produce worthwhile gains in fluency of performance {{and understanding of the}} intercept problems. (Author...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Over {{the last}} two decades, the {{capability}} and implementation of mm-wave point-to-point radios has changed almost beyond recognition. A manually-tuned, waveguide-aficionado’s delight {{has evolved into a}} highly manufacturable, field <b>programmable</b> <b>terminal</b> with lower cost, higher performance and much greater utility. These changes have depended largely on the availability and performance of GaAs Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits (MMICs). Waveguide mounted diodes of various types have been replaced by highly integrated receiver LNA-mixer, transmitter mixer-buffer and PA blocks manufactured in commercial foundries and packaged in SMT packages which can be machine assembled onto micro-strip radio boards. At these frequencies, “split ” configurations are required to minimise RF losses, so the microwave components are exposed to a severe temperature range in an outdoor environment and power efficiency becomes very important...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{provides}} {{the analysis of}} the lift model controlled by voice and sensor control panel. The model is constructed by using average powered controller, it has voice recognition, <b>programmable</b> <b>terminal</b> and logical lift program, which connect them all. The model can be easily reprogrammed in order to have various working regimes and thus is suitable for training students with the broad automation specialization. Presented system could be used in the smart house projects and, especially for disabled people. The modification of the well-known DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) algorithm was used. The set of voice commands consisted of eight Lithuanian words (floor number, go, stop) and two phrases (greeting and goodbye). The recognition accuracy of eight voice commands was equal 100 %, two commands were recognized with some errors. The voice controlled lift model was demonstrated in the exhibition “Science...|$|E
50|$|In 1964, he {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to participate in the design and implementation a classified system for identifying unknown vessels at sea by their sound fingerprint. Following his success with this and other related projects, he moved to New Hampshire to be put in charge of the computer software development for a line of IBM compatible <b>programmable</b> CRT <b>terminals.</b> As part of this assignment, Rubinstein went to San Francisco. Two years later, Rubinstein moved to the Bay Area and landed an assignment to implement a law office management system on a Varian Data Machines minicomputer. Following this, he formed the Systems Division of Prodata International Corporation which was subsequently acquired by Varian Data Machines. As a consequence, Rubinstein temporarily moved to Zürich, Switzerland to utilize the technology he developed as part of a branch banking system for Credit Suisse.|$|R

40|$|In {{the years}} which have elapsed since librarians {{began to use}} the {{computer}} to attack {{some of the problems}} they face, massive technological change has altered computer design and performance. Technical development has resulted in larger, faster machines, with storage capacities and processing speed factors higher than a decade ago, and a consequent dramatic reduction in the unit cost of storing and processing data. Simultaneously, teleprocessing has also developed rapidly, with <b>programmable</b> CRT <b>terminals</b> relatively com- monplace, where little more than a decade ago, in 1962, a computer manufac- turer announced the first linkage between a Telex and a computer. As a result, the concept of a large computer file of bibliographic data constantly maintained and usable at random by a number of users simultane- ously (or rather concurrently) for a variety of purposes (much like a card catalog in a large library) has become not only technically feasible but fiscally desirable. In this paper I want to describe the work being undertaken in New York State to realize this concept. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
