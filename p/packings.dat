40|$|We {{introduce}} the strongly NP-complete pagination problem, {{an extension of}} BIN <b>PACKING</b> where packing together two items may make them occupy less volume {{than the sum of}} their individual sizes. To achieve this property, an item is defined as a finite set of symbols from a given alphabet: while, in BIN <b>PACKING,</b> any two such sets would be disjoint, in PAGINATION, they can share zero, one or more symbols. After formulating the problem as an integer linear program, we try to approximate its solutions with several families of algorithms: from straightforward adaptations of classical BIN <b>PACKING</b> heuristics, to dedicated algorithms (greedy and non-greedy), to standard and grouping genetic algorithms. All of them are studied first theoretically, then experimentally on an extensive random test set. Based upon these data, we propose a predictive measure of the statistical difficulty of a given instance, and finally recommend which algorithm should be used in which case, depending on either time constraints or quality requirements.

In this paper we prove that the problem is polynomially solvable on Seymour graphs which include both all bipartite and all series-parallel graphs. We also consider the weighted version of the problem in which each edge of the graph G has a nonnegative weight and the weight of a cut D is equal to the maximum weight of edges in D.

40|$|This thesis studies {{online and}} offine {{approximation}} algorithms for packing and buffering problems. In the second chapter of this thesis, we study {{the problem of}} packing linear programs online. In this problem, the online algorithm may only increase {{the values of the}} variables of the linear program and his goal is to maximize the value of the objective function of it. The online algorithm has initially full knowledge of all parameters of the linear program, except for the right-hand sides of the constraints which are gradually revealed to him by the adversary. This online problem has been introduced by Ochel et al. [2012]. Our contribution (Englert et al. [2014]) is to provide improved upper bounds for the competitiveness of both deterministic and randomized online algorithms for this problem, as well as an optimal deterministic online algorithm for the special case of linear programs involving two variables. In the third chapter we study the offine COLORFUL BIN <b>PACKING</b> problem. This problem is a variant of the BIN <b>PACKING</b> problem, where each item is associated with a color and where there exists the additional restriction that two items packed consecutively into the same bin cannot share the same color. The COLORFUL BIN <b>PACKING</b> problem has been studied mainly from an online perspective and has been introduced as a generalization of the BLACK AND WHITE BIN <b>PACKING</b> problem (Balogh et al. [2012]), i. e., the special case of this problem for two colors. We provide (joint work with Matthias Englert) a 2 -appoximate algorithm for the COLORFUL BIN <b>PACKING</b> problem. In the fourth chapter we study the Longest Queue Drop (LQD) online algorithm for shared-memory switches with three and two output ports. The Longest Queue Drop algorithm is a well-known online algorithm used to direct the packet ow of shared-memory switches. According to LQD, when the buffer of the switch becomes full, a packet is preempted from the longest queue in the buffer to free buffer space for the newly arriving packet which is accepted. We show (Matsakis [2016], to appear) that the Longest Queue Drop algorithm is (3 / 2) -competitive for three-port switches, improving the previously best upper bound of 5 / 3 (Kobayashi et al. [2007]). Additionally, we show that this algorithm is exactly (4 / 3) -competitive for two-port switches, correcting a previously published result claiming a tight upper bound of 4 M- 4 / 3 M- 2 < 4 = 3, where M 2 Z+ denotes the buffer size...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} chromatographic theory {{has always been}} driven to the {{development}} of smaller particles. The use of smaller more uniform particle diameters results in more effective separations and faster optimal mobile phase velocities, therefore producing lower plate heights; consequently the use of sub 2 micron silica particles has delivered {{a significant impact on the}} practice of high pressure liquid chromatography. The main issue with sub 2 micron silica particles however, is related to their manufacture. It is difficult to produce such highly specialised materials homogeneously and there are only a handful of methods in the literature. This dissertation outlines work that is intended to improve our technical knowledge of this subject by studying the synthesis (of both non porous and totally porous) spherical silica particles to drive improvements. Further investigations into surface functionalisation as well as column packing are also studied. Several experimental tools have been developed to drive improvements to the manufacture of such materials. For example, the experimental challenges necessitated the development and implementation of the following in this work; Full evaluation of the experimental and technical requirements of the Stöber reaction to produce good quality particles greater than one micron in diameter. 2. Transfer of the key outcomes from non porous particle synthesis to produce totally porous particles via modified Stöber reactions and pseudomorphism, 3. Indentified new types of surfactants that could produce high porosity silica particles, 4. The use of microwave irradiation to dramatically speed up surface functionalisation processes, 5. Investigation of column <b>packing’s</b> via computer simulation. On the basis of this works experimental data, it is concluded that good quality non porous and totally porous spherical silica particles can be produced from the ethanol/water/ammonia hydrolysis system of the Stöber reaction up to two microns in diameter with a narrow particle size distribution. Key experimental procedures that are often overlooked in the literature have been highlighted to facilitate successful reactions. The resultant materials can be used for future column <b>packing’s</b> or as starting materials for the production of superficially porous materials. The use of microwave irradiation was shown to dramatically improve surface functionalisation reaction times whilst incorporating reduced solvent volumes and reduced energy expenditure. Reaction times of five minutes were shown to produce <b>packing’s</b> possessing the level of surface coverage associated with commercially produced phases (3 μmoles/m 2) which traditionally use disordered heating methods such as reflux with long reaction times. The use of microwave “superheating” or slightly longer reaction times of 20 minutes further increased the overall bonding density. Computer simulation of commercial <b>packing’s</b> showed the influence of large particles within the distribution on bed formation. Larger particles are pushed towards the top of the column chamber by the sedimentation of smaller particles. This effect is completely analogous to the phenomenon of “The Brazil nut effect”. More uniform <b>packing’s</b> would reduce the overall impact. This work improves our understanding of the complex nature of HPLC column phase synthesis as well as provides new tools for future research...|$|R

40|$|Given an undirected {{multigraph}} G and {{a subset}} of vertices S ` V (G), the STEINER TREE <b>PACKING</b> problem {{is to find a}} largest collection of edge-disjoint trees that each connects S. This problem and its generalizations have attracted considerable attention from researchers in different areas because of their wide applicability. This problem was shown to be APX-hard (no polynomial time approximation scheme unless P=NP). In fact, prior to this paper, not evenan approximation algorithm with asymptotic ratio o(n) wasknown despite several attempts. In this work, we close this huge gap by presenting the first polynomial time constant factor approximation algorithm for the STEINER TREE <b>PACKING</b> problem. The maintheorem is an approximate min-max relation between the maximum number of edge-disjoint trees that each connects S (i. e. S-trees) and the minimum size of an edge-cut thatdisconnects some pair of vertices in S (i. e. S-cut). Specifically, we prove that if the minimum S-cut in G has 26 k edges, then G has at least k edge-disjoint S-trees; this answers Kriesell's conjecture affirmatively up to a constant multiple. The techniques that we use are purely combinatorial, where matroid theory is the underlying ground work...|$|R
