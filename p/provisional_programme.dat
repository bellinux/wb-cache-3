The venture proved successful and that same month a meeting was held at the John Mackintosh Hall with the aim of forming a camera club which would be open to everyone in Gibraltar, including servicemen and UK based civilians. The club was to be called The John Mackintosh Hall Camera Club, and would incorporate the United Services Camera Club. A caretaker Committee was formed and a <b>provisional</b> <b>programme</b> arranged.|$|E

5000|$|According to Ester Turnhout et al., the IPBES must draw on a {{much broader}} range of {{knowledge}} and stakeholders. Currently, IPBES documentation, such as the <b>provisional</b> work <b>programme</b> and technical background documents, suggests that the platform aims {{to serve as a}} clearing house that guarantees the global availability of all biodiversity knowledge that has been standardized and scientifically validated. This might be attractive to [...] "elite actors", from natural scientists to national governments, but it omits many other important stakeholders and knowledge-holders including indigenous people, businesses, farmers, community partnerships and fishers. IPBES has not taken adequate notice that there exists no single scientific definition of biodiversity, nor is there one that does justice to the many ways of living with and knowing nature that human cultures have developed and is promoting a predominantly science-based understanding of biodiversity, with ecosystem services taking centre stage. This focus reduces biodiversity to an object of exploitation and runs the risk of bringing it even further into a system of market exchange.|$|R
40|$|Background: Dementia causes cognitive-communication disorders, which complicate {{everyday}} {{communication between}} individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Specific training of communicative skills in caregivers improves {{their knowledge and}} competence, resulting in an increased {{quality of life in}} people with dementia. Despite many existing interventions {{there is a lack of}} a comprehensive logopedic intervention programme involving both patient and caregiver in a community-dwelling setting. Therefore, a <b>provisional</b> <b>programme</b> concerning communication problems in people with dementia and their family caregivers was developed, which needs to be evaluated qualitatively in order to enable its standardisation. Aim and research questions: To identify actions and materials responsible for the success of the intervention programme. 1. What actions and materials appear in the programme? 2. What actions and materials used in the programme do patients and their caregivers find to be successful? Methods: A generic qualitative approach was used. Participants were treated with the intervention programme and were subsequently interviewed. Twelve intervention sessions of two patient-caregiver couples were video-recorded for observation and semi-structured interviews with four couples were conducted and audio-recorded. After transcription data were analysed following Framework Analysis. Results: A complex framework of actions and materials, used by the speech-language therapist, has been identified. Key aspects responsible for the success are: imparting knowledge about the diagnosis comprehensibly; imparting practical strategies for dealing with dementia-related problems; use of individual memory aids; use of communication advice addressed to conversational partners of the person with dementia; application of specific didactic strategies; and a positively charged demeanour of the speech-language therapist. Conclusion: In addition to factors of success also used in other programmes, new aspects have been identified, which provide promising evidence. Recommendations: Future research should focus on possible differences in the execution of the intervention programme in individuals with other types of dementia compared to those included...|$|E
40|$|The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) Subregional Headquarters for the Caribbean, in {{collaboration}} with the Division of Production, Productivity and Management at ECLAC Headquarters in Chile, convened a one-day workshop on “Boosting SME Development and Competitiveness in the Caribbean”, at the Subregional Headquarters for the Caribbean in Port of Spain on 14 May 2009. The workshop was the culmination of country studies that were carried out under an Italian Government-funded project to assess the policies, institutions and instruments for dynamic Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) development and competitiveness in Jamaica, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. The aim was to use the lessons learned from the three country studies to inform policy and practice in the other member countries of the Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee (CDCC). The main objectives of the workshop were to: (a) share and discuss the findings of the country studies and lessons learned; (b) provide a forum for high quality discussion of the policy environment, instruments, business development and support services required for successful SME development in the Caribbean; and (c) map out a strategy for moving from analysis and recommendation to policy implementation and business changes in order to promote a dynamic and competitive SME sector. The workshop aimed to arrive at practical solutions to major constraints and a weighting of key actions in order of priority of implementation, by adopting a problem-solving approach. Participants at the workshop included representatives of key SME support institutions in the region, actual SMEs and academic researchers. The list of participants and <b>provisional</b> <b>programme</b> are annexed to this report [...] Agenda item 1 : Overview of the SME sector in Latin America and the Caribbean. [...] Agenda item 2 : Presentation of Caribbean country studies. [...] Agenda item 3 : SME Competitiveness, requirements and challenges.

40|$|In {{respect of}} every {{financial}} year, the President causes {{to be laid}} beforeboth Houses of Parliament an "annual financial statement"—a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India. 1 The annual financial statement, otherwise known as the 'Budget', {{is presented in two}} parts, viz., the Railway Budget pertaining to Railway Finance, and the General Budget which gives an overall picture of the financial position of the Government of India, excluding Railways. The Budget is presented on such a day as the President directs. 2 By convention the Railway Budget is presented to the Lok Sabha sometime in the third week of February and the General Budget is generally presented on the last working day of February each year. 3 Simultaneously, copies of the respective Budgets are laid on the Table of the Rajya Sabha. On an occasion the Interim Railway Budget which was presented to the Lok Sabha on 27 February 1996, could not be laid on the Table of the Rajya Sabha that day as the House adjourned due to disorder. The Budget was laid the next day. 4 In 1953, the Railway Budget for 1953 - 54 was laid on the Table by the Leader of the House {{in the absence of the}} Railway Minister who was to speak in the other House. 5 In an election year, the Budget may be presented twice—first to secure a Vote on Account for a few months and later, in full, on a day convenient to the Government. A few days before the commencement of the Budget session, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs forwards to the Secretariat a <b>provisional</b> <b>programme</b> of dates for the financial business to be transacted during that session. This is published in the Bulletin for the information of the members. 6 The estimates of expenditure embodied in the annual financial statement show separately the sums required to meet expenditure which the Constitution has 'charged ' upon the Consolidated Fund of India and the sums required to meet other expenditure. 7 The charged expenditure is not required to be submitted to the vote of Parliament but it can be discussed in either House of Parliament. 8 The other expenditure is required to be submitted in the form of demands fo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{and critically}} reflects on a design programme, Storyforming, that explores ways to design objects and places to enrich daily life narratives. Using an experimental design approach, {{the goal is}} to exemplify and explore this idea with discursive artefacts that, through their physical and temporal form, act as catalysts in the construction of meaningful experiences. In the current sustainability discourse, behavioural change has been pointed out as a key factor in achieving a sustainable society. Historically, design has been very effective in increasing production and consumption behaviours by creating new types of needs and, in a way, manufacturing desire (Forty, 1986). Drawing on this, the overarching aim of this thesis is the investigation of the ways design, through a suggested programme, can afford alternative types of meaningful experiences in contrast to the prevailing consumer culture. The empirical work reported in the thesis stems from several research projects looking into the matter of energy use in relation to design. In addition, two of the projects have been carried out in the author’s own design practice. Some concepts are explored more in-depth—involving events such as field studies, situated interviews, workshops, prototype building, design interventions in the form of domestication probes, and contextual studies ranging from a few weeks up to a year—while other concepts exist only as sketches or photo montages. The diversity of these concepts, the design experiments, helps span a design space becoming a new provisional design programme. The idea for this programme has evolved from observations and reflections made throughout the experiments presented in the thesis. The general results are the suggested approach of Storyforming, which focuses on the design of artefacts supporting daily narratives {{that can be used to}} create engagement, meaning, and alternative values applicable to the discourse of sustainable behaviour. Specific contributions are the selection of design experiments. In the thesis, the experiments have first been examined from the perspective of stories and forming as a basis for the new programme formulation. Through this articulation of the programme, the experiments are revisited through three leitmotifs, part of the <b>provisional</b> <b>programme</b> focusing on different properties related to the aspect of forming. From the perspective of the user, these themes—seeing and accessing designs, exploring and expressing complexity, and sharing experiences and negotiating use—are finally elaborated on in relation to other theoretical concepts as well as their implications for future research.
