5|$|A common {{concern among}} reviewers is the {{overhead}} perspective, which critics have bemoaned for <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from judging pathway routes and an object's location {{in relation to}} its background. Besides this, the actual visuals were generally well received, {{as well as the}} setting and animations. The audio was commended for combining both originality and nostalgia, even though it looped frequently.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 1962, a PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (registration CF-IHA) crashed during landing at Nuuk Airport. The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} a mechanical malfunction in the nose wheel doors <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from closing during landing on water, resulting in the aircraft sinking. The accident killed 15 of the 21 people on board.|$|E

The following month, Edge and Orton became World Tag Team Champions, and Lita left the group after her legitimate retirement.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from suing or testifying in court.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1633, Commonwealth forces retook Dorogobuzh, an {{important}} Russian supply point after its capture the year before. This setback wrecked Russian plans to send reinforcements to Shein's army, although in any event the Russians did not begin to gather a 5,000-strong army for that purpose until January 1634. Also that autumn, Grand Crown Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski defeated an Ottoman incursion {{in the south of}} the Commonwealth, freeing his force to lay siege to the Russian town of Sevsk; although Koniecpolski failed to take the fortress, he tied down large Russian forces, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from moving north towards Smolensk.|$|E

5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from being absorbed. Notable examples are oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid, which {{are high in}} plant-based diets. Calcium and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|E
5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{contribute to}} antioxidant defense by chelating transition metals and <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from catalyzing {{the production of}} free radicals in the cell. Particularly important {{is the ability to}} sequester iron, which is the function of iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin. Selenium and zinc are commonly referred to as antioxidant nutrients, but these chemical elements have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{trees are}} also girdled {{to act as}} trap trees to monitor for emerald ash borer. The {{stressed}} tree attracts egg-laying females {{in the spring and}} trees can be debarked in the fall to search for larvae. If detected, an area is often placed under a quarantine to prevent infested wood material from causing new infestations. Further control measures are then taken within the area to slow population growth by reducing beetle numbers, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from reaching reproductive maturity and dispersing, and reducing the abundance of ash trees.|$|E

5|$|The bombing had {{destroyed}} the north {{wing of the}} school. During the search, rescuers found an additional 500pounds (230kg) of dynamite which had failed to detonate in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices, and they found an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in {{the second set of}} bombs, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to the Byzantines, Khalid had {{prepared}} {{for such a}} contingency by placing a strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises, which gave the Muslims {{time to prepare for}} battle. At the center, the Byzantines did not press hard, intending to pin down the Muslim centre corps in their position and <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from aiding the Muslim army in other areas. Thus the center remained stable.|$|E
5|$|Under US and UN pressure, Pakistan {{arrested a}} few members of Jamaat ud-Dawa and briefly put its founder under house arrest, but he was found to be free a few days later.

Meanwhile, journalists in Pakistan said security agencies were <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from interviewing people from Kasab's village. Home Minister P.

5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech {{had to play}} defense as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run the ball {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on the ground before the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E
5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Ape Escape is a {{platform}} game that is viewed from a third-person perspective. Players traverse several different environments to advance through the game. For {{most of the}} game, players control Spike‚Äîa boy tasked with pursuing and capturing the apes across time, <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> from rewriting history. Players use various gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, such as the Stun Club, used as an offensive measure against enemies, and the Time Net, used to capture apes and transport them to present day. More gadgets become available as players progress through the game. Players also control vehicles throughout the game, including a rubber raft, which allows travel over water, and the water net, which assists in traversing underwater. The game's controls are heavily centered around the analog sticks: the left stick is used to move players, while the right stick manipulates the various gadgets.|$|E
