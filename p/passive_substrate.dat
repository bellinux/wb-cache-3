Thus, specific ECM components may modulate effects of growth factors (GFs) that {{play an important role}} in structural changes in development and adult neuronal plasticity. In this study we examined the interaction of cultured Aplysia bag cell neurons (BCNs) with components of ECM and different GFs. Different ECM substrata induce a substrate-specific BCN morphology: BCNs grown on collagen or poly-l-lysine have larger soma diameter and more extensive neurite outgrowth than BCNs grown on laminin or fibronectin. BCNs also interact in a substrate-dependent way with GFs: BDNF treatment leads to a reduction of outgrowth on poly-l-lysine but an enhancement on fibronectin and laminin. CNTF reduces the soma diameter on collagen IV but enlarges it on laminin or fibronectin. In contrast, NGF induces a reduction of both soma diameter and outgrowth, on all substrata. Plating of BCNs in the presence of anti-β 1 -integrin reduces adhesion to fibronectin but does not change outgrowth. In contrast, RGD peptides block adhesion to laminin and poly-l-lysine and, additionally, reduce outgrowth on laminin. These data suggest that BCNs use different β 1 -integrin-dependent as well as RGD-dependent mechanisms for adhesion and outgrowth on different ECM substrata, providing possible sites of modulation by specific GFs...|$|R

Computational fluid dynamics modelling is then applied to make quantitative predictions regarding the effects of substrate proximity on the feeding hydrodynamics of a benthic shark.

To test the models, we used digital particle image velocimetry to record fluid flow around the mouth of white-spotted bamboo sharks, Chiloscyllium plagiosum, during suction feeding on the substrate and in the water column.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{widespread}} trend toward higher levels of integration in microwave and millimeter-wave system design, motivated {{by a desire to}} reduce cost, size and complexity, particularly as many old applications are being re-invented in array architectures. The most commonly used format for achieving high levels of integration in millimeter-wave systems is the MMIC-based multi-function module (MFM). High performance MMIC circuits of all kinds up to about 50 GHz are already readily available at low cost from many commercial suppliers. The selection of commercial MMICs above 50 GHz is more limited, however, although new ones are introduced regularly, and foundry services for III-V semiconductors are provided by many companies that enable users to design their own custom chips for applications well over 100 GHz. 1 The MMIC approach does have limitations, of course, {{not the least of which}} is relatively low-Q for passive components like filters. Microstrip filters are the most common form of integrated filter used with MMIC technology.

40|$|The article {{considers}} a catalyst granule with a porous ceramic <b>passive</b> <b>substrate</b> and point active centers on which an exothermic synthesis reaction occurs. A {{rate of the}} chemical reaction depends on the temperature according to the Arrhenius law. Heat {{is removed from the}} pellet surface in products of synthesis due to heat transfer. In our work we first proposed a model for calculating the steady-state temperature of a catalyst pellet with local reaction centers. Calculation of active centers temperature is based on the idea of self-consistent field (mean-field theory). At first, it is considered that powers of the reaction heat release at the centers are known. On the basis of the found analytical solution, which describes temperature distribution inside the granule, the average temperature of the reaction centers is calculated, which then is inserted in the formula for heat release. The resulting system of transcendental algebraic equations is transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations of relaxation type and solved numerically to achieve a steady-state value. As a practical application, the article {{considers a}} Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalyst granule with active cobalt metallic micro-particles. Cobalt micro-particles are the centers of the exothermic reaction of hydrocarbons macromolecular synthesis. Synthesis occurs as a result of absorption of the components of the synthesis gas on metallic cobalt. The temperature distribution inside the granule for a single local center and reaction centers located on the same granule diameter is found. It was found that there is a critical temperature of reactor exceeding of which leads to significant local overheating of the centers - thermal explosion. The temperature distribution with the local reaction centers is qualitatively different from the granule temperature, calculated in the homogeneous approximation. It is shown that, in contrast to the homogeneous approximation, the temperature of the granule surface with local centers cannot serve as a reliable criterion for the thermal state of the synthesis centers inside the granule.

40|$|Cadherins mediate Ca 2 + {{dependent}} cell-cell junction in all animal tissues. Tight {{regulation of}} cadherin adhesion plays critical roles in diverse biological processes. Differential binding between cadherin subtypes {{is widely believed}} to mediate cell sorting during embryogenesis. However, a fundamental unanswered question is whether cell sorting is dictated by the biophysical properties of cadherin bonds. Chapter 2 describes the atomic force microscope measurements of the strengths and dissociation rates of homophilic and heterophilic cadherin bonds. Measurements conducted with chicken N-cadherin, canine E-cadherin, and Xenopus C-cadherin demonstrated that all three cadherins cross-react and form multiple, intermolecular bonds. The mechanical and kinetic properties of the heterophilic bonds {{are similar to the}} homophilic interactions. The quantified bond parameters, together with previously reported adhesion energies were further compared with in vitro cell aggregation and sorting assays. Trends in quantified biophysical properties of the different cadherin bonds do not correlate with sorting outcomes. These results suggest that cell sorting in vivo and in vitro is not governed solely by biophysical differences between cadherin subtypes. Although the knowledge of molecular mechanism of cadherin adhesion is fundamental to understanding various processes in morphogenesis and the regulation of cell junctions, it remains largely unclear. In Chapter 3, single bond force measurement was used to directly address the functional roles of Trp 2 and adhesive domains in C-cadherin interaction. The bond rupture forces between the cadherin ectodomains, domain deletion fragments, and Trp 2 point mutant were measured and compared. The results, together with surface force measurements (Maruthamuthu, Ph. D thesis 2009) demonstrated that Trp 2 residue both mediates the N-terminal interaction of cadherins and exerts an inter-domain allosteric effect on multiple domains far away from EC 1. The findings of the allosteric coupling between classic cadherin ectodomains reconcile several previous models of cadherin adhesion and may have important implications for the regulation of cadherin-based cell adhesion. The importance of mechanical force to development, differentiation, and normal physiology is increasingly acknowledged. Although the classic cadherin complex is a good candidate for tension sensing in tissues, direct evidence for such a role is lacking. In Chapter 4, I examined the cell responses to both external applied forces and soft substrates via classic type I cadherins. Cells respond to applied force through cadherin bonds by reinforcing the bead-cell junction, showing cadherin complexes are force-sensors. Besides, depending on cell context, the cadherin mechanotransduction is subtype-specific. To study how cells respond to <b>passive</b> <b>substrate</b> rigidity, MCF- 7 cell spreading on soft gels coated with E-cadherins was examined. The spreading area of cells increases with substrate rigidity. This behavior indicates that the cells are able to sense the substrate stiffness through cadherin receptors and modify their spreading accordingly. These results provide direct evidences that cadherins complexes are mechanosensors...|$|E
40|$|Osteocytes are terminally {{differentiated}} bone cells, {{derived from}} osteoblasts, which comprise over 90 % {{of the cells}} in mature bone tissue and {{are known to be}} highly sensitive to extracellular mechanical cues. The effect of extracellular mechanical stimuli on osteoblast differentiation in particular has been well studied, with both mesenchymal and embryonic stem cells shown to differentiate into the osteoblast phenotype when cultured on substrates that mimic the mechanical properties of developing bone tissue, osteoid. However, relatively little attention has been paid thus far to the effects of extracellular mechanics on the differentiation of osteocytes, despite their clear importance to the function of bone tissue as a whole. The aim of this thesis is to uncover the effects of extracellular mechanical stimuli on osteocyte differentiation, and thus inform future bone tissue engineering strategies. The first study of this thesis examined the effects of <b>passive</b> <b>substrate</b> stiffness and intercellular separation on osteocyte differentiation of the pre-osteoblast MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell line. Cells were cultured on Type 1 collagen based substrates of different stiffnesses while seeding density was used to control intercellular separation. It was found that osteocyte differentiation, as measured by morphological analysis, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, substrate mineralisation and gene expression profile, occurred on substrates of approximately 300 Pa at an initial seeding density of 103 cells/cm 2. Interestingly, this stiffness was much lower than those previously found to induce osteoblast differentiation. The second study of this thesis used finite element modelling to examine the isometric stress generated in the cell body when cultured on the substrates investigated in the first study. Cell and substrate mechanical properties were measured through atomic force microscopy, while cell morphologies and the locations of focal adhesion complexes were determined through confocal microscopy. The results demonstrated that intracellular tension was influenced by cell morphology, focal adhesion location and density as well as substrate stiffness, suggesting a role for isometric tension in osteocyte mechanobiology. The third study presented here investigated the combined effects of substrate stiffness, thickness, fibrosity and crosslinking density on cell spread area, a known indicator of osteogenic differentiation potential. MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were cultured on flat and wedge shaped collagen and polyacrylamide (PA) gels, with stiffness being controlled through the polymerisation process of PA gels or 1 -Ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide crosslinking of collagen. It was found that cells on the fibrous collagen substrates adopt the same spread area as those cultured on much stiffer non-fibrous PA substrates, while a reduction in substrate thickness caused an increase in cell area in both collagen and PA substrates. The increase in cell area due to thickness was reduced as crosslinking density of collagen substrates was increased. Finite element simulations demonstrated that the effective modulus of a substrate increased when discrete fibres were included. The effective modulus was further increased as crosslinking density was increased and as substrate thickness was reduced. Interestingly, the effect of thickness on the effective modulus was lessened at higher crosslinking density, offering an explanation for the reduced effect of substrate thickness in highly crosslinked collagen. These results suggest that cell behaviour is regulated by the modulus of a substrate, as experienced at a local cell level, rather than bulk material properties. The results of this study may explain, in part, seemingly contradictory results as to the optimal stiffness for the promotion of osteogenic differentiation. The final study of this thesis investigated the combined effects of fluid flow and substrate stiffness on osteocyte differentiation of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells. Cells were cultured on collagen substrates previously shown to induce osteocyte differentiation (Study 1) and subjected to physiologically relevant levels of pulsatile fluid flow after 7 days of static culture. It was found that the application of flow at day 7 of culture followed by a further 7 days of static culture caused an increase in the percentage of cells undergoing osteocyte differentiation, as measured through morphological analysis and ALP activity. Together these studies provide new evidence that osteocyte differentiation can be induced by culture of pre-osteoblast like cells on soft collagen substrates, provided substrate thickness and heterogeneity are also controlled, and that this differentiation may be initiated through the generation of isometric stress within the cell body. The importance of intercellular separation in osteocyte differentiation was also demonstrated for the first time, while the number of cells undergoing the differentiation process can be further enhanced through the application of fluid flow induced stress. Through the research studies of this PhD Thesis, fundamental information has been uncovered about the differentiation behaviour of osteogenic cells in response to extracellular mechanical cues, and these results can be used to inform future bone tissue engineering strategies...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this PhD {{is to develop a}} poly-SiGe {{deposition}} and treatment process suitable for post processing MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) applications with a maximum thermal budget of 250 &# 176;C. The decrease in process temperature is expected to increase the integration flexibility, allowing the integration of MEMS on top of advanced CMOS, integrated <b>passive</b> <b>substrates</b> with BCB and/or flexible polymer substrates. It is intended that after development of the deposition process and the layer treatment, the resulting layers can be implemented into a reliable MEMS device on a flexible polymer substrate. The produced layer should possess good electrical and mechanical properties (resistivity in the range of a few mohm. cm, strain gradient with a magnitude of 10 - 6 /&# 956;m and low tensile stress). In addition, the substrate temperature should be maintained at all times below a maximum value of 250 &# 176;C. From the beginning, it was realized that the required temperature reduction will degrade the structural layer properties. Lowering the SiGe deposition temperature (< 250 &# 176;C) will yield layers with high stress, strain gradient and electrical resistivity. Therefore, the deposition temperature reduction should always be accompanied by a technique that improves the electrical and mechanical properties of the material. Techniques such as metal induced crystallization (MIC) and laser annealing are both initially considered due to their potential in improving structural layer properties. After preliminary tests, it is envisioned that laser annealing, using a KrF excimer laser, will produce the desired poly-SiGe layer. To reach the thesis objective, the work is divided into two main sections. The first deals with ensuring that the produced layers possess good electrical and mechanical properties which are comparable with standard high deposition temperature poly-SiGe, while the second section tackles the application of this post-deposition treated layer in a demonstrator. Optimum results are used to fabricate operational SiGe MEMS devices at such deposition temperatures.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} silicon-based {{integration of}} passive components applied to 3 D integration with dies of other technologies within one package. Particularly, {{the development of}} high-density trench capacitors has enabled the realization of small-formfactor DC-DC converters. As illustration, an integrated inductive DC-DC converter based on flip-chipping a 65 -nm CMOS active die on a PICS™ (Passive-Integration Connecting <b>Substrate)</b> <b>passive</b> die is described. The PICS die includes high-density (80 nF/mm 2) integrated MOS trench capacitors. A converter peak efficiency of 87. 5 % is achieved at Vin= 1. 2 V, Vout= 0. 95 V, Iout= 100 mA and 100 -MHz switching frequency. The concept enables further integration with sensors, actuators and MEMS...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDiamond (Dia) {{films are}} {{promising}} heat-dissipative materials for electronic packages because they combine high thermal conductivity with high electrical resistivity. However, precise {{knowledge of the}} thermal properties of the diamond films is crucial to their potential application as <b>passive</b> thermal management <b>substrates</b> in electronics. In this study, modulated photothermal radiometry in a front-face configuration was employed to thermally characterize polycrystalline diamond films deposited onto silicon (Si) substrates through laser-assisted combustion synthesis. The intrinsic thermal conductivity of diamond films and the thermal boundary resistance at the interface between the diamond film and the Si substrate were investigated. The results enlighten {{the correlation between the}} deposition process, film purity, film transverse thermal conductivity, and interface thermal resistance...|$|R

As a result, the embedding of very thin silicon dies and metallic structures into highly flexible polymeric, paper like or textile materials causes several mechanical problems preventing those applications from being utilized. This paper intends to demonstrate and discuss advantages and needs of using fully parameterized finite element modeling techniques for design optimizations of thin devices {{on the basis of}} damage evaluation and fracture mechanics approaches. For improving that method, the evaluation of mixed mode interface delamination phenomena and fracture of embedded thin silicon were combined with experimental investigations...|$|R

However, area for passive devices used in RF modules has made further miniaturization difficult. <b>Passives</b> embedded in <b>substrates</b> are now being studied intensively. In addition, circuit simulation technology has been developed that enables efficient designing of RF module circuits.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{allows for}} the use of chip-package co-design of RF transceivers and their components by using discrete active devices in conjunction with passive components. Two particular components are described, including voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) and low noise amplifiers (LNAs). The high quality passive components for use in the VCOs and LNAs may be obtained by the use of embedded <b>passives</b> in organic <b>substrates.</b> Further, the embedded passives may have multi-band characteristics, thereby allowing multi-band VCOs and LNAs to be implemented with fewer components. In situations where size is a concern, the active devices and passive components utilized in an RF transceiver may be implemented in a low form factor module of less than 1. 1 mm thick according to an embodiment of the invention.
