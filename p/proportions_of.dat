5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack.

The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E

5|$|Later, Brown {{revised the}} {{phylogeny}} of Corythosaurus, {{and found that}} it was closely related, and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus. The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae, and the <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> the limbs. During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately, and that birds, based on the shape and <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians. He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true. He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians, it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus. However, even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians, birds are now thought to have descended from the latter.|$|E

40|$|The Domestic Violence Intervention Court Model was {{successful}} in achieving some {{but not all of}} its aims.   This study examines whether domestic violence police and court outcomes have changed since the commencement of the Domestic Violence Intervention Court Model (DVICM). Method: Logistic and Poisson regression models were used to determine whether the DVICM resulted in the following: an increase in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> persons of interest charged with a domestic violence offence; an increase in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> domestic violence matters finalised on a plea of guilty; a decrease in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> matters finalised on a dismissal; an increase in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> penalties of bonds with supervision; an increase in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> penalties of imprisonment; a decrease in the time from first court appearance to finalisation in court; an increase in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> matters finalised with a plea of guilty within three weeks of first court appearance; and an increase in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> matters finalised within 12 weeks of the police event date. The test sites were Campbelltown, Macquarie Fields, and Wagga Wagga Local Area Commands. The rest of NSW was used as the control group. Results: The DVICM increased the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> persons of interest charged in Macquarie Fields but not in Campbelltown or Wagga Wagga Local Area Commands. It reduced the time taken to finalise domestic violence matters in Campbelltown and Wagga Wagga Local Courts. The DVICM did not affect the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> matters finalised on a plea <b>of</b> guilty; the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> matters finalised on a dismissal; the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> penalties of bonds with supervision; nor the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> penalties of imprisonment.

5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be as fine as 1 μm. The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.|$|E

This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} of known Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several {{different}} ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|E

40|$|Grazing {{management}} practices that allow congregation of cattle near pasture streams may increase sediment, phosphorus, and pathogen loading of the streams by removing vegetation and causing manure accumulation near the streams. Forage sward height, bare and manure-covered soil, and forage species were measured {{along the banks}} of streams in 13 pastures on 12 cow-calf operations in southern Iowa. Forage sward height decreased as the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> tall fescue at the vegetated sites increased, as the stocking rate increased, and as the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> reed canarygrass at the vegetated sites decreased. The <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> soil that was bare tended to increase as the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> reed canarygrass at vegetated sites decreased and the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> tall fescue at vegetated sites or the stocking rate increased. The <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> soil that was manure-covered increased as the stocking rate and <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> tall fescue at vegetated sites increased and the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> reed canarygrass at vegetated sites decreased. In stepwise multiple regressions, stocking rate was not selected to predict sward height and the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> bare soil. In contrast, stocking rate was the first factor selected to predict the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> soil that was covered with manure. Selection of tall fescue in the stepwise multiple regressions implied that the sward height decreased and manure cover increased as tall fescue as a <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> vegetated sites increased. The presence of tall fescue and increasing stocking rate may increase cattle activity near streams reducing sward height and increasing manure cover. However, the effects of stocking rate and the botanical composition on the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> bare soil along stream banks were relatively small...|$|R
