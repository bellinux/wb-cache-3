5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND. Despite {{theoretically}} higher {{requirements for}} water due to physiologic demands of pregnancy and lactation, {{little is known}} of actual ranges of intake in pregnant and lactating women. METHODS. Population-based estimates of total water and tapwater intake in <b>women</b> <b>of</b> reproductive age were derived {{using data from the}} 1977 - 78 USDA Nationwide Food Consumption Survey. Three-day average intakes were calculated for 188 pregnant women, 77 lactating women, and 6, 201 non-pregnant, non-lactating control women. RESULTS. Total water intake (mean +/- SD) was 1, 940 +/- 686 g/day (median 1, 835) for control women, 2, 076 +/- 743 g/day (median 1, 928) for pregnant women and 2, 242 +/- 658 g/day (median 2, 164) for lactating women. Tapwater intake was 1, 157 +/- 635 g/day (median 1, 065) for control women, 1, 189 +/- 699 g/day (median 1, 063) for pregnant women, and 1, 310 +/- 591 g/day (median 1, 330) for lactating women. Total water intake was equal to or greater than 3, 000 g/day among 7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> control <b>women,</b> 11 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> pregnant <b>women,</b> and 13 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> lactating <b>women.</b> Tapwater intake was equal to or greater than 2, 000 g/day among 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> control <b>women,</b> 15 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> pregnant <b>women,</b> and 8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> lactating <b>women.</b> CONCLUSIONS.

25|$|Sterilization {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Brazil since it became legal and free for women over 25 in 1996, and is regulated by the Health Ministry. It had already been a popular practice among poor communities before the legalization of sterilization, and was practiced in private clinics. In 1994, over sixty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in Goiás, and over seventy <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in Maranhão and Mato Grosso were sterilized. After the 1996 law, sterilization {{became part of the}} population control policy of the Brazilian government. Though some view sterilization as an inexpensive form of birth control and a useful tool in population control, others see the mass use of sterilization in Brazil as contrary to promoting women's choices in contraceptive use. Sterilization is most common among Afro-Brazilians in the Northeast of the country who are too poor to afford other types of contraception and uneducated on the long term consequences of sterilization. Scholars such as Andre Caetano and Joseph E.
