25|$|The Confederates {{were led}} by Charles L. <b>Pyron</b> and William Read Scurry. During the battle on March 26, <b>Pyron</b> had his {{battalion}} of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles, four companies of the 5th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. John Shropshire and two cannons. Scurry's force included nine companies of the 4th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. Henry Raguet, five companies of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. Powhatan Jordan and three additional cannons.|$|E
25|$|Sibley {{continued}} northward, capturing Albuquerque on March 2 and Santa Fe on March 13 {{but failed}} to capture the Union supplies there. This forced the Confederates to live off the land, but were only {{able to find a}} fraction of the supplies they needed; in addition, the foraging alienated the local population. After establishing his headquarters at Albuquerque, Sibley sent an advance force under the command Major Charles <b>Pyron</b> to Apache Canyon to watch for Union movements from the north along the Sante Fe Trail. A second detachment moved to the south to keep watch on Canby's force, while the main body under Lieutenant Colonel William R. Scurry moved slowly northward to unite with <b>Pyron.</b> A Union column from Fort Union under the command of Col. John P. Slough was moving south at this time. An advance guard from this column collided with Pyron's force on March 26, with the Confederates being driven back through the pass. That evening, in response to a message from <b>Pyron,</b> Scurry arrived with the main force and spent the next day observing the Union force, expecting an attack. At the Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 28, the main Confederate force under Scurry fought a Union force marching from Fort Union, driving it back through the pass. However, a Union detachment was able to march around the Confederates and burned its wagon train, destroying most of the Confederate army's supplies.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of this work the ruthenium-catalyzed anti-Markovnikon-hydration of {{terminal}} alkynes was optimized. This covers the reaction conditions (catalyst loading, concentration, solvent/reaction media, equivalents of water, additives and exchange of the counterion) as well as the variation of the ruthenium complex via ligand exchange. The most aktivst catalyst was the [cyclopentadienylruthenium(II) (2 -diphenylphosphino- 6 -(2, 4, 6 -triphenylphenyl) pyridine) (triphenylphosphino) (acetonitrile) ]hexafluorophosphate complex. Beside the optimization of the catalysis the ruthenium-catalyzed anti-Markovnikov-hydration was used in synthetic strategies to result aldols and poly- 1, 3 -diols and also poly- 1, 4 -diols. The poly- 1, 4 -diols led via a sequential synthesis from simple base-chemicals to poly- 1, 4 -diols with high structural complexity and natural related compounds. The hydration of propargyl alcohols to aldols, respectively 1, 3 -diols was more challenging in comparison to the hydration of 1, 4 -diols. But finally, it was possible to synthesize the massoialactone and a derivative of the family of the polyacetate secondary <b>pyrons...</b>|$|R
25|$|Next morning, February 21, Sibley sent {{an advance}} party {{consisting}} of four companies of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles {{under the command}} of Major Charles <b>Pyron</b> to scout ahead to the Valverde ford, with the 4th Texas Mounted Rifles under Lieutenant Colonel William Read Scurry following close behind. The rest of the brigade remained in camp, intending to follow later.|$|E
25|$|Pyron's {{force of}} 300 camped at Apache Canyon, {{at one end}} of Glorieta Pass, leaving a picket post of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 {{soldiers}} to the pass and, on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon Chivington’s men captured the picket post and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their artillery fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to {{the two sides of the}} pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. <b>Pyron</b> retired about a mile and a half (about 2=1/2 kilometers) to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington’s men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron’s men again and punished them with enfilade fire. <b>Pyron</b> ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. Not knowing if Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at Kozlowski’s Ranch to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough's army.|$|E
25|$|In March Sibley sent a Confederate {{force of}} 200-300 Texans {{under the command}} of Maj. Charles L. <b>Pyron</b> on an advance {{expedition}} over the Glorieta Pass, a strategic location on the Santa Fe Trail at the southern tip of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains southeast of Santa Fe. Control of the pass would allow the Confederates to advance onto the High Plains and make an assault on Fort Union, a Union stronghold on the route northward over Raton Pass. Sibley sent six companies {{under the command of}} Col. Tom Green to block the eastern end of Glorieta Pass, turning any Union defensive position in the Sangre de Cristos.|$|E

2500|$|When the Confederates under <b>Pyron</b> {{arrived at}} {{the eastern side of}} Valverde ford they found that Union forces were already there {{blocking}} their passage. [...] <b>Pyron</b> sent for reinforcements from the 4th Texas while his men took cover in an old river bed, which served as an excellent defensive position. At first, despite having a numerical advantage, the Union cavalry deployed in a skirmish line instead of trying to drive the Confederates out of their position. This forced the Union artillery to remain on the western bank of the Rio Grande.|$|E
2500|$|Thomson {{took the}} {{symbolism}} for the colors {{from a book}} called Elements of Heraldy by Antoine <b>Pyron</b> du Martre, which William Barton had lent to him.

2500|$|The {{show was}} so popular with his mostly female {{television}} audience, he drew over 30 million viewers {{at any one time}} and received 10,000 fan letters per week. His show {{was also one of the}} first to be shown on British commercial television in the 1950s, where it was broadcast on Sunday afternoons by Lew Grade's Associated TeleVision. This exposure gave Liberace a dedicated following in the United Kingdom. Homosexual men also found him appealing. According to author Darden Asbury <b>Pyron,</b> [...] "Liberace was the first gay person Elton John had ever seen on television; he became his hero." ...|$|E
2500|$|A devout Roman Catholic to the end, he had {{a priest}} {{administer}} the last rites to him the day before his death. The original {{cause of death was}} attributed variously to anemia (due to a diet of watermelon), emphysema, and heart disease, the last of which was attested to by Liberace's personal physician, Dr. Ronald Daniels. However, the Riverside County coroner, against the advice of Dr. Daniels, performed an autopsy and later stated that [...] "a deliberate attempt" [...] had been made to hide the actual cause of death by Liberace's doctors, his manager, and Liberace's entire immediate family. The post mortem discovered that Liberace had emphysema and coronary artery disease from years of chain smoking, but the real cause of death was pneumonia due to complications from AIDS. Author Darden Asbury <b>Pyron</b> writes that Liberace had been [...] "HIV-positive and symptomatic" [...] from 1985 until his death.|$|E
2500|$|Scurry then {{launched}} a three-pronged attack. <b>Pyron</b> and Raguet {{were ordered to}} attack the Union right, Shropshire the Union left, with the remainder led by Scurry against the Union center, and the artillery firing in support. The attack on the Union left was beaten back, with Shropshire killed. The attack on the center stalled, while the artillery was forced to withdraw after one cannon was disabled and a limber destroyed. The attack itself then stalled, with the Confederates fighting by squads [...] "with a desperation unequaled by any engagement of the war." [...] At around 3:00pm the Confederates outflanked the Union right, but Raguet was mortally wounded. From the ridge (thereafter known as [...] "Sharpshooters Ridge"), Confederate riflemen started picking off the artillerymen and infantry below them. Scurry again pressed the Union center, and the Union position became untenable. Slough reluctantly ordered a retreat, and Tappan formed the companies on the left into a rear guard. Slough reformed his line a half-mile east of Pigeon's Ranch, where skirmishing continued until dusk. The Union men finally retreated to Kozlowski's Ranch, leaving the Confederates in possession of the battlefield.|$|E
