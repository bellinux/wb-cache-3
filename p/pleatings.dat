And I know not how long I lay idly thus when I perceived Mrs. Willis moving quietly about, and my grandfather sitting in the armchair by the window, looking into Freshwater Lane. As my eyes fell upon him my memory came surging back,--first of the duel, then of its cause. And finally, like a leaden weight, the thought of the deception I had practised upon him, of which he must have learned ere this. Nay, I was sure from the troubled look of his face that he knew of it.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{there was}} the bed-canopy, the <b>pleatings</b> of which were gone, and it was turned white instead of the old blue. And the chimney-place! That was unaccountably smaller, and glowed with a sea-coal fire. And the mantel was now but {{a bit of a}} shelf, and held many things that seemed scarce at home on the rough and painted wood,--gold filigree; and China and Japan, and a French clock that ought not to have been just there. Ah, the teacups! Here at last was {{something}} to touch a fibre of my brain, but a pain came with the effort of memory. So my eyes went back to my grandfather in the window. His face was now become black as Scipio's, and he wore a red turban and a striped cotton gown that was too large for him. And he was sewing. This was monstrous! ...|$|E
40|$|Ascus {{structure}} of eight yellow, two white and two brown Rhizocarpon species {{has been investigated}} by light microscopy. Ultrastructure and function in R. atroflavescens subsp. pulverulentum and R. montagnei were studied in TEM. The Rhizocarpon-type ascus clearly differs from all other ascus types observed in the Lecanorales. It is bitunicate, opening with a slight ‘Jack-in-the-box'-mechanism. Its structure and function are related to patellariacean ascus types, but unlike those the ascus wall cytochemistry shows a certain similarity with Lecanora- and Peltigera-type asci. Rhizocarpon-type asci are embedded in a strongly amyloid hymenial gelatine. The nonamyloid ascus wall is surrounded by the strongly amyloid outer layer. The slightly amyloid expansible inner layer (= endoascus) is apically thickened; it shows the banded and pleated ‘accordion-structure' characteristic of bitunicate asci. Prior to dehiscence, the ascus wall and its outer layer burst. Thereafter the <b>pleatings</b> of the expansible inner layer are stretched, forming the rather short beak which reaches the hymenial surface. During expansion gliding occurs between the expansible inner layer and an outer part of the endoascus, here described as the ‘inner layer'. In a few sections of aldehyde- fixed material of R. atroflavescens a small laminated plug was observed in {{the apex of the}} endoascus. Rhizocarpon-lype asci are considered to be the most archaic in the Lecanorales. This supports a hypothesis that Rhizocarpon is a phylogenetically basal group, linking the evolved Lecanorineae, and possibly also the Peltigerineae and Teloschistineae with not yet recognized bitunicate ancestral forms similar to those occurring in the Patellariacea...|$|E
40|$|NOUS ETUDIONS CERTAINES DECOMPOSITIONS DE M EN POLYEDRES IDEAUX, OU M EST UNE VARIETE HYPERBOLIQUE A POINTE(S), DE DIMENSION 3. PAR UN THEOREME D EPSTEIN ET PENNER, IL EXISTE UNE TELLE DECOMPOSITION, DITE DE DELAUNAY, CANONIQUE EN UN SENS GEOMETRIQUE. AU CHAPITRE 1 NOUS TROUVONS LA DECOMPOSITION DE DELAUNAY QUAND M FIBRE SUR LE CERCLE AVEC POUR FIBRE UN TORE PERCE. LA METHODE CONSISTE A DEVINER LA COMBINATOIRE DE LA DECOMPOSITION, PUIS A TROUVER DES ANGLES DIEDRES POSITIFS POUR SES POLYEDRES COMBINATOIRES : UN THEOREME DE RIVIN DIT QUE TOUT POINT CRITIQUE DE LA FONCTIONNELLE VOLUME DANS L ESPACE DE DEFORMATION DES ANGLES DIEDRES FOURNIT LA METRIQUE HYPERBOLIQUE. LES INEGALITES ETABLIES POUR MONTRER L EXISTENCE D UN TEL POINT CRITIQUE PERMETTENT ALORS DE VERIFIER QUE LA DECOMPOSITION EST BIEN DE DELAUNAY. AU CHAPITRE 2 NOUS ETENDONS LA METHODE A CERTAINS COMPLEMENTAIRES D ENTRELCAS (ENTRELACS A 2 PONTS NOTAMMENT). AU CHAPITRE 3 NOUS L ETENDONS AUX CŒURS CONVEXES DE GROUPES QUASI-FUCHSIENS DU TORE PERCE (LA DECOMPOSITION EST ALORS INFINIE, ET CERTAINES PIECES NE SONT PAS DES POLYEDRES). NOUS OBTENONS AINSI UNE NOUVELLE PREUVE DU THEOREME DES LAMINATIONS DE PLISSAGE POUR LE TORE PERCE. AU CHAPITRE 4, NOUS ETENDONS PARTIELLEMENT LA METHODE AUX COMPLEMENTAIRES D ENTRELACS ARBORESCENTS : SANS TROUVER DE POINT CRITIQUE, NOUS CARACTERISONS LES ENTRELACS ARBORESCENTS HYPERBOLIQUES. AU CHAPITRE 5, QUI ECLAIRE UN PASSAGE DU CHAPITRE 3, NOUS MONTRONS QUE CERTAINS POLYNOMES DE LAURENT, QUI GENERALISENT LES NOMBRES DE MARKOFF, N ONT QUE DES COEFFICIENTS POSITIFS. WE STUDY CERTAIN DECOMPOSITIONS OF M INTO IDEAL POLYHEDRA, WHERE M IS A CUSPED HYPERBOLIC 3 -MANIFOLD. A RESULT OF EPSTEIN AND PENNER STATES THAT SUCH A DECOMPOSITION EXISTS : IN PARTICULAR, THE SO-CALLED DELAUNAY DECOMPOSITION, WHICH IS CANONICAL IN A GEOMETRIC SENSE. IN CHAPTER 1, WE FIND THE DELAUNAY DECOMPOSITION FOR M A PUNCTURED-TORUS BUNDLE OVER THE CIRCLE. THE METHOD IS TO GUESS THE COMBINATORICS OF THE DECOMPOSITION, THEN FIND POSITIVE DIHEDRAL ANGLES FOR ITS COMBINATORIAL POLYHEDRA : BY A THEOREM OF RIVIN, ANY CRITICAL POINT OF THE VOLUME FUNCTIONAL IN THE DEFORMATION SPACE OF DIHEDRAL ANGLES GIVES THE HYPERBOLIC METRIC. THE INEQUALITIES INVOLVED IN SHOWING THAT SUCH A CRITICAL POINT EXISTS ALSO IMPLY THAT THE DECOMPOSITION IS INDEED DELAUNAY. IN CHAPTER 2, WE EXTEND THE METHOD TO CERTAIN LINK COMPLEMENTS (NOTABLY, 2 -BRIDGE LINKS). IN CHAPTER 3 WE EXTEND IT TO CONVEX CORES OF QUASIFUCHSIAN PUNCTURED-TORUS GROUPS (HERE THE DECOMPOSITION IS INFINITE, AND HAS SOME NON-POLYHEDRAL PIECES). AS A COROLLARY, WE RE-PROVE THE <b>PLEATING</b> LAMINATION THEOREM FOR PUNCTURED-TORUS GROUPS. IN CHAPTER 4, WE PARTIALLY EXTEND THE METHOD TO ARBORESCENT LINK COMPLEMENTS : WITHOUT FINDING CRITICAL POINTS, WE CHARACTERIZE HYPERBOLIC ARBORESCENT LINKS. IN CHAPTER 5, EXTENDING A PROPOSITION OF CHAPTER 3, WE SHOW THAT CERTAIN LAURENT POLYNOMIALS, WHICH GENERALIZE THE MARKOFF NUMBERS, HAVE ONLY POSITIVE COEFFICIENTS.
