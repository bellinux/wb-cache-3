50|$|The MMPI {{subscale}} 7 describes <b>psychasthenia</b> as akin to obsessive-compulsive disorder, and as characterised by excessive doubts, compulsions, obsessions, and unreasonable fears. The psychasthenic has {{an inability}} to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature. In addition to obsessive-compulsive features, the scale taps abnormal fears, self-criticism, difficulties in concentration, and guilt feelings. The scale assesses long-term (trait) anxiety, although it is somewhat responsive to situational stress as well.|$|E
50|$|Karl Jaspers {{preserves}} the term 'neurasthenia', defining {{it in terms}} of 'irritable weakness' and describing phenomena such as irritability, sensitivity, a painful sensibility, abnormal responsiveness to stimuli, bodily pains, strong experience of fatigue, etc. This is contrasted with <b>psychasthenia</b> which, following Janet, he describes as a variety of phenomena 'held together by the theoretical concept of a 'diminution of psychic energy'.' The psychasthenic person prefers to 'withdraw from his fellows and not be exposed to situations in which his abnormally strong 'complexes' rob him of presence of mind, memory and poise.' The psychasthenic lacks confidence, is prone to obsessional thoughts, unfounded fears, self-scrutiny and indecision. This state in turn promotes withdrawal from the world and daydreaming, yet this only makes things worse. 'The psyche generally lacks an ability to integrate its life or to work through and manage its various experiences; it fails to build up its personality and make any steady development.' Jaspers believed that some of Janet's more extreme cases of <b>psychasthenia</b> were cases of schizophrenia.|$|E
5000|$|The 20th century saw Janet {{developing}} a grand {{model of the}} mind in terms of levels of energy, efficiency and social competence, which he set out in publications including Obsessions and <b>Psychasthenia</b> (1903) and From Anguish to Ecstasy (1926), among others. In its concern {{for the construction of}} the personality in social terms, this model has been compared to the social behaviorism of George Herbert Mead something which explains Lacan's early praise of [...] "Janet, who demonstrated so admirably the signification of feelings of persecution as phenomenological moments in social behaviour".|$|E
50|$|The term <b>psychasthenia</b> is {{historically}} associated primarily {{with the work}} of Pierre Janet, who divided the neuroses into the psychasthenias and the hysterias, discarding the term neurasthenia since it implied a neurological theory where none existed. Whereas the hysterias involved at their source a narrowing of the field of consciousness, the psychasthenias involved at root a disturbance in the fonction du reél ('function of reality'), a kind of weakness in the ability to attend to, adjust to, and synthesise one's changing experience (cf. executive function in today's empiricist psychologies). Carl Jung later made the hysteric and the psychasthenic states the prototypes of what he described as extroverted and introverted personalities.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{validity}} of Rupp's experimental results had been challenged by other workers in the field repeatedly throughout his career, it wasn't until 1935 that his misdeeds were fully exposed. In 1935 experimentalists Walther Gerlach and Eduard Rüchardt published a corrected version of Einstein's mirror diagram in an article that argued that Rupp had falsely claimed to have carried out the rotated mirror experiment. Some fellow physicists at the AEG labs grew suspicious of Rupp when he claimed having accelerated protons at 500 kV, something he couldn't have the technical facilities to achieve. Rupp had to publicly retract five publications from the previous year.

This study was performed {{in order to further}} understand the clinical relevance of these findings. METHODS: Examination of correlates between temperament dimensions (Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire together with the IVE- impulsiveness scale (EPQI), and the Marke-Nyman Temperament (MNT)) and NPY, CRH and DSIP and serum-cortisol in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in 38 suicidal patients and matched controls. RESULTS: NPY correlated significantly and positively with <b>psychasthenia,</b> irritability, and stability and significantly and negatively with validity in patients, but significantly and negatively with muscular tension, <b>psychasthenia,</b> verbal aggression and irritability in controls. DSIP correlated significantly and positively with impulsiveness (EPQI) in controls. CRH correlated negatively with lie in controls.

Method: Juvenile offenders (N = 141) incarcerated in the California Youth Authority completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Version 2 (MAYSI- 2). Results: MMPI {{cluster analysis}} revealed four distinct profiles: two for male and two for female juvenile offenders. Among males, we identified one Normative cluster with no clinically elevated scores. A second male cluster, labeled Disorganized, exhibited clinical elevations on scales 8 (Schizophrenia), 6 (Paranoia), 4 (Psychopathic Deviate), and 7 (<b>Psychasthenia).</b> Among females, two clinically elevated profiles emerged. One Impulsive-Antisocial cluster consisted of clinical elevations on scale 4 (Psychopathic Deviate), which has been consistently associated with delinquent and antisocial behavior.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} personality-adjusting effect of electro-acupuncture {{treatment}} for depression and compared this treatment with paroxetine treatment. METHODS: A non-blinded, randomized controlled trial was adopted. Sixty depressed patients, who met trial criteria, {{were randomly assigned}} to the treatment and the control groups. In the treatment group, electro-acupuncture treatment was used, and paroxetine treatment was used in the control group. During the 24 -week study period, 12 patients dropped out and 48 patients completed the study. The Minnesota Multiple Personality Inventory (MMPI) was adopted as the evaluation tool. At the same time, the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were used to evaluate the psychological state. Evaluations were done before and after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, patients' psychological state improved significantly in both groups (P< 0. 01). For the treatment group, within-group comparison between baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment showed that severity of depression had significantly decreased (P< 0. 01). MADRS and SDS scores decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) and MMPI subscale scores for hypochondriasis, depression, psychopathic deviate, <b>psychasthenia,</b> social introversion and fake decreased significantly (P< 0. 05). For the control group, severity of depression also decreased significantly. MADRS and SDS scores decreased significantly (P< 0. 05); and MMPI subscale scores for hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria, paranoia, and <b>psychasthenia</b> decreased significantly (P< 0. 05). Between-group comparison demonstrated that for the MMPI subscales paranoia and social introversion, the decrease of score was greater in the treatment group than in the control group (P< 0. 05). However, there were no other significant differences between the control group and the treatment group.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{investigated}} whether anxiety characteristics independently predicted {{the onset of}} myocardial infarction (MI) over an average of 12. 4 years and whether this relationship was independent of other psychologic variables and risk factors. BackgroundAlthough several psychosocial factors {{have been associated with}} risk for MI, anxiety has not been examined extensively. Earlier studies also rarely addressed whether the association between a psychologic variable and MI was specific and independent of other psychosocial correlates. MethodsParticipants were 735 older men (mean age 60 years) without a history of coronary disease or diabetes at baseline from the Normative Aging Study. Anxiety characteristics were assessed with 4 scales (<b>psychasthenia,</b> social introversion, phobia, and manifest anxiety) and an overall anxiety factor derived from these scales. ResultsAnxiety characteristics independently and prospectively predicted MI incidence after controlling for age, education, marital status, fasting glucose, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure in proportional hazards models. The adjusted relative risk (95 % confidence interval [CI]) of MI associated with each standard deviation increase in anxiety variable was 1. 37 (95 % CI 1. 12 to 1. 68) for <b>psychasthenia,</b> 1. 31 (95 % CI 1. 05 to 1. 63) for social introversion, 1. 36 (95 % CI 1. 10 to 1. 68) for phobia, 1. 42 (95 % CI 1. 14 to 1. 76) for manifest anxiety, and 1. 43 (95 % CI 1. 17 to 1. 75) for overall anxiety. These relationships remained significant after further adjusting for health behaviors (drinking, smoking, and caloric intake), medications for hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes during follow-up and additional psychologic variables (depression, type A behavior, hostility, anger, and negative emotion).

40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} reported that depressive personality (the scores of hypochondriasis, depression and <b>psychasthenia</b> {{determined by the}} Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)) and daily hassles of Graves' disease (GD) patients treated long trem with antithyroid drug (ATD) were significantly higher in a relapsed group than in a remitted group, even in the euthyroid state. The present study aims {{to examine the relationship}} among depressive personality, emotional stresses, thyroid function and the prognosis of hyperthyroidism in newly diagnosed GD patients. Methods Sixty-four untreated GD patients responded to the MMPI for personality traits, the Natsume's Stress Inventory for major life events, and the Hayashi's Daily Life Stress Inventory for daily life stresses before and during ATD treatment. Results In the untreated thyrotoxic state, depressive personality (T-scores of hypochondriasis, depression or <b>psychasthenia</b> greater than 60 points in MMPI) were found for 44 patients (69 %). For 15 (23 %) of these patients, the scores decreased to the normal range after treatment. However, depressive personality persisted after treatment in the remaining 29 patients (46 %). Normal scores before treatment were found for 20 patients (31 %), and the scores were persistently normal for 15 patients (23 %). The remaining 5 patients (8 %) had higher depressive personality after treatment. Such depressive personality was not associated with the severity of hyperthyroidism. Serum TSH receptor antibody activity at three years after treatment was significantly (p = 0. 0351) greater in the depression group than in the non- depression group. The remission rate at four years after treatment was significantly (p = 0. 0305) lower in the depression group than in the non- depression group (22 % vs 52 %). Conclusion The data indicate that in GD patients treated with ATD, depressive personality during treatment reflects the effect of emotional stress more than that of thyrotoxicosis and that it aggravates hyperthyroidism. Psychosomatic therapeutic approaches including antipsychiatric drugs and/or psychotherapy appears to be useful for improving the prognosis of hyperthyroidism. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects that a particular psychopharmacological treatment has on personality patterns in patients with panic disorder. METHOD: Forty-seven patients with panic disorder and 40 controls were included in the study.
