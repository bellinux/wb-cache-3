40|$|Lights vary {{in their}} ability to render object {{spectral}} reflectances into color contrasts. When a light L 1 is replaced by another L 2, even if L 2 matches L 1 in chromaticity, systematic color shifts may occur, including a loss or gain of <b>chromatic</b> <b>color.</b> For instance, many familiar lights, when compared to daylight, dull red and green objects, rendering them closer to gray. An opponent colors method is appropriate to this discussion because it brings to the surface the notion of <b>chromatic</b> <b>color,</b> meaning actual departure from white or gray. In this article, an opponent-colors analysis leads to a matrix formulation that serves two purposes. The effects of replacing L 1 by L 2 are estimated with a 3 x 3 “rendering matrix ” P. Given an object’s tristimulus vector under L 1, the method makes an approximate prediction of the new tristimulus vector under L 2. Thanks to the opponent formulation, matrix element P 22 quantifies the gain or loss of redness and greenness, while P 33 expresses gain or loss of blueness and yellowness. These in fact are major effects, so the method is both quantitative and explanatory...|$|R

All data presented are collected from various sources, such as Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian Standard Dictionary), and added with data obtained from Oxford Advanced Leaner’s Dictionary, Indonesian proverb book, encyclopedia, terminology collection book, poetry anthology, song lyrics, and data of the author’s own creation as an Indonesian native speaker. Set aside from their literal meanings, the metaphorically used color words are collected and classified into two categories, i. e. achromatic and <b>chromatic</b> <b>colors.</b> Then, their universalities are determined by comparing them with English color metaphors. Finally the existence of specific Indonesian color metaphors are identified by correlating them with extra linguistic factors, such as environment, history, religion, politic and other socio cultural activities.

40|$|A color-order {{system is}} a {{conceptual}} system of organized color perceptions. The Munsell Color System was the first color-order system developed by Munsell in 1905 as a teaching aid for art students [9]. His goal was to have both a numerical system and a physical exemplification, achieved via the Atlas of the Munsell Colors [10]. A color-order system exemplification is a physical system that depicts a color-order system. His guiding principle was equality of visual spacing. The original Atlas has undergone considerable refinement and development based on extensive visual experimentation resulting in the current specification, the Munsell System, and its various exemplifications. During late 1930 s, a subcommittee of the Optical Society of America performed further visual experiments to improve the visual spacing between color samples. More sophisticated color matching experimental techniques were used [11], totaling over three million observations in the final specifications [12]. A Munsell notation is defined as H V/C for hue (H), value (V), and chroma (C). The Munsell system is cylindrical in nature with a central lightness axis (Munsell value) surrounded by chromatic planes arranged in a hue circle. For a given hue, the colors have equal visual spacing. However, between hues, the more <b>chromatic</b> <b>colors</b> are further apart than less <b>chromatic</b> <b>colors</b> are. Between 1947 and 1974, the Optical Society of America developed a new color-order system, called the OSA Uniform Color Scales (OSA-UCS), that alleviated this deficiency. Unfortunately, the OSA-UCS is very complex and very difficult to sample colors at constant hue or chroma, thus greatly limiting its usage. The International Commission on Illumination (Commission International de l’’Eclairage, CIE) standardized a method of specifiying the color of illuminants and materials by tristim-ulus values X, Y, Z: X = k Y = k Z =...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPsychophysical {{chromatic}} sensitivity deteriorates in peripheral retina, {{even after}} appropriate size scaling of targets. This decrease is more marked for stimuli targeted at the long- (L) to middle-wavelength (M) cone opponent system than for stimuli targeted at short-wavelength (S) pathways. Foveal chromatic mechanisms integrate over several hundred milliseconds for pulse detection. If the time course for integration were shorter in the periphery, this {{might account for}} sensitivity loss. <b>Psychophysical</b> <b>chromatic</b> temporal integration (critical duration) for human observers was estimated {{as a function of}} eccentricity. Critical duration decreased by a factor of 2 (from ∼ 200 to ∼ 100 ms) from the fovea to 20 ° eccentricity. This partly (but not completely) accounts for the decrease in |L–M| sensitivity in the periphery, but almost completely accounts for the decrease in S-cone sensitivity. Some loss of |L–M|I sensitivity thus has a cortical locus. In a physiological analysis, we consider how the |L–M| cone parvocellular pathway integrates chromatic signals. Neurometric contrast sensitivities of individual retinal ganglion cells decreased with the square-root of stimulus duration (as expected from Poisson statistics of ganglion cell firing). In contrast, psychophysical data followed an inverse linear relationship (Bloch’s law). Models of cortical pooling mechanisms incorporating uncertainty as to stimulus onset and duration can at least partially account for this discrepancy...|$|R
