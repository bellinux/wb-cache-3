5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the curfew and exclusion orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E

40|$|User Equipment (UE) <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> {{location}} tracking {{are influenced by}} the underling state handling model. There are recent proposals to introduce a new RRC state called RRC Inactive as a main state for inactive UEs in 5 th Generation (5 G) cellular systems. One of the characteristics of the new state is that the interface between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) is kept. Considering this characteristic, there are proposals for a RAN controlled <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> {{location tracking}} schemes for RRC Inactive UEs. In this paper, we show that this approach is not always beneficial, especially for high mobility UEs. Instead, we propose a hybrid <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking scheme where both RAN and CN are involved in the <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking of RRC Inactive UEs. This is done transparently to the UE. We further propose a hierarchical <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking scheme to reduce the signaling overhead from <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking updates. The scheme is applicable to both RAN based <b>and</b> CN based <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking schemes...|$|R

5|$|In February 1942, Casterman {{suggested}} to Hergé that his books {{be published in}} a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 <b>pages,</b> <b>and</b> now in full colour rather than black-and-white. He agreed to this, and in 1943 The Crab with the Golden Claws was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus bringing {{it up to the}} standard 62-page format.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to Lichfield in February 1734, where he began an annotated edition of Poliziano's Latin poems, {{along with a}} history of Latin poetry from Petrarch to Poliziano. The work was designed to fill 480 <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> provide a detailed commentary and corresponding notes. By completing such a work as this, Johnson hoped to become known as a scholar-poet similar to Julius Caesar Scaliger, Daniel and Nikolaes Heinsius, Desiderius Erasmus, and Poliziano, all of whom Johnson admired. Johnson began on 15 June 1743 and printed a Proposal for the work on 5 August 1734. However, the project did not receive enough funds and it was soon brought to an end. Although the project failed, it shows that Johnson identified himself with neo-Latin humanism.|$|E

5|$|Murasaki is {{best known}} for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel {{spanning}} 1100 <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete.

She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD).

5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, were not {{included}} in the final cut. Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet. Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping <b>pages)</b> <b>and</b> the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits. Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's start. This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.|$|E
