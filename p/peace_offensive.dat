50|$|After {{years of}} being split into fiefdoms, the main Somalian warlords {{established}} an agreement to appoint a new president in 2004. However, this plan failed when Islamist insurgents, including the radical youth militia al-Shabaab who had links to Al-Qaeda, gained control over much of southern Somalia from 2006 to 2008. With the assistance of international <b>peace</b> keeping <b>offensives</b> and the Kenyan army, the Islamist insurgents were forced to withdraw in 2012. In the same year, the first formal parliament in over 20 years was appointed in Somalia. The newly formed parliament chose Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in September 2012. With international assistance, the Somalian government {{has been able to}} rebuild itself and the country has been relatively more stable recently. Since 2013, Somalia has retained a polity score of five and is listed as an open anocracy.|$|R

He summarized Old Republican principles as: [...] "love of <b>peace,</b> hatred of <b>offensive</b> war, jealousy of the state governments toward the general government; a dread of standing armies; a loathing of public debts, taxes, and excises; tenderness for the liberty of the citizen; jealousy, Argus-eyed jealousy of the patronage of the President." ...|$|R

Such a bellicousness and the underlying military industry constitute the tip of a great offensive by the big military power (USA) and its "new" "globalizing" ideology: The "neo"-liberalism.

50|$|Now U Nu {{turned the}} {{communist}} <b>peace</b> <b>offensive</b> {{to his advantage}} {{and came up with}} a very successful 'arms for democracy' offer. Tatmadaw offensives in early 1956, Operation Aung Thura (Valiant Victory) in Pakokku area and Operation Aung Tayza (Glorious Victory) in Pathein area, had been partly successful. The year 1958 saw mass surrenders of first the Rakhine nationalists led by U Seinda, next the Pa-O, Mon, and Shan communists, but most importantly the PVO led by Bo Po Kun. The official figure was 5,500 armed insurgents that 'entered the light', of which about 800 were White Flag communists mainly in Sittwe, northern Rakhine State. The one crucial exception was the KNU.|$|E

50|$|In 1963 Ne Win {{as head of}} the Union Revolutionary Council {{government}} {{launched a}} <b>peace</b> <b>offensive</b> starting with a general amnesty on 1 April. Bo Ye Htut, a member of the Thirty Comrades and central military committee of the CPB who had been to Rangoon on a secret peace mission before the 1958 AFPFL split, took the offer together with Bo Ye Maung and Bo Sein Tin. The KNU split in the same month between the KNUP and the Karen Revolutionary Council (KRC) led by Saw Hunter Tha Hmwe. The first insurgent group to arrive in Rangoon was the Red Flag delegation in June later joined by Thakin Soe himself from Arakan in August. After just three meetings the talks were abruptly ended by the RC on 20 August and the Red Flag communists were flown back to Sittwe.|$|E
50|$|Expectations {{had been}} running high, and the People’s Peace Committee, {{set up by the}} NUF and {{supported}} by Thakin Kodaw Hmaing and former brigadier Kyaw Zaw, staged a Six-District Peace March in early November from Minhla to Rangoon. The marchers were cheered and applauded along the entire route by large crowds chanting anti-government slogans, and given food parcels collected by the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU) and the All Burma Federation of Student Unions (ABFSU). When they reached Rangoon at a mass rally of 200,000 in front of City Hall, speakers openly supported the NDUF’s demand to keep its weapons and territory. Although at first the CPB and NDUF had misinterpreted Ne Win’s <b>peace</b> <b>offensive</b> as a sign of weakness desperate for a solution, once they arrived in Rangoon they realised {{it was going to be}} a mainly cosmetic exercise. They therefore took the opportunity to re-establish contacts and meet family and friends.|$|E
5000|$|British XXII Corps {{was formed}} in France in December 1917, from {{what was left of}} II ANZAC, once the Australian {{divisions}} had left to form the Australian Corps. In July 1918, significantly reconstituted as an inter-Allied reserve corps, by the addition of four first-line British Army divisions, the 15th (Scottish) Division, the 34th Division, the 51st (Highland) Division and the 62nd (West Riding) Division. It was placed under French command in July 1918 prior to the German [...] "Friedensturm" [...] (<b>Peace</b> <b>Offensive).</b> The Corps {{played an important role in}} the [...] "pinching-off" [...] of the Soissons-Rheims salient (which had been established by the German [...] "Bluecher" [...] Offensive in late May 1918) in the Second Battle of the Marne. Two divisions (15th, 34th) went into action with the French Tenth Army (Mangin) against the Soissons [...] "hinge", two (51st, 62nd) in the Ardre valley with the French Fifth Army (Berthelot) against the Rheims [...] "hinge".|$|E
5000|$|Russian GRU {{defector}} Stanislav Lunev said in {{his autobiography}} that [...] "the GRU and the KGB helped to fund just about every antiwar movement and organization in America and abroad," [...] and that during the Vietnam War the USSR gave $1 billion to American anti-war movements, more than it gave to the VietCong, although he does not identify any organisation by name. Lunev described this as a [...] "hugely successful campaign and well worth the cost". The former KGB officer Sergei Tretyakov said that the Soviet Peace Committee funded and organized demonstrations in Europe against US bases. According to Time magazine, a US State Department official estimated that the KGB may have spent $600 million on the <b>peace</b> <b>offensive</b> up to 1983, channeling funds through national Communist parties or the World Peace Council [...] "to {{a host of new}} antiwar organizations that would, in many cases, reject the financial help if they knew the source." [...] Richard Felix Staar in his book Foreign Policies of the Soviet Union says that non-communist peace movements without overt ties to the USSR were [...] "virtually controlled" [...] by it. Lord Chalfont claimed that the Soviet Union was giving the European peace movement £100 million a year. The Federation of Conservative Students (FCS) alleged Soviet funding of CND.|$|E
5000|$|In 1546, Spanish {{authorities}} discovered {{silver in}} the Zacatecas region and established mining settlements in Chichimeca territory which altered the terrain and the Chichimeca traditional way of life. The Chichimeca resisted the intrusions on their ancestral lands by attacking travelers and merchants along the [...] "silver roads." [...] The ensuing Chichimeca War (1550-1590) would become the longest and costliest conflict between Spanish forces and indigenous peoples in the Americas. The attacks intensified with each passing year. In 1554, the Chichimecas inflicted a great loss upon the Spanish when they attacked a train of sixty wagons and captured more than 30,000 pesos worth of valuables. By the 1580s, thousands had died and Spanish mining settlements in Chichimeca territory were continually under threat. In 1585, Don Alvaro Manrique de Zúñiga, Marquis of Villamanrique, was appointed viceroy. The viceroy was infuriated {{when he learned that}} some Spanish soldiers had begun supplementing their incomes by raiding the villages of peaceful Indians in order to sell them into slavery. With no military end to the conflict in sight, he was determined to restore peace to that region and launched a full-scale <b>peace</b> <b>offensive</b> by negotiating with Chichimeca leaders and providing them with lands, agricultural supplies, and other goods. This policy of [...] "peace by purchase" [...] finally brought an end to the Chichimeca War.|$|E
40|$|Abstract At {{the end of}} the 20 th century, the Soviet Union {{dissolved}} its Communist Empire and East and West Germany reunited. These dramatic {{events were}} preceded by Soviet consolidation of the world socialist and peace movements with assistance from the European Left, especially in West Germany. On {{the other side of the}} Iron Curtain, newly emerged independent peace groups, such as Charter 77, also played a significant role. In the process, West Germany realigned itself with the Soviet Union, diminishing the role of the United States and Great Britain in Europe. This shift was a direct result of the Soviet long-term <b>peace</b> <b>offensive</b> policy, which was originally devised by V. I. Lenin to defeat capitalism worldwide. The Soviet <b>peace</b> <b>offensive</b> sought the creation of a common security system, disarmament, and the withdrawal of U. S. troops and weapons from Europe. As soon as the communist facade disappeared and the image of the enemy faded, many Western policymakers and analysts stopped paying attention to the fact that Russia continued to pursue the same strategic objectives in Europe after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia's long-term strategic and geopolitical interests remained the same. Could Russia, some twenty years later, be closer to fulfilling these goals?EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This ARI {{explores the}} {{situation}} in the Korean peninsula after the sinking of the Cheonan on 26 March 2010 and stresses the need for a new South Korean policy towards the North. We are entering the final stage of the Cheonan incident, following the adoption of the UN Security Council President’s Statement of 9 July 2010. There will now be a period of either stalemate or confrontation between the two Koreas. And North Korea is very likely to engage in its traditional <b>peace</b> <b>offensive</b> vis-à-vis the outside world. To manage North Korea’s challenges in the coming days, South Korea should consider the following: (1) taking a long-term comprehensive approach towards North Korea geared towards achieving a fundamental change in the North; (2) enhancing its defence posture in various ways to deny North Korea’s political and military objectives; (3) further strengthening its international cooperation networks, including its links to China; and (4) consolidating domestic support for its policy towards North Korea...|$|E
40|$|The Purpose of {{this article}} is to {{consider}} the analysis of intelligence that relates to a <b>peace</b> <b>offensive</b> of the Soviet Union that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs executed in the 1970 's. In this article, an informal opinion where the diplomat in the Soviet Union, Malaysia, Singapore, India, China, Taiwan, and Bangladesh explained the collective security of Asia is examined closely. When the real intention of the Asian collective security of the Soviet Union was ascertained, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs used the unofficial view of the diplomat in these foreign countries. The Asian collective security that the Soviet Union had proposed was actually the one to aim at encirclement toward China. And, the Asian collective security that the Soviet Union had proposed was the one including the border nonaggression principle for Japan to admit the illegal occupancy of northern territories by the Soviet Union. As a result, Japanese Government refused cooperation in the Asian collective security proposal of the Soviet Union...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs {{the image of}} the thermonuclear apocalypse loomed over {{the early years of the}} Cold War and technological advancements brought the possibility of such a fate closer to reality, the U. S. -Soviet conflict became increasingly a battle for hearts and minds—on the home front as well as among allied populations. However, public diplomacy in a democracy is more complicated than a public relations campaign, for actions often trump words, particularly in the case of nuclear strategy. This thesis examines the aims of policy, strategy, and mass persuasion and its civil-military character as manifested in the atomic public diplomacy in the Cold War until the 1980 s, but especially of the classical period, 1940 s– 1960 s. Specifically, it studies public presentation of nuclear issues through three media: U. S. television, the Soviet <b>peace</b> <b>offensive,</b> and official communiqués of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In each example, leaders sought to shape citizens’ views on warfare in order to garner the support necessary to carry out an expensive strategy that required tremendous faith from the political public. These three examples shed light on the importance of mass politics in the creation and implementation of strategy in an era of high tension and rapid technological innovation.
