25|$|The Sealand was a {{high wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction with a flying boat hull and both underwing floats and a standard tail-wheel undercarriage; the two main wheels retracted into recesses in the hull below the wings, while the tailwheel retracted behind the hull's <b>planing</b> <b>bottom.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{anodised}} duralumin fuselage {{was mounted}} below the lower wing, with the <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> {{of the hull}} made of stainless steel (as on the Singapore II) with a transverse main step. The use of stainless steel reduced the frequency of land inspections of the hull. The bimetallic corrosion problems experienced on the Singapore II hull had been solved; Short Brothers became the first company to master the technique of building seaplane floats and flying boat hulls in this combination of metals.|$|E
25|$|The Sarafand was a six-engined biplane {{flying boat}} with equal span wings. Due {{to the high}} wing end loads, Gouge {{specified}} corrugated steel spars for both upper and lower wings. The six engines, in tractor/pusher pairs, were housed in monocoque nacelles mounted between the wings on integral girders; the central nacelle was further supported by two pairs of splayed struts to the lower wing-roots. The hull, largely constructed of anodised Alclad, had a stainless-steel <b>planing</b> <b>bottom.</b> It had a monoplane tail unit with one large fin and two small auxiliary fins on the tailplane.|$|E

25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired long range, the PBB became a fairly large aircraft, with a {{wingspan}} of 139 feet 8½ inches (42.59 m) and a crew of ten. Despite its size, it was powered by just two Wright R-3350 Duplex Cyclone radial engines, driving three-bladed Curtiss Electric propellers. It was the largest twin-engined flying boat flown during World War II. For a flying boat, the PBB was aerodynamically clean, with a cantilever wing set high on the fuselage. The <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> had a single step, and the non-retractable outrigger floats were attached to streamlined, cantilever struts. The lower hull was divided with seven watertight compartments, and a short upper deck provided seating for the cockpit crew. The wing of the PBB was constructed in a center section and two outer panels. The center section carried the engine nacelles and contained the internal bomb bays, as well as fuel and oil tanks. The outer wing panels contained main and auxiliary, integral fuel tanks.|$|E
2500|$|The hull, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was {{all-metal}} and rectangular, with flat sides and top. Its <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> was also flat, with two steps. Stability on the water was provided by long, stepless floats on each side, strut-mounted from the wings a little outside the engines and braced to the fuselage with a parallel pair of horizontal struts. [...] The hull tapered in plan to the tail, where the empennage was again rectangular, with a broad fin reaching out beyond the end of the hull and carrying a balanced rudder. [...] The tailplane was mounted on the fin about one third of the way up, braced from below with a single strut on each side, and carried narrow-chord elevators.|$|E
2500|$|The Sunderland Mark IV used major {{structural}} {{elements of the}} Sunderland Mark III, with a fuselage stretch of 3ft ahead of the wing, an extended and redesigned <b>planing</b> <b>bottom,</b> the same wing with thicker Duralumin skinning, and Bristol Hercules engines. Further structural changes were made after initial flight tests. The planned armament consisted of two fixed forward-firing [...]303inch (7.7mm) Browning machine guns in the nose, a Brockhouse Engineering nose turret with twin [...]50 in (12.7mm) machine guns, twin 20 mm Hispano cannon mounted in a Bristol B.17 dorsal turret, twin [...]50 in (12.7mm) guns in a Glenn-Martin tail turret, and another [...]50 in (12.7mm) machine gun in a hand-held position {{on each side of}} the fuselage.

2500|$|As an {{amphibian}} the Kittiwake {{needed to}} have a retractable undercarriage, a most unusual feature at this time. [...] The two main wheels were retracted with a hand crank into boxes within the hull, placed {{between the first and}} second step. [...] These boxes had cam-operated doors to preserve the hull surface. [...] Inevitably, this arrangement led to a very narrow track undercarriage. [...] At the rear of the hull/central float was a combined water rudder/ tailskid.

2500|$|The Lerwick was of {{all-metal}} construction, with {{a conventional}} flying boat hull, a <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> and two stabilising floats, carried under the wings on long struts. It was powered by two Bristol Hercules radial engines and initially had twin fins and rudders. For defence, the Lerwick {{was equipped with}} three powered gun turrets. The nose turret had a single 0.303 inch Vickers K gun; the other two had 0.303 Browning machine guns, two guns in the Nash & Thomson FN.8 turret in the dorsal position and four in the Nash & Thomson FN4.A turret at the tail. Offensive weapons were a total of [...] of bombs or depth charges – four [...] or eight [...] bombs, or four depth charges, carried in two streamlined nacelles behind the engines, similar to the Martin PBM Mariner.|$|E
2500|$|To try {{to resolve}} the H-4's {{hydrodynamic}} issues, in 1915 Porte carried {{out a series of}} experiments on four H-4s fitted with a variety of modified hulls, using the results of these tests to design a new [...] hull which was fitted to the wings and tail of an H-4, serial number 3580, with a pair of 150hp (112kW) Hispano-Suiza 8 engines as the Felixstowe F.1. [...] Rather than the lightweight boat-type structure of the Curtiss boats, the F.1's hull was based around a sturdy wooden box-girder similar to that used in contemporary landplanes, to which were attached a single-step <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> and side sponsons. [...] Once modified by the fitting of a further two steps, the new hull proved to give much better take off and landing characteristics and was much more seaworthy.|$|E
2500|$|The SR.45 Princess {{was a large}} flying boat, {{being the}} largest {{all-metal}} flying boat to have ever been constructed. The Princess featured a rounded, bulbous, [...] "double-bubble" [...] pressurized fuselage which contained two full passenger decks; these decks had sufficient room to accommodate up to 105 passengers in great comfort. The <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> of the hull had only a slight step in the keel to minimize drag in the air. The Princess was powered by an arrangement of ten Bristol Proteus turboprop engines. These engines drove six sets of four-bladed propellers; of these, the inner four propellers were double, contra-rotating propellers which were driven by a twin version of the Proteus, named the Bristol Coupled Proteus, each engine drove one of the propellers. The two outer propellers were single and each powered by a single engine.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hull of the}} Latécoère 340 had a <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> {{with two}} steps. [...] It was built around a keel and four {{longerons}} and provided a mooring position in the nose, an enclosed cabin for pilot and radio operator and a passenger cabin with four windows on each side. Aft of the cabin there was a space for mail. The sponsons, symmetric [...] in cross section and with a thickness/chord ratio of 12.5%, were entirely metal. [...] The fuselage was aluminium covered, tapering towards the tail with decreasing skin thickness. [...] Like the wings, the rear surfaces were metal structures with fabric covering. The tailplane was mounted a little way up the fin, the latter carrying a generous and rounded rudder, its lower edge blending elegantly into {{the lines of the}} lower fuselage. [...] The rudder had a trim tab, but neither it nor the elevators had aerodynamic balances.|$|E
2500|$|Sopwith then {{produced}} {{a completely new}} design of flying boat, still called [...] "Bat-boat", this time a pusher configuration two-bay biplane powered by a 90hp (67kW) Austro-Daimler engine. [...] The hull, which was again built by Saunders of Consuta, accommodated two people side-by-side in an open cockpit {{in line with the}} leading edge of the wings, and had a curved, vee-profile <b>planing</b> <b>bottom.</b> [...] The wings, of 41ft (12.5m) span, were unstaggered, with lateral control by wing warping. The tail, which had no fixed fin, was carried on tailbooms connected to the wings, while an additional forward elevator was fitted to the front of the hull to supplement the normal elevator fitted to the tail. The new Bat-boat was assembled at Sopwith's new factory at Kingston upon Thames early in 1913, and was displayed at the International Aero Show at Olympia, London in February that year.|$|E
2500|$|Seen side on, the Latécoère 24's {{fuselage}} was {{slender and}} elegant, yet from below it was broad beamed {{to match the}} stubby wings. [...] At the widest point its beam was 3.5 m and its height 1.70 m (11ft 6 in x 5ft 7 in). [...] It was built of spruce and ash. The trapesoidal sponsons were largely wooden, [...] with metal longerons. [...] There was a mooring position in the nose with a post room aft, followed by positions for navigator and radio operator. [...] The pilot sat in an open cockpit to starboard. [...] Behind him were fuel tanks within firewalls, followed by mail compartments. [...] The <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> had two steps, the first at {{the trailing edge of}} the sponsons and the second well aft. [...] The tail unit had a wide chord rounded fin that carried a nearly semi-circular rudder and a tailplane at mid height to keep it clear of the water. [...] The tailplane incidence was adjustable on the ground; the elevators had leading edge compensators like those fitted to the ailerons.|$|E
25|$|After {{designing}} the un-built Ro I twin-engined flying boat, Rohrbach developed the Rohrbach Ro II flying boat as an all-metal shoulder winged monoplane flying boat with two tractor engines mounted in nacelles, above the wings, on struts. Planforms and profiles were kept {{as simple as}} possible with rectangular section fuselage frames (with vee <b>planing</b> <b>bottoms),</b> constant chord wings, tailplane and fin with square cut tips and distinctive protruding servo/trim/balance tabs at wing and fin tips. The two-seat open cockpit sat between the engines at the wing leading edge, with an open gunner/bosun's position at the extreme nose. A very unusual feature of several of Rohrbach's flying-boats was the provision of a pair of masts and sails to be rigged in the event of engine failure to allow the aircraft to be sailed back to safety.|$|R

2500|$|The fuselage, {{like most}} of the Kittiwake was built with Saunders' patent Consuta method for {{jointing}} plywood panels with sewn copper wire. [...] This was well tested on motor boats - it circumvented the absence of waterproof glues pre-1945 - but had only been used once before on an aircraft, Saunders' own, much smaller [...] T.1. The hull was of two step design with a shallow V <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> and tumblehome sides. [...] On its top were two accommodation levels, the lower glazed in cockpit for the two crew and above them, set back and roofed by the upper wing was the passenger space. [...] This had its own enclosing front and side windows and held seven passengers. [...] Though the forward part of the fuselage containing crew and passengers was married to the hull, aft of the wings these became separate, so that the Kittiwake was somewhere between a flying boat and a single float seaplane in appearance. [...] This separation made it straightforward to mount the tail high up and well clear of the water. [...] There was a variable-incidence tailplane with unbalanced elevators and bearing three wire braced fins, the central one carrying a balanced rudder.|$|E
2500|$|The Cockle [...] was an {{all-metal}} aircraft {{apart from}} the fabric-covered flying surfaces. [...] The hull was a duralumin monocoque structure with a concave V-shaped <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> incorporating two steps, the main one near the centre of gravity. [...] These steps were external to the monocoque to prevent step damage leading to water leakage into the hull. [...] The top of the hull was rounded, with a single-seat open cockpit near the nose. [...] The wings had steel spars and were mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage, with pairs of bracing struts to the chines. [...] The wings carried full-span ailerons which could be drooped together, flap-like, for landing. There were stabilising floats near the wingtips in trouser-like fairings. [...] The two engines were mounted on top of the wing at about mid-chord, the twin-bladed propellers being driven via long extension shafts to the leading edge. [...] Originally the Cockle had a shallow triangular fin and rudder, but this was later extended upwards to a curved and slightly pointed profile which more than doubled the area, to cope better with single-engine flying. A tube ran transversely across the hull just above the main step, into which the axle of a pair of ground-handling wheels could be inserted.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to its wooden wings, {{the hull of}} the CAMS 110 was all metal. [...] It was built from transverse and longitudinal light alloy frames and covered with védal, duralumin with an outer layer of aluminium for protection from sea-water. The <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> had two steps, one under {{the trailing edge of}} the wing and the other further aft. Longitudinal stability was assured by wing floats of similar construction to the hull. [...] The CAMS 110 was intended for long flights and carried five or six crew, all in enclosed accommodation. The commander, who was navigator, observer and bomb-aimer was housed in the nose in a cabin with three windows on each side and provided with a chart table. He could also operate one of the two machine guns on mounts just aft of the windows or use a position in the roof from which, behind a folding glass windscreen, he could observe in the open air. On top of the fuselage, offset to port, was a long glazed cabin which seated two pilots in tandem, provided with dual control. Below, {{on the other side of}} the fuselage was the flight engineer's position and behind him the radio operator's post. Machine gun mounts allowed a gunner to cover either side. Further aft there was a sleeping compartment, a kitchen and a toilet.|$|E
50|$|The first Type IV {{had a pair}} of floats, about 7.8 m and 3.1 m apart, single stepped, round topped in {{cross-section}} and with hard chine but almost flat bottoms. These were mounted on an axle just forward of the wing leading edge, supported at its centre by a V-strut from the lower fuselage longerons and at its extremities by struts at about 45° to the same points. Under the trailing edge a W-form strut linked the longerons and floats, allowing passage for bombs released from the central fuselage underside. Vertical legs transmitted landing forces to the lower wing just inboard of the folding line. The floats were made of spruce and ply covered; on the <b>planing</b> <b>bottoms</b> the ply was 8 mm thick. A second example, the IVbis, had a single central main float, suitable for catapult launching, and a small, stabilizing float under each wing.|$|R

2500|$|It was {{the second}} Saunders {{aircraft}} to use their patented [...] "corrugated" [...] structure for the hull, first trialled on the Saunders A.14, in which longitudinal external corrugations in the skin replaced internal riveted stringers. Full trials of the A.14, revealing both {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of this technique were not made until after the Severn had flown. [...] Like the A.14 the Severn's construction largely avoided doubly curved hull plating, so the <b>planing</b> <b>bottom</b> was strictly V-shaped and the upper hull rather slab sided. [...] The hull was a two-step design with tumble-home sides above the chines. [...] There was a gunner's position in the nose and a side-by-side open cockpit for the pilots ahead of the engines and wing. [...] Behind the cockpit and within a windowed part of the hull were crew positions and accommodation, from which a dorsal gunner's position just aft of the wings could be accessed. [...] There was an isolated rear gunner's position at the extreme rear of the upswept rear fuselage, above the braced tailplane and between the two braced fins. [...] Twin balanced elevators projected beyond the tailplane and the fins carried balanced rudders. [...] Early flight trials showed the Severn to be heavy on rudder control, so separate servo-rudders were soon fixed on struts behind the main rudder surfaces. [...] It was also heavy on elevators, which were increased in area.|$|E
2500|$|The Saunders A.3 Valkyrie {{was built}} in {{response}} to Air Ministry specification 22/24 for a large general duty and patrol flying boat, Saunders receiving an order for a single prototype for trials in February 1925. It was a three-engined biplane with a two step monocoque hull, circular apart from the shallow, curved <b>planing</b> <b>bottom.</b> The fuselage had no internal bulkheads and was deliberately designed to be flexible so as to absorb the shocks of landing, {{though there was a}} rigid section under the wings. As with Saunders' other wooden aircraft, Valkyrie's hull [...] was covered with Consuta sewn stress-bearing plywood. It accommodated a crew of five. There was a pair of open tandem cockpits with dual flying controls well forward of the wing leading edge. Below this, aft and in the hull were the navigation and radio operator's position, and further aft, behind the trailing edge there were two gunners' positions, roughly in tandem but offset port and starboard, each fitted with machine guns on Scarff rings. The gunner's cockpit in the nose was similarly equipped. [...] There were bunks and living space for all five crew in the rigid part of the hull. The fin was large and angular, carrying the braced rectangular tailplane with unbalanced elevators above the top of the hull. [...] The fin also carried a large and prominently balanced rudder with a rudder servo surface on outriggers.|$|E
50|$|The fixed {{landing gear}} has twin wheels {{on each of}} the three {{vertical}} shock absorber-equipped struts. The main leading gear units are mounted on triangulated tubular structures, while the nose gear is bracketed to the cockpit bulkhead via a watertight seal in the <b>planing</b> <b>bottom.</b> The main wheels have hydraulic brakes operated from the pedals, complete with a parking hand brake, while the nose unit is fully castoring.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to use many kinds of natural energy resources to keep environment clean and to reduce the energy consumption. Many simple and skilful methods to utilize the natural energy have to be developed. The authors have been proposing to utilize snow stored till summer as one of the natural cold and clean energy resources. In this study, the authors investigated the characteristics of direct heat exchange between hot air and snow block with a vertical hole. This heat transfer model, so called as the snow cooling system, may be applied to various air-conditioning systems of conventional living room and so on. As the heat transfer process of this model is very complicated because the shape of the snow block changes by the progress of melting, the characteristics of the direct heat exchange were investigated by the experiment with a model of practical scale. The outlet air temperature through the snow hole and snow melting process were measured for various air flow rates at constant inlet air temperature 30 ℃. Experimental results show that the outlet air temperature from the snow cooling system was almost constant and enough lower to use for the actual air conditioning situations.
