5000|$|To worm, parcel {{and serve}} a line {{is to apply}} to {{standing}} rigging a multi-layered <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>chafe</b> and deterioration. It is a technique not usually used on modern small boats, but is found extensively on traditionally-rigged sailing ships. Worming, parcelling and serving —referred to collectively as [...] "service"— is traditionally applied only to traditional twisted rope, either natural fiber or steel wire-rope, not the braided line almost exclusively used on modern vessels, but some traditional vessels now use modern high modulus braided lines (like Amsteel or AS-90) in place of wire rope (to save weight aloft) and serve the line to maintain the traditional appearance. It {{can be applied to}} the entire length of a line, such as a shroud, or selectively, to specific parts of a line, such as over the spliced ends of a stay, where the chafe on the middle section of the stay precludes complete protection.|$|R
50|$|On rare occasions, when {{parcelling}} {{is not to}} {{be served}} (e.g., for short term use to protect a line <b>against</b> <b>chafe),</b> it should be applied against the lay of the line, counter to that guiding rhyme. In these circumstances, the parcelling itself is filling the protective role that serving would do.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{propensity}} of retroviruses to rapidly establish persistent infections poses a formidable problem in vaccination strategies. In the current study, {{we use a}} live attenuated vaccine to study <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute and persistent Friend virus infections in mice. Adoptive transfers of immune CD 8 + T cells combined with passive immunizations with virus-neutralizing antibodies increased <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease compared with either treatment alone, {{but there was no}} <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> the establishment of persistent infection. In addition, the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease elicited by the combination treatment was dependent on endogenous CD 4 + T cells as no protection was achieved in CD 4 + T-cell-depleted mice. Quantitative studies showed that doubling the numbers of immune lymphocytes used in adoptive transfer experiments increased <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease {{depending on the type of}} lymphocyte subset used in the transfer. CD 8 + T cells were the most potent subset for the transfer of such protection. However, even high numbers of immune CD 8 + T cells gave no <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> the establishment of persistent infections. The data indicate that strengthening the numbers of specific immune cell subsets may have a beneficial effect on <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease, but protection from establishment of persistence requires complex immune responses involving multiple lymphocyte subsets...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that active {{immunization}} of rats with the capsular polysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis protects these animals against abscess development following intraperitoneal challenge with this species. Passive transfer of hyperimmune globulin from immunized animals to nonimmune recipients provided <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> B. fragilis bacteremia in challenged animals, but did not confer <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> abscess development. On the other hand, adoptive transfer of spleen cells from immunized animals to nonimmunized recipients resulted in <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> abscesses following challenge with B. fragilis.
