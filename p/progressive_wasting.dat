5000|$|Targeted {{disruption}} of G2A in mice causes {{the development of}} a late onset (> 1 year) slowly <b>progressive</b> <b>wasting</b> and autoimmune disease characterized by lymphoid organ enlargement, lymphocytic infiltration into various tissues, glomerular immune complex deposition, and anti-nuclear autoantibodies. [...] Mice transplanted with bone marrow cells containing the BCR-ABL leukemia-inducing fusion gene but deficient in G2A exhibit expanded populations of leukemic cells compared to recipients of BCR-ABL-containing, G2A-sufficient bone marrow cells. BCR-ABL is the oncogene of the Philadelphia chromosome that causes human Chronic myelogenous leukemia and is sometimes found associated with human acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia; furthermore, the forced expression of BCR-ABL in cultured rodent cells induces the expression of G2A and the overexpression of G2A inhibits the malignant growth to these cells. [...] Thus, the G2A deficiency studies suggest that G2A functions in mice to suppress certain immune dysfunctions and BCR-ABL-related leukemic cell growth.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cachexia {{represents}} <b>progressive</b> <b>wasting</b> {{of muscle}} and adipose tissue and {{is associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality. Although anorexia usually accompanies cachexia, cachexia rarely responds to increased food intake alone. Our knowledge of the under-lying mechanisms responsible for cachexia remains incomplete. However, most states of cachexia are associ-ated with underlying inflammatory processes and/or can-cer. These processes activate protein degradation and lipolytic pathways, resulting in tissue loss. In this article, we briefly review the pathophysiology of cachexia and discuss the role of specific nutrient supplements {{for the treatment of}} cachexia.

40|$|AbstractHNF 1 is a {{transcriptional}} activator of many hepatic genes including albumin, α 1 -antitrypsin, and α- and β-fibrinogen.

Mice lacking HNF 1 fail to thrive and die around weaning after a <b>progressive</b> <b>wasting</b> syndrome with a marked liver enlargement. The transcription rate of genes like albumin and α 1 -antitrypsin is reduced, while the gene coding for phenylalanine hydroxylase is totally silent, giving rise to phenylketonuria. Mutant mice also suffer from severe Fanconi syndrome caused by renal proximal tubular dysfunction. The resulting massive urinary glucose loss leads to energy and water wasting.

40|$|The {{generation}} of waste is closely linked to population size, urbanization and affluence, but a state’s capacity to manage its waste and mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that derive from it, {{is a function of}} that state’s regulatory and institutional regimes {{and the extent to which}} it has access to appropriate resources, infrastructure and incentives. There is, therefore, a clear demarcation between developed and developing countries’ capacities to manage waste. This chapter provides an overview of key waste management policies in the Asia-Pacific, a highly diverse region which consists of developed economies (Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan), economies-in-transition (Malaysia, Thailand, China, to name a few), and still relatively poor, developing countries (the Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and all the Pacific island countries, again to name just a few).

40|$|The dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC) can be {{considered}} as a specialized adhesion complex, linking the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton, primarily in muscle cells. Mutations in several components of the DGC lead to its partial or total loss, resulting in various forms of muscular dystrophy. These typically manifest as <b>progressive</b> <b>wasting</b> diseases with loss of muscle integrity. Debate is ongoing about the precise function of the DGC: initially a strictly mechanical role was proposed but {{it has been suggested that}} there is aberrant calcium handling in muscular dystrophy and, more recently, changes in MAP kinase and GTPase signalling have been implicated in the aetiology of the disease. Here, we discuss new and interesting developments in these aspects of DGC function and attempt to rationalize the mechanical, calcium and signalling hypotheses to provide a unifying hypothesis of the underlying process of muscular dystrophy...|$|E
40|$|Facioscapulohumeral muscular {{dystrophy}} (FSHD) {{is a common}} form of {{muscular dystrophy}} in adults that is foremost characterized by <b>progressive</b> <b>wasting</b> of muscles in the upper body. FSHD is associated with contraction of D 4 Z 4 macrosatellite repeats on chromosome 4 q 35, but this contraction is pathogenic only in certain "permissive" chromosomal backgrounds. Here, we show that FSHD patients carry specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the chromosomal region distal to the last D 4 Z 4 repeat. This FSHD-predisposing configuration creates a canonical polyadenylation signal for transcripts derived from DUX 4, a double homeobox gene of unknown function that straddles the last repeat unit and the adjacent sequence. Transfection studies revealed that DUX 4 transcripts are efficiently polyadenylated and are more stable when expressed from permissive chromosomes. These findings suggest that FSHD arises through a toxic gain of function attributable to the stabilized distal DUX 4 transcript...|$|E

Most myopathies in which the molecular defect has been identified are due to mutations affecting proteins that form a supramolecular link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, such as dystrophin, the mutated protein in DMD. In the absence {{of one of these}} proteins, mechanical stress associated with contraction progressively leads to degeneration of the muscle fiber, although the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood.
