Although most studies focus on CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production, the emissions from lime production is not well researched. Lime production is the second largest source of carbon emissions from industrial processes after cement production.

40|$|Purpose: Additive {{manufacturing}} {{processes such as}} Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) are often considered to be more sustainable then conventional manufacturing methods. However, quantitative analyses of {{the environmental impact of}} these processes are still limited and mainly focus on energy consumption. This paper presents parametric models to estimate the environmental footprint of the SLS’ production phase, covering energy and resource consumption as well as <b>process</b> <b>emissions.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The required Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data are collected using the CO 2 PE! – Methodology, including time, power, consumables and emission studies. Multiple linear regression analyses have been applied to investigate the interrelationships between product design features {{on the one hand and}} production time (energy and resource consumption) on the other hand. Findings: The proposed parametric process models provide accurate estimations of the environmental footprint of SLS processes based on two design features, build height and volume, and help to identify and quantify measures for significant impact reduction of both involved products as well as the supporting machine tools. Practical/Social implications: The gained environmental insight can be used as input for ecodesign activities, as well as environmental comparison of alternative manufacturing process plans.

40|$|Based on 15 {{production}} lines we surveyed in China, the widely accepted {{input and output}} methods were applied to compare the <b>process</b> <b>emissions</b> with CSI (Cement Sustainability Initiative), and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) default values. We found that the output method would magnify CO 2 emissions from carbonate breakdown during clinker production. A reasonable method is to calculate carbonate content in raw meal using the CaO and MgO content in carbonate-containing material and their material ratio. Another finding is that the raw meals consumption recommended by CSI and CMBA (China Building Materials Academy) would enlarge and underestimate the calcining emissions, respectively. We applied the TC (total carbon) and LHV (lower heating value) methods for fuel emissions calculation and found {{that all of the}} samples' fuel emissions by the LHV method' were higher than those by the TC method. Indirect emissions from different cement producing stages were also estimated by using regional electricity emission factor. In raw meal preparation and cement grinding stage, there were no differences in main production technologies, but in clinker production stage a remarkable difference appears. Replacing carbonate-containing materials with non-carbonate materials and changing clinker ratio are the main ways to reduce CO 2 content in raw meal and <b>process</b> <b>emissions.</b> Lowering fossil fuel intensity, using clean energy and alternative fuel were strongly recommended for reducing cement energy emissions.
