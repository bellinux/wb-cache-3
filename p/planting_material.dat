40|$|Elevated {{atmospheric}} CO 2 may alter decomposition rates through {{changes in}} <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> quality and through {{its impact on}} soil microbial activity. This study examines whether <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> produced under elevated CO 2 decomposes differently from <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> produced under ambient CO 2. Moreover, a long-term experiment offered {{a unique opportunity to}} evaluate assumptions about C cycling under elevated CO 2 made in coupled climate-soil organic matter (SOM) models. Trifolium repens and Lolium perenne <b>plant</b> <b>materials,</b> produced under elevated (60 Pa) and ambient CO 2 at two levels of N fertilizer (140 vs. 560 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1)), were incubated in soil for 90 days. Soils and <b>plant</b> <b>materials</b> used for the incubation had been exposed to ambient and elevated CO 2 under free air carbon dioxide enrichment conditions and had received the N fertilizer for 9 years. The rate of decomposition of L. perenne and T. repens <b>plant</b> <b>materials</b> was unaffected by elevated atmospheric CO 2 and rate of N fertilization. Increases in L. perenne <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> C : N ratio under elevated CO 2 did not affect decomposition rates of the <b>plant</b> <b>material.</b> If under prolonged elevated CO 2 changes in soil microbial dynamics had occurred, they were not reflected in the rate of decomposition of the <b>plant</b> <b>material.</b> Only soil respiration under L. perenne, with or without incorporation of <b>plant</b> <b>material,</b> from the low-N fertilization treatment was enhanced after exposure to elevated CO 2. This increase in soil respiration was not reflected in an increase in the microbial biomass of the L. perenne soil. The contribution of old and newly sequestered C to soil respiration, as revealed by the C- 13 -CO 2 signature, reflected the turnover times of SOM-C pools as described by multipool SOM models. The results do not confirm the assumption of a negative feedback induced in the C cycle following an increase in CO 2, as used in coupled climate-SOM models.

40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} studies, limited dispersal {{was revealed}} {{to be the main}} obstacle to restoration of species-rich flood-meadows along the northern Upper Rhine in Germany. To overcome dispersal limitation we transferred freshly mown <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> from species-rich sources to a restoration site on a former arable field. Before <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> application, topsoil was removed to accelerate nutrient impoverishment and create favourable conditions for seedling recruitment. Topsoil removal led to a drastic reduction in organic matter and essential mineral nutrients to the level of target communities (P) or even below (N, K). At a removal depth of 30 cm content of the soil seed bank that comprised exclusively of annual arable weeds, ruderals and some common grassland species, declined by 60 - 80 %, while at a removal depth of 50 cm the seed bank was almost completely eliminated. With few exceptions, all species recorded in source <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> were found established at the restoration site. However, the overall correlation between seed content in <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> and estab-lishment success was not very high. Vegetation development at the restoration site was charac-terized by a rapid decline in arable weeds and ruderals, while resident grassland species and species transferred with <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> increased rapidly from the third year onwards. After four years as many as 102 species were established that could be exclusively attributed to <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> transfer, among them many rare and highly endangered plants. Establishment of species from <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> was most successful in regularly flooded plots, due to the suppression of competitors as well as the creation of favourable moisture conditions for seedling emergence. Diaspore transfer with <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> proved to be an extremely successful method in restoring species-rich grass-land. However, high quality of <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> and suitable site conditions with low competition in early stages of succession seem to be essential prerequisites...|$|R
40|$|The current {{fight against}} Vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{has focused on}} promoting biofortified staples that are rich in beta carotene, such as Orange Fleshed Sweetpotato (OFSP). These efforts usually entail providing quality <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> to vulnerable households accompanied by sensitization {{about the benefits of}} OFSP. Most such interventions heavily subsidize the <b>planting</b> <b>materials,</b> with subsidies ranging from 50 - 100 %. The subsidies are often premised on the hope that farmers will eventually absorb the full cost of the <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> once they experience the benefits of consuming OFSP. This study uses data from 481 farmers drawn from different regions that benefited from a sweetpotato project, and the ANOVA and descriptive statistics, to examine farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for OFSP <b>planting</b> <b>materials.</b> It specifically compares the WTP for quality <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of OFSP and non-OFSP varieties and assesses differences in WTP by region and agroecology. It finds a higher WTP for clean <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of a non-OFSP variety than for all OFSP varieties studied. It also finds that WTP differs by region and agroecology. The study concludes that there is higher demand for quality <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of some of the non-OFSP varieties of sweetpotato than for OFSP varieties, and that WTP for differs by intervention area. These findings imply that farmers’ demand for clean <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of non-OFSP varieties is higher than for the OFSP varieties. They suggest the need for sweetpotato breeding to continue considering some of the attributes that make local varieties popular, e. g., taste and dry matter content, in their breeding programs...|$|R
