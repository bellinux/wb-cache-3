40|$|The recent {{advances}} on information technology have made tremendous change on traditional banking. These days, {{people do not}} carry cash and prefer to use electronic devices such as point of sale system (POS) or PIN entry devices (<b>PinPad)</b> to do desirable transactions. These technologies could facilitate e-business and increase profitability in various industries including banking sector. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the effect of five new products namely ATM, POS Machines, <b>PinPad</b> machines, online and swift branches on banking performance indicators including return on assets (ROA), return on equities (ROE) and operating investment return (OIR). We use the information of 19 private and governmental banks, which were active in Iran over the period of 2005 - 2010. The study uses linear regression analysis as well as VAR technique to study the effects of the independent variables on bank performance indicators. The results indicate that while there are some weak and positive relationships between three technology indicators including POS, <b>PinPad</b> and online businesses and ROA as well as ROE, there is relatively strong and positive relationship between these three independent variables and OIR. In addition, while the results of VAR analysis have shown that any reduction on <b>PinPad</b> will reduce OIR but this reduction will disappear after approximately four periods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an attack that identifies {{the sequence of}} keystrokes analyzing mechanical vibrations generated by the act of pressing keys. We use accelerometers as vibration sensors. The apparatus necessary for this attack is inexpensive and can be unobtrusively embedded within the target equipment. We tested the proposed attack on an ATM keypad and a <b>PINpad.</b> We achieved the key recognition rates of 98. 4 % in ATM keypad, 76. 7 % in PIN-pad resting on a hard surface and 82. 1 % in PIN-pad hold in hand.

40|$|Card {{payments}} {{are getting more}} and more popular across the world. The dominant standard used for Electronic Funds Transfer transaction is EMV. It is widely used across Europe and Canada, and currently it is being introduced in the USA. The most frequently used Cardholder Verification Method in EMV transaction is PIN, which requires from the payment terminal to be equipped with <b>pinpad</b> - which increases the cost of the whole payment device. In this article I present an alternative Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) that can be used instead of traditional PIN. The key advantage of the presented mechanism is that it can be easily implemented in currently utilized authorization protocols, it does not affect rules of EMV specification and may decrease time of transaction processing...|$|E
