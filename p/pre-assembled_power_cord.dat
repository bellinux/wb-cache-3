5000|$|Worldwide, {{more than}} a dozen {{different}} types of AC power plugs and sockets are used for fixed building wiring. Products sold in many different markets can use a standardized IEC 60320 connector and then use a detachable <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> to match the local electrical outlets. This simplifies safety approvals, factory testing, and production since the <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> is a low-cost item available as a commodity. Note that the same types of appliance-side connectors are used with both 110 V and 230 V power cables, so care must be used when moving appliances between countries with different voltage standards [...] - [...] substituting a <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> that matches local power outlets will result in an incorrect voltage being applied to the appliance or equipment. Unless explicitly labelled as capable of handling local voltages, this is very likely to damage or destroy the appliance. Some devices have a slide-switch to adapt to different voltages, or wide-ranging power supplies.|$|R
