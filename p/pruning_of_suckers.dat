40|$|Biomechanical {{properties}} <b>of</b> squid <b>suckers</b> {{were studied}} to provide {{inspiration for the}} development <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> artefacts for a robotic octopus. Mechanical support of the rings found inside squid suckers was studied by bending tests. Tensile tests were carried out to study the maximum possible sucking force produced by squid suckers based on the strength <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> stalks, normalized by the sucking areas. The squid suckers were also directly tested to obtain sucking forces by a special testing arrangement. Inspired by the squid <b>suckers,</b> three types <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> artefacts were developed for the arm skin of an octopus inspired robot. The first <b>sucker</b> artefact made <b>of</b> knitted nylon sheet reinforced silicone rubber has the same shape as the squid suckers. Like real squid <b>suckers,</b> this type <b>of</b> artefact also has a stalk that {{is connected to the}} arm skin and a ring to give radial support. The second design is a straight cylindrical structure with uniform wall thickness made of silicone rubber. One end of the cylinder is directly connected to the arm skin and the other end is open. The final design <b>of</b> the <b>sucker</b> has a cylindrical base and a concave meniscus top. The meniscus was formed naturally using the surface tension of silicone gel, which leads to a higher level of the liquid around the edge of a container. The wall thickness decreases towards the tip <b>of</b> the <b>sucker</b> opening. Sucking forces of all three types <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> artefacts were measured. Advantages and isadvantages <b>of</b> each <b>sucker</b> type were discussed. The final design <b>of</b> <b>suckers</b> has been implemented to the arm skin prototypes...|$|R

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} on ‘enset’ propagation at Humbo, Wolayta. The experiments {{of this study were}} executed with the objectives of determining size of whole corms and corm pieces for better sucker production. Five whole corm sizes (0. 75, 3, 7, 11 and 15 kg), five bigger (0. 8, 1. 75, 2. 3, 3. 5 and 4. 6) and three smaller (0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 kg) corm pieces, three corm piece positions (lower, middle and top) of horizontal cut. There were significant (p< 0. 01) differences among corms and corm pieces in the number <b>of</b> <b>suckers.</b> Whole corms with 7 kg gave the highest number of suckers; similarly, corm pieces with 3. 5 kg. The mean number <b>of</b> <b>suckers</b> produced ranged from 9. 5 - 28. 4 for whole corms, 3. 7 - 38. 1 for corm piece. There was no positive and significant relationship between total number <b>of</b> <b>suckers</b> and growth. Many of the other growth parameters are associated with each other. The highest sucker number was recorded using corms of 7 kg corm and 3. 5 kg corm pieces. 1) Significant variations among corms and corm pieces in the number <b>of</b> <b>suckers</b> formed, with whole corms, corms with 7 and 3 kg weights scored the highest number <b>of</b> <b>suckers.</b> With corm pieces, those with 3. 5, 4. 6, and 1. 75 kg sizes scored the highest sucker numbers. Compared for whole corms, corm pieces gave the greatest overall number <b>of</b> <b>suckers.</b> 2) The size of corms and corm pieces had a significant effect on leaf width and leaf length; and sucker height, pseudostem length leaf width, leaf length and leaf number respectively. 3) The position of the corm from which pieces were taken affected their regeneration capacity.

40|$|SUGAR RESEARCH Australia (SRA) uses a {{selection}} index within the variety improvement program called Economic Genetic Value {{to determine which}} clones will be advanced to {{the next stage of}} selection. Economic Genetic Value is determined from a number of traits including cane yield and sugar content which are both quantitative. Within the Northern region of the Australian sugar industry, a visual subjective rating, mainly assessing the propensity of lodging and flowering and suckering, is included as an appearance grade. Suckering within commercial crops of sugarcane can lead to a decline in CCS while elevating overall tonnes of product delivered to the mill. To assess the propensity <b>of</b> <b>suckering,</b> a linear equation <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> weight as a function <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> height and number was established. It is important to refine the relationship matrix for sucker weight based on the size and number <b>of</b> <b>suckers.</b> For the current study, data from two first clonal trials were used and selection of the top 25 % of clones, based only on old and new appearance grade methods, without consideration of cane yield and sugar content, was simulated.
