5|$|If the Universe were {{contracting}} {{instead of}} expanding, {{we would see}} distant galaxies blueshifted by an amount <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> their distance instead of redshifted.|$|E
5|$|The nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} constructs a clustering in time <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> {{the square}} of the number of points to be clustered. This is also <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the size of its input, when the input is provided {{in the form of an}} explicit distance matrix. The algorithm uses an amount of memory <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the number of points, when it is used for clustering methods such as Ward's method that allow constant-time calculation of the distance between clusters. However, for some other clustering methods it uses a larger amount of memory in an auxiliary data structure with which it keeps track of the distances between pairs of clusters.|$|E

5|$|A better {{approximation}} {{is to take}} ε = L/M, {{the energy}} generation rate per unit mass, as ε is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> TI15, where TI is the core temperature. This is suitable for stars at least as massive as the Sun, exhibiting the CNO cycle, and gives the better fit R ∝ M0.78.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> {{the square of the}} mass and inversely <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} causes a {{temperature}} {{rise of the}} gas, <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the pressure increase. Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage. Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.|$|E
5|$|Convolve the {{pixelated}} {{image with}} a heat kernel to simulate its evolution under the heat equation {{for a short}} time step. The result is a Gaussian blur of the image, or equivalently the Weierstrass transform of the indicator function, with radius <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the square root of the time step.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, the area {{enclosed}} by the curve shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area {{per unit of}} time, independent of the curve. Therefore, the total time for a curve to shrink to a point is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> its area, regardless of its initial shape.|$|E

5|$|Further insufficiencies, such as {{rotor blade}} {{friction}} and drag, gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine.

5|$|However, the {{distance}} from y to the centre, s is now greater than SQ, so an additional force is required to move the body to q such that sq = SQ. The extra force is represented by yq, and f is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> ry + yq, just as F is to RQ.|$|E
5|$|In an 1878 {{article that}} Ohly called ‘epoch-making,’ Charles Graux {{proved that the}} numerals {{at the end of}} the medieval manuscripts were <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the length of each work and in fact gave the total number of a fixed unit equal to a Homeric line.

5|$|Many frogs have webbed {{feet and}} the degree of webbing is {{directly}} <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the amount of time the species spends in the water. The completely aquatic African dwarf frog (Hymenochirus sp.) has fully webbed toes, whereas those of White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea), an arboreal species, are only a quarter or half webbed.|$|E
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the degree of viremia, and inversely <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E

Prior to this election, the electoral system was changed in 2007 from a constituency-based d'Hondt proportional representation (with seven multi-member constituencies), which had some elements of mixed member <b>proportional</b> voting, <b>to</b> a nationwide d'Hondt based <b>proportional</b> system <b>to</b> reduce disproportionality.|$|R
