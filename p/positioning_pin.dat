Then the French left wing would make a feint attack against the Spanish right. After this distraction, the reinforced right wing would deliver the main French assault. To implement this strategy, De Flers had only 5,000 foot soldiers, 300 horsemen, 15 cannons, and nine howitzers. Claude Souchon de Chamron led the 1,180 men of the left wing. This comprised Pierre François Sauret's 7th Battalion of Champagne, Pierre Banel's 7th Battalion of the Aude, Charles Dugua's artillery of Gard, and Paul-Louis Gaultier de Kervéguen's 3rd Company of Lavaur.

40|$|This paper extends pin-tool {{research}} by investigating a new method to accurately <b>position</b> high-fidelity <b>pins</b> in an array, with each <b>pin</b> uniquely <b>positioned</b> under computer control. The resultant tool is a reusable prototyping {{system for the}} rapid generation of three-dimension (3 -D) profiles using CAD extracted data, with application potential {{in a variety of}} manufacturing processes. A control assessment identifies a combination of array-addressing, latching positioning hardware, and a combined "setting platen" pin-position feedback and drive as an appropriate technique for pin control. The novel platen motion strategy is capable of moving thousands of pins with a single drive motor. The system incorporates latching "locks" that operate on the "tail" of a new two-part "header and tail" pin design. Key to the lock strategy is the application of shape memory alloy actuators in a back-to-back configuration; the response of this material to electrical input is quantified and applied to achieve the unique lock design. Multiple locks combined into a demonstrator position headers to an accuracy of + 0. 09 - 0. 05 mm. The mounting pitch of the prototype system permits the use of 1. 0 mm section pins. An extension to the design ultimately allows a 15 000 pin-array to be positioned in similar to 3 min. Note to Practitioners-This research was motivated by the apparent lack of a technique to uniquely <b>position</b> small section <b>pins</b> in an array, without a bulky control system, power limitations, or motion system restrictions. Prior approaches to <b>positioning</b> <b>pins</b> in an array have used multiplexed or sequential control on pins of 6 mm section or larger. This research investigates a combined control system/hardware approach applied to pins of 1 mm square section, scalable to move thousands of pins uniquely. The presented novel solutions generate a higher fidelity surface definition than previous systems. Extending existing research on surface-smoothing interpolators that reduce the "staircase" effect generated by discrete pins would be beneficial. ...|$|R

But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position.

40|$|International audienceFunctional {{ferroelectric}} {{thin films}} present a great interest for telecommunication applications. In particular, the tunability of the dielectric constant under an applied electric field allows realizing of intelligent devices. The non linear {{variation of the}} permittivity is attributed to domain wall motion. The movement of domain walls {{under the influence of}} a low ac electric field corresponds either to a vibration around the equilibrium <b>position</b> (<b>pinning</b> center) or to a jump towards another equilibrium state. The first mechanism corresponds to a reversible process whereas the second is related to an irreversible modification of the local polarization. This results in the “hyperbolic law” for the description of the permittivity which is an improvement of the Raleight law. We present here a study of the parameters of the hyperbolic law {{as a function of the}} bias field, i. e. at different points of the hysteresis cycle. We are in particular interested by the ratio between the reversible and the irreversible contribution to the permittivity. Experiments concern the real part of the permittivity but also the imaginary part which is related to the dielectric losses phenomena...|$|R

40|$|Placing {{the tunnels}} in the {{anatomic}} positions {{is important for}} successful restoration of knee function after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It {{has been shown that}} it is difficult to place the tunnels in the anatomic position using the transtibial technique. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of each step of our modified transtibial technique (mTT) on the positioning of the femoral tunnel so as to assess whether the mTT could achieve anatomic placements of the tunnels without tibial tunnel expansion. Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. First, the tibial tunnel was created in the center of ACL footprint. Then, a pin was inserted through the tibial tunnel using a femoral guide by four stepwise techniques: transtibial technique, additional anterior drawer force applied to the proximal tibia, another additional varus force applied to the tibia and finally, additional external rotation of the tibia and the femoral guide (mTT). Then, tibial tunnel was re-reamed using mTT with 10 mm-diameter reamer. The <b>pin</b> <b>positions</b> in each technique on the femur were evaluated by the quadrant method and shapes of the tibial tunnel apertures were evaluated. Femoral <b>pin</b> <b>positions</b> in the four techniques were 23. 6 ± 4. 5 %, 28. 4 ± 3. 4 %, 30. 1 ± 3. 8 %, 33. 2 ± 4. 5 % in the superior-inferior position, and 23. 9 ± 4. 3 %, 26. 2 ± 3. 7 %, 32. 0 ± 4. 3 %, 36. 9 ± 4. 8 % in the anterior-posterior <b>position,</b> respectively. <b>Pin</b> <b>position</b> shifted to more inferior and posterior position with each step of mTT (all p values comparing superior-inferior and anterior-posterior positions of each step with positions of previous step were 0. 008 or less).

After belatedly learning of Howe's march, George Washington ordered John Sullivan {{to take charge of}} his own division plus those of Lord Stirling and Stephen and stop the British. Near the Birmingham Friends Meetinghouse, Stephen's 1,500 men drew up on the right flank, Stirling's 1,500 soldiers defended the center, and Sullivan's troops filed into position on the left. The British outnumbered the Americans by approximately 8,000 to 4,000 men. Stephen's division and two cannons held a wooded hill in a place called Sandy Hollow.
