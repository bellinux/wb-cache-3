5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the <b>pressure</b> <b>cabin</b> on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
25|$|The Junkers Ju 49 was {{developed}} entirely to investigate techniques for flight at high altitude. To this end, {{it had a}} specially developed engine and the first pressurized cabin in a German aircraft. The engine was the Junkers L88a, which combined two six-cylinder inline L8 motors into an upright V-12 and had a two-stage supercharger plus intercooler to sustain power at high altitudes. It produced 522kW (700hp) at about 5,800m (19,000ft). This engine drove a large four-blade propeller. The <b>pressure</b> <b>cabin</b> held the two crew. The original intention was for operation at about 6,000m (20,000ft).|$|E
25|$|From the outset, each Meteor was {{constructed}} from several modular sections or separately produced units, a deliberate design choice {{to allow for}} production to be dispersed and for easy disassembly for transport. Each aircraft comprised five main sections: nose, forward fuselage, central section, rear fuselage and tail units; the wings were also built out of lengthwise sections. The forward section contained the <b>pressure</b> <b>cabin,</b> gun compartments, and forward undercarriage. The center section incorporated much of the structural elements, including the inner wing, engine nacelles, fuel tank, ammunition drums, and main undercarriage. The rear fuselage was of a conventional semi-monocoque structure. Various aluminium alloys were the primary materials used throughout {{the structure of the}} Meteor, such as the stressed duralumin skin.|$|E
50|$|The Junkers EF 61 was a German {{prototype}} twin-engined high-altitude bomber aircraft of the 1930s. Only {{two examples}} were built, but it provided valuable information on <b>pressure</b> <b>cabins</b> which aided {{the design of}} later pressurised aircraft.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the low {{pressure}} environment of commercial aircraft, hypoxaemia may be common and accentuated in patients with lung or heart disease. Regulations specify a <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> not lower than 750 hPa {{but it is not}} known whether this standard is met. This knowledge is important in determining the hazards of commercial flight for patients and the validity of current flight simulation tests. METHODS: Using a wrist-watch recording altimeter, <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was recorded at 60 s intervals on 45 flights in Boeing 747 - 400 aircraft with three airlines. A log was kept of aircraft altitude using the in-flight display. Change in <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> during flight, relationship between aircraft altitude and <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> and proportion of flight time with <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> approaching the minimum specified by regulation were determined. RESULTS: Flight duration averaged 10 h. Average <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> during flight was 846 hPa. There was a linear fall in <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> as the aircraft cruising altitude increased. At 10, 300 m (34, 000 ft) <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was 843 hPa and changed 8 hPa for every 300 m (1000 ft) change in aircraft altitude (r(2) = 0. 993; P < 0. 001). Lowest <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was 792 hPa at 12 200 m (40, 000 ft) but during only 2 % of flight time was <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> less than 800 hPa. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> is determined only by the engineering of the aircraft and its altitude and {{in the present study was}} always higher than required by regulation. Current fitness-to-fly evaluations simulate cabin conditions that passengers will not experience on these aircraft. There may be increased risks to patients should new or older aircraft operate nearer to the present minimum standard. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{technology}} developed at NASA s Kennedy Space Center, pilots now have a hand-held personal safety device to warn them of potentially dangerous or deteriorating <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> altitude conditions before hypoxia becomes a threat. The Personal <b>Cabin</b> <b>Pressure</b> Altitude Monitor and Warning System monitors <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> to determine when supplemental oxygen should be used according to Federal Aviation Regulations. The device benefits both pressurized and nonpressurized aircraft operations - warning pressurized aircraft when the required safe <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> altitude is compromised, and reminding nonpressurized aircraft when supplemental oxygen is needed...|$|R
25|$|Starting 1 April 2003 Kato Airline {{took over}} two public service {{obligation}} routes, which received subsidies from the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Both were out of Bodø, one to Røst Airport {{and the other to}} Narvik Airport, Framnes—the downtown airport serving Narvik. The same year the airline won four-year contract with Norway Post to operate postal flights from Trondheim to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. Kato Airline was allowed to operate the route with a Dornier Do 228, a significantly smaller aircraft than the incumbent de Havilland Canada Dash 8 used by Widerøe. By December both routes had seen a drastic fall in patronage. Røst Municipal Council came with a statement criticizing the ministry for allowing such aircraft, stating that the lacked among other amenities accessibility, <b>pressure</b> <b>cabin,</b> weather radar, space for hand luggage and that the airline did not operate with discount tickets.

2500|$|At {{the time}} that the Mk V was placed in {{production}} there were growing fears that the Luftwaffe were about to start mass-producing very high flying bombers such as the Junkers Ju 86, which could fly above the reach of most fighters of the time. It was decided that a new Spitfire variant would be required with improved high altitude performance. During a meeting held at the RAE at Farnborough on 17 February 1941 the Air Ministry asked [...] "that a Spitfire should be provided with a <b>pressure</b> <b>cabin</b> capable of maintaining a pressure differential of 1 lb per square inch at 40,000 feet." [...] A Marshall-manufactured compressor was to be used, and it was agreed that the sliding canopy could be replaced by one which could not be slid open, as long as it could be jettisoned by the pilot.|$|E
