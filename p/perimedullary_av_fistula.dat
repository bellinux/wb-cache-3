40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the outcome of infrapopliteal bypass when an {{adjuvant}} arteriovenous (<b>AV)</b> <b>fistula</b> was reconstructed as means of rescue as a result of poor runoff. The design was a retrospective multicenter case-control study. MethodsSeventy-seven infrapopliteal vein bypasses required an adjuvant <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> among 1813 patients operated on for critical leg ischemia in 3 vascular centers between 1996 and 2003. The mean age was 74 years (range, 39 - 90 years). A total of 70 % of the patients had diabetes, and 24 % had undergone previous vascular surgery. In 25 % of the bypasses, the distal anastomosis was in a crural artery, in 55 % it was in the dorsal pedal artery, and in 20 % it was in a plantar artery. An adjuvant <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> was reconstructed in all cases because of poor intraoperative arterial status, intraoperative angiography, or low intraoperative flow. A control group was retrieved that matched the study group according to the recipient artery and runoff score. ResultsThe primary and secondary patency were 61 % and 75 %, respectively, at 1 year in the <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> group and 57 % and 71 % in the control group. The 3 -year patency rates were 49 % and 62 % for the <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> group and 46 % and 71 % for the control group, respectively. There was a 76 % leg-salvage rate at 3 years in the study group, compared with 87 % in the control group.

Immunohistochemical staining and morphometric measurements of intima and media were performed in the artery, the vein, the toe, and the heel of the venous anastomosis. Ratios of intimal to medial thickness (Ith/Mth) and area (Ia/Ma) were calculated. IH developed in all goats, mainly at the anastomosis (Ia/Ma = 0. 17) and the efferent vein (Ia/Ma = 0. 31). The artery was almost free of lesions (Ia/Ma = 0. 03). In the efferent vein, Ith/Mth varied between 0. 59 and 0. 68. In the anastomosis the largest value of Ith/Mth was measured at the suture lines (0. 88 and 0. 91). Absolute intimal area increased with time. IH contained many vascular smooth muscle cells with a patchy display of desmin positivity, an abundance of smooth muscle cell alpha-actin positivity, and almost complete endothelial cell coverage. Occlusion was due to thrombus formation on the IH. A clear intimal hyperplasia developed in <b>AV</b> <b>fistulas</b> in goats at locations comparable to those in humans.

30|$|The <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> is {{considered}} the best long-term vascular access for haemodialysis because it provides adequate blood flow, is long-lasting and has a lower complication rate than other types of access.

40|$|Introduction. Though {{surgical}} {{approach is}} common in arteriovenous (<b>AV)</b> <b>fistula</b> treatment, endovascular procedures such as stent-graft placement has become more popular in recent years. We aim to present a case of thrombosed femoral artery stent-graft which was placed one year earlier due to multiple <b>AV</b> <b>fistulas</b> following gunshot wounds. Case Outline. A 43 -year-old patient {{was admitted to the}} Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases 'Dedinje', Belgrade, Serbia, for arteriography. Five years before, he had suffered from six gunshot wounds in his right leg and one year before, in the health centre in Vienna, stent-graft had been placed in the right superficial femoral artery due to multiple <b>AV</b> <b>fistulas.</b> Because of artery dilation proximal to <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> location, a large dimensional stent-graft had to be placed (24 mm). After admission, arteriography and Multislice CT (MSCT) angiography revealed thrombotic masses in the stent-graft with intraluminal stenosis of 50 %. Extirpation of thrombosed stent-graft was performed followed by Dacron tubular graft 10 mm interposition. On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was discharged from the clinic, and after 3 months, the right leg vascularisation was well preserved. Conclusion. Large dimensional stent-graft placement in patients with mutiple <b>AV</b> <b>fistulas</b> and blood vessel dilation proximal to AV site of communication carries an increased risk of thrombotic events due to turbulent blood flow and parietal thrombosis occurrence. Though stent-graft placement can be a very useful solution in acute <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> treatment, the very same thrombosis should be thought of when surgical management is the only treatment choice...|$|R
40|$|Arteriovenous (<b>AV)</b> <b>fistula</b> is {{the most}} {{preferred}} form of vascular access for end-stage renal disease patients. Acute changes in hemodynamics and in particular wall shear stress (WSS) immediately after fistula placement are followed by the dilation of the vasculature luminal area to recover the normal physiological condition before surgery. However, vasodilation in <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> is not well understood and thus, the major goal {{of this study is}} to assess the longitudinal effect of wall shear stress on <b>fistula</b> maturation. Six <b>AV</b> <b>fistulae</b> with curved (n = 3) and straight (n = 3) configurations are created between the femoral artery and vein of three Yorkshire pigs. Anatomical configuration and flow measurements are performed at 2 D (D: days), 7 D, and 28 D post-surgery. It is shown that fistulae with relatively higher baseline axial WSS may result in better maturation as compared to the ones with lower levels of baseline axial WSS. This finding is novel and hasn’t been reported in previous studies. Moreover, it is found that the longitudinal variation of WSS is also of high importance in prediction of the maturation of <b>AV</b> <b>fistula.</b> Fistulae whose mean axial WSS decreases over time achieve larger mean area, and therefore, favorable remodeling, while an increasing trend of axial WSS is detrimental to fistulae maturation. Also, it is found that curved fistula as compared to the straight configuration results in larger luminal area over time and thus, is the preferred form of <b>AV</b> <b>fistula...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Fistula First Initiative {{set a goal}} of 66 % {{arteriovenous}} (AV) fistula-based access among US hemodialysis patients. This study modeled {{the impact}} of achieving the target <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> placement rate on Medicare expenditures and on dialysis patient survival and also reviewed economic disincentives for providers that will inhibit achieving this target. The model projects lifetime costs and survival in the US 2003 incident hemodialysis population. Annual treatment costs were estimated from previous analyses of Medicare expenditures by access modality. Patient survival by mode of access was derived from the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study (DMMS). These parameters were applied to a cohort of patients who meet the 66 % <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> target and an identical cohort with the current vascular access case mix. Comparison of outcomes yields estimates of differential total expenditures and total patient life-years. If prevalence AV fistula-based access in the 2003 incident hemodialysis cohort were 66 % rather than the observed 35 %, then the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services would save $ 840 million in access-attributed expenditures over the expected lifetime of these patients. However, population survival would increase by 35, 000 additional life-years, increasing total lifetime expenditures by a net of $ 1. 4 billion. Relative to the current mix of access modality, the shift to 66 % <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> would be achieved at a net incremental cost of $ 40, 000 per year of life gained. Economic barriers to reaching this goal include financial disincentives to providing adequate predialysis care, performing <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> surgical procedures, and monitoring vascular access flow.

CKD was established in rats by a 5 / 6 th nephrectomy and after 6 weeks, an <b>AV</b> <b>fistula</b> was created between the carotid artery and jugular vein, which was followed up at 3 weeks with ultrasound and flow assessments. Vessel wall histology was assessed afterwards and vasoreactivity of carotid arteries was studied in a wire myograph. The soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activator BAY 60 - 2770 was administered daily to CKD animals for 3 weeks to enhance fistula maturation. CKD animals showed lower flow rates, smaller fistula diameters and increased oxidative stress levels in the vessel wall. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was comparable but vasorelaxation after sodium nitroprusside was diminished in CKD vessels, indicating NO resistance of the NO-receptor sGC. This was confirmed by stimulation with BAY 60 - 2770 resulting in increased vasorelaxation in CKD vessels. Oral administration of BAY 60 - 2770 to CKD animals induced larger fistula diameters, however; flow was not significantly different from vehicle-treated CKD animals.
