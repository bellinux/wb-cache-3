5|$|After Carter and Lawler {{left the}} World Wrestling Federation, they worked various {{independent}} wrestling events. They also signed with Tri-Star Productions {{and worked at}} Memphis Championship Wrestling. Carter made her debut for Tri-State Wrestling Alliance (TWA) on June 5, 2001 at the TWA Homecoming event in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, where she teamed up with Demolition (Ax and Smash) in a winning effort defeating Sheeta and The Nigerian Nightmares (Maifu and Saifu) in a 6-person mixed-tag team match. Carter made her debut for Stranglehold Wrestling (SHW) on August 26, 2010 at the Stranglehold Devils Playground Tour in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, where she competed in an Arm-Wrestling match against <b>Pissed</b> <b>off</b> Pete in a no-contest. Later that event, Carter accompied Sinn Bohdi to the ring where he competed against George Terzis.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|ARMITAGE: Yeah. And I know Joe Wilson's {{been calling}} everybody. He's <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> {{because he was}} {{designated}} as a low-level guy, went out to look at it. So, he's all <b>pissed</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} I was very volatile, and thought {{everyone}} {{should take a}} stand.

25|$|I'm really <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> {{with the}} BBC for {{bringing}} down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out {{much of the}} vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy is that I {{was told that the}} cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened as far as the viewer is concerned is that it has made Rome hard to follow.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{influence}} {{may have}} been limited, but Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh said that Beetle Beat was his first album purchase, thinking it was a Beatles album. Mothersbaugh said, [...] "One track <b>pissed</b> me <b>off</b> so much it eventually inspired the nasty Devo song, [...] "U Got Me Bugged." [...] In 2009, reissue label Master Classics brought Beetle Beat to iTunes Store and other online music services including Spotify.|$|R
2500|$|Bloom never <b>pissed</b> me <b>off</b> {{because there}} are critics out there, and he's one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of {{intellectual}} prowess. He {{might be able to}} say that Mark Twain is a great writer, but it's impossible for him to say that there's a direct line of descent from, say, Nathaniel Hawthorne to Jim Thompson because he doesn't read guys like Thompson. He just thinks, [...] "I never read him, but I know he's terrible." ...|$|R
5000|$|..... {{then you}} have Jonny Fairplay, who's {{completely}} despicable. It was actually fun to work with Fairplay on the show because he's a producer's dream. When he shows up drunk or flips somebody off, he's bringing you gold every time. I wish we had a Jonny Fairplay every season. Personally, however, he's an absolute jackass whose actions at the Vanuatu finale after-party <b>pissed</b> me <b>off</b> so much that he's banned from any event that I'm at from now on. I'm done with Jonny Fairplay." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} their limited {{lifespan}} and discography, The Faith were a seminal influence on the early hardcore punk movement in Washington, D.C. Their songs not only stand up {{with the best of}} D.C. hardcore, but with hardcore as a whole. After breaking up in 1983, the members from The Faith continued to shape the sound of D.C. punk in their later projects. Nearly all of their membership moved on to either Embrace or Rites of Spring. An often under-appreciated D.C. band, They went in two years from being one of the most <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> and aggro early hardcore bands to introducing a melodic element that would have a huge influence on the future of D.C. punk.|$|E
500|$|Evil Dead-actor Bruce Campbell was Kripke's {{first choice}} {{to portray the}} character. However, Campbell was unavailable, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan {{eventually}} received the role. Due {{to the fact that}} Morgan's scene in the pilot episode takes place 22 years before the series, Morgan expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes. Being only 12 years older than Jensen Ackles, who portrays the eldest son Dean, Morgan was surprised when he was asked to reprise the role. Ackles and Jared Padalecki often teased him about the age difference during filming. Throughout the season, Morgan became frustrated at times due to his character's avoidance of his sons, stating, [...] "It <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> everybody, it <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> us as actors, it <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> the audience watching, because none of us really knew where we were gonna go." [...] However, he reasoned that John's motivation for his actions was due to having knowledge that nobody else had.|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 2003, {{ten weeks}} before release, an unmastered version of Hail to the Thief {{containing}} unfinished tracks was leaked online.

Work we've not finished, being released in this sloppy way, ten {{weeks before the}} real version is even available... It's not [...] I'm <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> about, it's just the situation I guess. It's stolen work, fer fuck's sake." [...] Colin Greenwood said the leak was [...] "like being photographed with one sock on {{when you get out}} of bed in the morning," [...] but expressed dismay at the cease-and-desist orders sent by label EMI to radio stations and fan sites playing the leaked tracks, saying: [...] "Don't record companies usually pay thousands of dollars to get stations to play their records? Now they're paying money to stations not to play them." ...|$|E

He sought out a series of cases defending the homeless, successfully challenging an open-container law that was frequently used to round up Ventura’s large indigent population and getting a raft of misdemeanor illegal camping charges — also used as a weapon against the homeless — thrown out so decisively it led to an internal city review. “It <b>pissed</b> me <b>off,</b> it was a horrific injustice, and {{it was the right thing}} to do,” Leiderman said." ...|$|R

What was really funny, when we {{approached}} the CS desk, he suddenly {{let go of my}} collar and turned to talk to the CS girl. He changed into a polite person…What <b>pissed</b> me <b>off</b> most was that he kept talking to the CS girl like, ‘you understand what I mean, right?’ I mean as a service worker you should be aware that you ought to satisfy the customers’ requests’… and a lot of bullshit like that… Then I lost my control and threatened him.|$|R
500|$|Originally {{the band}} wanted the {{pictures}} to include burning stakes, however, given the possible KKK connotations, they settled for moody lighting instead.

[...] "We should be mixing at the end of January and soon after that giving birth to a really <b>pissed</b> <b>off,</b> loud, fast and heavy child."

500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E
500|$|Vedder {{found the}} medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, [...] "Ed brought in that book, {{and we said}} man {{that would make a}} great album cover."

Ament said, [...] "We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> record stores: they had to put it in sideways." [...] The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.|$|E

Production values are good, even if it’s clear the budget is a bit too slim to pull off {{reasonable}} looking military headquarters at the beginning, and the meteor crash leaves a bit to be desired. There are a few definite weak spots in the cast, but the acting is surprisingly good. The deputy especially is played by a compelling actor who raises the films credibility level...While it kinda <b>pissed</b> me <b>off,</b> it also managed to hold my interest, with the action sequences providing good, solid entertainment." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Sutherland, {{who was a}} {{judge for}} the 1999 prize, has said, [...] There is a {{well-established}} London literary community. Rushdie doesn't get shortlisted now because he has attacked that community. That {{is not a good}} game plan if you want to win the Booker. Norman Mailer has found the same thing in the US - you have to 'be a citizen' if you want to win prizes. The real scandal is that Martin Amis has never won the prize. In fact, he has only been shortlisted once and that was for Time's Arrow, which was not one of his strongest books. That really is suspicious. He <b>pissed</b> people <b>off</b> with Dead Babies and that gets lodged in the culture. There is also the feeling that he has always looked towards America.|$|R
500|$|When {{asked about}} his lyrics {{commanding}} a woman to [...] "do it doggy style" [...] in his song [...] "Do It Do It", Weaver stated that the lyrics are a reflection of his background and audience, and not necessarily {{how he feels about}} others. Weaver reflected on the song [...] "Saturday Night" [...] as being about [...] "my 17 year old Saturday night" [...] which consisted of going down to the Parkside Inn, drinking, and [...] "watching the bitches on the corner" [...] and that the song was not meant to be taken literally, but that he [...] "did come home once with a girl and I forgot my key and my mom was <b>pissed</b> <b>off,</b> but she didn't pull a gun; she's never owned a gun in her life".|$|E
500|$|... "Whale Whores" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews.

Brian Jacks of MTV complimented the show's focus on whale conservation, writing, [...] "Leave it to the hard-hitting folks at South Park to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together." [...] Josh Modell of The A.V. Club said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was [...] "culturally insignificant" [...] and not particularly well-known. Modell wrote, [...] "The show's star, Paul Watson, seems to have really <b>pissed</b> <b>off</b> South Park's creators Parker and Stone [...] Fine, but could you make me laugh a few times while you beat me {{over the head with}} information about a guy that I couldn't care less about?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Cobain told Spin that on Bleach he [...] "didn't give {{a flying}} fuck what the lyrics were about" [...] {{and claimed that}} 80 percent of the lyrics were written the night before {{recording}}. He was often still working on {{the words on the}} drive to the recording studio. He explained: [...] "It was like I'm <b>pissed</b> <b>off.</b> Don't know what about. Let's just scream negative lyrics, and as long as they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay. I don't hold any of those lyrics dear to me." [...] Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad noted that, nevertheless, many of the songs on the album reflected Cobain and various incidents in his life. [...] "Mr. Moustache" [...] was inspired by Cobain's dislike of macho behavior, while [...] "School" [...] was a critique of the Seattle music scene, particularly Sub Pop.|$|E
5000|$|While in Colorado, Shoup had {{a three-hour}} weekly show on KRCC, the Colorado College radio station, where by Jason Heller's account (2003) he played jazz and {{experimental}} music {{from his own}} extensive collection, and [...] "began using the studio itself as an instrument, manipulating multiple turntables and mixing in guest musicians who would improvise over the records…" [...] Describing a band he organized during this period, the Creative Music Ensemble (active circa 1973-74), Shoup later said, [...] "I was still developing some chops on the sax, so I wasn't a player yet; I was just the instigator. I had them play a number of gigs, and it just outraged and <b>pissed</b> people <b>off.</b> … People didn't {{know what to make}} of it. It was kind of like Mahavishnu meets Merzbow or something." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hillbilly Jim {{said that}} there were a lot of big, tough guys in the locker room but Haku stood out as the toughest among them. He also {{mentioned}} that despite being a tough guy, Haku was a friendly and good hearted family man.. Wrestler Shane Douglas said in a shoot interview that one would be better off fighting the US Army than fighting Haku. He spoke about an incident when he witnessed several cops trying to hold Haku down and one of them struck Haku with a baton on his face while the others emptied their cans of mace on him but nothing seemed to faze Haku. He also mentioned that Haku was the nicest and friendliest guy but if you <b>pissed</b> him <b>off</b> he could break you in half or do whatever he wanted to do.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sound of}} The Boatman's Call, {{released}} in 1997, was {{a radical departure}} from the archetypal and violent narratives of the band's past, featuring songs about relationships, loss, and longing, often with sparse arrangements. Cave revealed his mindset during the creation of the album in a 2008 interview: [...] "When I was making half that record I was furious because certain things had happened in my love life that seriously <b>pissed</b> me <b>off.</b> And some of those songs came straight out of that. I don't regret making it ... the songs are of a moment when you felt a certain way. When ... you just think, 'Fuck - please!'" [...] The album's corresponding tour was later documented on the 2008 live album Live at the Royal Albert Hall. After the release of the album, Cave embarked on a brief hiatus, during which time he remarried.|$|R
