50|$|Schottel {{developed}} the Pump Jet for shallow waters. It {{is also used}} as an additional maneuvering aid for main propulsion or as a redundant auxiliary propulsion unit. An impeller sucks in water from under the hull and forces it into a <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> The outlet nozzles are integrated into an azimuthing base plate which is installed flush with the hull.|$|E
50|$|Discharge {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes {{the majority of the}} fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a venturi), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.|$|E

50|$|The vane cell {{feed system}} mainly {{consists}} of a rigid <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> with attached side plate that is fixed to the pivoting hopper, and a removable rotor with pump vanes and cam. Depending on the machine size there are various different sizes of vane cell feed systems with parts with appropriate dimensions. The hopper can be swivelled to clean and dismantle surfaces and parts that {{come into contact with}} filling product. The driven rotor with an appropriate number of slots is located in the <b>pump</b> <b>housing,</b> in which pump vanes form cells with defined volumes when the machine is closed, supported by the cam. Induced by the rotor movement when the machine is started, the cells move {{in the direction of the}} vane cell feed system outlet and therefore ensure that a defined product flow is achieved. The weight accuracy of a feed system is partially dependent upon the production precision of the parts and their degree of wear.|$|E
50|$|Float {{switches}} {{are used}} to automatically turn the sump pump on when water rises to a preset level. Float switches must be clear of any obstructions within the sump. A float guard {{can be used to}} prevent the float switch from accidentally resting on the <b>pump</b> <b>housing,</b> and remaining on. As mechanical float switches can wear out, they should be periodically tested by actuating them manually to assure that they continue to move freely and that the switch contacts are opening and closing properly.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary {{vane pumps}} (fixed and simple {{adjustable}} displacement) have higher efficiencies than gear pumps, {{but are also}} used for mid pressures up to [...] in general. Modern units can exceed [...] in continuous operation, although vane pumps are not regarded as [...] "high pressure" [...] components. Some types of vane pumps can change {{the centre of the}} vane body, so that a simple adjustable pump is obtained. These adjustable vane pumps are in general constant pressure or constant power pumps: the displacement is increased until the required pressure or power is reached and subsequently the displacement or swept volume is decreased until an equilibrium is reached. A critical element in vane pump design is how the vanes are pushed into contact with the <b>pump</b> <b>housing,</b> and how the vane tips are machined at this very point. Several type of [...] "lip" [...] designs are used, and the main objective is to provide a tight seal between the inside of the housing and the vane, {{and at the same time}} to minimize wear and metal-to-metal contact. Forcing the vane out of the rotating centre and towards the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> is accomplished using spring-loaded vanes, or more traditionally, vanes loaded hydrodynamically (via the pressurized system fluid).|$|E

50|$|A {{flexible}} {{impeller pump}} is a positive-displacement pump that, by deforming impeller vanes, draws the liquid into the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> and moves {{it to the}} discharge port with a constant flow rate. The flexibility of the vanes enables a tight seal to the internal housing, making the pump self-priming, while also permitting bi-directional operation. The output from these pumps tends to be smooth or gentle {{when compared to the}} operation of a reciprocating pump (for example). In 1938, Arthur M. Briggs filed a patent for this type of pump.|$|E

In 1984, the 700R4 designed for use behind Chevrolet small block V8s received a 30-spline input shaft {{similar to those found}} on TH400 transmissions and which also used a different torque converter than its 2.8 V6 and 2.2 L4 engines. Between 1984-1987, internal components, from the ring gear to the oil <b>pump</b> <b>housing,</b> were updated, ending with the auxiliary valve body for 700s manufactured after October 1986.|$|E

50|$|Continuous-flow VADs {{are smaller}} and {{have proven to}} be more durable than pulsatile VADs. They {{normally}} use either a centrifugal pump or an axial flow pump. Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin. In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated {{in the direction of the}} rotor's axis.|$|E
5000|$|In mid-1984, the 3.8 liter LD5 {{engine was}} {{modified}} for transverse-mounting in smaller, FWD vehicles, and equipped with multi point fuel injection (MPFI). 1984-1985 models used a distributor and a distributorless wasted spark ignition system was added for all engines produced in 1986 and later. In 1986, it received sequential fuel injection (SFI) {{and it was}} initially produced in two forms, the LG2 with flat lifters (tappets), and the LG3 with a roller camshaft and lifters. The latter was offered in various models through 1988.

50|$|The block uses a {{bedplate}} {{featuring a}} perimeter wall with transverse webbings for durability and quiet operation at high engine speeds. The pistons {{are attached to}} fracture-split forged powdered metal connecting rods using semi-floating press-fit pins. A gerotor oil pump is driven directly from the crankshaft {{on the front of}} the engine. A timing belt is used to drive the valvetrain. Early production 2.0 L engines used a hydraulic tensioner to tension the timing belt. 2000 and 2001 engines used a mechanical spring-loaded tensioner that tended to wear out prematurely, causing serious valve and piston damage upon belt failure due to the interference design of the engine. 2002+ engines utilized a different mechanical tensioner. The water pump is driven from the timing belt, with the water <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> cast partially into the engine block itself.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Pump</b> <b>House</b> Center for the Arts {{is housed}} in the former <b>Pump</b> <b>House</b> of the Chillicothe Water and Sewer Co. The <b>Pump</b> <b>House</b> was {{constructed}} in 1883 as a municipal pumping station for distribution {{of water from the}} deep well field located in Yoctangee Park to a reservoir situated on Carlisle Hill. In March 1977, the <b>Pump</b> <b>House</b> was placed on the Ohio History Inventory. On November 15, 1979, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places kept by the U.S. Department of Interior. The <b>Pump</b> <b>House</b> was used by the Jaycees group for its annual Haunted House fund-raiser until it was condemned in 1984 as unsafe. A group of artists, preservationists, and an attorney formed a coalition to restore and preserve the building. In 1986, City Council designated the <b>Pump</b> <b>House</b> as part of the city’s Preservation District. Coursework was replaced, bricks were repaired, floors were poured, electricity and water was installed, and the walls were rebuilt. The rooms were transformed into a beautiful art gallery where works could be displayed.

50|$|In {{the food}} sector, moving or {{transporting}} fluids is achieved {{with the aid}} of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning. Various different types of pumps are used, {{depending on the type of}} filling products to be moved. Vacuum fillers with vane cell feed systems and vacuum feeding are commonly used for viscous products. The products are transported {{with the aid of}} a hopper with a feeding device, a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> This is basically a volumetric feed principle, which means that a certain weight is defined via a volume. In addition to the vane cell feed systems, also known as rotary vane pumps, there are also screw feed systems with feed augers, toothed wheel feed systems and evacuated lifting cylinders. With all these systems, transportation is achieved via volume expulsion under a vacuum.Vacuum fillers are traditionally used in the meat processing industry as well as in other food sectors. They can also be found in some non-food sectors. Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be used for filling pasty and compressible products.|$|E

5000|$|Gear pumps (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of gear pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the gear pump uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> Some gear pumps can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern gear pumps are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E
40|$|A {{hydraulically}} operated pump is described for in-ground filtering and monitoring of wells or other fluid sources, including a hollow cylindrical <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> with an inlet and an outlet, filtering devices positioned in the inlet and the outlet, a piston that fits slidably within the <b>pump</b> <b>housing,</b> and an optical cell {{in fluid communication}} with the <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> A conduit within the piston allows fluid communication between the exterior and {{one end of the}} piston. A pair of O-rings form a seal between the inside of the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> and the exterior of the piston. A flow valve positioned within the piston inside the conduit allows fluid to flow in a single direction. In operation, fluid enters the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> through the inlet, flows through the conduit and towards an end of the <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> The piston then makes a downward stroke closing the valve, thus forcing the fluid out from the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> into the optical cell, which then takes spectrophotometric measurements of the fluid. A spring helps return the piston back to its starting position, so that a new supply of fluid may enter the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> and the downward stroke can begin again. The pump may be used independently of the optical cell, as a sample pump to transport a sample fluid from a source to a container for later analysis...|$|E
