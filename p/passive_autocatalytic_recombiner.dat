40|$|In the THINCAT project, an {{alternative}} concept for hydrogen mitigation {{in a light}} water reactor (LWR) containment is being developed. Based on catalytic coated thermal insulation elements of the main coolant loop components, it could be considered either as {{an alternative}} to backfitting <b>passive</b> <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>recombiner</b> devices, or as a reinforcement of their preventive effect. The present paper summarises the results achieved at about project mid-term. Potential advantages of catalytic thermal insulation studied in the project are:reduced risk of unintended ignition,no work space obstruction in the containment,no need for seismic qualification of additional equipment,improved start-up behaviour of recombination reaction. Efforts to develop a suitable catalytic layer resulted in the identification of a coating procedure that ensures high chemical reactivity and mechanical stability. Test samples for use in forthcoming experiments with this coating were produced. Models to predict the catalytic rates were developed, validated and applied in a safety analysis study. Results show that an overall hydrogen concentration reduction can be achieved which is comparable to the reduction obtained using conventional recombiners. Existing experimental information supports the argument of a reduced ignition risk. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{numerical}} modeling of passive autocatalytic hydrogen recombiners (PARs).

The main purpose of this work {{is to develop a}} numerical model of <b>passive</b> <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>recombiner</b> (PAR) using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS-FLUENT and tuning the model using experimental results. The REKO 3 experiment was used for this purpose. Experiment was made in the Institute for Safety Research and Reactor Technology in Julich (Germany). It has been performed for different hydrogen concentrations, different flow rates, the presence of steam, and different initial temperatures of the inlet mixture. The model of this experimental recombiner was elaborated within the framework of this work. The influence of mesh, gas thermal conductivity coefficient, mass diffusivity coefficients, and turbulence model was investigated. The best results with a good agreement with REKO 3 data were received for k-ɛ model of turbulence, gas thermal conductivity dependent on the temperature and mass diffusivity coefficients taken from CHEMKIN program.

This paper investigates {{the capabilities of}} CFD models for predicting hydrogen stratification in a containment vessel {{using data from the}} NEA/OECD SETH 2 MISTRA experiments. Further simulations are then carried out to illustrate the qualitative effects of hydrogen stratification on the performance of <b>Passive</b> <b>Autocatalytic</b> <b>Recombiner</b> (PAR) units. The MISTRA experiments have well-defined initial and boundary conditions which makes them well suited for use in a validation study. Results are presented for the sensitivity to mesh resolution and mesh type. Whilst the predictions are shown to be largely insensitive to the mesh resolution they are surprisingly sensitive to the mesh type. In particular, tetrahedral meshes are found to induce small unphysical convection currents that result in molecular diffusion and turbulent mixing being under-predicted. This behaviour is not unique to the CFD model used here (ANSYS CFX) and furthermore, it may affect simulations run on other non-aligned meshes (meshes that are not aligned perpendicular to gravity), including non-aligned structured meshes. Following existing best practice guidelines can help to identify potential unphysical predictions, but as an additional precaution consideration should be given to using gravity-aligned meshes for modelling stratified flows. CFD simulations of hydrogen recombination in the Becker Technologies THAI facility are presented with high and low PAR positions and homogeneous and stratified initial hydrogen distributions. For the stratified initial hydrogen distribution, as expected, the high PAR location performs better than the low positioned PAR. However, for the homogeneous initial hydrogen distribution, the low PAR location performs better than the high PAR. The work demonstrates that CFD can be a useful tool to help inform the positioning of PAR units, which may provide a practicable risk-reduction measure for situations where hydrogen releases are possible...|$|E

40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> (PARs) are a {{means of}} {{preventing}} hydrogen accumulation in the containment building of a water-cooled nuclear reactor during an accident. A potential problem exists concerning suspended radioactive aerosols: particles passing through the catalytic elements are heated up with significant evaporation of more volatile chemical species. The aerosols, vapours and carrier-gas mixture may chemically react resulting potentially in conversion of easily-retained aerosol material into more troublesome vapours and gases. An experimental programme, RECI, demonstrated that potential exists for PARs to generate volatile forms of iodine, namely molecular iodine, by thermo-catalytic decomposition of metal-iodide aerosols. Here, analysis of RECI results aided by two computer codes, one a field code the other a lumped-parameter approach, provides significant insight into the iodide-iodine phenomenology where, in particular, the rapid cooling of the reacting mixture explains the persistence of volatile species downstream at ambient conditions. While understanding of the phenomenology has progressed, the current results cannot be extrapolated to the reactor case since further experiments are needed reproducing more closely expected accident conditions.

The study presented in this work analyses the size, location and number of the PARs to minimise the risk arising from a hydrogen release and its distribution in the containment building during a hypothetical severe accident. A detailed 3 D model of a PWR-KWU containment type was used for the simulations.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the course}} of a severe {{accident}} in a light water nuclear reactor, large amounts of hydrogen can be generated and released into the containment during reactor core degradation. Additional burnable gases [hydrogen (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) ] may be released into the containment in the corium/concrete interaction. This could subsequently raise a combustion hazard. As the Fukushima accidents revealed, hydrogen combustion can cause high pressure spikes that could challenge the reactor buildings and lead to failure of the surrounding buildings. To prevent the gas explosion hazard, most mitigation strategies adopted by European countries are based on the implementation of <b>passive</b> <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> (PARs). Studies of representative accident sequences indicate that, despite the installation of PARs, it is difficult to prevent at all times and locations, the formation of a combustible mixture that potentially leads to local flame acceleration. Complementary research and development (R&D) projects were recently launched to understand better the phenomena associated with the combustion hazard and to address the issues highlighted after the Fukushima Daiichi events such as explosion hazard in the venting system and the potential flammable mixture migration into spaces beyond the primary containment. The expected results will be used to improve the modeling tools and methodology for hydrogen risk assessment and severe accident management guidelines. The present paper aims to present the methodology adopted by Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire to assess hydrogen risk in nuclear power plants, in particular French nuclear power plants, the open issues, and the ongoing R&D programs related to hydrogen distribution, mitigation, and combustion...|$|R
40|$|A severe {{accident}} {{in a nuclear}} power plant (NPP) can lead to core damage in conjunction with the release of large amounts of hydrogen. As hydrogen mitigation measure, <b>passive</b> <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> (PARs) are used in today’s pressurized water reactors. PARs recombine hydrogen and oxygen contained in the air to steam. The heat from this exothermic reaction causes the catalyst and its surroundings to heat up. If parts of the PAR heat up above the ignition temperature of the gas mixture, a spontaneous deflagration or detonation can occur. The aim of this work is the prevention of such high temperatures by means of passive cooling of the catalyst with heat pipes. Heat pipes are completely passive heat exchanger with a very high effective thermal conductivity. For {{a deeper understanding of the}} reaction kinetics at lower temperatures, single catalytic coated heat pipes are studied in a flow reactor. The development of a modular small-scale PAR model is then based on a test series with cooled catalyst sheets. Finally, the PAR model is tested inside a pressure vessel under boundary conditions similar to a real NPP. The experiments show, that the temperatures of the cooled catalytic sheets stay significantly below the temperature of the uncooled sheets and below the ignition temperature of the gas mixture under any set boundary conditions, although no significant reduction of the conversion efficiency can be observed. As a last point, a mathematical model of the reaction kinetics of the recombinaton process as well as a model of the fluid dynamic and thermohydraulic processes in a heat pipe are developed with the data obtained from the experiments...|$|R

Today the main concerns lies with hydrogen production in a nuclear reactor core when the zirconium fuel cladding reacts with the water coolant during an accident, creating combustible hydrogen gas. This concern is being addressed with new technologies for new nuclear power plants {{and the development of}} hydrogen mitigation techniques for currently operating plants. This study looks at a few potential safety upgrades including hydrogen mitigation upgrades such as hydrogen ignitors and <b>Passive</b> <b>Autocatalytic</b> <b>Recombiners</b> (PARs).

40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> (PARs) {{have been}} {{installed}} inside light water reactor containments {{in many countries}} to remove hydrogen and, thus, to mitigate the combustion risk during a severe accident (SA). Due to the challenging SA boundary conditions, PARs are exposed to several deactivation risks during operation, which may cause a reduction of the hydrogen removal capacity. Such a deactivation may occur through different mechanisms and could in principle affect the start-up behavior up to the full loss of catalytic activity. To assess the interaction of PARs with the products of cable fires, a set of PAR catalyst samples has been introduced to the atmosphere of cable fire tests performed at Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN), France. The subsequent surface analyses performed at Forschungszentrum Jülich (Germany) reveal {{a significant amount of}} carbon, chlorine (a constituent of polyvinyl chloride), zinc, and antimony (a flame retardant) on all catalyst samples compared to reference samples. The subsequent performance tests confirm that all catalyst sheets suffer a significant start-up delay of between 17 and 45 min compared to the reference samples. However, after burning off the soot deposition, the catalyst samples reach full conversion capacity and show immediate start-up behavior in a subsequent test. The present results clearly demonstrate the adverse effect of cable fire products on the efficiency of hydrogen conversion in a PAR. To further understand and quantify the impact of cable fire products and to assess their relevance for SA scenarios, further experimental as well as theoretical investigations are required. In particular, the combined influence of cable fire products and humidity, which has intentionally been omitted in the present study, should be investigated in the future due to the possible corrosive impact on the catalyst as well as the influence of humidity {{on the nature of the}} soot deposition...|$|R

Numerical simulation is an important tool for assessing PAR operation during a severe accident in terms of efficiency and proper installation. Advanced numerical PAR models are required for the challenging boundary conditions during a severe accident, for example, low oxygen amount, high steam amount, and presence of carbon monoxide. The REKO-DIREKT code has been developed in order to provide a PAR model capable of simulating complex PAR phenomena {{and at the same time}} being suitable for implementation in thermal-hydraulic codes. The development of REKO-DIREKT was supported by small-scale experiments performed at Forschungszentrum Juelich in the REKO facilities.

This facility is equipped with numerous measuring devices, e. g. katharometers for in-situ measuring of the hydrogen concentration and the optical flow measurement technique Particle-Image-Velocimetry. In preliminary assessments the equipment is being qualified in order to determine the measurement accuracy. In the following experimental investigations, a small-scale PAR is used, that is built in a modular way allowing it to be equipped with different chimney geometries. The experimental results produce a database that shows the central correlation between the hydrogen concentration, the catalyst temperature and the inlet velocity. The results include the variation of the recombiner’s chimney height and experiments at different operating pressures. After optimization of the chimney model, the simulation program is validated against experiments in the large-scale facility THAI in Eschborn, which have been performed subsequent to this thesis in the context of the OECD/NEA-THAI project. Finally, the influence of a downward-directed, near-wall flow on the operational behaviour of the small-scale PAR is investigated. The goal is to analyse, whether or not externally induced flow regimes are able to influence the start-up and operational behaviour of PARs. The results show that downward directed flow conditions may influence the operational behaviour and reduce the efficiency of a recombiner, if the flow through the chimney is not prevented by the outlet design...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{accident}} at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi {{nuclear power plant}} in March 2011, caused by an earthquake and a subsequent tsunami, resulted in {{a failure of the}} power systems that are needed to cool the reactors at the plant. The accident progression in the absence of heat removal systems caused Units 1 - 3 to undergo fuel melting. Containment pressurization and hydrogen explosions ultimately resulted in the escape of radioactivity from reactor containments into the atmosphere and ocean. Problems in containment venting operation, leakage from primary containment boundary to the reactor building, improper functioning of standby gas treatment system (SGTS), unmitigated hydrogen accumulation in the reactor building were identified as some of the reasons those added-up in the severity of the accident. The Fukushima accident not only initiated worldwide demand for installation of adequate control and mitigation measures to minimize the potential source term to the environment but also advocated assessment of the existing mitigation systems performance behavior under a wide range of postulated accident scenarios. The uncertainty in estimating the released fraction of the radionuclides due to the Fukushima accident also underlined the need for comprehensive understanding of fission product behavior {{as a function of the}} thermal hydraulic conditions and the type of gaseous, aqueous, and solid materials available for interaction, e. g., gas components, decontamination paint, aerosols, and water pools. In the light of the Fukushima accident, additional experimental needs identified for hydrogen and fission product issues need to be investigated in an integrated and optimized way. Additionally, as more and more passive safety systems, such as <b>passive</b> <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> and filtered containment venting systems are being retrofitted in current reactors and also planned for future reactors, identified hydrogen and fission product issues will need to be coupled with the operation of passive safety systems in phenomena oriented and coupled effects experiments. In the present paper, potential hydrogen and fission product issues raised by the Fukushima accident are discussed. The discussion focuses on hydrogen and fission product behavior inside nuclear power plant containments under severe accident conditions. The relevant experimental investigations conducted in the technical scale containment THAI (thermal hydraulics, hydrogen, aerosols, and iodine) test facility (9. 2  m high, 3. 2  m in diameter, and 60  m 3 volume) are discussed in the light of the Fukushima accident...|$|R
40|$|In {{the case}} of a severe {{accident}} in light-water reactors, a large amount of hydrogen could be generated from the reaction between steam and zirconium at high fuel clad temperature and also from reactions of molten core debris with concrete. The hydrogen generated will be released into the containment atmosphere, and mixed with air and steam possibly creating local flammable conditions. In order to prevent loads resulting from a possible hydrogen combustion, French and German reactor containments are equipped with <b>passive</b> <b>autocatalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> (PARs), which recombine hydrogen with oxygen even at concentrations below the lower flammability limit. In common PAR designs, catalytic materials (platinum and palladium on ceramic washcoat) are housed in a metallic structure whose purpose is to optimise the circulation of gases in contact with the catalyst. Numerous tests have been conducted in the past to investigate PAR behaviour in situations representative of severe accidents (Battelle Model Containment in Germany, H 2 PAR and KALI-H 2 in France, AECL Whiteshell Laboratories in Canada, etc.). Furthermore, these tests demonstrated that, provided special care is paid to the design and construction of the catalysts, catalyst poisoning by materials such as carbon monoxide, iodine and aerosols present in the containment atmosphere will not fundamentally reduce the effectiveness of the PARs. Some of the above-mentioned tests also show that PARs could ignite the flammable gas mixture at elevated hydrogen concentrations. These experimental results need however to be corroborated by more detailed experiments and by refined modelling of phenomena occurring in PARs. In order to better characterise the PAR-induced ignition risk, a series of dedicated experiments has started at the REKO- 3 facility located in Forschungszentrum Julich. In parallel, a refined modelling of the recombiners has been developed by IRSN and will be used to gain insights into the phenomena occurring at the PAR catalyst plates. Furthermore, previous tests indicated that the position of the recombiners could have an impact on their overall efficiency. The installation of PARs in the reactor building is influenced by geometric and operational constraints. To this end, numerical models were developed from the experimental data for codes like COCOSYS or ASTEC in order to optimise the PAR location and to assess the efficiency of PAR implementation in different scenarios. However, these models are usually simple (black-box type) and based on the manufacturer's correlation to calculate the hydrogen depletion rate. Recently, enhanced CFD models have been developed at IRSN and Julich in order to take into account phenomena such as the PAR location effect, gas mixture ignition induced by PARs, and the oxygen starvation effect. A new specifically instrumented facility is also under construction at Julich to investigate these phenomena in more detail. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|FPT 3 was {{the last}} of the five in-pile {{integral}} experiments in the Phébus FP programme, whose overall purpose was to investigate fuel rod degradation and behaviour of Fission Products (FPs) released via the primary coolant circuit into the containment building. The results contribute to validation of models and computer codes used to calculate the source term for a severe accident with core meltdown in light water reactors. Unlike the previous tests, FPT 3 used B 4 C as absorber material in the pre-irradiated (24. 5 GWd/tU) fuel bundle, while featuring a steam-poor period as in FPT 2, that used Ag/In/Cd absorber. The main FPT 3 containment results are summarised: the source term of FPs, fuel and structural materials from the experimental circuit into the containment; the composition, morphology and deposition processes of aerosols in the containment atmosphere; the specific behaviour of the radiologically-significant FP iodine; and finally the performance of <b>Passive</b> <b>Autocatalytic</b> <b>Recombiners</b> (PARs) exposed to the containment atmosphere just after the transient. The major elements contributing to the aerosol mass in the containment are the volatile FPs Cs and Mo, the control rod material B, the cladding material Sn, and the instrumentation materials Re and W (specific to Phébus tests). The fractional compositions, leaving aside the control rod materials, were very similar in FPT 2 and FPT 3. After reactor shutdown, homogenisation of the aerosol size in the containment led to only one aerosol population, similar to the previous tests. Long-term aerosol deposition in the containment is dominated by gravitational settling and diffusiophoresis, but also significant deposits were measured on the vertical wall, consisting of multi-component aerosols, again comparable with FPT 2. A significant result of FPT 3 is that iodine is mainly in gaseous form in the atmosphere up to containment isolation; the rest in aerosol form. Another important result is the fast decrease of the iodine concentration in the atmosphere, for total iodine (gas and aerosol), mainly due to deposition on the painted condensers; the depletion of the airborne aerosols Cs and Te was about a factor of 3 slower. As in FPT 2, gaseous iodine is mainly in molecular form. Iodine collected in the sump is essentially in soluble form throughout, probably due to the replacement of Ag/In/Cd by B 4 C as the absorber material. Concerning the PARs, which were introduced in the vessel when the overall aerosol, FP and hydrogen releases in the containment atmosphere had ended, analysis of their surface temperature evolution indicated that, despite the very low oxygen concentration in the FPT 3 containment, they worked quite well and were not poisoned by FPs during their 30 minute exposure time.

40|$|MATERIAUX:SURFACES+FMOIn {{the context}} of {{hydrogen}} risk mitigation in nuclear power plants (NPPs), experimental studies of a possible poisoning of <b>Passive</b> <b>Autocatalytic</b> <b>Recombiners</b> (PARS) by fission products (FPs) and aerosols released during a core meltdown accident were mainly conducted in the past with non-radioactive fission product surrogates (e. g., in the H 2 PAR facility at Cadarache, France). The decision was taken in 1997 to complete these studies by a test in the Phebus facility, a research nuclear reactor also at Cadarache: {{it was a rare}} opportunity to expose catalyst samples to an atmosphere as representative as possible of a core meltdown accident, containing gaseous fission products and aerosols released during the degradation of an actual irradiated nuclear fuel bundle. Before testing in Phebus during the FPT 3 experiment, reference and qualification tests were performed in the H 2 PAR facility using the same samples the so-called "coupons" and coupons holder to check that the apparatus was functional and correctly designed for avoiding to tamper with the thermal-hydraulics and chemical conditions in the Phebus containment. The correct operation of catalysts was checked by measuring the surface temperature increase of the coupons due to the exothermic reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. After the Phebus FPT 3 test (November 2004), REKO- 1 tests were initiated at Julich, Germany, to confirm the discrepancy in coupons temperature observed in Phebus FFT 3 and H 2 PAR PHEB- 03 tests, and to study the operation behaviour of PARs. Besides, before REKO- 1 tests, a first interpretation of H 2 PAR and Phebus experiments was led to the conclusion that their difference during the operation was due to the different experimental conditions. Samples of catalysts (IRSN/IRCELYON coupon) similar to those used in Phebus and H 2 PAR facilities were exposed in REKO- 1 facility to an atmosphere {{similar to that of the}} Phebus model containment. During the REKO- 1 experiments, the temperatures of the coupon surface, together with the oxygen and hydrogen recombination kinetics, were measured as a function of the oxygen fraction in the feed. In these conditions, the inlet oxygen fraction was shown to be the main parameter affecting the recombination rate. The presence of steam was also taken into account during the IRSN/IRCELYON coupon operation in REKO- 1. Finally, the PAR surface temperatures during the REKO- 1 tests (both optical and thermocouple measurements) are compared with those obtained during the FPT 3 and PHEB- 03 tests. Then, the experimental observations (from the Phebus FFT 3, H 2 PAR PHEB 03 and REKO- 1 tests) were corroborated by numerical calculations using the SPARK code developed at IRSN for catalytic reactors and recombiners applications. Despite the loss of performance experienced by the coupons in the FPT 3 test, as compared with the PHEB- 03 test, this study does not challenge the qualification of PARs for risk mitigation in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) NPPs, and suggests that they could still be efficient in the rich burn conditions of partially inerted (oxygen depleted) Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) containments.

40|$|<b>Autocatalytic</b> <b>passive</b> <b>recombiners</b> (PAR) are {{implemented}} in containments as an accident management measure {{to mitigate the}} consequences of possible hydrogen combustion {{in the course of}} a severe accident. The performance of a PAR has been demonstrated in large scale tests; however these integral tests provided no data for detailed model development. At Forschungszentrum Jülich separate effect tests are performed in order to obtain experimental data suited for the validation of detailed numerical models for the assessment of the operational behaviour of PAR. The paper describes the experimental facilities and results obtained so far. Two modelling strategies are pursued and assessed with their applicability and further development needs. The detailed evaluation of the reaction kinetics and heat and mass transport phenomena on a single catalyst element is performed by a direct implementation of the transport and kinetic approaches in ANSYS CFX 11. To model the interaction of PAR with the containment and address the issues mentioned above, REKO-Direkt, a detailed user model based on Fortran 90 will be implemented in CFX to model the entire PAR. This in-house code is already validated against the database and capable to model all relevant processes. Finally some results of local interaction studies are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|The 5 th FWP EURSAFE Project {{highlighted}} iodine chemistry in {{the containment}} {{as one of}} the issues requiring further research in order to reduce source term uncertainties. Consequently, a series of studies was launched in the 6 th FWP SARNET Project aimed at improving the predictability of iodine behaviour during severe accidents via {{a better understanding of the}} complex chemical phenomena in the containment. In particular, SARNET has striven to foster common interpretation of integral and separate effect test data, production of new or improved models where necessary, and compilation of the existing knowledge of the subject. The work has been based on a substantial amount of experimental information made available from bench-scale projects (PARIS and EPICUR), via intermediate-scale tests (CAIMAN) to large-scale facilities (SISYPHE, THAI and PHEBUS-FP). In the experimental field, particular attention has been paid to two specific issues: the effects of radiation on both aqueous and gaseous iodine chemistry, and the mass transfer of iodine between aqueous and gaseous phases. Comparisons between calculations and results of the EPICUR and CAIMAN experiments suggest that the aqueous phase chemistry is reasonably well understood, although there are still some areas of uncertainty. Interpretation of integral experiments, like PHEBUS-FPT 2, indicated that radiation-induced conversion of molecular iodine into particulate species (IxOy) could be responsible for the gaseous iodine depletion observed in the long-term. However, the results of much simpler, small-scale experiments have shown that further improvements in understanding and modelling are still needed. Mass transfer modelling has been extended to cover evaporating sump conditions based on SISYPHE data; however, application of this model to the larger scale THAI experiments seems not to be straightforward. In addition to these two major issues, some specific studies have been carried out concerning the potential effect of <b>passive</b> <b>autocatalytic</b> hydrogen <b>recombiners</b> on iodine volatility. The RECI analytical experiments have shown that metal iodides (namely Csl and Cdl(2)) are not stable and yield gaseous iodine when heated, in a humid atmosphere, at temperatures representative of recombiner operation. Another important undertaking successfully carried out has been the compilation of an Iodine Data Book, which provides a critical review of the experimental data and modelling approaches that have been used in the development of iodine source term methodologies. This should assist in a proper use of such models, and inform their future development...|$|R
