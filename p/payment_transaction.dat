25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated <b>Payment</b> <b>Transaction</b> tax and Spahn tax. The Automated <b>Payment</b> <b>Transaction</b> tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Edgar L. Feige {{proposed}} a synthesis and {{extension of the}} ideas of Keynes and Tobin by proposing a flat rate tax on all transactions. The total volume of all transactions undertaken in an economy represents the broadest possible tax base and therefore requires the lowest flat tax rate to raise any requisite amount of revenue. Since financial transactions in stocks, bonds, international currency transactions and derivatives comprise most of the automated <b>payment</b> <b>transaction</b> (APT) tax base, it is in essence the broadest of financial transaction taxes. Initially {{proposed a}}s a revenue neutral replacement for the entire Federal tax system of the United States, it could alternatively {{be considered as a}} global tax whose revenues could be used by national governments to reduce existing income, corporate and VAT tax rates as well as reducing existing sovereign debt burdens. If adopted by all of the developed nations, it would have the advantage of eliminating all incentives for substitution between financial assets and between financial centers since all transactions would universally be taxed at the identical flat tax rate.|$|E
2500|$|A {{transaction}} tax {{is not a}} levy {{on financial}} institutions per se; rather, it is charged only on the specific transactions that are designated as taxable. So if an institution never carries out the taxable transaction, then {{it will never be}} subject to the transaction tax. Furthermore, if an institution carries out only one such transaction, then it will only be taxed for that one transaction. As such, this tax is neither a financial activities tax (FAT), nor a Financial stability contribution (FSC), or [...] "Bank tax", The global adoption of a small flat rate Automated <b>Payment</b> <b>Transaction</b> tax whose base included all transactions would eliminate evasion and avoidance possibilities since the tax would apply equally at all substitution margins.|$|E

2500|$|According to some economists, a {{financial}} transaction tax is {{less susceptible to}} tax avoidance and tax evasion than other types of taxes proposed for the financial sector. The Automated <b>Payment</b> <b>Transaction</b> tax (APT tax) employs 21st century technology for automatically assessing and collecting taxes when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking payments system. Joseph Stiglitz, former Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank affirmed the [...] "technical feasibility" [...] of the tax. Although Tobin said his tax idea was unfeasible in practice, Stiglitz noted that modern technology meant that {{was no longer the}} case and said that the tax is [...] "much more feasible today" [...] than a few decades ago, when Tobin disagreed.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{common theme}} is the {{proposed}} intention {{to create a}} system of more fair and equitable tax collection. The Automated <b>Payment</b> <b>Transaction</b> tax (APT tax) taxes the broadest possible tax base, namely all transactions including all real and financial asset transactions. Instead of introducing progressivity through the tax rate structure, the flat rate APT tax introduces progressiveness through the tax base since the highest income and wealth groups undertake {{a disproportionate share of}} financial transactions. In the context of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, many economists, governments, and organizations around the world re-examined, or were asked to re-examine, the concept of a financial transaction tax, or its various forms. In response to a request from the G20 nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delivered a report in 2010 titled [...] "A Fair and Substantial Contribution by the Financial Sector" [...] which made reference to a financial transaction tax as one of several options.|$|E

40|$|Performing <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> {{over the}} Internet is {{becoming}} increasingly important. Whenever one interacts with others, he or she faces the problem of uncertainty because in interacting with others, one makes him or herself vulnerable, i. e. one can be betrayed. Thus, perceived risk and confidence are of fundamental importance in electronic <b>payment</b> <b>transactions.</b> A higher risk leads to greater hesitance about entering into a business relationship {{with a high degree}} of uncertainty; and therefore, to an increased need for confidence. This paper has two objectives. First, it aims to introduce and test a theoretical model that predicts consumer and merchant acceptance of the Internet payment solution by explaining the complex set of relationships among the key factors influencing confidence in electronic <b>payment</b> <b>transactions.</b> Second, the paper attempts to shed light on the complex interrelationship among confidence, control and perceived risk. An empirical study was conducted to test the proposed model using data from consumers and merchants in Slovenia. The results show how perceived risk dimensions and post-transaction control influence consumer’s and merchant’s confidence in electronic <b>payment</b> <b>transactions,</b> and the impact of confidence on the adoption of mass-market on-line payment solutions...|$|R
