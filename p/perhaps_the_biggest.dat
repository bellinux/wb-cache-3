5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> problem Biden faced was {{the fact}} that voters did not know about him and his candidacy. An April 2–5 poll {{conducted}} by Gallup found that 38% of the public had never heard of Joe Biden and 17% had no opinion at all about him. In contrast, 0% of the public had never heard of Hillary Clinton and only 3% had no opinion according to a June 1–3 poll by Gallup.|$|E
5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players {{who came up}} this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show me what he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
25|$|When {{the summer}} ended, Wooler {{traveled}} to Rhodesia and represented their {{team in the}} 1951/52 Currie Cup. He managed 23 wickets at 32.34 in first-class matches for Rhodesia, with <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> of those scalps being his last ever, Denis Compton of the Marylebone Cricket Club.|$|E

50|$|The SPD, {{under its}} leader Andrea Ypsilanti, {{increased}} {{its share of}} the vote substantially, from 29% to 37%, and it claimed victory as a result. <b>The</b> other winner—and <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> winner overall considering their relative starting positions and the subsequent events in Hesse politics—was the far-left Linke party. They entered the Hesse Landtag with 5.1% of the vote, clearing the five-percent hurdle. This was the second western Landtag in which the Linke party had won seats (the first having been earlier in 2008 in Lower Saxony).|$|R

25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> move in free agency, however, was {{the signing}} of former Pro Bowl wide {{receiver}} T. J. Houshmandzadeh from the Cincinnati Bengals to a 5-year, $40 million deal with $15 million guaranteed two days after signing Cole. Houshmandzadeh was rated {{as one of the}} top free agents available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> scalp of {{his career}} was Aravinda de Silva, whom he {{dismissed}} when the Leeward Islands took on the touring Sri Lankans at St John's in 1997. He has also taken the wicket of Trinidadian Brian Lara, bowling him in a Red Stripe match which the Leeward Islands won.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to just about {{everyone}} but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our focus away from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> strategic blunder in our nation's history. And while we have been preoccupied with Iraq, under this President, North Korea has gone nuclear and Iran {{is on the verge}} of doing so.|$|E
40|$|TELEVISION {{takes its}} audiences close to {{events and the}} men who lay claim to decisive {{influence}} on those events. The cameras were very revealing of President Johnson and Prime Minister Holt in their politicians’ progress through eastern Australia. Predictably, Mr. Holt came out worse—obviously obsequious, long-winded and boring. Mr. Johnson, more experienced and better coached in projecting an image, was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> disappointment to those who may have looked for any signs of intellectual depth or I grasp of the moral and political issues in Vietnam and Asia...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the level}} of abstraction, derived {{categories}} became accepted over the following decades, especially as a convenient setting for sheaf cohomology. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> advance was the formulation of the Riemann–Hilbert correspondence in dimensions greater than 1 in derived terms, around 1980. The Sato school adopted the language of derived categories, and the subsequent history of D-modules was of a theory expressed in those terms.|$|E
25|$|Preston were <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> chokers as {{they lost}} 5 of their final 7 games to slump {{out of the}} {{play-off}} places they had occupied through {{the bulk of the}} season, missing out on a third successive play-off finish. Cardiff City had been the early pace-setters, leading the table up until the midway point before their form tailed off badly in the second half.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> {{factor in}} drawing {{visitors}} to Nashville is {{its association with}} country music. Many visitors to Nashville attend live performances of the Grand Ole Opry, the world's longest-running live radio show. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum is another major attraction relating to the popularity of country music. The Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, the Opry Mills regional shopping mall and the General Jackson showboat, are all located in {{what is known as}} Music Valley.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{moving to}} Division I in 2001 the Binghamton {{basketball}} team has seen rewarding successes and great disappointments. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> program's <b>biggest</b> non-conference win was against ACC member, University of Miami {{in the winter}} of 2006. The Bearcats also have had wins against both Rutgers University and Tulane.|$|R
2500|$|Glazer {{continued}} to publish books {{on race and}} ethnicity throughout the 1980s and 1990s. We Are All Multiculturalists Now, published in 1997, <b>perhaps</b> created <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> stir. In it, Glazer argued that multiculturalism was now the dominant ethic in public schools while [...] "assimilation" [...] had become a dirty word.|$|R
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> {{nowadays}} <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> {{and most}} famous festival where participants spontaneously {{decide to go}} naked or take part in nude events is Burning Man: it's got its own naked bike ride aka 'Naked Pub Crawl', and a few camps organize activities in the nude, including the famous oil wrestling by camp Gymnasium.|$|R
25|$|Ladysmith Black Mambazo, {{headed by}} the sweet soprano of Joseph Shabalala, arose in the 1960s, and became <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> isicathamiya stars in South Africa's history. Their first album was 1973's Amabutho, which {{was also the first}} gold record by black musicians; it sold over 25,000 copies. Ladysmith Black Mambazo {{remained}} popular throughout the next few decades, especially after 1986, when Paul Simon, an American musician, included Ladysmith Black Mambazo on his extremely popular Graceland album and its subsequent tour of 1987.|$|E
25|$|The first {{international}} matches scheduled were {{as part of}} the Natwest Series against England and Bangladesh. In their first match, Australia lost to Bangladesh by five wickets in the last over, <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> upset in recent memory. Just before that game Andrew Symonds was dropped for disciplinary reasons. The following day, Australia lost their second match in a row to England, due mainly to Kevin Pietersen's late batting onslaught. However, Australia remained undefeated {{throughout the rest of the}} series to tie a thrilling final against England at Lord's.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> {{sustainability}} {{problem in}} Tucson, with its high desert climate, is potable water supply. The state manages all water in Arizona through its Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR). The primary consumer {{of water is}} Agriculture (including golf courses), which consumes about 69% of all water. Municipal (which includes residential use) accounts for about 25% of use. Energy consumption and availability is another sustainability issue. However, with over 300 days of full sun a year, Tucson has demonstrated its potential to be an ideal solar energy producer.|$|E
50|$|In the spring, cool fronts moving {{south from}} Canada collide with warm, humid air {{streaming}} {{in from the}} Gulf Coast. When these fronts meet over north central Texas, severe thunderstorms are generated with spectacular lightning shows, torrents of rain, hail, and occasionally, tornadoes. Over time, tornadoes have <b>perhaps</b> been <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> natural threat to the city.|$|R
50|$|Dent was a London {{manufacturer}} of luxury clocks and watches, founded by Edward John Dent. Dent began making watches in 1814, although it wasn’t until 1876 that the Dent triangular trade mark was registered. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> company’s <b>biggest</b> coup is winning {{the contract to}} make the clock for the new palace of Westminster - or Big Ben as it’s more commonly known.|$|R

25|$|McGhee heavily {{invested}} in the squad in the post-season, and Rovers were considered among the favourites for promotion to League One. However, the club made a dire start, and were {{near the bottom of}} the table from the earliest weeks of the season. By December 2012 it was clear that Rovers were in <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> danger of dropping out of the Football League they had ever been, which resulted in McGhee being sacked and former manager John Ward returning to the club. The club's form greatly improved in the weeks that followed, and another safe finish was achieved, this time 14th.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait was {{the center}} of boat {{building}} in the Persian Gulf region. During the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, vessels made in Kuwait carried the bulk of trade between the ports of India, East Africa and the Red Sea. Kuwaiti ships were renowned throughout the Indian Ocean. Regional geopolitical turbulence helped foster economic prosperity in Kuwait {{in the second half of}} the 18th century. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> catalyst for much of Kuwait becoming prosperous was due to Basra's instability in the late 18th century. In the late 18th century, Kuwait partly functioned as a haven for Basra's merchants, who were fleeing Ottoman government persecution. Kuwaitis developed a reputation as the best sailors in the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, {{only a few}} long-standing mgqashiyo {{groups were}} well-known, with the only new groups finding success with an all-male line-up. Abafana Baseqhudeni and Boyoyo Boys were <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> new stars of this period. The Mahotella Queens' members began leaving the line-up around 1971 for rival groups. Gallo, {{by far the biggest}} record company in South Africa, began to create a new Mahotella Queens line-up, {{recording}} them with Abafana Baseqhudeni. Lead groaner Mahlathini had already moved to rival label EMI (in early 1972), where he had successful records with backing team Ndlondlo Bashise and new female group the Mahlathini Girls. The new Mahotella Queens line-up over at Gallo found just as much success as the original Queens, recording on-and-off with new male groaners such as Robert Mbazo Mkhize of Abafana Baseqhudeni.|$|E

25|$|King was {{repeatedly}} rejected in auditions for the South Side's Chess Records, the premier blues label, {{which was the}} home of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter. The complaint was that King sang too much like B.B. King. A newer blues scene, lively with nightclubs and upstart record companies, was burgeoning on the West Side, though. The bassist and producer Willie Dixon, {{during a period of}} estrangement from Chess in the late 1950s, asked King to come to Cobra Records for a session, but the results have never been heard. Meanwhile, King established himself as <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> musical force on the West Side. He played along with Magic Sam and reputedly played backing guitar, uncredited, on some of Sam's tracks for Mel London's Chief and Age labels, though King does not stand out on them.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> {{story of}} 1948 for Pontiac was the {{addition}} of Hydramatic automatic transmission as an option. As of 1948 only General Motors sold cars with fully automatic transmissions and the only other way to get one was to buy a higher priced Cadillac, Buick or Oldsmobile. Chevrolet would not introduce Powerglide until 1950, Ford FordoMatic until 1951 (Lincoln would start buying Hydramatics from GM in 1949), and Chrysler, PowerFlite on Imperials, until 1953. Hydramatic proved very popular {{with a total of}} 171,946 Pontiacs sold with it, or about 71% of all Pontiacs, and with 122,327 Streamliners equipped with it, or about 76% of all Streamliners, in its first year. Since Hydramatic was still only optional on Cadillac and Oldsmobile, and Dynaflow optional on Buick Roadmaster, given the total sales of Cadillac (50,619), Oldsmobile (173,661) and Buick Roadmaster (80,071), and the fact that Dynaflow was only introduced {{in the middle of the}} model year, this implies that probably over 40% of all cars sold with automatic transmissions in 1948 were Pontiacs.|$|E
25|$|Langston {{was twice}} {{threatened}} with destruction in the 1960s. In 1964, Washington, D.C., officials proposed closing {{the first nine}} holes of Langston Golf Course and building the Barney Circle Freeway on the land, but the National Park Service (which owned and managed the island at the time) refused {{to turn over the}} land to the city. In 1969, the city of Washington proposed closing all of Langston Golf Course and building extensive low-income public housing on the golf course and the rest of Kingman Island. The National Park Service rejected that plan as well. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> threat to the course was a study by the Park Service in the mid-1960s which called for a new federally owned golf course to be built at Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm (just over the District line in Maryland). This study showed that D.C. golfers would be better served by the new course, and that Langston should be closed. But by 1977, the Oxon Cove course had yet to be built, and the plan died.|$|E
2500|$|Khan is {{considered}} one of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> film stars in the world and is referred to by the media as [...] "King Khan", [...] "The Baadshah of Bollywood", and [...] "The King of Bollywood". In 2011, Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "He is <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> movie star you've never heard of.

40|$|Australia has {{traditionally}} relied on two diplomatic strategies in {{its attempts to}} 'engage' Asia. The first has been to couch engagement diplomacy within broader global trends and developments, such as {{the response to the}} Communist threat during the Cold War or the general move towards the 'new regionalism' after the Cold War. The second strategy has been a dogged prudentialism, building on shared (usually commercial) interests. The shortcomings of both strategies became apparent in the lead-up to the 2005 East Asia Summit, where Australia faced a diplomatic exclusion not as the specific policy choice of another country, but as the unintended by-product of rivalries among Asia's great powers. That the success or otherwise of Australia's regional engagement will be shaped by such rivalries in future was reinforced by the sensitivities aroused over the Prime Minister's trip to China in 2008. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> lesson is that Asia's rivalries are no longer sub-sets of global dynamics. We may be entering an era in which Asia's rivalries drive broader global dynamics, which in turn will pose severe challenges for Australia's regional diplomacy. Full Tex...|$|R
