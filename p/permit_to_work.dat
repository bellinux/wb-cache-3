25|$|Njóla {{is a long}} didactic theological-philosophical poem Björn wrote mostly {{during his}} survey travels when the weather did not <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or in the evenings. It was {{published}} originally in the annual report of 1842 of the Bessastaðir school, and then in 1853 with some minor revisions and again in 1884 in Reykjavík. The poem begins by describing a night view of the skies, and then introduces the reader to astronomic distances, explaining how long a cannonball shot from the sun would take to reach each of the planets—and then the next star. In later stanzas, he describes {{the birth of the}} universe, covers Newton's laws and explains gravity. He interweaves such physics and mathematics framed as poetry with theological and philosophical musings about the purpose of the universe, the nature of good and evil, and God's intent.|$|E
25|$|Zeev Sternhell {{was born}} in Przemyśl, Poland, to an {{affluent}} secular Jewish family with Zionist tendencies. His grandfather and father were textile merchants. When the Soviet Union occupied eastern Poland, Soviet troops took over part of his home. His father died of natural causes. A few months after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, the family {{was sent to the}} ghetto. His mother and older sister, Ada, were killed by the Nazis when he was seven years old. An uncle who had a <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> outside the ghetto smuggled him to Lwów. The uncle found a Polish officer who was willing to help them. Supplied with false Aryan papers, Sternhell lived with his aunt, uncle and cousin as a Polish Catholic. After the war, he was baptized, taking the Polish name Zbigniew Orolski. He became an altar boy in the Cathedral of Kraków. In 1946, at the age of 11, Sternhell was taken to France on a Red Cross children's train, where he lived with an aunt. He learned French and was accepted to a school in Avignon despite stiff competition.|$|E

25|$|For Scream 3, Craven {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that convincing the central cast to return was not difficult but their burgeoning fame and busy schedules made arranging their availability with the film's production troublesome. Campbell in particular was only available for 20 days of filming which resulted in a significantly reduced role for her character and a focus on Cox and Arquette's characters. Emily Mortimer was cast as Angelina Tyler but shortly after filming began it was discovered she lacked the required <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> resulting in her being flown to Vancouver to obtain one. Carrie Fisher made a cameo in the film at the suggestion of Bob Weinstein and Fisher helped write her character. Kelly Rutherford was cast after filming had begun as the production was undergoing constant rewrites and the opening scene evolved from requiring only a female corpse to needing a live actress with whom Schreiber could interact. In an 2009 interview, Matthew Lillard, who played Stu Macher in Scream, claimed that he was signed to reprise his role in Scream 3 as the primary antagonist but after the script moved in a direction without his character, he was bought out of his contract.|$|E
2500|$|The 2003 Labor Law and its {{implementing}} Ministerial Decree and the 2004 Decree of the Ministry of Manpower and Emigration force all foreigners including {{refugees to}} have a <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in [...] "gainful" [...] employment.

50|$|Once a <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{has been}} issued to a workgroup, a {{lock-out}} tag-out system {{is used to}} restrict equipment state changes such as valve operations until the work specified in the permit is complete. Since the <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> is the primary de-conflictation tool all work activities in high risk environments should have a <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> specific hazardous operations will then have a second permit for activities such as confined space or hot work.

Common failures in control of work systems are a failure to follow the <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or isolation management procedures, risk assessments that are not suitable and sufficient to identify the risks, and/or the control measures and a combination of the two.|$|E
