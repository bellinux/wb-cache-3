5|$|It is {{possible}} that increased competition due {{to the evolution of}} key innovations among other groups, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> response to predation, drove the Ediacaran biota from their niches.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of William's {{background}} or family, except that his father Godwin held land in Shipbourne, near Wrotham in Kent, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vassal of the Archbishops of Canterbury. William's brother Richard was named as William's deputy in 1207.|$|E
5|$|The book {{appears to}} have {{originally}} been composed in the 1130s, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> text for his students, and only later dedicated it to King Henry. It has been printed in a critical edition.|$|E
50|$|Progressive metal band Gordian Knot takes {{their name}} from the legendary knot, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> allusion to the complex, {{interwoven}} layers of harmony and counterpoint in their music.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{newspaper}} {{interviews with}} Stander, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> teenager {{he appeared in}} the silent film Men of Steel (1926), <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> extra, since he is not listed in the credits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{illustration}} {{of the effects of}} declining circulation for 2011, The Journal-Gazette broke its long-standing tradition of hosting a Christmas reception at the Fort Wayne Country Club.|$|R
5|$|The first {{argues that}} {{because there is no}} medieval {{documentary}} evidence, then the Giant was created in the 17th century, perhaps by Lord Holles, who resided in Cerne Abbas, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> parody of Oliver Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and {{are thought to have}} formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
50|$|In American {{literature}} (e.g., in The Great Gatsby) moving West {{has sometimes}} symbolized gaining freedom, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{association with the}} settling of the Old West (see also Manifest Destiny).|$|R
50|$|Early in the 19th century {{there was}} growing {{interest}} in medieval art, and, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> expression of national pride, casts were made of outstanding national monuments particularly in France and Germany.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{house was}} built by Rubens {{to the north of}} Antwerp in the polder village of Doel, [...] "Hooghuis" [...] (1613/1643), <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> investment. The [...] "High House" [...] was built next to the village church.|$|R
5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E
5|$|Edward's body lay at Wareham for a {{year before}} being disinterred. Ælfhere {{initiated}} the reinterment, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gesture of reconciliation. According {{to the life of}} Oswald, Edward's body was found to be incorrupt when it was disinterred (which was taken as a miraculous sign). The body was taken to the Shaftesbury Abbey, a nunnery with royal connections which had been endowed by King Alfred the Great and where Edward and Æthelred's grandmother Ælfgifu had spent her latter years.|$|E
5|$|Like Eliurus, Voalavo has {{moderately}} high-crowned (hypsodont) molars with crowns that consist not {{of discrete}} cusps, but of transverse laminae (plates) that generally lack longitudinal connections. However, Eliurus molars are slightly more hypsodont {{than those of}} Voalavo. The third upper and lower molars are smaller relative to the second molars in Voalavo than in Eliurus. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consequence, the upper third molar lacks discrete laminae in Voalavo, and the lower third molar has only two laminae (three in Eliurus). There are three roots under each upper molar and two under each lower.|$|E
50|$|Packera tomentosa is a {{perennial}} {{that produces a}} head of yellow flowers in late spring. Its seeds {{have been shown to}} have varying masses within a single head of flowers, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adaptation for better dispersal in disturbed habitats.|$|R
50|$|The patas monkey avoids dense {{woodlands}} {{and lives}} in more open savanna and semi-deserts. The patas monkey has a remarkably high reproductive rate, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> evolutionary response to the high adult mortality rates associated with this strongly terrestrial lifestyle.|$|R
50|$|If no {{communication}} {{mechanism is}} given (as is usual in the prisoner's dilemma), the operative social {{relationship between the}} actors {{is based on the}} actors own beliefs about the other (<b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> another member of the human race, solidarity will be felt, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adversary). This illustrates the principle of game transformation, which is a key element of the theory.|$|R
5|$|Models of how Siletzia formed are of {{two general}} types: (1) Formation well {{offshore}} (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation inshore, {{on or near}} the continental margin (<b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of transcurrent extension, or of a slab window). All current models then have Siletzia rifting away from the continental edge about a northern pivot.|$|E
5|$|The army of {{the early}} Republic {{continued}} to evolve, and {{although there was a}} tendency among Romans to attribute such changes to great reformers, {{it is more likely that}} changes were the product of slow evolution rather than singular and deliberate policy of reform. The manipular formation was probably copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of Roman defeats in the Second Samnite War.|$|E
5|$|The {{work may}} have been {{intended}} for private devotion, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because {{of a lack of}} surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15thcentury-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa– an influential albergo active from 1362– who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century.|$|E
2500|$|The Duke of Dorset {{was a great}} {{admirer of}} his play and the sources have recorded, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anecdote, that Dorset used {{to sit on the}} railing round the Sevenoaks Vine ground to watch him bat, often exclaiming: [...] "Bravo, my little Bowra".|$|R
50|$|Erasmus wrote Copia while a {{professor}} at the University of Cambridge in 1511. He was teaching Greek, but between courses composed several texts designed to instruct Latin. Copia was one such text, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to expand on Quintillian's rhetorical guide, Institutio Oratoria.|$|R

5|$|There are {{no reports}} of {{dopamine}} in archaea, {{but it has been}} detected in some types of bacteria and in the protozoan called Tetrahymena. Perhaps more importantly, there are types of bacteria that contain homologs of all the enzymes that animals use to synthesize dopamine. It has been proposed that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria, via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers {{was unable to}} control the army he had created. On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prelude to {{storming}} Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading out of town, and imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get out of hand, Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time {{under the command of}} General E.J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{evidence}} suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked {{in much of}} Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland {{in the second half}} of the twelfth century and was revived in the late fifteenth century, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reaction to the English perpendicular style that had come to dominate. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> enabler of cross-training, {{the company}} adopts (<b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{element of a}} {{contract}} with the labor union) skill-base pay, which refers to a pay-for-skills incentive; for example, for each new skill mastered, the employee's wage rate is increased by some amount, such as $0.50 per hour.|$|R
50|$|Brown {{left the}} Australian Public Service {{shortly after the}} 1990 federal election, {{thought to have been}} sacked by Prime Minister Bob Hawke, perhaps due to his not being {{sufficiently}} responsive to certain ethnic communities, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> effort to remove Brown's Deputy Secretary, Tony Harris.|$|R
50|$|The waist-level finder (WLF) {{is a type}} of {{viewfinder}} {{that can}} be used on twin lens and single lens reflex cameras. While it is typically found on older medium format cameras, some newer and/or 35 mm cameras have this type of finder (<b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> option).|$|R
5|$|In the summer, the Alpine chough feeds {{mainly on}} {{invertebrates}} collected from pasture, such as beetles (Selatosomus aeneus and Otiorhynchus morio {{have been recorded}} from pellets), snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars and fly larvae. The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including berries such as the European Hackberry (Celtis australis) and Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), rose hips, and domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of Crocus vernus albiflorus, including the pistils, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> source of carotenoids. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Where additional food is available, winter flocks are larger and contain {{a high proportion of}} immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Carus's death, amid a {{successful}} war with Persia and in mysterious circumstances – he was believed (<b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of later Diocletianic propaganda) {{to have been}} struck by lightning – left his sons Numerian and Carinus as the new Augusti. Carinus quickly {{made his way to}} Rome from his post in Gaul as imperial commissioner and arrived there by January 284, becoming legitimate Emperor in the West. Numerian lingered in the East. The Roman withdrawal from Persia was orderly and unopposed. The Sassanid king Bahram II could not field an army against them as he was still struggling to establish his authority. By March 284, Numerian had only reached Emesa (Homs) in Syria; by November, only Asia Minor. In Emesa he was apparently still alive and in good health: he issued the only extant rescript in his name there, but after he left the city, his staff, including the prefect (Numerian's father-in-law, and as such the dominant influence in the Emperor's entourage) Aper, reported that he suffered from an inflammation of the eyes. He traveled in a closed coach from then on. When the army reached Bithynia, some of the soldiers smelled an odor emanating from the coach. They opened its curtains and inside they found Numerian dead. Both Eutropius and Aurelius Victor describe Numerian's death as an assassination.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and the conception of national interests, {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the centrality of notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the proposition that the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E
5000|$|Smoking jackets have {{declined}} in popularity since the 1950s, though {{a minority of}} wearers still exists, Playboy mogul Hugh Hefner being a notable example. In its January/February 1999 issue, Cigar Aficionado stated {{that it was time}} the smoking jacket be brought back, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> [...] "alternative type of formalwear".|$|R
50|$|Barrow's {{greatest}} {{significance is}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aggressive promoter of paper preservation, as in retrospect his scientific discoveries {{have not been}} entirely sound. For example, his tests to accelerate the natural aging of paper samples at elevated temperatures have since proven to be erroneous, and modern scholars doubt his importance <b>as</b> <b>an</b> original chemical researcher.|$|R
50|$|And, in {{addition}} to setting Levels for Conditions, an Average needs to be allowed for where the more data that is run through the system, the more accurate an Average. Once Averages are established, then {{in addition}} to Conditions—or <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alternative to Conditions—a percentage or Variance should be set <b>as</b> <b>an</b> allowable or Notifiable range.|$|R
