5|$|On January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of {{the exact}} {{location}} of the blockading squadron, Decatur set a course to avoid them and seek a safe port, but approximately two hours later the squadron's sails were spotted on the horizon. President changed course to outrun them, but the damage she suffered the night before had significantly reduced her speed. Attempting to gain speed, Decatur ordered expendable cargo thrown overboard; by late afternoon of 15January, HMS Endymion under Captain Henry Hope came alongside and proceeded to fire broadsides. Decatur planned to bring President in close to Endymion, whereby Presidents crew could board and capture the opposing ship and sail her to New York. (<b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> scuttled to prevent her capture).|$|E
5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E

50|$|During Augusto Pinochet's {{military}} regime from 1973 to 1989, the University experienced many profound changes. On 2 October 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 {{stated that the}} University's <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> designated by the {{military regime}}.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, Vincent {{conducted}} a plebiscite about extending his term in office, receiving a favorable vote to extend it to 1941. The plebiscite also approved {{an amendment to}} the constitution so that future <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected by popular vote.|$|R
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E
5|$|The latter {{soon began}} {{to come to a}} head. Austria had {{solidified}} its control over Lombardy-Venice and extended its protection to provinces nominally under the control of Francis' daughter Marie Louise. On 18 April Metternich announced that Austria was formally at war with Murat's Naples. Austria won the Battle of Tolentino on 3 May and captured Naples less than three weeks later. Metternich then was able to delay a decision {{on the future of the}} country until after Vienna. Discussions about Germany would drag on until early June, when a joint Austrian-Prussian proposition was ratified. It left most constitutional issues to the new diet; its <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the Emperor Francis himself. Despite criticism from within Austria, Metternich was pleased with the outcome and the degree of control it granted Habsburgs, and, through them, himself. Certainly, Metternich was able to use the diet to his own ends on numerous occasions. The arrangement was similarly popular with most German representatives. A summation treaty was signed on 19 June (the Russians signed a week later), bringing the Vienna Congress officially to an end. Metternich himself had left on 13 June for the front line, prepared for a lengthy war against Napoleon. Napoleon, however, was defeated decisively at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June.|$|E
25|$|The elder Ford {{was active}} with his four sons in the Boy Scouts of America. The future <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the first Eagle Scout to become Vice President or President. The President {{was to say}} later that the award {{was one of his}} proudest accomplishments.|$|E
50|$|On 26 November 1982, Lerma was {{appointed}} President of the Valencian Community after {{the resignation of}} Enrique Monsonís.

25|$|A year later, Urrutia {{visited the}} US to gain {{support for the}} revolution, {{successfully}} lobbying for a halt of weapons shipments to Batista's forces. It was considered that the choice of Urrutia, an educated liberal and Christian, as <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> welcomed by the US.|$|E
25|$|Angola had no {{confidence}} {{that a new}} <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more effective than Kabila and feared that continued fighting {{would lead to a}} power vacuum that could only help UNITA. The intervention of the experienced Angolan forces was essential in deciding the outcome of both wars.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Prosecutors' Office of Korea (SPO), in laying {{charges against}} Choi and two former presidential aides, have alleged that President Park colluded {{with the three}} in certain {{criminal}} activities.

5000|$|Some {{criticized the}} film, however. Susan Silver, {{a staff writer}} for The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Bob Newhart Show, {{predicted}} that, {{as a result of the}} film's success, future <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> judged by voters on their ability to deliver a [...] "laugh riot" [...] rather than on substantive policy positions.|$|R

The new foreign minister of Honduras, Enrique Ortez, said that Insulza and any other <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> welcome but that Zelaya <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> allowed to enter.|$|R
25|$|Following the 2013 general elections, it was {{expected}} that the new <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> chosen by the party that won a plurality and thus headed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League (N). It {{is the first time in}} the country that a president elect has been chosen in the presence of a sitting president.|$|E
25|$|John Wesley was the {{longtime}} {{president of the}} Methodist Conference, but after his death {{it was agreed that}} in future, so much authority would not be placed in the hands of one man. Instead, the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected for one year, to sit in Wesley's chair. Successive Methodist schisms resulted in multiple presidents, before a united conference assembled in 1932.|$|E
25|$|In The Federalist Papers, James Madison {{explained}} {{his views on}} {{the selection of the}} president and the Constitution. In Federalist No. 39, Madison argued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of state-based and population-based government. Congress would have two houses: the state-based Senate and the population-based House of Representatives. Meanwhile, the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected by a mixture of the two modes.|$|E

25|$|At {{a meeting}} on 23 May 2009 a {{breakthrough}} was reached; a transitional government and a {{truth and reconciliation commission}} was agreed to be formed, and all former <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> allowed to stand in the presidential elections; this last point was seen as controversial, as it might increase instability. However, on 25 May 2009 the party of Didier Ratsiraka withdrew from the talks.|$|R
25|$|On 30 July 2009, {{he became}} Acting President after the {{retirement}} of 88-year-old President Iloilo. The President {{was supposed to be}} appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs (effectively abolished by the military-backed regime) under the 1997 constitution that Iloilo had abrogated, but Bainimarama announced that a new <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> appointed by his Cabinet at the regime's convenience. Nailatikau was formally appointed to the office on 5 November 2009.|$|E
25|$|Russell died on October 31, 1916, in Pampa, Texas {{during a}} {{cross-country}} preaching trip. On January 6, 1917, {{board member and}} society legal counsel Joseph Franklin Rutherford, aged 47, {{was elected president of}} the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. Under his presidency, the role of the society underwent a major change. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the executive officer and general manager of the society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Republic {{began with}} the {{adoption}} of the Yushin Constitution on November 21, 1972. This new constitution gave Park effective control over the parliament and the possibility of permanent presidency. The <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected through indirect election by an elected body, and the term of presidency was extended to six years with no restrictions on reappointment. The legislature and judiciary were controlled by the government, and educational guidelines were under direct surveillance as well. Textbooks supporting the ideology of the military government were authorized by the government, diminishing the responsibilities of the Ministry of Education.|$|E
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1930 Revolution, the Constitution adopted on 16 July 1934, in its {{transitional}} provisions, empowered the Constituent Assembly to elect the president for the first presidential term. Chosen by the Constituent Assembly, Getúlio Vargas, until then Head of the Provisional Government, took office as president on 20 July 1934. Subsequent <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected by direct popular ballot and the next <b>president</b> <b>would</b> take office on 3 May 1938. Accordingly, 3 May <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Inauguration Day under the 1934 Constitution. This Constitution was however short-lived due to the presidential coup d'etát of 10 November 1937, so that no presidential elections were held under its permanent provisions.|$|R
25|$|The <b>president's</b> salary <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{cut from}} $400,000 to {{approximately}} $39,000 per year (the median personal {{income of the}} American worker), and congressional pay and perks <b>would</b> <b>be</b> slashed.|$|R
50|$|After {{his death}} in 1904, Shaykh Sufi's resting place became a site of annual pilgrimage for the {{faithful}} from across Somalia and East Africa.

25|$|Nullification {{of federal}} legislation: On September 16, 2010, Bill Howell (R-Stafford), Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, wrote an online Wall Street Journal {{editorial}} advocating {{an amendment to}} the United States Constitution to give state legislatures the power to repeal federal legislation. Under the proposal, if two-thirds of the state legislatures agree, any federal law enacted by Congress and the <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> nullified or amended. Howell announced that he will introduce legislation in the 2011 General Assembly to advocate such an amendment. The Republicans advocated in favor of the amendment during the 2011 session.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} , {{the committee}} obtained {{the testimony of}} a former Secret Service agent, Abraham Bolden, who {{had been assigned to}} the Chicago office in 1963. He alleged that shortly before November 2, the FBI sent a teletype message to the Chicago Secret Service office stating that an attempt to assassinate the <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> made on November 2 by a four-man team using high-powered rifles, and that at least one member of the team had a Spanish-sounding name. Bolden claimed that while he did not personally participate in surveillance of the subjects, he learned about a surveillance of the four by monitoring Secret Service radio channels in his automobile and by observing one of the subjects being detained in his Chicago office.|$|E
25|$|Mori was {{a deeply}} unpopular leader {{throughout}} his year-long term, with several gaffes, scandals and resignations {{of government and}} party figures causing his approval ratings to fall below 10 percent. At the end of 2000, several LDP members launched an abortive effort to remove Mori through a vote of no-confidence, this failed, though it further damaged his government's standing. In the spring of 2001, Mori announced that the election for LDP <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> brought forward from the autumn, which was in effect a resignation announcement since he was not expected to stand again for the leadership. Mori then confirmed his intention to stand down {{at the beginning of}} April and remained in office for several more weeks until Junichiro Koizumi was elected as his successor and became Prime Minister on April 26.|$|E
