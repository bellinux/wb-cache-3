40|$|Abstract: Forces {{generated}} during <b>precision</b> wafer <b>grinding</b> {{are small}} and present challenges for accurate and reliable process monitoring. In this work, these challenges are met by incorporating noncontact displacement sensors into an aerostatic spindle that is calibrated to measure grinding forces from the relative motion between the spindle rotor and stator. This arrangement allows the calculation of grinding forces without introducing compliance into the structural loop of the grinding machine. Aerostatic spindles are used in <b>precision</b> wafer <b>grinding</b> requiring high stiffness and very low error motions (5 – 25 nm). Several experiments evaluate this force sensing approach in detecting workpiece contact, process monitoring with small depths of cut, and detecting workpiece defects. The results indicate that force measurements offer good performance for monitoring <b>precision</b> wafer <b>grinding</b> since this approach provides excellent contact sensitivity, high signal resolution, and has sufficient bandwidth to detect events occurring within a single revolution of the grinding wheel...|$|R

500|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in <b>precision</b> <b>grinding</b> machines in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of the rotational frequency Ω of OD-blade on its warp. In the analysis, the material constants of a sintered metal bonded diamond blade in common use in <b>precision</b> cutoff <b>grinding</b> are adopted as standard calculating conditions. The obtained results are summarized as follows. (1) In <b>precision</b> cutoff <b>grinding,</b> where the blade protrusion from flange ψ is set below 20 times of the blade thickness t, the initial warp decreases drastically just by fixing the blade to a flange. Under this condition, {{the effect of}} Ω on the warp reduction is slight. (2) When ψ is large, the warp decreases exponentially with the increase of Ω. (3) The warp decreases with the decrease of the blade thickness t under a high value of Ω. (4) The warp decreases slightly with the decrease of the blade bore diameter under a high value of Ω. (5) As for the metal bonded blade in common use, the effect of Ω on the warp reduction can be hardly expected because of its high Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus E. As for the resin bonded blade in common use, the effect can be expected a little because of its low value of E. (6) Almost independently of Ω, the warp decreases with the increase of Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio. (7) Even if a blade had double density of the metal bonded blade in common use, the effect of Ω on the warp reduction is comparatively slight...|$|R
