40|$|Discussions of "sustainable development" call {{attention}} to various dimensions of human well-being to be considered concomitantly with traditional financial and economic measures. The challenge of environmental impact analysis (EIA) is to encourage re-design of projects so that net benefits are maximized over some weighting of economic, environmental, and other criteria. To date, development organizations have been under attack by environmentalists for ignoring or conveniently overlooking environmental damages of development projects. Explanations for this include inadequate institutional commitment to link resource conservation with economic development, short time horizons, narrow evaluation criteria, problems of monetary valuation, and problems with implementation of EIAs. The future of EIAs will see a number of changes to correct for these deficiencies. Evaluation of project impacts in isolation may yield to a more comprehensive environmental assessment for entire regions. Projects will not be funded without the assurance of specific policy conditions for environmental management. The technology of EIA will advance {{with the assistance of}} geographic information systems and related tools for data management. Cost-benefit analysis of development projects will continue to integrate the work of <b>project</b> <b>economists</b> with engineers, agronomists, and other specialists with knowledge of environmental issues. Methods of multiple criteria evaluation represent an advance over the partial approaches of EIA and cost-benefit analysis. There is considerable support for moving towards longer project cycles and extended planning periods within the total cycle, meaning that EIA can be more extensive and continuous than in the past. Within the development organizations, reconsideration of personnel accountability and reward systems is one of the strategies to raise the prominence of environmental issues. Each year presents more case studies, videos, and other didactic materials for training in EIA. Finally, the question of improving EIA is a matter of demanding stronger institutions for proactive planning, technical analysis, and policy reforms favorable to environmental protection.

The difference between what they should receive and actually receive equals the quality value. Second, I analyzed how specific university attributes affect the institution’s quality value. Using IPEDS we gathered data on both student attributes, and institutional attributes. We measured student attributes by looking at ACT scores, GPA and class rank. Some variables used to measure institution quality included, student enrollment, money spent on research, and diversity.

The specialist on project preparation took responsibility for formulating locally adapted development projects and organizing training in this methodology for subsequent application by the Government's own staffFrom these various activities, a number of tangible results emerged: preparation of the agricultural sector component of the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan; formulation of a detailed proposal for the reorganization of the Planning Division; establishment of a locally adapted methodological framework for project preparation and analysis; and creation of a computerized system to collect and make continuously available all data necessary for long-range planning and preparation of future projects. The various workshops and seminars organized throughout the year were intended to strengthen the country's internal capacity for independent and autonomous project preparation and executionThis project was judged to have achieved very well its most important objectives. Government planners now had a sound basis for improvement and refinement of recommended methodology and techniques to meet future project preparation needs.

The research will integrate theoretical perspectives from multiple disciplines and utilize {{a wide range of}} complementary methodologies including: theoretical modeling of individuals, groups and complex systems, conceptual analysis; lab and field experiments and analysis of large data sets. The Network will promote high quality cross-disciplinary research and serve as a policy forum for understanding behaviour and behaviour change. We use an experiment to show that compliance to a cue by an authority is a powerful motivating mechanism. We do this in an experiment where there are direct orders or indirect cues to destroy half of another participant’s earnings at a cost to one’s own earnings.
