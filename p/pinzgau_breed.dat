40|$|<b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> or Pinzgauer {{is called}} after its {{region of origin}} (place Pinzgauer, near Salzburg, Austria) and is a {{mountain}} breed of cattle. The breed appeared in the 19 th century from local mountain breeds and was developed in three directions: traction, milk and meat. Recent {{research has shown that}} specimens of the <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> feed recovered well from such areas, farmers, to get average yields, having to buy a small amount of concentrated feed for animal ration to complete. In Romania, Red <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> formed after absorption crosses made between local breeds of cattle (Grey Steppe and MocaniGa) and Pizgau of Austria, since {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, and black Pinzgau named "Cow of Dorna" by crossing local cattle with various mountain improved breeds (Pinzgauer, Mölltal, Zillertal, Dux-Zillertal, Dutch, Brown, etc.). The breed is exploited in three areas: NW of Moldavia, SW of Transylvania and W of Transylvania -Apuseni Mountains. Transylvanian <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> has a sound constitution, lively temperament, docile character, precocity mediocre, high longevity, good capacity of adaptation, resistance to disease and weather. Has a multilateral skill (milk, meat, traction). These things are the main reasons why race should be kept in a form of active conservation. Moreover, in order to preserve the tradition and traditional products in Romania, is required to maintain this breed and even the formation of its national park...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to extend the {{knowledge}} about current fatty acids (FAs) profile of cow milk fat at herds of cows held in dairy farms in Slovakia. 368 milk samples were taken in total from cows of 5 different breeds, namely Holstein (H, n = 105), Red Holstein (R, n = 120), Pinzgau (P, n = 74), Slovak Pied (S, n = 61), and Braunvieh (B, n = 8). Single milk samples were analyzed for fat, protein, lactose content, minerals and fatty acid composition of milk fat using gas chromatography, where 54 FAs were identified and expressed relatively in percentage of peak areas (%) and evaluated in segments in accord with their biosynthetic origine. The combination of acids C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0 and C 16 : 0, as expressed in the sum HCHFA (46. 86 % for S and 47. 35 % for P), and also {{the value of the}} so-calculated. atherogenic index (2. 82 for S and 3. 10 for P) are the lowest, and thus the most favorable for human health at the breeds S and P. Medically desirable MUFA (27. 11 % for the S and 25. 84 % for P) and PUFA (3. 55 % for S and 3. 26 % for P) in these breeds are represented in the highest percentage shares.

40|$|The goal of {{work was}} {{identification}} of b - casein gene polymorphism in different breeds of cow. The beta - casein constitutes up to 45 % of the casein of bovine milk. The most common forms of beta-casein in dairy cattle breeds are A 1 and A 2, while B is less common. The b-casein A 1 variant {{was associated with}} the incidence of diabetes mellitus 1 st type, coronary heart disease and autism. The A 2 variant reduces serum cholesterol. The material involved 287 cows (Simmental breed – 111 cows, <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> – 89 cows, Holstein breed – 87 cows). Bovine genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood by using commercial kit and used in order to estimate b - casein genotypes by means of PCR-RFLP method. In the populations included in the study were detected all three genotypes – homozygote genotype A 1 A 1, heterozygote genotype A 1 A 2 and homozygote genotype A 2 A 2 with frequencies 0. 1261, 0. 3333 and 0. 5405 in Simmental breed; 0. 1379, 0. 4598 and 0. 4023 in Holstein breed, 0. 3034, 0. 5168 and 0. 1798 in <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed.</b> In population of Simmental breed and Holstein breed was higher frequency of allele A 2 (0. 7072 and 0. 6322).

40|$|Measurements made on 270 cows of Transilvanian <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> from Hunedoara county {{enables us}} to {{establish}} the genetic structure for productive characters as milk production and reproduction. We found the followings. Transilvanian <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> from Hateg county has its own genetic structure but {{similar to the one}} raised in region of Bucovina, for characters which concur to milk production for these contributing to reproduction efficiency. The average potential of milk production is 305 days and does not overrun 3550 Kg milk with 130 Kg fat (3, 8 %) but with a good persistence of milk synthesis during normal lactation. Maximum of milk production is manifested in the 7 th lactation and the average longevity overruns 9 lactations. Transilvanian Pinzgau is characterized by a remarkable fecundity and natality, with a low rate of embryonic abortion. Genetic handicap for this breed is its productive tardivnness and reproduction (it can enter reproduction without negative morphologic and functional consequences at the age of 21 months when it realizes 68 % of the adult mass) ...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} was to {{identify}}  - lactoglobulin gene polymorphism in bulls. The  - lactoglobulin (LGB) is expressed in milk and {{is important in the}} evaluation of milk production potential and butterfat and protein content. LGB is localized on bovine chromosome 11. The AA genotype of LGB is associated with higher milk yield, the BB genotype with higher fat and casein content and is more desirable for cheese making. The material involved 46 bulls (Slovak spotted breed – 41 bulls, <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> – 3 bulls and Holstein breed – 2 bulls). Bovine genomic DNA was isolated from sperm using commercial kit NucleoSpin Tissue and used in order to estimate LGB genotypes by means of PCR RFLP method and high resolution melting analysis (HRMA).

40|$|Base {{economic}} characteristics (total revenues, total costs, {{profit and}} profitability ratio) of the Slovak <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> were calculated in this study. Under the actual production {{and economic conditions}} of the breed, production system is operated with loss (- 457 € per cow and per year) and with negative profitability ratio (- 20 %). Optimisation of the production parameters on the level defined in the breed standard (5, 200 kg milk per cow and year, 92 % for conception rate of cows, 404 days of calving interval and 550 g in daily gain of reared heifers) and improved udder health traits (clinical mastitis incidence and somatic cells score) was of {{positive impact on the}} total revenues (+ 34 %), on the effective utilisation of costs (+ 105 %) and balanced profit of dairy systems. Next to the positive profitability of the system, higher quality and security of dairy milk products should be mentioned there. Moreover, direct subsidies as an important factor of positive economic result of dairy cattle systems has to be pointed as well. Subsidies should be provided to compensate the real biological limitation of the local breed farmed in marginal areas. However, improvement of the production parameters of the Slovak <b>Pinzgau</b> <b>breed</b> is recommended with the same attention to reach the economic sustainability of dairy production system. To reach economic sustainability of the breed from practical point of view, the farmer activity should be aimed especially to the enhanced herd management...|$|E
