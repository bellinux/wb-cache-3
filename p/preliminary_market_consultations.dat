40|$|This report {{highlights}} {{the results of}} the HNSciCloud Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) Open <b>Market</b> <b>Consultation</b> (OMC), which took place on 17 March 2016 at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. The OMC was preceded by a preparatory workshop on 16 March during which procedures for the OMC were defined and agreed amongst the HNSciCloud collaboration board members present. The preparatory morning session consisted of presentations of the procurement, legal and technical characteristics of the tender, while the afternoon session was dedicated to processing these characteristics into requirements, which were in turn grouped into use cases. Task 2. 1 “Open Market Consultation” aims at verifying the market readiness to meet the procurement needs through an open dialogue that broaches the views of the market about the intended scope. The results of this open <b>market</b> <b>consultation</b> have been duly taken into account to define the tender specifications, and filled the gap between state-of-the art industry developments and procurement needs, thus justifying the need to procure R&D services. CERN, as project coordinator and leader of work package 2, applied through a management and technology consulting company[4], a unique methodology in order to identify the most appropriate use-cases and evaluation criteria to be used for this PCP project, based on an evaluation of risk (on the supply-side) and value (on the demand-side). This consultancy resulted in the production of the following outputs: 	 	Main use cases prioritized 	 	 	Reference architecture for the prototype refined 	 	 	Value-Risk matrix mapped based on prioritized sources of risk 	 	 	Evaluation criteria for phases 1, 2 and 3 defined 	 The Open <b>Market</b> <b>Consultation</b> event brought together over 40 European cloud service providers.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{business}} potential of open government {{data in the}} domain of mobility. Open data is often touted as the go-to policy for government to pursue, but the actual returns of following such a strategy remain somewhat illusive and anecdotic. Based on a research project subsidised by the Flemish Department of Mobility and Public Works, this paper presents the results of a <b>market</b> <b>consultation</b> with diverse stakeholders. The goal is to better understand the attitudes, bottlenecks, expectations and requirements related to open data of market stakeholders, so that the government can devise strategies that support sustainable open data initiatives and its policy goals at the same time. The paper offers a framework towards analysing this. It concludes that structural and iterative dialogue is desirable, both {{from the perspective of the}} market and government, but that this perhaps obvious key component is often overlooked...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the return of investment and profitability of a bio-gasification facility using a modeling method. Based on <b>preliminary</b> <b>market</b> analysis, the results determined that the power facilities driven by biomass gasifiers could be profitable if they consider the most sensitive cost factors such as labor, project investment, and feedstock supply. The result showed that economic feasibility of bio-gasification facility can significantly affect by its production capacity and operating modes (one shift, two shifts, or three shifts). The cost analysis modeling approach developed in this study could be a good approach for economic analysis of bio-syngas and bio-fuel products. In addition, this study demonstrated a unique modeling approach to analyze return of investment and profitability of biofuels production...|$|R
