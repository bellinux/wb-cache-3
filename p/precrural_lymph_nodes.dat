The distribution of 141 lesions in lymph nodes of slaughtered and live sheep was 50. 4 % in prescapular, 14. 9 % in parotid, 11. 3 % in precrural, 5. 7 % in mandibular, 3. 5 % in supramammary, 0. 7 % in mediastinal, and 0. 7 % in mesenteric lymph nodes. Lesions {{in other parts of the}} body were 11. 3 % subcutaneous abscesses, 0. 7 % abscess in a liver, and 0. 7 % abscess in lung. The distribution of 44 lesions in lymph nodes of live and slaughtered goats was 43. 2 % in prescapular, 27. 3 % in parotid, 11. 4 % in mandibular and 9. 1 % in <b>precrural</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> In other parts 9. 1 % subcutaneous abscesses were noted in goats. Mass culture of a local strain of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis CP 41 N was obtained using IBT bioreactor at pH 8, temperature 31 ℃ and dilution rate of 0. 02 h - 1. The harvest was used to prepare five types of v vaccines; The first a cell wall vaccine containing 6 mg/ 1 ml of protein, the second a whole cell vaccine containing 16 mg/ 1 ml of bacterial dry weight, the third a toxoid vaccine containing 8 mg/ 1 ml of protein the fourth a cell wall + toxoid vaccine (6 mg/ 1 ml+ 8 mg/ 1 ml) and the fifth a whole cell + toxoid vaccine (16 mg/ 1 ml + 8 mg/ 1 ml). Saponin and aluminum hydroxide adjuvants were added in a concenteration of 1 mg/ 1 ml to each of the different vaccines. A dose of 0. 5 ml from the three first vaccines and of 1 ml from the fourth and fifth ones were injected subcutaneously to each one of 5 groups of sheep of 7 animals, and a sixth group was left as unvaccinated control. All animals were bled at weekly intervals. After one month a booster doses of the vaccines were given to the animals which were bled weekly for serological monitoring by the agglutination test. All animals were challenged subcutaneously with 5. 1 X 10 8 CFU Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis CP 41 N one month after the second dose of vaccine. The animals were then slaughtered one month later to determine the number of abscesses in the carcasses. The results showed that the vaccine which consisted of whole cells + toxoid was the best of the five vaccines with a significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in mean abscesses numbers in vaccinated animals after challenge with C. pseudotuberculosis. The percentage of protection of the group vaccinated with the whole cell+ toxoid was 75 % vi compared with 32. 3 %, 37. 5 %, 37. 5 % and 45. 3 % for the groups vaccinated with cell wall, whole cell, toxoid and the cell wall + toxoid vaccines, respectively Sixty- six isolates of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis from the sheep and goats were tested for their sensitivity to 16 antimicrobial agents. The isolates were found highly sensitive to nitrofurantoin, chloramphenicol, rifampacin, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, and ampicillin. Moderately sensitive to methicillin, kanamycin, gentamycin and tetracycline, but were resistant to nalidixic acid, colistin, novobiocin, penicillin, cloxacillin and streptomycin. PCR technique was used to examine 28 of the local isolates of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis using the primer targeting the 16 S rRNA gene. The results showed homogeneity of the isolates with the molecular size of this gene. The study showed that caseous lymphadenitis is prevalent in South Darfur State, which is an important area for sheep production in the country.

Methods: There are 10 patients, which they had stomach cancer involved in the study. As {{a result of this}} study before and during the cancer surgery, they had resectable cancer and they did not involve any <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> clinically. In all patients the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> or <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> marked with radio nucleoid scan and the biopsy of the sentinel lymph nodeand lymphatic dissection done in standard way, then the patient put under the gastrectomy. At last, the pathology result of the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and other <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> have been compared and the concordance of them have been analysed. Results: Tumor location in 7 cases was in lesser curvature, one in greater curvature, one in antrum and one in EG junction. In 9 cases the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was against to the tumor in pregastric area, in one case of GE junction tumor, the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was in the hilum of spleen, and only in one case there was skip metastasis.

The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to determine how often a sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is visualized by lymphoscintigraphy in breast carcinoma patients, how often the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is identified during surgery, and the sensitivity of these procedures to identify the presence of axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis. METHODS. A total of 136 patients were enrolled in 2 hospitals. Preoperative dynamic and static lymphoscintigraphy were performed; in addition, both a vital dye and a gamma detection probe were used intraoperatively. The tracers were injected into the primary lesion. Sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy was followed by completion axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection. The sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and other axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were examined routinely and by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS. A sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was visualized by lymphoscintigraphy in 118 patients (87 %). During the operation a sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was localized in 126 patients (93 %). A total of 224 sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were harvested (average of 1. 7 and range of 1 - 4 sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> per patient). Of all the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> 37 were blue (17 %), 68 were radioactive (30 %), and 119 were both blue and radioactive (53 %). The sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> contained metastatic disease in 56 patients (44 %). Three sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsies were false-negative (sensitivity 95 %). CONCLUSIONS, Sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy after intralesional tracer administration and intraoperative use of both a gamma detection probe and a vital dye is a reliable technique for staging the axilla of breast carcinoma patients.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} lymphotoxin (LT) and TNF {{function in}} <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> genesis and cellular organization by manipulating LTβ-R and TNF-R signaling. <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> developed in LTα−/− mice treated in utero with agonist anti-LTβ-R monoclonal antibody. Thus, LTβ-R signaling mediates <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> genesis. Surprisingly, mucosal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> that can develop independently of LTαβ/LTβ-R interaction were generated. Normal mice treated in utero with LTβ-R-Ig and TNF-R 55 -Ig or anti-TNF lacked all <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> indicating that TNF signaling contributes to <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> genesis. <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> generated in LTα−/− mice had disrupted cellular organization. Therefore, LTβ-R signaling during gestation {{is not sufficient}} to establish normal cellular microarchitecture. We conclude that LT and TNF play critical roles in the genesis and cellular organization of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} multicenter {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the feasibility and negative predictive value of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> detection with blue dye in vulvar carcinoma patients. METHODS: In patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva without suspicious groin <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> patent blue V was injected intradermally shortly before surgery. Routine groin <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection and radical vulvectomy were performed. During the surgery, blue lymph vessels and <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were identified, and the blue <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were sent separately for histologic examination. The negative predictive value of the blue <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> for the absence of metastases was assessed by histologic examination of the groin <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> specimens. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients in whom 93 groin <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissections were performed were entered. One or more blue <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were detected in only 52 groins (56 %). Nine (17 %) of these were tumor positive, and 6 blue <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were the only tumor positive <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in the specimen in which they were found. There were two false-negative blue <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The negative predictive value was 0. 953. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown in this multicenter study that sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> detection in vulvar carcinoma patients with blue dye only is not feasible because its negative predictive value is too low. Further studies involving the use of a combination of radioactive labeled technetium and blue dye are warrante...|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{assessment}} of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases, several studies excluded <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> smaller than 5 mm, leading to selection bias. Node-by-node correlations between preoperative MRI and histopathological specimens present another problem. <b>Lymph</b> <b>node</b> position is generally labelled according to <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> region, which limits the correlation between suspicious MRI findings and histopathological samples. In addition, {{the small size of}} some <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> makes it difficult to precisely position a region of interest in order to measure, for example, ADC in a single <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b>|$|R
