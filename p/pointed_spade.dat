5000|$|Square foot spades: {{this type}} has square feet, a square crutch, and a central {{line on the}} obverse. The reverse {{normally}} has only three lines apart from on spades produced by some mints {{in the state of}} Zhao, who also produced <b>pointed</b> foot <b>spades.</b> These have numerals on the reverse. The mints that produced square foot spades are more numerous than those that produced the <b>pointed</b> foot <b>spades.</b> Their weights are compatible with the half jin denomination. They are associated with the states of Han, Zhao, Liang, Zhou, and Yan. They are found in the provinces of Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Zhejiang. The type is contemporary, along with the <b>pointed</b> foot <b>spades.</b> Some mints issued both types, and the two are found together in hoards.|$|R
5000|$|Shape is used {{to denote}} the <b>pointed</b> (diamonds and <b>spades,</b> which {{visually}} have a sharp point uppermost) versus rounded (hearts and clubs) suits.|$|R
50|$|For four-color decks, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the red/black distinction could be replaced by pointed bottoms (hearts and diamonds visually have a sharp <b>point</b> downwards, whereas <b>spades</b> and clubs have a blunt stem).|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{have played}} here {{years and years}} and years, and there are only the gulls and terns and cormorants, and that!" [...] She <b>pointed</b> with her <b>spade</b> towards the broken water.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} of {{widespread}} introduction of four-color decks, {{it has been suggested}} that the red/black distinction could be replaced by pointed bottoms (hearts and diamonds visually have a sharp <b>point</b> downwards, whereas <b>spades</b> and clubs have a blunt stem).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Chuzzlewit! Can I {{believe my}} eyes! My dear sir; my good sir! A joyful hour, a happy hour indeed. Pray, my dear sir, walk in. You find {{me in my}} garden-dress. You will excuse it, I know. It is an ancient pursuit, gardening. Primitive, my dear sir. Or, if I am not mistaken, Adam {{was the first of}} our calling. MY Eve, I grieve to say is no more, sir; but'--here he <b>pointed</b> to his <b>spade,</b> and shook his head as if he were not cheerful without an effort--'but I {{do a little bit of}} Adam still.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{courtyard}} is a 24 x 24 m square, with two-story {{houses with}} slate four-sided hip roofs in the angles. The right-hand house {{still has a}} pigeon loft, and the ground floor has a well-preserved fireplace. Between these two houses, a wall supports a succession of surmounted cylindrical bars with <b>spaded</b> <b>points.</b> Two stone pillars, finished by a ballot box, support the grids of the entry. A stone alley leads to the castle. On its line is a fountain with water that comes out a head of a watery god. The whole is overcome by a large urn.|$|R
50|$|Flat-handled spade {{money does}} not have the hollow handle of the early spades. Nearly all have {{distinct}} legs, suggesting that their pattern was influenced by the <b>pointed</b> shoulder hollow-handled <b>spades</b> with further styling for easy handling. They are generally smaller and sometimes have denominations specified in their inscriptions in addition to place names. In combination with the little evidence of establishment dates of some mint towns, flat-handled spade money could have been a later development. Archaeological evidence dates them to the Warring States period (475 to 221 BC). Arched foot spades have an alloy consisting of about 80% copper; for other types the copper content varies between 40% and 70%.|$|R
60|$|They {{had come}} up on the grassy scalp of the hill, {{one of the few}} bald spots that stood clear of the {{crashing}} and roaring pine forest. A mean enclosure, partly timber and partly wire, rattled in the tempest to tell them the border of the graveyard. But by the time Inspector Craven had come to the corner of the grave, and Flambeau had planted his <b>spade</b> <b>point</b> downwards and leaned on it, they were both almost as shaken as the shaky wood and wire. At the foot of the grave grew great tall thistles, grey and silver in their decay. Once or twice, when a ball of thistledown broke under the breeze and flew past him, Craven jumped slightly {{as if it had been}} an arrow.|$|R
5000|$|Pointed foot spades: {{this type}} has pointed feet and a square crutch. The {{shoulders}} can be pointing upwards or straight. They are a clear {{descendant of the}} <b>pointed</b> shoulder hollow-handled <b>spade.</b> The weight {{and size of the}} larger specimens is compatible with the one jin unit of the arched foot flat-handled spades. Smaller specimens can often specify the unit as a half jinor one jin (less frequent), but frequently do not specify a unit. This seems to imply that the half jin unit became the norm. They are associated with the State of Zhao and are usually found in Shanxi and Hebei provinces. They frequently have numerals on the reverse side. The two-character mint names mean that the cities that cast these coins can be identified with more certainty than those of earlier series.|$|R
2500|$|After the gun {{was placed}} in a firing {{position}} with the gun pointing in the desired direction, the trails were lowered to the ground and the limber was removed. The carriage wheels would then be raised using built-in ratcheting screw-jacks, lowering the gun carriage to the ground. Once on the ground, the limber-end of the trail legs were separated to form a wide [...] "vee" [...] with its apex {{at the center of the}} carriage pivot <b>point.</b> A recoil <b>spade</b> at the limber-end of each trail leg required a correctly positioned hole to be dug for the spade, which was attached to the trail end, to transmit the recoil from gun carriage through the trails and into the earth. This made the gun very stable and assisted its accuracy. [...] The removable spades were transported in brackets on the trail legs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hate," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply. [...] "It's twenty years since, and I've {{a kind of}} craving to see him that much older. There's hate and love, you know, David. They're both writ of here. But I tell you it's hate that lasts the longest. Love is like my flowers. Look at them--my tall hollyhocks, my bush roses, my {{snapdragon}} there. They blossom and they fade, and they lie dead--who knows where? And in the spring they come again, or something like them. And hate," [...] he went on, <b>pointing</b> to a <b>spade</b> which lay propped against the paling, [...] "is like that lump of metal. It's here winter and summer alike. It doesn't change, it doesn't die; there's no heat would melt it. It was there last year, it's there to-day, it will be there to-morrow." ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{requests}} {{me now to}} {{open the}} lantern, which I do, and the light streams out upon the wet sod. At last divining his proceedings I say that I had no idea, in keeping the tryst, {{that he was going}} to do more at such an unusual time than meet me for a meditative ramble through the stronghold. I ask him why, having a practicable object, he should have minded interruptions and not have chosen the day? He informs me, quietly <b>pointing</b> to his <b>spade,</b> that it was because his purpose is to dig, then signifying with a grim nod the gaunt notice-post against the sky beyond. I inquire why, as a professed and well-known antiquary with capital letters at the tail of his name, he did not obtain the necessary authority, considering the stringent penalties for this sort of thing; and he chuckles fiercely again with suppressed delight, and says, 'Because they wouldn't have given it!' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{cards are}} dealt {{as shown in}} the bridge hand diagram; North is the dealer and starts the auction which {{proceeds}} {{as shown in the}} bidding table.As neither North nor East have sufficient strength to open the bidding, they each pass, denying such strength. South, next in turn, opens with the bid of 1, which denotes a reasonable heart suit (at least 4 or 5 cards long, depending on the bidding system) and at least 12 high card points. On this hand, South has 14 high card points. West overcalls with 1, since he has a long spade suit of reasonable quality and 10 high card points (an overcall can be made on a hand that is not quite strong enough for an opening bid). North supports partner's suit with 2, showing heart support and about 6-8 <b>points.</b> East supports <b>spades</b> with 2. South inserts a game try of 3, inviting the partner to bid the game of 4 with good club support and overall values. North complies, as North is at the higher end of the range for his 2 bid, and has a fourth trump (the 2 bid promised only three), and the doubleton queen of clubs to fit with partner's strength there. (North could instead have bid 3, indicating not enough strength for game, asking South to pass and so play 3.) ...|$|R
