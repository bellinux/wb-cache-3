5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E

25|$|He {{started his}} anti-fascist {{activities}} soon after, while integrating the cultural working class associations of his hometown in the 1960s. In that period he {{made contact with}} the strong clandestine organization that the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> had {{in the suburbs of}} Lisbon, where he, being one of the few able to read, used to read the illegal communist newspaper Avante!, in secrecy, for the other workers. He would later formalize his membership, right after the Carnation Revolution, in 1974.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{presented as}} a general consensus that the colonies {{were a part of}} the national unity, closer to overseas provinces than to true colonies. The communists were the first party to oppose the official view, since they saw the Portuguese presence in the colonies as an act against the colonies' right to self determination. During its 5th Congress, in 1957, the illegal <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Comunista Português - PCP) was the first political organization to demand the immediate and total independence of the colonies.|$|E
25|$|PIDE is {{considered}} by many authors as being one of the most functional and effective secret services in history. Using a wide network of covert cells, which were spread throughout Portugal and its overseas territories, PIDE had infiltrated agents into almost every underground movement, including the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> as well as the independence movements in Angola and Mozambique. The PIDE encouraged citizens - the so-called bufos (snitches) - to denounce suspicious activities, through the use of monetary and prestige incentives. This resulted in an extremely effective espionage service which was able to fully control almost every aspect of Portuguese daily life.|$|E

25|$|Under colonial law, black Angolans were {{forbidden}} from forming political parties or labour unions. The first nationalist movements {{did not take}} root until after World War II, spearheaded by a largely Westernised, Portuguese-speaking urban class which included many mestiços. During the early 1960s {{they were joined by}} other associations stemming from ad hoc labour activism in the rural workforce. Portugal's refusal to address increasing Angolan demands for self-determination provoked an armed conflict which erupted in 1961 with the Baixa de Cassanje revolt and gradually evolved into a protracted war of independence that persisted for the next twelve years. Throughout the conflict, three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the Portuguese government and local forces, supported to varying degrees by the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parallel to {{the conference}} preparations, the Italian Communist Party {{organized}} two bilateral events with its two main Eurocommunist counterparts; {{a meeting with the}} Communist Party of Spain in Livorno in July 1975 and a summit with the French Communist Party in Rome in the summer 1976. The Eurocommunists were not a solid bloc, and sharp differences between the parties were manifested during the preparatory process. The French party, whilst criticizing the lack of civil liberties in the Soviet Union, was hesitant to give up proletarian internationalism for the concept of international solidarity proposed by the Italians. Differences on how to analyze the situation in Portugal following the Carnation Revolution divided the French and Italian parties. The French voiced their support for the strategy of the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> whilst the Italians publicly criticized the Portuguese party.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, {{with the}} {{replacement}} of António de Oliveira Salazar by Marcelo Caetano, the Estado Novo-controlled nation got a very slight taste of democracy, such as permission to rebuild a democratic Labour Union movement. José Afonso joined the movement and supported it by all the means he could; he also {{took part in the}} second wave of student rebellion against the regime in Coimbra, an important university town. He released the album Contos Velhos Rumos Novos and the single Menina dos Olhos Tristes which contains the popular song Canta Camarada (Sing, Sing, Comrade!) which was almost adopted by the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> as an unofficial anthem. He received the award for best album that year, and again in 1970 and 1971. For the first time on a Zeca album, an instrument other than the guitar was used. His fourth and last son, Pedro, was born.|$|E

500|$|The CPC {{continues}} to have relations with non-ruling communist and workers' parties and attends international communist conferences, most notably the International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties. Delegates of foreign communist parties still visit China; in 2013, for instance, the General Secretary of the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCP), Jeronimo de Sousa, personally met with Liu Qibao, {{a member of the}} Central Politburo. In another instance, Pierre Laurent, the National Secretary of the French Communist Party (FCP), met with Liu Yunshan, a Politburo Standing Committee member. In 2014 Xi Jinping, the CPC general secretary, personally met with Gennady Zyuganov, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), to discuss party-to-party relations. While the CPC retains contact with major parties such as the PCP, FCP, the CPRF, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, the Communist Party of Brazil, the Communist Party of Nepal and the Communist Party of Spain, the party retains relations with minor communist and workers' parties, such as the Communist Party of Australia, the Workers Party of Bangladesh, the Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist–Leninist) (Barua), the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, the Workers' Party of Belgium, the Hungarian Workers' Party, the Dominican Workers' Party and the Party for the Transformation of Honduras, for instance. In recent years, noting the self-reform of the European social democratic movement in the 1980s and 1990s, the CPC [...] "has noted the increased marginalization of West European communist parties." ...|$|E

50|$|Maoist {{movements}} in Portugal were very active during the 1970s, {{especially during the}} Carnation Revolution {{that led to the}} fall of the fascist government the Estado Novo in 1974. The largest Maoist movement in Portugal was the <b>Portuguese</b> Workers' <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> The party was among the most active resistance movements before the Portuguese democratic revolution of 1974, especially among students of Lisbon. After the revolution, the MRPP achieved fame for its large and highly artistic mural paintings. It was intensely active during 1974 and 1975. At that time, the party had members that later came to be very important in national politics. For example, a future Prime Minister of Portugal, José Manuel Durão Barroso was active within Maoist {{movements in}} Portugal and identified as a Maoist.|$|R

The <b>Portuguese</b> <b>communist</b> secretary-general Álvaro Cunhal was one of few political leaders from western Europe to have supported the invasion for being counter-revolutionary. along with the Luxembourg party and conservative factions of the Greek party.|$|R
50|$|In {{many other}} {{capitalist}} countries, struggles against dictatorships, state repression, and colonisation were also marked by protests in 1968, {{such as the}} beginning of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Tlatelolco massacre in Mexico City, and the escalation of guerrilla warfare against the military dictatorship in Brazil. Countries governed by <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> had protests against bureaucratic and military elites. In Eastern Europe there were widespread protests that escalated particularly in the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia. In response, USSR occupied Czechoslovakia. The occupation was denounced by the Italian and French <b>Communist</b> <b>parties,</b> and the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Finland.
