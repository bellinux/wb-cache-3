40|$|As {{the closing}} phase of product {{development}} projects, the product introduction process significantly influences {{the time to}} market and product quality. The rapid launching of new products to market aids manufacturing companies in avoiding crucial consequences, such as a loss of market share and revenue and the early obsolescence of products in a globalized market. Therefore, the characteristics and influential factors of the product introduction process must be identified to facilitate the management of new product development projects and to maintain competitiveness for manufacturing companies. The management and support of product introduction processes in low-volume manufacturing industries require solutions that are tailored to the characteristics and requirements of these industries. However, studies {{on the characteristics of}} low-volume manufacturing industries and their influence on the product introduction process are limited. Therefore, the objective of the research presented in this thesis is to develop knowledge about product introduction process and its facilitators in low-volume manufacturing industries by focusing on characteristics of products and production systems in these industries. To fulfil this objective, the characteristics of low-volume manufacturing industries and their influence on the product introduction process were investigated via literature reviews and a multiple-case study. In addition, the facilitators of the product introduction process in low-volume manufacturing industries were examined. A case study was performed, comprising two longitudinal real-time cases and two retrospective cases, all within one Swedish company. The characteristics of low-volume products and production systems are studied in this research. The identified influences of these characteristics on the product introduction process include few engineering prototypes, limited and uncertain numbers of <b>pre-series</b> <b>productions</b> and the infeasibility of conventional production ramp-up. Other identified influences include the modification of existing products instead of the development of entirely new products, the use of existing production systems with slight modifications for new products, a high frequency of introducing new products, and an extensive focus on the functionality of products instead of their manufacturability. Finally, the utilization of knowledge and experiences from the development and production of prior similar products was identified as a potential facilitator of the product introduction process in low-volume manufacturing industries. A process was suggested to support the product introduction process in low-volume manufacturing industries in gathering, sharing and using knowledge and experiences from the production of prior similar products. This process can compensate for the lack of opportunities to test and refine products and production systems during the product introduction process in low-volume manufacturing industries. ...|$|R
40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{is under}} {{construction}} at CERN. Most of its 27 km underground tunnel will be filled with superconducting magnets, mainly 15 m long dipoles and 3. 3 m long quadrupoles. In total 1248 dipole and 400 quadrupole magnets will be built (including spares), all wound with copper stabilized NbTi Rutherford cables and designed to operate in superfluid helium at 1. 9 K. The dipoles operative field is 8. 3 T, the system being designed for possible operation up to 9 T (ultimate field). The <b>pre-series</b> dipole <b>production</b> has started in 2000 in three companies while the series dipole construction will {{start at the beginning}} of 2003. As far as quadrupoles are concerned, the prototypal phase (carried out at CEA - Saclay, F) is followed directly by the series construction, started in March 2002. In the paper the magnet main characteristics are reviewed and the special tooling, put in place to fulfill the mass production with the suitable accuracy and safety margin, is described. The results obtained on the first fifteen pre-series magnets as well as the effect of the corrective actions taken to meet the necessary field quality are discussed. Finally a realistic plan of the Project, foreseeing that last dipoles are delivered in summer 2006, is presented...|$|R
40|$|The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) {{experiment}} {{will explore}} the phase diagram of strongly interacting {{matter in the}} region of high net baryonic densities. The matter at these extreme conditions will be produced and studied in heavy-ion collisions with a fixed target set-up. The present work is dedicated to the main component of the CBM experiment - the Silicon Tracking System (STS). The STS comprises of 8 tracking stations with 1292 double sided silicon microstrip sensors. The STS has to enable the reconstruction of up to 1000 charged particle tracks per nucleus-nucleus interaction at the rate of up to 10 MHz, provide a momentum resolution of Δp/p = 1 %, and withstand the radiation load of up to 1 x 1014 neq/cm 2 (neq — radiation dose of 1 MeV neutron equivalent). Self-triggering read-out electronics will be located {{on the periphery of the}} detecting planes, and connected to the sensors with low mass micro-cables. During the R&D phase, as well as in the <b>pre-series</b> and series <b>production</b> phase, the characterization of the sensors, of the front-end electronics and of the complete detector modules has to be performed. It is evident that characterization of more than 1000 silicon microstrip sensors and later of complete detector modules is very time-consuming, and may even damage the objects if not performed carefully. One of the goals of this work was to develop a systematic procedure for the quality assurance for the double-sided silicon microstrip sensors. This includes static optical inspection and visual tests, passive electrical test (such as leakage current, bulk capacitance, inter-strip capacitance & resistances, bias resistance and coupling capacitance), radiation hardness and long-term stability. A strategy for the quality assurance of these sensors is presented, defining the various tests to be performed and the documentation of the results. The techniques and quality assurance criteria will be applied for the <b>pre-series</b> and series <b>production.</b> With decreasing feature size and increase in functionality and structures, the classical mechanical probe approach for internal fault detection and functional testing faces increasing challenges. In the field of silicon based chips and sensors there is rarely any analysis on the topic of non-invasive or contact-less probing and characterization, despite the fact that the contact-less probing is becoming more and more important as the fabrication technologies become smaller and more susceptible to the parasitic impact of mechanical probes. The silicon micro-strip double sided sensors used in STS have a complex structure, such as 1024 metal electrodes, 2048 bias resistors, 2048 DC pads and 4098 AC pads for probing, several guard rings, and even more in the 6. 2 cm x 6. 2 cm prototype sensor. Photo-intrusive technique is the best solution for the characterization and investigation of crucial parameters related to the detector operation and its functionality. A photo-intrusive probing is a method in which a non-invasive pulsed laser of a desired wavelength is used to inject the photon into the bulk and resulting in electron-hole pairs (e-h). In a completely depleted silicon sensor the charge injected (or generated) by the pulsed laser beam could be detected as current and shall be used for characterization. A non-invasive contact-less Laser Test System (LTS) was developed based on a pulsed laser to investigate properties of the silicon sensors. The set-up is able to inject charge locally and scan sensors(or detector modules) with a pulsed infra-red laser driven by a step motor. The LTS is designed to measure sensor response in an automatized procedure at several thousand positions across the sensor with focused infra-red laser light (spot size = 12 μm, wavelength = 1060 nm). The duration (10 ns) and power (5 mW) of the laser pulses are selected such that the absorption of the laser light in the 300 μm thick silicon sensors produces a number of about 24000 electrons, which is similar to the charge created by the minimum ionizing particles (MIP) in these sensors. The set-up was used to developed characterization procedures to determine the charge sharing between strips, and to measure a qualitative uniformity of the sensor response over the whole active area. The prototype sensors which are tested with the set-up are small prototype sensors (256 strips, pitch = 50 μm on each side) and full-size detector modules (1024 strips/side and pitch = 58 μm). They are read-out using a self-triggering prototype read-out electronic ASIC called n-XYTER. Laser scans for amplitude response, charge sharing in the inter-strip region, and spot-size determination technique are reported. For the verification of the some design parameters, unique methods of determining coupling capacitance, and inter-strip capacitance have been developed. The modules were also tested with proton beams, and the charge sharing in the inter-strip region has been compared to the laser test results...|$|R

There were insufficient aircraft to fully replace the Bf 110, so it remained in service {{until the end}} of the war. In the wake of the failure of the Me 210, the Bf 110G was designed. Fitted with the DB 605B engines, producing 1,085 kW (1,475 PS) in [...] "War Emergency" [...] setting, and 997 kW (1,355 PS) at 5.8 km (19,000 ft) altitude, the Bf 110G also underwent some changes which improved the aerodynamics of the aircraft, as well as upgrading the nose armament and moving the rear cockpit access forward from the transversely-hinged, [...] "tilt-open" [...] rearmost canopy glazing (which was changed to a differently framed fixed section) to a side/top hinged opening section of the main canopy, opening to port, with a new rearmost framed glazing section fixed in place. No Bf 110 G-1 existed, as the Bf 110 G-2 became the baseline Bf 110G and was fitted with a large number of Rüstsätze field conversion packs, making the G subtype the most versatile production version of the Bf 110.

40|$|The coil end spacers play an {{important}} role in the performance of superconducting coils, as their shape and location determine the mechanical stability of the conductors in the coil ends (and hence the overall coil training performance) and the local field quality. The dipole end spacers are often of a size and a geometry difficult to be industrially series manufactured and measured. Efficiency of the production and related costs are a key issue to achieve the required production rate of the LHC main dipoles at an affordable price. For the latter reasons, a design approach integrating state-of-the-art CAD/CAM optimization techniques allowing to considerably decrease design and machining time was implemented.

In both cases, measurements are split in straight part average, variations and coil ends contributions. Two different alarm levels exist in case the measured field is out of limits. The analysis can be carried out at the manufacturer and allows detection of anomalies in the measured magnetic field. These can be either due to wrong measurements or caused by assembly defects. Techniques used to work out information on the magnet assembly from the field harmonics are outlined.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide the {{necessary}} mechanical aperture for the LHC beam, the main dipole cold masses have to match precisely the nominal circular trajectory of the particles beam. The requirements on the dipole cold mass geometry are dictated by the LHC beam optics and by the allowed limits of mechanical deformation of the interconnection bellows.

40|$|The aim is {{to explore}} {{challenges}} related to the integration between product development and production in product introduction and, given these challenges, to analyse the learning potential of boundary crossing {{in the context of}} product introduction. The paper draws on evidence from a Swedish manufacturing company. The theoretical framework is based on a boundary-crossing perspective, which in turn is framed by a workplace learning perspective. Data were collected through interviews with 19 employees from the product development department and 21 employees from the production plant, and 8 focus-group interviews. Within the company, there were many challenges related to product introduction, but the findings also show these challenges can provide learning opportunities by enabling the boundaries to be crossed between the product development department and the production plant. Several forms of intrapersonal or interpersonal boundary crossing were identified. Individuals acted as brokers, and prototypes, pre-series, DfA analysis and a crossfunctional team served as boundary objects and encounters. Nothing in our study indicates that the boundary crossing identified on the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels created learning potentials on the organisational level in the company. The conclusion is {{that it is necessary to}} consider the learning potential made available by boundary crossing in order to support learning, and thereby improve the integration between product development and production in product introduction. By seeing and using prototypes and <b>pre-series</b> <b>production</b> as learning opportunities you can create a better preparedness and provide collective access to knowledge required for successful product introduction.

Due {{to changes in}} the organization there are shortcomings in terms of processes for feedback from the production back to the engineering organization. Physical Integration is responsible for the design and industrialization of interior and exterior products. Product engineers at the department need to take part of improvements and lessons learned that can be made in the initial <b>pre-series</b> <b>production</b> phase. During the execution of the thesis Physical Integration developed products for the C 30 project, a metro train for Stockholm subway. The aim of the thesis is to achieve processes with continuous improvements so that Physical Integration can take part of feedback from the production in a structured way, in order to become a learning organization. Data was collected with qualitative research through interviews, observation and documentation. Main takeaways was that engineers needs to be more involved in the production to gain experience and the process for problem solving has to be documented with focus on the cause of problems. A comparison between theory and data analyzed the subjects of improvements & lessons learned, engineering involvement in production, standardization of problem solving and the staffing at Physical Integration. Solutions focus on the mindset needed for a learning organization and a new process for problem solving. The research questions can be answered through a number of concluding remarks: Physical Integration needs permanent staffing that participate in problem solving in the production. Problem solving with the proposed process ensures documentation and identification of causes. Together, these two sources of experience and documentation create a base of knowledge for engineering and methods department to review projects and have input to upcoming projects.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{systems have}} evolved drastically bringing {{the technology to}} the spotlight of manufacturing digitalization. Incremental technology improvements allow new possibilities in manufacturing, unlocking a number of serious applications. However, there are still gaps between the technological projections and the practical constrains of the technology. In this regard, research based on case studies is helping firms to evaluate factors for technology adoption. With this in mind, the purpose in this research is to advance on AM direct digital applications and its integration with secondary processes in order to drive the technology to industrialization. This dissertation is built upon four interrelated case studies. The scientific contribution is grounded on cross case analysis and mixed methods for research. This aided to link industry relevant applications with academic research methods to finally construct new knowledge on strategic, operational, technical and environmental factors for AM implementation. Results show that direct digital manufacturing of low volume plastic structural components are feasible, when geometrical and mechanical requirement are meet. Especially in <b>pre-series</b> <b>production</b> and highly customizable components. Nevertheless, parts will often require secondary manufacturing operations. Besides, the need for removal of support structures, secondary operations are implemented to obtain engineering specifications. Results in this regard show that hybrid processes can be combined and automated to create parts with tight geometrical and dimensional requirements. However, its environmental feasibility {{is dependent on the}} material volume removal ratio subtracted from the initial stock. AM systems are not always intrinsically at disadvantage in medium and high volume production industries. Factors such as geometry variability and the elimination of tooling reduces upfront cost prevalent on conventional methods manuafcturing. Nevertheless, AM systems are still in the industrialization process that require integration with conventional manufacturing methods for secondary operations. To this end, future research and development activities should take a holistic perspective considering multiple factor for technology transfer. During the coming years firms will need to look at their legacy products to identify potential benefits of AM implementation with a life cycle perspective. However, the big opportunities are yet to come when technology improves and additive methods are taken into consideration early in the design stages as a manufacturing solution. ...|$|E
