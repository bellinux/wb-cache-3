5|$|In September York {{arrived from}} Ireland, {{and at the}} {{parliament}} of October that year, the duke {{walked up to the}} throne and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York's plans, though it is assumed that this had been agreed upon between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 31October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.|$|E
5|$|Pressure high up {{the pitch}} from Barcelona kept Manchester United {{in their own}} half, forcing them into {{attempting}} long balls downfield. A scrappy few moments {{in and around the}} centre circle followed, but Manchester United eventually came away with the ball. However, a lapse in communication between Giggs and Evra on the left wing allowed Eto'o to steal in and advance on the Manchester United goal. He cut in from the right wing and played a through-ball just out of reach of Messi, who went to ground after O'Shea had <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Messi's shoulder. A period of sustained pressure from Barcelona followed, culminating with a run from Iniesta, who could only be stopped by a foul from Tevez {{on the edge of the}} Manchester United penalty area. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who curled the ball around the defensive wall and onto the post with Van der Sar beaten.|$|E
5|$|At that time, Antoine had {{a student}} named Martin Jeanfils, an {{employee}} at the Corbeau coal. A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment. Adjourned, The judgment was adjourned and was finally, on 21 June 1907, President Hamoir acquitted the two men, who were absent in court then. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing, claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E

Bodson drew his {{revolver}} and shot Msiri three times, and one of Msiri's men — his son Masuka — fired his musket hitting Bodson in the abdomen and spinal column. The Dahomeyan askari shot and killed Masuka, and in the general firing Hamadi was hit in the ankle.|$|E
25|$|On January 31, 2008, Branyan {{was arrested}} for {{allegedly}} assaulting his then wife, Jill. According to police accounts, officers were called to a {{parking lot of a}} police station after an officer found Jill Branyan sitting alone in her car, crying. The couple had gone to The Cowboy restaurant in Bainbridge, Ohio and reportedly argued on the way home. At some point, Russell Branyan, who was driving, allegedly <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Jill's face, causing her to have a cut lip. The force of the grab caused her to develop a swollen lip and some bleeding. When the couple entered their home, Jill's mother saw the injury and said she, Jill, and the children should leave the home for the evening and go to her house.|$|E

500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J. Thomas Burch, who accused McCain of having [...] "abandoned the veterans" [...] on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues: [...] "He came home from Vietnam and forgot us." [...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't give me that shit. And take your hands off me." ...|$|E

By this point, they had run approximately [...] {{from the car}} park. Bryant opened his door and slowed down. Mikac moved towards the car, apparently thinking he was offering them help in escaping.

Next, he fired a shot at Madeline, which hit her in the shoulder, then shot her fatally through the chest. Bryant shot twice at Alannah, as she ran behind a tree, missing. He then walked up, pressed the barrel of the gun into her neck and fired, killing her instantly.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly then {{heard the}} {{approach}} of Kennedy and Scanlan, and the four gang members concealed themselves, some behind logs, {{and one in the}} tent. They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, [...] "Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm." [...] Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went forward and said, [...] "Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded." [...] Kelly at the same time called out, [...] "Put up your hands." [...] Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for he smiled and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his revolver case. He was instantly fired at, but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, [...] "It's all right, stop it, stop it."

2500|$|The Melakans were {{described}} by European travellers as [...] "white", well-proportioned, and proud. The men normally wear cotton garments (sarongs) which cover them {{only from the}} waist down, {{but a few of}} the more distinguished wear short, silk coats, under which they carry krisses. Their women, who are olive-coloured, comely, and brunette, usually wear fine silk garments and short shirts. Nobody but the Sultan may wear yellow colours without special permission under pain of death. The faces of the natives are broad with wide noses and round eyes. Both sexes are well-mannered and devotees of all forms of refined amusement, especially music, ballads, and poetry. The rich pass life pleasantly in their country homes at Bertam which are surrounded by bountiful orchards. Most of them maintain separate establishments in the city from which they conduct their business. They take offence easily and will not permit anyone to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> their head or shoulders. Often malicious and untruthful, they take pride in their ability to wield the kris adroitly against their personal enemies. In larger engagements they fight in bands with bows and arrows, spears and krises. In their beliefs, they are devout Muslims. Their language [...] "is reported to be the most courteous and seemelie speech of all the Orient." [...] It is readily learned by foreigners, and is the lingua franca for the entire region.|$|E
2500|$|Michelle {{is furious}} when she finds out Dennis bought {{a video game}} using her credit card and so accuses her of being a {{paedophile}} and she slaps him and Louise comes home to witness Michelle calling Dennis a [...] "brat". After failing to obtain £100 from Michelle, Dennis tells Louise about Michelle and Preston's relationship, while Bex and Preston decide to make their relationship official. Louise tells Bex that Michelle and Preston are having sex but Bex refuses to believe it, but when she sees Preston <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Michelle's shoulder and Michelle flinch, Bex publicly asks {{if it is true}} that Michelle is having sex with her boyfriend. Louise reveals the truth and Martin attacks Preston and disowns Michelle. A drunk Michelle frantically tries to find Preston, getting into Phil's car having taken sleeping pills. Speeding around the square, Michelle is shocked to see Preston, who jumps out of the way of the car and as she swerves, she crashes into the chip shop where Kathy and Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) are. Michelle is rushed to hospital, where she needs an operation after rupturing her spleen. She is later discharged but is angered upon learning that Sharon has convinced Preston to return to the States. Michelle decides to return to the States but Sharon convinces her to attend the police station to be interviewed over the crash. The police say that the CPS will assess if she should be charged with an offence, confiscating her passport so she cannot leave the country.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{the next}} day, Kennedy and Scanlon {{went down to}} the creek to explore, leaving McIntyre to {{attended}} to camp duty. He fired two shots out of his fowling piece at a pair of parrots. These shots were heard by Kelly, who was on the lookout for the police. At about 5pm, McIntyre was at the fire making tea, with Lonigan by him, when they were suddenly surprised by the Kelly gang with the cry, [...] "Bail up; throw up your arms." [...] McIntyre testified that Kelly took his fowling piece, and that all the gang members were armed. (Kelly stated that only two had guns.) Having left his revolver at the tent door, McInytre held up his hands as directed. Lonigan went for cover behind a tree and, at the same time, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his revolver. Kelly shot him in the temple. He fell to the ground and said, [...] "Oh Christ, I am shot." [...] He died a few seconds later. Kelly remarked, [...] "What a pity; what made the fool run?" [...] Kelly had McIntyre searched and, when they found that he was unarmed, let him drop his hands. They took Lonigan and McIntyre's revolvers, and helped themselves to articles from the tent. Kelly talked to McIntyre and expressed his wonder that the police should have been so foolhardy as to look for him in the ranges. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of police and the description of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and told McIntyre he would kill him if he lied. McIntyre revealed their whereabouts and pleaded for their lives: ...|$|E
