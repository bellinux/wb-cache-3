By the 18th century, it was commonly <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> both colonists and native American Indians. Cabbage seeds traveled to Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet, and were planted the same year on Norfolk Island. It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the Sydney Markets.|$|E

5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Manfred Berg {{speculated that}} Washington {{probably}} murdered Fryer, but doubted that he raped her. The same year, Julie Armstrong of the University of South Florida argued that Washington was possibly innocent of both charges. Bernstein notes that Washington's motives {{have never been}} established. She also states that his confession could have been coerced, and that the murder weapon—perhaps the strongest evidence against him—could have been <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> authorities.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's Pillar (also {{known as}} the Nelson Pillar or simply the Pillar) was a large granite column capped by a statue of Horatio Nelson, built in the centre of what was then Sackville Street (later renamed O'Connell Street) in Dublin, Ireland. Completed in 1809 when Ireland {{was part of the}} United Kingdom, it survived until March 1966, when it was {{severely}} damaged by explosives <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> Irish republicans. Its remnants were later destroyed by the Irish Army.|$|E

5|$|Syrian {{government}} forces supported by Russian airstrikes recaptured Palmyra on 27 March 2016 after intense fighting against ISIL fighters. According to initial reports, {{the damage to}} the archaeological site was less extensive than anticipated, with numerous structures still standing. Following the recapture of the city, Russian de-mining teams began clearing mines <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> ISIL prior to their retreat. Following heavy fighting, ISIL reportedly reoccupied the city on 11 December 2016, prompting an offensive by the Syrian Army which retook the city on 2 March 2017.|$|E
5|$|Taliban forces took up new {{positions}} {{to defend the}} town on 9 December. Taliban sources suggested {{at the time that}} militants from nearby areas were entering the town to reinforce its defence. Fighting was on-going through the day and bombs <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> insurgents continued to take a toll on ISAF forces: an American soldier, Corporal Tanner J O'Leary of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was killed by the detonation of an improvised explosive device.|$|E

This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.|$|E

5|$|The sub-surface {{station has}} twice {{been damaged by}} explosions. On 30 October 1883, a bomb <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> Fenians campaigning for an {{independent}} Irish Republic exploded on a train near the station. The bomb damaged the train it was on and a passing train along with part of the station and the signal box. Sixty-two passengers were injured. On the night of 13 October 1940, the station was hit by German bombs dropped during The Blitz killing five people in the station with four more subsequently dying of injuries.|$|E
5|$|After hearing NSDAP leader Hitler {{speak for}} the first time in 1920 at a Munich rally, Hess became {{completely}} devoted to him. They held a shared belief in the stab-in-the-back myth, the notion that Germany's loss in World War I was caused by a conspiracy of Jews and Bolsheviks rather than a military defeat. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July as member number 16. As the party continued to grow, holding rallies and meetings in ever larger beer halls in Munich, he focused his attention on fundraising and organisational activities. On 4 November 1921 he was injured while protecting Hitler when a bomb <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> a Marxist group exploded at the Hofbräuhaus during a party event. Hess joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) by 1922 and helped organise and recruit its early membership.|$|E
5|$|Applewood Farm {{has served}} as a farm for over a century, with an 1850 census {{reporting}} it produced butter, cheese, rye, Indian corn, oats, wool, Irish potatoes and hay. Three apple orchards <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> Russell Gallup would become an important part of Applewood Farms and owe its name to those orchards. After Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s, the farm produced fresh fruits and vegetables and poultry, eggs and dairy products. In 1994, the Applewood Farm reported having 700 trees tapped for maple syrup production and showed visitors the process of producing the syrup. Applewood Farms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under criteria A for the Gallup family history that {{played an important role in}} the local history and under criteria C as an architecturally important example of a late colonial center chimney house.|$|E
