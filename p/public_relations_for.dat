5|$|Ed Brubaker's uncle, John Paxton, was a noted Hollywood screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s {{known for}} Murder, My Sweet, Crossfire, The Wild One and On the Beach.

5|$|The first {{discussion}} of a bridge in a public forum was in 1954, when Anton P. Torsvik proposed a bridge to the major and municipal engineer of Fjell. Torsvik lived in Oslo and had worked with <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> <b>for</b> various other bridge projects. The issue was discussed in the municipal councils of Fjell and Sund, but they both concluded {{that there were more}} pressing needs on the islands' road network, so {{they did not want to}} prioritize a bridge. National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, an October {{snowstorm}} in Salida, Colorado, destroyed Sunday's tent—a special disaster because revivalists {{were typically}} paid with a freewill offering {{at the end}} of their meetings. Thereafter he insisted that towns build him temporary wooden tabernacles at their expense. The tabernacles were comparatively costly to build (although most of the lumber could be salvaged and resold {{at the end of}} the meetings), and locals had to put up the money for them in advance. This change in Sunday's operation began to push the finances of the campaign to the fore. At least at first, raising tabernacles provided good <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> <b>for</b> the coming meetings as townspeople joined together in what was effectively a giant barnraising. Sunday built rapport by participating in the process, and the tabernacles were also a status symbol, because they had previously been built only for major evangelists such as Chapman.|$|E
