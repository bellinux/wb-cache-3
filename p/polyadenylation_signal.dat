5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II to slip {{off of the}} transcript. Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>signal</b> can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} poly(A) site can be {{influenced}} by extracellular stimuli and depends on {{the expression of the}} proteins that take part in polyadenylation. For example, the expression of CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results in the selection of weak poly(A) sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like lysozyme and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins. RNA-binding proteins other than those in the polyadenylation machinery can also affect whether a polyadenyation site is used, as can DNA methylation near the <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The processive {{polyadenylation}} {{complex in}} the nucleus of eukaryotes works on products of RNA polymerase II, such as precursor mRNA. Here, a multi-protein complex (see components on the right) cleaves the 3'-most part of a newly produced RNA and polyadenylates the end produced by this cleavage. The cleavage is catalysed by the enzyme CPSF and occurs 10–30 nucleotides downstream of its binding site. This site often has the <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>signal</b> sequence AAUAAA on the RNA, but variants of it that bind more weakly to CPSF exist. Two other proteins add specificity to the binding to an RNA: CstF and CFI. CstF binds to a GU-rich region further downstream of CPSF's site. CFI recognises a third site on the RNA (a set of UGUAA sequences in mammals) and can recruit CPSF even if the AAUAAA sequence is missing. The polyadenylation signal– the sequence motif recognised by the RNA cleavage complex– varies between groups of eukaryotes. Most human polyadenylation sites contain the AAUAAA sequence, but this sequence is less common in plants and fungi.|$|E

In males, exons 1,2,3,5,and 6 are joined {{to form the}} mRNA, which encodes a {{transcriptional}} regulatory protein required for male development.

40|$|The {{expression}} of six cell-surface proteoglycans (syndecan, fibroglycan, amphiglycan, glypican, betaglycan and CD 44) was {{studied at the}} mRNA level. Analysis was performed by Northern blotting using total RNA preparations from freshly isolated articular chondrocytes obtained from both juveniles and adults. Similar results were obtained for both age groups. By far the most abundant message was that for amphiglycan, CD 44 message was next in relative abundance, and the messages for fibroglycan, glypican and betaglycan were all expressed at low levels. Syndecan message could not be detected by this technique. This pattern of expression was different to that observed in cultured skin fibroblasts, where the messages for amphiglycan, CD 44, fibroglycan and glypican were all expressed at a similar level. In contrast with the fibroblasts, where the amphiglycan message exhibits no size polymorphism, the chondrocyte amphiglycan message is present in three polymorphic forms, due {{to the use of}} alternative <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>signals.</b> When the newly isolated chondrocytes are maintained in monolayer culture for several passages, the amphiglycan message heterogeneity reverts to that characteristic of the fibroblasts.
