40|$|The {{complexity}} of Web applications is increasing almost every day. Besides impacting the implementation phase, this complexity {{must also be}} suitably managed while modeling the application. W 2000 supplies the modeling means that are needed to render complex Web applications, but we argue that a <b>pure</b> <b>notation</b> {{is not enough to}} assist the user while shaping his applications. To this end, the paper proposes an approach based on metamodeling and transformation rules to let the user assess and control the consistency of produced artifacts and adapt them in a controlled way. The correctness of designed models is enforced by reasoning on user models as instances of MOF metamodels; adaptability is guided by rules – based on graph transformation – that modify these instances. The paper describes the approach, exemplifies it through the W 2000 metamodel and some transformation rules, and sketches the tool support for such an approach...|$|E
40|$|This master's thesis {{examines}} {{the possibilities of}} correction and change in a classification scheme, {{with regard to the}} changes that occur in the world the classification system intends to describe. Applying a comparative method and classification theory, the classification of the example of the former Yugoslavia (1918 - 1941, 1945 - 1991), its republics and successor states, and the languages, formerly known as Serbo-Croatian are examined through a comparison of the main classes and divisions of language, geography, and history, in Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), and Klassifikationssystem för svenska bibliotek [Classification for Swedish Libraries] (SAB). Eight editions of DDC, from 1876 to 2014, are compared to seven editions of SAB, from 1921 to 2013. The editions have been selected in order to show the changes prior to, and following, the First World War, changes after the Second World War, and changes following the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991. The examination shows that both systems have updated their editions according to the changes in former Yugoslavia over the years. DDC has well constructed facet schedules, especially Table 2 concerning geography, but fails, in some cases, to construct a logic and hierarchical structure for the republics and languages of Yugoslavia, partly due to the fixed classes and divisions that survive from the very first edition of DDC from 1876, but also {{as a result of the}} decimal notation, and its limitations, itself. SAB seeks to construct a hierarchically logic and equal scheme for the languages, areas, and states of the former Yugoslavia. Although the facets for geography and chronology aren't as developed as the ones in DDC, the overall result is that of a logically consistent and hierarchically clear classification, with short notation codes, thanks to the alphabetic mixed notation, which allows more subdivisions than the numerals and the <b>pure</b> <b>notation</b> of DDC. This study is a two years master's thesis in Archive, Library and Museum studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The DiaMODL dialog {{modelling}} is {{a hybrid}} language, {{based on the}} Pisa interactor abstraction and UML Statecharts. By combining a dataflow-ori-ented language with one focussing on behavior, we get a flexible notation which {{may be used for}} different purposes, interaction styles and platforms. DiaMODL may be used as a <b>pure</b> abstract <b>notation</b> for modelling dialog or more directly for modelling concrete interaction objects, pointing towards hybrid tools for com-bining abstract modelling with concrete GUI-building...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{classical}} topics in discrete mathematics and in computer science is the computation of the transitive closure and reduction of a directed graph. We provide a complete analysis of the random variables counting {{the size of the}} transitive closure and reduction in random acyclic digraphs. In particular we present closed forms for their probability distribution and moments, showing that they involve functions such as the q [...] binomial coefficients and the q [...] Stirling numbers of the second kind. In general it turns out that a <b>pure</b> numbertheoretical <b>notation,</b> the q [...] notation, represents the perfect tool to deal with these kinds of problems. In this context we speak therefore about q [...] distributions. 1 Introduction Graphs are probably the most common "abstract" structure in computer science and because of their flexibility they provide an adequate model for a variety of problems. Any system consisting of a set V of discrete states (called nodes or vertices) and a set E of relations b [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} Wilde’s use of French in his dramatization of the Biblical story, Salomé. It argues that Wilde adopted the foreign {{language}} as a strategy for representing the taboo of incestuous and homoerotic desire, murder and necrophilia. His aesthetic objective was to produce a work belonging to the school of French decadentism and adhering to its principles of symbolism. He uses the French language {{as if it were}} a system of signs divorced from their semantic meaning, creating as <b>pure</b> a musical <b>notation</b> as verbal language can allow. A study of the manuscript versions of his play reveals his limited knowledge of French, though this paper interprets the mistakes as key to his poetic achievement. Wilde’s play is untranslatable: both the illustrator Aubrey Beardsley and the composer Richard Strauss recognized the quintessential French quality of the script, and respected it in their creative translations into another artistic genre...|$|R
