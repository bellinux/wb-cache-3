50|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) {{is a form}} of radar {{in which}} sophisticated processing of radar data is used to produce a very narrow effective beam. It can be used to form images of relatively immobile targets; moving targets can be blurred or displaced in the formed images.

SAR image acquisition is therefore independent of natural illumination and images can be taken at night. Radar uses electromagnetic radiation at microwave frequencies; the atmospheric absorption at typical radar wavelengths is very low, meaning observations are not prevented by cloud cover.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{polarimetry}} in active remote sensing is extended to <b>passive</b> remote <b>sensing.</b> The potential {{use of the}} third and fourth Stokes parameters U and V, which {{play an important role in}} polarimetric active remote sensing, is demonstrated for <b>passive</b> remote <b>sensing.</b> It is shown that, by the use of the reciprocity principle, the polarimetric parameters of <b>passive</b> remote <b>sensing</b> can be obtained through the solution of the associated direct scattering problem. These ideas are applied to study polarimetric <b>passive</b> remote <b>sensing</b> of periodic surfaces. The solution of the direct scattering problem is obtained by an integral equation formulation which involves evaluation of periodic Green's functions and normal derivative of those on the surface. Rapid evaluation of the slowly convergent series associated with these functions is observed to be critical for the feasibility of the method. New formulas, which are rapidly convergent, are derived for the calculation of these series.

40|$|In {{the early}} stages of plant breeding, breeders {{evaluate}} a large number of varieties. Due to limited availability of seeds and space, plot sizes may range from one to four rows. Spectral proximal sensors can be used in place of labour-intensive methods to estimate specific plant traits. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the performance of active and <b>passive</b> <b>sensing</b> to assess single and multiple rows in a breeding nursery. A field trial with single cultivars of winter barley and winter wheat with four plot designs (single-row, wide double-row, three rows, and four rows) was conducted. A GreenSeeker RT 100 and a passive bi-directional spectrometer were used to assess biomass fresh and dry weight, as well as aboveground nitrogen content and uptake. Generally, spectral <b>passive</b> <b>sensing</b> and active sensing performed comparably in both crops. Spectral <b>passive</b> <b>sensing</b> was enhanced by the availability of optimized ratio vegetation indices, as well as by an optimized field of view and by reduced distance dependence. Further improvements of both sensors in detecting the performance of plants in single rows can likely be obtained by optimization of sensor positioning or orientation.

These architectures {{have received}} an explosive growth in research {{over the past}} few years due to the first practical demonstration of a thin-film memristor in 2008. The reliability and lifetimes of both the CMOS and memristor partitions of these architectures are severely affected by temperature variations across the chip. Therefore, it is expected that dynamic thermal management (DTM) mechanisms will be needed to improve their reliability and lifetime. This thesis explores one aspect of DTM [...] thermal profiling [...] in a CMOS/memristor memory architecture. A temperature sensing resistive random access memory (TSRRAM) was designed. Temperature information is extracted from the TSRRAM by measuring the write time of thin-film memristors. Active and <b>passive</b> <b>sensing</b> mechanisms are also introduced as means for DTM algorithms to determine the thermal profile of the chip. Crosstherm, a simulation framework, was developed to analyze the effects of temperature variations in CMOS/memristor architectures.
