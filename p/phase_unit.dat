Four constructs were inserted into pET vectors for overexpression in Escherichia coli of the following spectrin peptides: (i) two adjacent but separately expressed "conformationally phased" repeating units, R 16 and R 17, one of which (R 17) contains a single tryptophan; (ii) a mutant, M 17, of the single tryptophan-containing unit with alanine substituted for the tryptophan; and (iii) a conformationally unphased unit, 1617, composed of half {{of each of the}} <b>phased</b> <b>units.</b> Both the mutant unit and the unphased unit were much more readily digested by chymotrypsin and by elastase than the <b>phased</b> <b>units</b> and exhibited only 38 % and 54 % as much alpha-helical structure, respectively, as the <b>phased</b> <b>units</b> by their far UV CD spectra; 90 degrees light scattering measurements revealed the folded peptides to be predominantly monomeric in solution, whereas the unfolded, protease-sensitive peptides consisted of dimers and/or trimers.

40|$|After {{decades of}} repose, Puyehue-Cordón Caulle Volcano (Chile) erupted in June 2011 {{following}} {{a month of}} continuously increasing seismic activity. The eruption dispersed a large volume of rhyolitic tephra over a wide area and was characterized by complex dynamics. During the initial climactic phase of the eruption (24 – 30  h on 4 – 5 June), 11 – 14 -km-high plumes dispersed most of the erupted tephra eastward towards Argentina, reaching {{as far as the}} Atlantic Ocean. This first eruptive phase was followed by activity of lower intensity, leading {{to the development of a}} complex stratigraphic sequence, mainly due to rapid shifts in wind direction and eruptive style. The resulting tephra deposits consist of 13 main layers grouped into four units. Each layer was characterized based on its dispersal direction, sedimentological features, and on the main characteristics of the juvenile fraction (texture, density, petrography, chemistry). The lowest part of the eruptive sequence (Unit I), corresponding to the tephra emitted between 4 and 5 June, is composed of alternating lapilli layers with a total estimated volume of ca. 0. 75  km 3; these layers record the highest intensity phase, during which a bent-over plume dispersed tephra towards the southeast-east, with negligible up-wind sedimentation. Products emitted during 5 – 6 June (Unit II) signaled an abrupt shift in wind direction towards the north, leading to the deposition of a coarse ash deposit in the northern sector (ca. 0. 21  km 3 in volume), followed by a resumption of easterly directed winds. A third <b>phase</b> (<b>Unit</b> III) began on 7 June and resulted in tephra deposits in the eastern sector and ballistic bombs around the vent area. A final <b>phase</b> (<b>Unit</b> IV) started after 15 June and was characterized by the emission of fine-grained white tephra from ash-charged plumes during low-level activity and the extrusion of a viscous lava flow. Timing and duration of the first eruptive phases were constrained based on comparison of the dispersal of the main tephra layers with satellite images, showing that most of the tephra was emitted during the first 72  h of the event. The analyzed juvenile material tightly clusters within the rhyolitic field, with negligible chemical variations through the eruptive sequence. Textural observations reveal that changes in eruption intensity (and consequently in magma ascent velocity within the conduit) and complex interactions between gas-rich and gas-depleted magma portions during ascent resulted in vesicular clasts with variable degrees of shear localization, and possibly in the large heterogeneity of the juvenile material...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for measuring M, {{the ratio of}} the Gaussian (saddle splay) elastic modulus to the bending elastic modulus of a lipid monolayer. The ratio M is determined from measurements of the equilibrium bicontinuous inverted cubic (QII) <b>phase</b> <b>unit</b> cell size in excess water as a function of temperature. The analysis includes the effect of a curvature elastic term that is second-order in the Gaussian curvature, K. Preliminary results using data on DOPE-Me validate the method. The fitted value of M is within 8 % of the value estimated in an earlier treatment. The method can be used to measure changes in M due to addition of exogenous lipids and peptides to a host lipid system. The Gaussian elastic modulus has a substantial effect on the stability of fusion intermediates (stalks, hemifusion diaphragms, and fusion pores). Studying the effects of peptides and different lipids on M via this method may yield insights into how fusion protein moieties stabilize intermediates in membrane fusion in vivo. The contribution of the K 2 curvature elastic term to the free energy of QII phase and fusion pores explains some features of fusion pore stability and dynamics, and some peculiar observations concerning the mechanism of Lα/QII phase transitions...|$|E

Witness observations were also used to clarify the eruption process. The deposits are divided into three major depositional units (Units A, B, and C) which are characterized by massive, extremely poorly sorted, and multimodal grain-size distribution with 30 – 50  wt% of fine ash (silt–clay component). The depositional condition was initially dry but eventually changed to wet. Unit A originated from gravity-driven turbulent PDCs in the relatively dry, vent-opening <b>phase.</b> <b>Unit</b> B was then produced mainly by fallout from a vigorous moist plume during vent development. Unit C was derived from wet ash fall in the declining stage. Ballistic ejecta continuously occurred during vent opening and development. As observed in the finest population of the grain-size distribution, aggregate particles were formed throughout the eruption, {{and the effect of}} water in the plume on the aggregation increased with time and distance. Based on the deposit thickness, duration, and grain-size data, and by applying a scaling analysis using a depth-averaged model of turbulent gravity currents, the particle concentration and initial flow speed of the PDC at the summit area were estimated as 2  ×  10 − 4 – 2  ×  10 − 3 and 24 – 28  m/s, respectively. The tephra thinning trend in the proximal area shows a steeper slope than in similar-sized magmatic eruptions, indicating a large tephra volume deposited over a short distance owing to the wet dispersal conditions.
