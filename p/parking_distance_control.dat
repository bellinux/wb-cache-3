40|$|The {{increased}} demand for more intelligence in automotive applications requires robust low-cost sensory systems. This paper presents low-cost high-speed camera employing novel CMOS sensors capable of serving in different automotive applications. Our camera offers a platform {{that can be used}} to perform different tasks like occupancy detection, precrash sensing, collision avoidance, and <b>parking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>control</b> for the driver assistance.

40|$|Moore's Law {{predicts the}} {{shrinking}} of integrated circuits. Today's rapid development in packaging technologies allows additional downscaling of self-sufficient wireless sensors from some cubic centimetre {{to less than}} 1 cm 3. Ongoing system miniaturization at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration (IZM) targets an edge length of 6 mm. These wireless sensors reduce the wiring complexity and mounting costs in the automotive industry while substituting signal wires by radio communication. They allow efficient solutions for applications like {{tire pressure monitoring system}}s, which requires low weighted self-sufficient sensors to reduce out-of-balance forces. Furthermore the lowering of substrate area reduces mechanical stress applied to the electronic device. Tiny wireless ultrasonic sensors and cameras mounted on external rear mirrors are further instances to monitor blind angles and to be integrated into <b>parking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>control</b> systems. Innovative packaging technologies and power aware design enable system shrinking considering automotive requirements. During the design process the coupling of very narrow positioned components have to be addressed. The counter measures can be selected either by software, hardware or technology. The methodologies of an ultra low power design are fundamental during the development of tiny wireless sensors to allow ultra dense system integration with innovative packaging technologies for automotive applications. Thereby exploitation of battery effects increases operation time. The relevant miniaturisation aspects are discussed on the exemplary application of a tire pressure monitoring system currently reaching 10 g in weight and five years of operation period...|$|E

50|$|For 1998 {{optional}} {{rear side}} airbags became available, and both models also gained BMW's exclusive new Head Protection System, {{which consists of}} two tubular bags that inflate upon a side impact and pop out just above each front door. A new Sport Package for the 528i and 540i, {{as well as an}} automatic transmission 540i were added options. The Sport Package included black body trim (standard models had chrome around the top of the windows), a sport-tuned suspension, and 17-inch wheels and tires. In September 1998, the 540i's M62B44 was updated to the M62TUB44, adding 15 ftÂ·lb (20 Nm) of torque. DSC first became available on 540i with automatic transmission as of 9/97The high-performance M5 sedan (saloon) returned to the BMW fold. Built in limited numbers, the M5 used a 400 hp (300 kW) V8 S62, and came with a firmer suspension, 18-inch wheels, a 6-speed manual transmission, and exclusive interior trim.13 Lower-body rear side airbags were standard on the M5, remaining optional for other models. 1999 saw the introduction of the Touring wagon (estate) body style and joined sedans (saloons) in both I6 and V8 versions. New options for 1999 included brighter xenon headlights, <b>Park</b> <b>Distance</b> <b>Control</b> that warns of obstacles when backing up, and self-leveling rear suspension for wagons (estates). Standard on V8 models and newly optional for 528i versions was BMW's Dynamic Stability Control, designed to aid control in fast turns. The M52 2.8 liter I6 engines were now all aluminium block and head with the introduction of double VANOS, as opposed to the previous single VANOS iron block/aluminium head M52.|$|R

5000|$|During the {{takeover}} battle in 1998 between BMW and Volkswagen Group for ownership of Rolls Royce and Bentley Motors, BMW {{had threatened to}} stop supply of their engines if Volkswagen Group won. While the threat was later withdrawn in conjunction with BMW acquiring the right to manufacture the Rolls Royce marque at a new location, {{it was clear that}} Volkswagen could not accept the business and reputation risks associated with having their rival as a long-term business partner. Furthermore, customers were nervous about engine and part availability (of which there turned out to be no issue) and orders for new cars dropped precipitously. Volkswagen's response was to prepare the old pushrod 6.75-litre 16-valve engine from the Turbo R for the Arnage, designed for the lighter and smaller BMW 32-valve V8 unit. Coupled with an outdated 4-speed automatic, the engine was extremely thirsty, and would not meet government-imposed emissions standards without hasty modifications.The revised version of the car was launched as the Arnage Red Label in October 1999. At the same time, but without the fanfare, Bentley made several minor modifications to the original BMW engined cars, and designated them as the [...] "Arnage Green Label" [...] for the 2000 model year. As part of the modification process, both Red and Green Label cars received stiffer body shells and larger wheels and brakes. The stiffer body shell was needed because of the extra weight of the British engine. The larger brakes were needed for the same reason. Despite the larger brakes, braking performance worsened with the extra weight of the 6.75 engine. The braking performance of the '99 Green Label from 70-0 was 172 ft while the later Arnage T's performance was 182 ft from the same speed. [...] The rest of the revisions included: 1. making a pop up Alpine navigation system standard 2. adding <b>park</b> <b>distance</b> <b>control</b> to the front and rear 3. increasing the rear seat leg room (by modifying the design of the front seat backs) 4. adding power folding exterior mirrors and 5. modifying the steering rack to reduce steering effort at low speeds. The lens covers for the headlights went from being glass (1998-99) to plastic (2000 onwards).|$|R

Methods: A school-based representative sample (n = 1, 718; boys = 40. 4 %) of teenagers of Curitiba, Southern region of Brazil.
