40|$|Introduction Heavy ion {{collisions}} at intermediate {{and higher}} energies {{give us the}} opportunity to study properties of compressed and heated nuclear matter. According to predictions of hydrodynamic models a strong azimuthal correlation in the particle emission is produced by the fluid-like behaviour of nuclear matter. Different phenomena related to flow have been observed: the bounce-off of the spectator fragments and the side-splash of participant matter which occur in the reaction plane and the squeeze-out of nucleons out of the reaction plane [1]. These studies can possibly put constraints on the equation of state of nuclear matter. 2 Experiment Stacks of NIKFI BR- 2 nuclear <b>photoemulsions</b> have been irradiated by a 950 MeV/nucleon 84 Kr beam at the SIS synchrotron at GSI, Darmstadt.

40|$|Absolute {{intensity}} calibration of {{the transfer}} function of a photodetector measuring line is not a straightforward technique. One of the many hints is that it depends on almost all parameters of the experimental set-up. All stable and reliable light standards are continuous working, and thus low level devices. Pulsed sources do exist, but are neither traceable nor calibrated and give badly reproducible pulses. The device which is presented here {{makes it possible to}} use standard CW sources, with exposure time down to a few microseconds. The main idea on which the device is based, is to use the multiplication factor of the angular speed of a optical ray reflected by a rotating mirror. Starting at a usual speed wl, a chain of n mirrors gives a final speed 2 nw 1. The procedure is well suited to all detectors including <b>photoemulsions,</b> however less accurate in this latter case. © 1983 SPIE. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

With 1 :. 1 e exception of a few missions which carried plutonium-fueled radioisotope thermoelectric generators, all of the neutrons inside the spacecraft are secondary radiations resulting from interactions of high-energy charged particles with nuclei in the Earth's atmosphere, spacecraft structural materials, and the astronaut's own bodies. Although of great interest, definitive measurements of the spacecraft neutron field have been difficult due to the wide particle energy range and the limited available volume and power for traditional techniques involving Bonner spheres. A multitude of measurements, however, have been made of the neutron environment inside spacecraft. The majority of measurements were made using passive techniques including metal activation fo ils, fission foils, nuclear <b>photoemulsions,</b> plastic track detectors, and thermoluminescent detectors.

The exact mechanism of AGRP and Agouti protein action has been difficult to examine, in part because of difficulties in producing homogeneous forms of these molecules that can be used for direct binding assays. In this report we describe the application of chemical protein synthesis to the construction of two novel AGRP variants. Examination of the biological activity of the AGRP variants demonstrates that a truncated variant, human AGRP(87 – 132), a 46 amino acid variant based on the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain of AGRP, is equipotent to an 111 -amino acid variant, mouse [Leu 127 Pro]AGRP (mature AGRP minus its signal sequence), in its ability to dose dependently inhibit �-MSH-generated cAMP generation at the cloned melanocortin receptors. Furthermore, deletion of the amino-terminal portion of the full-length variant did not alter the MCR subtype specificity of AGRP(87 – 132). Finally, iodination of human AGRP(87 – 132) provided a useful reagent with which the binding properties of AGRP could be analyzed.
