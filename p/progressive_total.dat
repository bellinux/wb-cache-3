25|$|A {{final point}} {{needs to be}} explained. It was noted above that when a {{candidate}} polls more votes than the quota, their surplus vote is distributed to other candidates. Thus, in the example given above, Hutchins's surplus was 909,698, or 1,446,231 (his primary vote) minus 536,533 (the quota). It may be asked: which 909,698 of Hutchins's 1,446,231 primary votes are distributed? Are they chosen at random from among his votes? In fact they are all distributed, but at less than their full value. Since 909,698 is 62.9% of 1,446,231, each of Hutchins's votes is transferred to other candidates as 62.9% of a vote: each vote {{is said to have}} a transfer value of 0.629. This avoids any possibility of an unrepresentative sample of his votes being transferred. After each count the candidate's <b>progressive</b> <b>total</b> is rounded down to the nearest whole number. This means that a small number of votes are lost by fractionation in the final count.|$|E

Although current progress suggests that biologic agents can delay the advancement of deterioration, such drugs are incapable of promoting tissue restoration. The limited ability of articular cartilage to regenerate renders joint arthroplasty an unavoidable surgical intervention. This Review describes current, widely used clinical repair techniques for resurfacing articular cartilage defects; short-term and long-term clinical outcomes of these techniques are discussed. Also reviewed is a developmental pipeline of acellular and cellular regenerative products and techniques that could revolutionize joint care over the next decade by promoting the development of functional articular cartilage. Acellular products typically consist of collagen or hyaluronic-acid-based materials, whereas cellular techniques use either primary cells or stem cells, with or without scaffolds. Central to these efforts is the prominent role that tissue engineering has in translating biological technology into clinical products; therefore, concomitant regulatory processes are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal dysplasia-Clefting (EEC) {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal dominant disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the p 63 gene and characterized by limb defects, orofacial clefting, ectodermal dysplasia, and ocular defects. Patients develop <b>progressive</b> <b>total</b> bilateral limbal stem cell deficiency, which eventually results in corneal blindness. Medical and surgical treatments are ineffective and of limited benefit. Oral mucosa epithelial stem cells (OMESCs) represent an alternative source of stem cells capable of regenerating the corneal epithelium and, combined with gene therapy, could provide an attractive therapeutic avenue. OMESCs from EEC patients carrying the most severe p 63 mutations (p. R 279 H and p. R 304 Q) were characterized and the genetic defect of p. R 279 H silenced using allele-specific (AS) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Systematic screening of locked nucleic acid (LNA) -siRNAs against R 279 H-p 63 allele in (i) stable WT-ΔNp 63 α-RFP and R 279 H-ΔNp 63 α-EGFP cell lines, (ii) transient doubly transfected cell lines, and (iii) p. R 279 H OMESCs, {{identified a number of}} potent siRNA inhibitors for the mutant allele, which had no effect on wild-type p 63. In addition, siRNA treatment led to longer acquired life span of mutated stem cells compared to controls, less accelerated stem cell differentiation in vitro, reduced proliferation properties, and effective ability in correcting the epithelial hypoplasia, thus giving rise to full thickness stratified and differentiated epithelia. This study demonstrates the phenotypic correction of mutant stem cells (OMESCs) in EEC syndrome by means of siRNA mediated AS silencing with restoration of function. The application of siRNA, alone or in combination with cell-based therapies, offers a therapeutic strategy for corneal blindness in EEC syndrome...|$|E

In samples analysed 20 days after cheesemaking, aerobic mesophilic count was 1. 8 • 107 CFU/g, Enterobacteriaceae were 2. 7 • 106 CFU/g, Staphylococcus spp. were 1. 8 • 104 CFU/g, and yeasts 4. 5 • 105 CFU/g. Sulphite reducing bacteria were not found. Lactic bacteria count at 30 °C (LAB 30) and 42 °C (LAB 42) was about 108 CFU/g (day 20); LAB 30 reduced until month 8; LAB 42 reduced until month 12; both were not detectable at months 17 and 24. Cheese-making process does not consider commercial starter cultures and LAB group is heterogeneous because of its natural microflora. Yeasts were considered as typical microflora of Maiorchino. Volatile compounds were examined at 6, 12 and 24 months of ripening; 54 components were identified. Statistical analysis showed that the seasoning period of 12 months was the best for Maiorchino flavour attributes.

40|$|The author {{concludes that}} the {{national}} trend in contemporary literature confronts a different trend, namely globalism. The main feature of {{the turn of the}} twenty-first century is a <b>progressive</b> <b>total</b> globalization. It has captured almost all areas of life in the modern world: culture, politics and economics. Literary globalization gradually leads to the erasure of special features of the national literature. Globalization is expressed {{in the fact that the}} works of contemporary writers lose national characteristics that distinguish them from the literature of any other country in the world. Modern literature is full of averaged stereotypes of the mass culture. Mostly it refers to commercial literature, to the genre of romance novels, detective fiction and fantasy. Any of the mentioned genres recreate a certain type of character, only slightly reformulating the story and updating stylistic aesthetics. Plots and character types, similar like Siamese twins, wander from one book to another; the twists and turns of stories recur as well. They are usually associated with a specific model which serves to create mass literature, intended for the consciousness of the mass reader. This prose is aimed at the artificially generated images and encourages people to look at the world through the prism of common standards. Among the characters you will not find clearly individualized and psychologically expressive images. The authors saturate the narrative with facts and exterior details, not delving into the inner world of the characters. The artistic quality is averaged and massive trends are rooted in the literature. This process becomes more and more apparent year after year that forces writers, oriented to the readers with a good aesthetic taste, to try to break the stereotypes and constantly seek new forms, genres and techniques...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze and compare the conventional and functional semen parameters in men practicing vigorous physical activity to those of sedentary men. Materials and Methods In this descriptive cross-sectional study, semen samples of 17 physically active men and 15 sedentary men were collected for analysis. Semen analysis was performed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, while functional parameters were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results Results showed that several semen parameters (semen volume, viability, <b>progressive</b> motility, <b>total</b> motility, normal morphology, and moribund cells) were superior in the physically active group in comparison with the sedentary group. Semen parameters such as viability, <b>progressive</b> motility and <b>total</b> motility, as well as the percentage of moribund spermatozoa were significantly different between both groups. However, sperm DNA damage, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial potential were not significantly different among the groups.

The studs were provided with the supplements as aliquots to be added to each feed once per day. Stallions from one stud were fed a different basal diet from the other two studs. At least 3 semen samples were collected from each stallion and sent to Equibreed NZ Ltd, before, and after feeding the supplements for around 60 days. Spermatozoa fertility parameters evaluated included <b>total</b> motility, <b>progressive</b> motility, <b>total</b> <b>progressive</b> motility, morphology (normal, loose heads, head defects, mid-piece defects, tail defects), acrosome status (FITC-PNA), membrane integrity (hypo-osmotic swelling test), and concentration.

Blood levels of Se, Cu and Zn were measured before and after supplementation. Per cycle pregnancy data was also obtained from questionnaire responses from studs A and B at the end of the trial. This study demonstrates that there was a statistically significant effect of feeding oil as a dietary supplement on sperm motility at 24 h after collection (longevity) and also on the per cycle pregnancy rates when treatment groups were combined. Consequently, we were able to elucidate a difference in the actions of mineral and vitamin E supplementation when compared with oil supplementation on fertility parameters measured in this trial. Other beneficial effects of antioxidant supplementation on sperm parameters were suggested from the results of the fourteen stallions on two separate diets, but were not found to be statistically significant...|$|R
