In this way we use multilayer perceptron and classifiers models for assessing power system voltage stability margin in unstable point. In this paper we consider voltage magnitudes and phase angles as input and voltage stability margin as target of ANNs. Simulation was carrying out on IEEE- 14 bus test system and numerical {{results show that}} minimum rule in combination gives better results rather than other models. Also be specified that use learning mechanism lead to better results than apply <b>pattern</b> <b>presentation</b> techniques...|$|E

Setting: Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria, Nigeria. Subjects: Twenty one children managed for gastrointestinal injuries from blunt trauma from 1984 - 2002. Main outcome measures: The <b>pattern,</b> <b>presentation,</b> management and outcome of gastrointestinal injuries from blunt trauma. Results: In the l 9 year period, 1984 - 2002, 92 children were treated for blunt abdominal trauma, 21 (23 %) of who had injuries to the gastrointestinal tract. Three presenting after 24 hours had evidence of peritonitis.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown the size of kinaesthetically {{presented}} two-dimensional movement patterns to be significantly overestimated. Whether this size overestimation is characteristic of the kinaesthetic system alone has not been established. Two experiments are reported which were designed to investigate size judgment made after kinaesthetic and visual <b>pattern</b> <b>presentation</b> {{and the effect of}} environmental cues on the perception of movement patterns. In experiment 1 patterns were presented kinaesthetically (experimenter guided hand movements around the outline of the pattern) or in combination with visual information given by a moving light (pinpoint light attached to the stylus which was moved around the pattern); visual and kinaesthetic cues were either congruent or conflicting with each other; and environmental cues were either present or absent. In experiment 2 static visual display was compared with visually traced <b>pattern</b> <b>presentation,</b> again with or without environmental cues. Overall the results showed that, regardless of experimental manipulation, in all eases where the information was given over time the subject perceived the pattern larger than reality.

It {{takes a lot}} of discipline and creativity to prepare and give a presentation that, on the one hand, is received positively by its audience and, on the other hand, has the effects desired by the presenter. This paper gives a handful of recommendations that aid in creating a good presentation. These recommendations are put in pattern form and combined into a <b>presentation</b> <b>pattern</b> language. Introduction Motivation Many readers have been exposed to presentations of varying quality. So have I. When listening to a very chaotic and boring presentation given by a student, I felt there must be a way to change this.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a new {{algorithm}} to train Min-Max neural models is proposed.

ARC generates the optimal Min-Max network by a succession of hyperbox cuts. The generalization capability of ARC technique depends mostly on the adopted cutting strategy. A new recursive cutting procedure allows ARC technique to yield a better performance. Some real data benchmarks are considered for illustration...|$|E

In order to solve these two problems, a dynamic learning parameter and random <b>pattern</b> <b>presentation</b> method were introduced. Results using a number of actual dual-echo MR images with the modified ART 2 A network show that ART-based networks can be used for segmentation of multi-echo MR image...|$|E

40|$|The Neuron Ring model employs an {{avalanche}} structure with two important distinctions at the neuron level. Each neuron has two memory latches; one traps maximum neuronal activation during <b>pattern</b> <b>presentation,</b> {{and the other}} records the time of latch content change. The latches filter short term memory. In the process, they preserve length 1 snapshots of activation theory history. The model finds utility in pattern classification. Its synaptic weights are first conditioned with sample spectra. The model then receives a test or unknown signal. The objective is to identify the sample closest to the test signal. Class decision follows complete presentation of the test data. The decision maker relies exclusively on the latch contents.
