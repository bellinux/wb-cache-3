In addition, higher controllability of the boost pressure can be obtained by the electric drive of the supercharger, combining power electronics with the internal combustion engine system.

40|$|Turbocharged {{diesel engines}} suffer from poor drivability, mostly at low loads and speeds, leading also to {{overshoot}} in exhaust emissions (primarily PM/soot and NOx) during the transient operation after a speed or load increase. The main cause for this problematic behavior {{is located in}} the turbocharger in the form of high moment of inertia and unfavorable aerodynamic-type compressor flow characteristics. In the present work, various alternative turbocharging configurations are reviewed that have proven successful in improving the dynamic diesel engine operation. The configurations studied are: combined supercharging, variable geometry turbine, electrically assisted turbocharging, two stage series and sequential turbocharging, as well as lower turbine moment of inertia. It is shown that significant improvement in the engine’s transient response can be realized through reduction in the turbocharger mass moment of inertia (using lighter materials and/or more than one units). Increasing the available turbine torque (e. g. through elevated turbine back pressure in a variable-geometry turbine) is another successful option, as well as enhancement of the compressor boost pressure (e. g. {{through the use of a}} <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> upstream of the turbocharger). Finally, the use of external energy (e. g. in the form of electrical assistance on the turbocharger shaft during the critical turbocharger lag phase) is another recently developed and highly promising measure to mitigate the drawbacks of the poor transient performance of turbocharged diesel-engined vehicles and limit their exhaust emissions...|$|E

Some of the experimental measuring techniques involve the use of pressure and temperature transducers installed in the housing to determine the vital thermodynamic process characteristics and functioning performance of compressors. Moreover, as advanced technologies were available, measurements were performed in an optical compressor with a transparent window near the discharge port to allow the application of a laser technique, Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), to investigate the axial mean flow and turbulence characteristics inside the working chamber of the male rotor. Recently a prototype two-phase screw steam expander has been designed and developed as a means of power recovery from liquid geothermal brine. An experimental setup has been designed by using a set of new generation instruments to complement the unit’s numerical modeling, from which predictions of an adiabatic efficiency in the order of 70 %, were obtained. The testing includes measurements of instantaneous pressure and temperature in the suction and discharge port, instantaneous torque, speed and flow rate as well as monitoring the temperature and pressure of its lubrication system. Furthermore, four miniature high resolution pressure transducers were installed in the expander unit to measure the main rotor inter lobe temporal pressures with respect to crank angle of the main rotor. The high dynamic characteristics and response of the instrument are captured by a real time processor, National Instrument Compact-RIO, data logger and the programming is done using LabVIEW.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuing}} work from the same authors on the same topic of gas pulsation control using a shunt pulsation trap method by Huang (2012 a, 2014). Traditionally, a serial pulsation dampener/muffler, often a reactive type, is connected AFTER the discharge of a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> or engine. It is capable of reducing pressure pulsation level up to 10 - 20 folds or 20 - 40 dB but is bulky and suffers sizable back pressure losses. It has been demonstrated in the previous theoretical and experimental investigations by Huang (2012 a, 2014) that gas pulsations can be as effectively controlled by an alternative method, shunt pulsation trap (SPT) of a parallel configuration, which is more compact and tackles the gas pulsations BEFORE the compressor or engine discharge, hence not suffering any back pressure losses. However, {{it is observed that}} the dampening element inside SPT by a perforated plate (p-plate) induces a severe â€œdrum effectâ€ with enhanced vibration and noise. This paper investigates experimentally the effect of a new dampening element inside the SPT by using circular perforated tubes (p-tubes) with minimum trap volume. It is found that p-tubes can effectively resolve the adverse â€œdrum effectâ€ of p-plate with improved pulsation/vibration/noise reduction. Furthermore, the use of an absorption type silencer is beneficial to further reduce noise level by 10 - 15 dB in addition to the p-tubes under Exhauster and Blower modes. However, this type of silencer will not have the sizable back pressure drop associated with reaction type silencers and therefore will not affect system efficiency. The integration of absorptive silencer into a p-tube based SPT would provide an optimal design choice for size/weight and pulsation/noise reduction, energy saving and for improving equipment fatigue life. The potentials for applying the SPT to screw and scroll compressors are enormous in the future since a significant portion of their operation is under off-design conditions of either an under-compression (UC) or over-compression (OC) ...|$|E
40|$|The demands {{facing the}} {{refrigeration}} industry are minimal usage of {{conventional energy sources}} for compression and avoidance of ozone depleting substances. One of the approaches to combat these issues {{is the use of}} thermally driven solid sorption compression with non-ozone depleting refrigerant. In this context, the research work presented in this thesis is devoted to a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis and development of a laboratory model of an activated carbon+ HFC 134 a adsorption refrigeration system. The cooling load catered to by the laboratory model is 2 - 5 W, mainly for thermal management of electronics. A complete thermodynamic analysis is carried out for the desorption temperatures varying from 75 to 90 oC, evaporating temperatures from - 20 to 15 oC and adsorption/condensing temperatures from 25 to 40 oC. A program on MatLab platform is developed for theoretical modeling. A new concept of thermal compression uptake efficiency (u) which is analogous to volumetric efficiency of a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> is introduced to consider the effect of void volume. The thesis also covers an investigation of two-stage and hybrid (thermal+ mechanical) cycle compression systems. It is possible to identify the conditions under which a two-stage gives a better performance than a single-stage one. It also shows that hybrid cycle system gives the best performance and saves ~ 40 % of power compared to operation under the same conditions run with a single-stage mechanical compression refrigeration system. A heat transfer analysis of the thermal compressor is carried out to evaluate non-uniformities in bed temperature. As a part of it, the thermal conductivity of the bed under adsorbed state has been calculated. A laboratory model of activated carbon+ HFC 134 a adsorption refrigeration system is fabricated to meet a 2 - 5 Watts cooling load based on the results from theoretical calculations. Experimental results show a fair match in the trends for the COP with analysis. The main aim of the research was to examine how effective the adsorption refrigeration system is in reducing the temperature rise of the heater used to simulate the electronic component. The heater that would have stabilized at 81, 97, 103 and 112 oC without any cooling for heat inputs of 3, 4, 4. 4 and 4. 9 W, respectively, would attain a cyclic steady state around 24, 26, 28, 31 oC. The influence of cycle time on the performance of the systems is also investigated. It is concluded that an activated carbon+ HFC 134 a adsorption refrigeration system can be a good supplement to conventional compression refrigeration systems. In situations where heat recovery imminent this system could be a good choice. For waste heat recovery and suppression of infrared signatures of electronic components, it is ideally suited where COP becomes immaterial...|$|E
