30|$|For {{a better}} understanding, we {{consider}} a simple example. Assume that we observe a certain fixed-date <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> in a 3 year in-sample period on a Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. In {{the next year}} {{where we want to}} forecast the load of this <b>public</b> <b>holiday,</b> it falls on a Sunday. Thus, a simple additional dummy approach would have noticed a clear reduction in the load for the three in-sample years and puts a clear negative coefficient on this <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> dummy. If in the next year, the <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> falls on a Sunday then there will be a double reducing impact, because the Sunday dummy and the <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> dummy are active. The replacing dummy approach is able to overcome this problem.|$|R

5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. <b>Public</b> <b>holidays</b> in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates.

5|$|<b>Public</b> <b>holidays</b> in Rhodesia, a {{historical}} region in southern Africa equivalent to today's Zimbabwe and Zambia—formerly Southern and Northern Rhodesia, respectively—were largely based around milestones in the region's short history. Annual holidays marked {{various aspects of}} the arrival of white people during the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the respective unilateral declarations of independence (1965) and of republican government (1970). On these days, most businesses and non-essential services closed.

5|$|The {{majority}} form of opposition, however, was passive resistance. Small patriotic badges, {{depicting the}} royal family or national colours, were extremely popular. When these symbols were banned, new ones, such as ivy leaves, were worn with similar meaning. Workers in strategic industries deliberately underperformed in their jobs {{as a form of}} resistance. The celebration of nationalist <b>public</b> <b>holidays,</b> like 21 July (National Day), which were officially banned by the Germans, were also often accompanied by protests and demonstrations. One of the most notable acts of passive resistance was the Judges' Strike of 1918, which managed to gain concessions from the German occupiers under considerable public pressure.|$|E
