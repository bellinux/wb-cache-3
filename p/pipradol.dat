40|$|Cocaine, {{imipramine}} and <b>pipradol</b> potentiated the contractions to adrenaline and noradrenaline, {{but not to}} tyramine, on the {{nictitating membrane}} of the spinal cat. Pheniprazine and dexamphetamine potentiated the responses to adrenaline, noradrenaline and tyramine, whereas nialamide only potentiated the response to tyramine. Potentiation of the response to stimulation of either the preganglionic or the postganglionic sympathetic nerve trunks was observed with imipramine, <b>pipradol,</b> pheniprazine and dexamphetamine. Only dexamphetamine and pheniprazine caused substantial contractions of the membrane when the preganglionic nerve was cut (acutely decentralized), or when the superior cervical ganglion was removed (acutely denervated). Cocaine produced contractions of the innervated but not of the acutely decentralized membrane. The significance of the peripheral effects of these antidepressant drugs {{in relation to their}} central actions is discussed...|$|E
