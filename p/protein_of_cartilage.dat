40|$|Abstract Background Molecular {{hydrogen}} (H 2) {{functions as}} an extensive protector against oxidative stress, inflammation and allergic reaction in various biological models and clinical tests; however, its essential mechanisms remain unknown. H 2 directly reacts {{with the strong}} reactive nitrogen species peroxynitrite (ONOO -) as well as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), but not with nitric oxide radical (NO•). We hypothesized {{that one of the}} H 2 functions is caused by reducing cellular ONOO -, which is generated by the rapid reaction of NO• with superoxides (•O 2 -). To verify this hypothesis, we examined whether H 2 could restore cytotoxicity and transcriptional alterations induced by ONOO - derived from NO• in chondrocytes. Methods We treated cultured chondrocytes from porcine hindlimb cartilage or from rat meniscus fibrecartilage with a donor of NO•, S -nitroso- N -acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) in {{the presence or absence of}} H 2. Chondrocyte viability was determined using a LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit. Gene expressions <b>of</b> the matrix <b>proteins</b> <b>of</b> <b>cartilage</b> and the matrix metalloproteinases were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-coupled real-time PCR method. Results SNAP treatment increased the levels <b>of</b> nitrated <b>proteins.</b> H 2 decreased the levels <b>of</b> the nitrated <b>proteins,</b> and suppressed chondrocyte death. It is known that the matrix <b>proteins</b> <b>of</b> <b>cartilage</b> (including aggrecan and type II collagen) and matrix metalloproteinases (such as MMP 3 and MMP 13) are down- and up-regulated by ONOO -, respectively. H 2 restoratively increased the gene expressions of aggrecan and type II collagen in the presence of H 2. Conversely, the gene expressions of MMP 3 and MMP 13 were restoratively down-regulated with H 2. Thus, H 2 acted to restore transcriptional alterations induced by ONOO -. Conclusions These results imply that one of the functions of H 2 exhibits cytoprotective effects and transcriptional alterations through reducing ONOO -. Moreover, novel pharmacological strategies aimed at selective removal of ONOO - may represent a powerful method for preventive and therapeutic use of H 2 for joint diseases. </p...|$|R

METHODS: Mice transgenic for HLA-DR 2. Ab(0), DR 3. Ab(0), DR 4. Ab(0), and DQ 8. Ab(0), lacking their own (mouse) class II antigens (Ab(0)), on the original (arthritis-resistant) and the arthritis-susceptible BALB/c backgrounds, were immunized with human cartilage PG. The T cell epitope repertoire presented by these class II MHC alleles was determined using a synthetic peptide library (143 peptides <b>of</b> the core <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> human <b>cartilage</b> PG), and arthritis development was monitored and compared in wild-type and HLA-transgenic/congenic BALB/c mice. RESULTS: Mice of the 4 HLA-transgenic lines, either on the original mixed, arthritis-resistant background or DR 4. Ab(0) - and DQ 8. Ab(0) -transgenic/congenic mice on the arthritis-susceptible BALB/c genetic background, responded well to PG immunization (as assessed by T cell responses and antibody and cytokine production), {{and a number of}} T cell epitopes along the core <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> human <b>cartilage</b> PG were identified. DR 4. Ab(0) - and DQ 8.

40|$|Previous {{evidence}} from our laboratories showed that collagen {{is not the}} major matrix protein of the cartilaginous endoskeleton of the lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). Here we have characterized the cartilage matrix proteins of the only other extant agnathan, the hagfish (Myxine glutinosa). Using morphological, immunochemical and biochemical methods, we show that the structural proteins of the cartilaginous endoskeleton of the hagfish are also non-collagenous in nature. Although these hagfish cartilage proteins share properties both {{with each other and}} with lamprey cartilage proteins, including resistance to solubilization with cyanogen bromide and an usual amino acid composition rich in glycine and non-polar amino acids, it is clear that at least two and probably more hagfish cartilage proteins can be distinguished, with distinct distributions in different cartilage structures. Furthermore, in spite of their similarities, matrix proteins from hagfish cartilage are not identical to the proteins we have previously characterized in lamprey cartilage. These results suggest the existence of a larger family of similar but not identical proteins that form the major structural elements of cartilage tissues of agnathans.

We also studied variants of GDF 5, one that has a higher affinity for the receptor BMPR-IA and one that is insensitive to the GDF 5 antagonist noggin. As a positive control, chondrocytes were treated with TGF-b 1.

At early stages of limb development, an accumulation of silver grains representing hybridizable core protein mRNA first became detectable in the proximal central core of the limb where the prechondrogenic condensation of mesenchymal cells that characterizes the onset of cartilage differentiation was occurring. In fact, the pattern of silver grain accumulation closely followed the pattern of mesenchymal cell condensation, and no hybridizable core protein mRNA sequences were detectable in the limb bud prior to condensation.

40|$|Abstract This work engaged Finnish females {{affected}} with osteoarthritis (OA) of {{the hand}} to define the role of common sequence variations within the genes of the important structural <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> <b>cartilage,</b> aggrecan (AGC 1), and the genes of inflammatory mediators, the interleukin 1 gene cluster and interleukin 6 (IL 6), as possible risk factors for the disease. Also, a genome-wide linkage analysis was performed in a sample consisting of Finnish families with multiple individuals affected with hip and knee OA in order to reveal new chromosomal areas {{that are likely to}} contain disease associated variations. OA is a chronic disease that leads to the degeneration of articular cartilage in synovial joints. The etiology of the disease is for the most part unknown. Joints {{of the hand}}, hip and knee are most commonly affected, and obesity, trauma and excess mechanical stress are known risk factors for the disease. OA also has a significant genetic component. AGC 1 carries a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism, which may be significant for the biomechanical properties of cartilage. It was shown that the most common allele with 27 tandem repeats is protective against hand OA (HOA) (odds ratio 0. 46, 95 % confidence interval 0. 27 – 0. 78). Also, carrying two copies of any of the shorter or longer alleles increased the risk of the disease. Inflammation seems {{to play a role in}} the etiology of OA and certain polymorphisms within the interleukin 1 gene cluster and IL 6 have been previously shown to increase the transcription of these molecules and to associate with OA. In this study it was shown that the G alleles in three common IL 6 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites are associated with the risk of more severe forms of HOA (p =   0. 001 for GGG haplotype). A SNP in IL 1 B associated with the bilateral form of the disease (p =   0. 006) and two IL 1 B-IL 1 RN extended haplotype alleles were associated with the same phenotype.

40|$|Diamond {{has been}} under {{spotlight}} in industry since the discovery of its extraordinary mechanical properties, high wear resistance and excellent chemical inertia. These properties enable diamond a competitive candidate for industrial and biomedical applications. In the present research, the tribological properties of two types of diamond materials, diamond reinforced ceramic composites and diamond coatings have been investigated. Experimental approaches consist of tribological investigation, electrochemical evaluation and characterization of diamond-reinforced ceramic composites (DRCC), thin nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) film, thin microcrystalline diamond (MCD) film and their functionalized derivatives. After the tribotest, phase transformation from diamond carbon (sp^(3)) to amorphous carbon (sp^(2)) is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy in the diamond composite. The surface roughness of the diamond grits {{was found to be}} greatly reduced due to wear. A tribo-electrochemical method is developed to in situ monitor the this amorphrization-wear process. It is discovered that the current density {{is a function of the}} excitation voltage in a sinusoidal pattern. The amplitude and period of the sinusoidal pattern reflect the intensity and the frequency of the process. For the diamond-cartilage contact, it is found that the coefficient <b>of</b> friction between <b>cartilage</b> Figure and diamond decreases with increasing load because real contact area is not linearly change with load. Even though the hydrogen treatment decreases the friction and ammonia treatment decreases adhesion and friction in dry conditions, the friction under lubrication is determined by synergy effects of number of bonds established and strength of single bond between <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cartilage</b> and the diamond surface.

However, when acting alone, MTDs or HMGB 1 did not upregulate cartilage degrading enzymes or iNOS. Conclusion. MTDs or HMGB 1 could only stimulate inflammatory response in chondrocytes with the presence of cytokines or Fn-f...|$|R
40|$|Collagen-induced {{arthritis}} (CIA) 1 is {{a chronic}} inflammatory arthropathy induced by immunizing rodents with type II collagen, the major matrix <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> hyaline <b>cartilage</b> (1, 2). Histopathologically, CIA in {{rats and mice}} {{is characterized by a}} proliferative synovitis that erodes the adjacent cartilage, ultimately producing articular injury and ankylosis (3, 4). In some rats, the auricles of the ear are also affected by an inflammatory chondritis (5, 6). Both articular and auricular lesions have been closely associated with an intense immune response to type II collagen that is controlled by genes within or closely linked to the major bistocompatibility loci (7 - 9). Because CIA shares clinical, histological, immunological, and genetic features with human rheumatoid arthritis and relapsing polychondritis, it may serve as an important model of these human diseases. The immunologic events resulting in arthritis have not been fully elucidated. Although the role of cell-mediated immunity in the pathogenesis of CIA is debated (10, 11), most investigators agree that antibodies to type II collagen are critically involved. We have found that CIA can be transferred from arthriti...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{epiphyseal}} dysplasia (MED) is {{a relatively}} mild and clinically variable osteochondrodysplasia, primarily characterized by delayed and irregular ossification of the epiphyses and early-onset osteoarthritis(1 - 3). Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and type IX collagen (COL 9 A 2 and COL 9 A 3) have previously been shown to cause different forms of MED (refs. 4 - 13). These dominant forms of MED (EDM 1 - 3) are caused by mutations in the genes encoding structural <b>proteins</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cartilage</b> extracellular matrix (ECM); these proteins interact with high affinity in vitro(14, 15). A recessive form of MED (EDM 4) has also been reported; it {{is caused by a}} mutation in the diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter gene(16) (SLC 26 A). A genomewide screen of family with autosomal-dominant MED not linked to the EDM 1 - 3 genes(17) provides significant genetic evidence for a MED locus on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2 p 24 -p 23), and a search for candidate genes identified MATN 3 (ref. 18), encoding matrilin- 3, within the critical region. Matrilin- 3 is an oligomeric protein that is present in the cartilage ECM. We have identified two different missense mutations in the exon encoding the von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain of matrilin- 3 in two unrelated families with MED (EDM 5). These are the first mutations to be identified in any of the genes encoding the matrilin family <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> and confirm a role for matrilin- 3 in the development and homeostasis <b>of</b> <b>cartilage</b> and bone...|$|R
40|$|The {{repetitive}} sequence GGLGY {{was found}} in lamprin, the most important matrix <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> lamprey annular <b>cartilage</b> by Keeley and co-workers. Similar sequences appear also in other proteins, i. e. elastin, spidroin, spider minor ampullate silk proteins, in matrix <b>proteins</b> <b>of</b> the chorion or egg shell membrane of insects and others. We synthesized (GGLGY) n, n= 1, 2, 6, because the sequence is repeated six times in the aggregated protein. The peptides were studied both in solution and in the solid state. Because the CD spectra were dominated by aromatic contribution, we synthesized GGLGF and GGLGA in order to carefully interpret the CD spectra. The conformational analysis suggests that all synthetic peptides do adopt the same secondary structure. In solution the peptides present a flexible conformation with {{a significant amount of}} PPII structure. In the solid state PPII, beta-pleated-sheets and beta-turns possibly co-exist...|$|R
40|$|The granule {{fraction}} of human leukocytes contains neutral protease capable of degrading the noncollagenous <b>protein</b> mucopolysaccharide matrix <b>of</b> <b>cartilage</b> at neutral pH in physiological salt solution. Cartilage degradation was monitored by quantitating {{the release of}} 35 S from labeled rabbit ear <b>cartilage.</b> Degradation <b>of</b> <b>cartilage</b> matrix occurs when intact viable human leukocytes are incubated with cartilage opsonized with aggregated human gamma globulin (AHGG). During a similar 4 h incubation period cells did not degrade uncoated cartilage or cartilage coated with nonaggregated gamma globulin. Cells remain viable during the enzyme release process {{as evidenced by the}} absence of a cytoplasmic enzyme marker (lactic dehydrogenase) in the supernatant and dye exclusion studies. The release of 35 S from labeled cartilage by human leukocytes in the presence <b>of</b> <b>cartilage</b> coated with AHGG (nonphagocytic enzyme release) was compared with the <b>cartilage</b> degrading activity <b>of</b> the supernatant from the same number of cells preincubated with a suspension of AHGG (phagocytic enzyme release). Nonphagocytic enzyme release by 5 x 106 cells provoked two to four times more 35 S and β-glucuronidase (β-G) release from cartilage than phagocytic enzyme release conditions. β-glucuronidase was used as an indicator of the release of lysosomal granule enzymes. By the use of selected pharmacological agents it was possible to dissociate the enzyme release process from intrinsic enzyme (neutral protease) activity. Neutral protease and β-G release by human cells in the presence <b>of</b> AHGG-coated <b>cartilage</b> was inhibited by 10 – 5 M colchicine, whereas the protease activity, but not the release process, was inhibited by 10 – 6 M gold thiomalate and 10 % human serum.

40|$|In {{contrast}} {{to all other}} vertebrate cartilages, the major extracellular matrix <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> lamprey <b>cartilages</b> is not collagen. Instead, there exists a unique family <b>of</b> noncollagenous structural <b>proteins,</b> the significance <b>of</b> which is not completely understood. A custom-built uniaxial testing apparatus was used to quantify and compare equilibrium stress-relaxation behavior (equilibrium moduli, stress decay behavior, recovery times and relaxation times) of (1) lamprey pericardial cartilages with perichondria tested in tension (young adult and aged), (2) annular cartilages without perichondria tested in compression (young adult and aged) and (3) bovine auricular cartilage samples without perichondria tested in both tension and compression. Results of this study demonstrated that all cartilages were highly viscoelastic but with varying relaxation times; approximately 120 min for annular and pericardial cartilages and 30 min for bovine auricular cartilages. For mean equilibrium moduli, young adult lamprey annular cartilages (0. 71 MPa) and pericardial cartilages (2. 87 MPa) {{were found to be}} statistically different. The mean moduli of all bovine auricular cartilages were statistically identical to lamprey cartilages except in the case of aged adult pericardial cartilages, which were statistically larger than all other cartilages at 4. 85 MPa. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} suggest that lamprey cartilages are able to exhibit mechanical properties largely similar to those <b>of</b> mammalian <b>cartilages</b> despite unique structural proteins and differences in extracellular matrix organization.

40|$|Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a common}} {{degenerative}} disease of joints and {{the main cause of}} elder patients' disability. Cartilage damage is a major problem in OA. To investigate the pathogenesis of OA, this study aimed to analyze the differential proteomics of chondrocytes in OA patients compared to normal chondrocytes. Materials and Methods: <b>Protein</b> extracts <b>of</b> <b>cartilages</b> prepared from 7 patients with end-stage OA, who were candidates for arthroplasty, were compared to 7 samples from normal cartilages. Proteins were analyzed by fluorescent gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) method and the differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Two samples were lost because of tissue insufficiency and the other because of mistransportation. Results: Among the 25 analyzed proteins, difference was seen for the 8 following proteins: osteonectine, cathepsin, chondroadherin, HSP, clustrine and collagen II, Activin A and carbonic Anhydrase. The levels of osteonectine, cathepsin, clustrine and collagen II were decreased in the OA samples compared to normal chondrocytes. Moreover, the levels of chondroadherin and Activin A were increased in the OA samples compared to normal chondrocytes. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the ability of the 2 D-DIGE/MS platform to identify proteins with altered expression in chondrocytes of patients with OA. The identification <b>of</b> these <b>proteins</b> may open new lines of research for the pathogenesis of OA...|$|R
40|$|The peptide DHLSDNYTLDHDRAIH (Link N), cleaved {{from the}} N-terminus <b>of</b> the link <b>protein</b> {{component}} <b>of</b> <b>cartilage</b> proteoglycan aggregates by {{the action of}} stromelysin, can act as a growth factor and stimulate synthesis of proteoglycans and collagen in articular cartilage [McKenna, Liu, Sansom and Dean (1998) Arthritis Rheum. 41, 157 - 161]. The mechanism by which this biologically active peptide is degraded and inactivated was investigated using U 937 monocytes as a model cell. Time-course experiments showed that two major proteases, an initial serine proteinase followed by a metalloproteinase, acted in sequence. Analysis of the resulting fragments showed that the serine endopeptidase cleavage was at the Leu(3) -Ser(4) bond to produce the peptide SDNYTLDHDRAIH. The terminal serine could then be removed from the resulting peptide by an aminopeptidase. A second metallopeptidase liberated the peptides SDNYTL or DNYTL from DHDRAIH by cleavage at the Leu(9) -Asp(10) bond. The DNYTL peptide intermediate was degraded too rapidly to allow sequencing and sequential aminopeptidase cleavages removed further amino acids from the N-terminus of the remaining DHDRAIH peptide. The identical patterns of breakdown that occurred when either whole cells or purified plasma membranes were used indicated that proteolysis and inactivation of Link N was carried out entirely by membrane-associated enzymes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To explore {{potential}} T-cell epitopes <b>of</b> {{the core}} <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> human <b>cartilage</b> proteoglycan aggrecan (PG) {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis. METHODS: Peptide-specific T-cell proliferation and cytokine/chemokine production in response to PG-specific peptides were measured in RA and osteoarthritis patients and in healthy controls. RESULTS: Peptides representing amino acid regions 16 - 39 and 263 - 282 of PG were most frequently recognised by T cells in a subset of patients with RA or osteoarthritis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these PG-reactive RA and osteoarthritis patients showed increased production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in response to PG peptide stimulation. As PG p 263 - 282 was found to show high sequence homology with Yersinia Yop protein, the corresponding bacterial (Yersinia) peptide was also tested. Remarkably, RA and osteoarthritis patients responding to the Yersinia peptide also responded to p 263 - 282 of PG suggesting a possibility of molecular mimicry in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that PG-specific peptides, located in the G 1 domain of PG, can induce (auto) antigenic T-cell responses in RA and osteoarthritis patients. These peptides might thus {{be involved in the}} immune pathogenesis and/or cartilage degradation in RA and osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterised by {{articular}} cartilage degradation {{and changes in}} associated joint tissues. It is a common condition, which causes significant pain and disability. Aetiological factors include age, mechanical stress, genetic predisposition and obesity. The exact sequence of molecular events in disease initiation and progression remains unclear. Treatment options are limited to symptom control and joint replacement surgery for severe disease. The aim {{of this research was}} to perform a global analysis of the gene expression and <b>protein</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>cartilage</b> during the early stages of OA. The destabilisation of the medial meniscus mouse (DMM) model of OA was used to study changes in the <b>cartilage</b> <b>of</b> operated or unoperated knee joints at two, four, and eight weeks following surgery. A new method was developed to retrieve {{articular cartilage}} from the mouse knee joint. This enabled proteomic analysis <b>of</b> the <b>cartilage</b> using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry. No significant changes were seen at two or four weeks; at eight weeks both intracellular and extracellular proteins had altered abundance including small leucine rich repeat proteoglycans (SLRPs) and proteins involved in energy production and the cytoskeleton. For whole genome expression profiling, RNA was isolated from cartilage at the same time points, amplified and hybridised to Mouse WG- 6 v 2. 0 Expression BeadChips. Validations were performed using real-time RT-PCR. Changes in gene expression were most marked at two weeks with up-regulation of metalloproteinases and SLRPs and markedly altered expression of cytoskeletal elements. These findings demonstrate the significant alteration of key biological processes related to cartilage degeneration early in the progression of OA.

40|$|SummaryObjectivePost-traumatic {{osteoarthritis}} (PTOA) occurs after {{anterior cruciate}} ligament (ACL) injury. PTOA may be initiated by early expression of proteolytic enzymes capable of causing degradation <b>of</b> the articular <b>cartilage</b> at time <b>of</b> injury. This study investigated the production of three of these key proteases in multiple joint tissues after ACL injury and subsequent markers <b>of</b> <b>cartilage</b> turnover. MethodsACL transection was performed in adolescent minipigs. Collagenase (MMP- 1 and MMP- 13) and aggrecanase (ADAMTS- 4) gene expression changes were quantified in the articular cartilage, synovium, injured ligament, and the provisional scaffold at days 1, 5, 9, and 14 post-injury. Markers of collagen degradation (C 2 C), synthesis (CPII) and aggrecan synthesis (CS 846) were quantified in the serum and synovial fluid. Histologic assessment <b>of</b> the <b>cartilage</b> integrity (OARSI scoring) was also performed. ResultsMMP- 1 gene expression was upregulated in the articular cartilage, synovium and ligament after ACL injury. MMP- 13 expression was suppressed in the articular cartilage, but upregulated 100 -fold in the synovium and ligament. ADAMTS- 4 was upregulated in the synovium and ligament {{but not in the}} articular <b>cartilage.</b> The concentration <b>of</b> collagen degradation fragments (C 2 C) in the synovial joint fluid nearly doubled in the first five days after injury. ConclusionWe conclude that upregulation of genes coding for <b>proteins</b> capable <b>of</b> degrading <b>cartilage</b> ECM is seen within the first few days after ACL injury, and this response is seen not only in chondrocytes, but also in cells in the synovium, ligament and provisional scaffold...|$|R
40|$|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc enzymes {{responsible}} for the degradation of the extracellular matrix. With this function, MMPs are involved in many physiological processes, but also in many pathological states. MMP- 13 is implicated in the degradation of type II collagen, the main structural <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> articular <b>cartilage,</b> contributing {{to the development of}} osteoarthritis and inflammatory diseases. In the last years, a new generation of potent and selective MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) has been identified and classified as non-zinc-binding inhibitors (NZBIs). Several MMP- 13 NZBIs have been developed and crystallographically determined in complex with the enzyme. Here, we provide a detailed review of the current knowledge about this class of MMP- 13 inhibitors and, by using computational procedures, we highlight the molecular determinants that are needed for the binding process. In particular, FLAP, a program based on GRID molecular interaction fields, was used to analyze the ligand-protein interactions: molecular shape and hydrogen bond acceptor groups strongly influence the binding according to the ligand-based modeling, while the aromatic interactions are better identified by the structure-based study. The complementary results can be combined in a high performance model, showing the effectiveness of molecular interaction field based approaches to search for novel MMP- 13 NZBIs...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} produced against chondroitinase-treated human adult cartilage proteoglycans {{were selected}} {{for their ability to}} recognize epitopes on native proteoglycans. Binding analyses revealed that four of these monoclonal antibodies (BCD- 4, BCD- 7, EFG- 4 and KPC- 190) each recognized a different epitope on the same proteoglycan molecule which represents a subpopulation of a high buoyant density (D 1) fraction <b>of</b> human articular <b>cartilage</b> proteoglycans (10, 30, 50 and 60 % in fetal-newborn, 1. 5 years old, 15 years old and 52 - 56 years old <b>cartilages,</b> respectively). Analysis <b>of</b> epitope specificities revealed that BCD- 7 and EFG- 4 monoclonal antibodies recognized epitopes on proteoglycan monomer which are associated with the protein structure in that they are sensitive to cleavage by Pronase, papain and alkali treatment and do not include keratan sulphate, chondroitin sulphate or oligosaccharides. The BCD- 4 and KPC- 190 epitopes also proved to be sensitive to Pronase or papain digestion or to alkali treatment, but keratanase or endo-beta-galactosidase also reduced the immunoreactivity of these epitopes. These observations indicate that the BCD- 4 and KPC- 190 epitopes represent peptides substituted with keratan sulphate or keratan sulphate-like structures. The BCD- 4 epitope is, however, absent from a keratan sulphate-rich fragment of human adult proteoglycan, while the other three epitopes were detected in this fragment.
