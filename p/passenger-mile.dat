2500|$|By comparison, {{a freeway}} lane {{expansion}} typically costs $1.0 million to $8.5 million per lane mile for two directions, {{with an average}} of $2.3 million. However, freeways are frequently built in suburbs or rural areas, whereas light rail tends to be concentrated in urban areas, where right of way and property acquisition is expensive. Similarly, the most expensive US highway expansion project was the [...] "Big Dig" [...] in Boston, Massachusetts, which cost $200 million per lane mile for a total cost of $14.6 billion. Since a light rail track can carry up to 20,000 people per hour as compared with 2,000–2,200 vehicles per hour for one freeway lane, light rail is comparable in construction cost to freeways on a per <b>passenger-mile</b> basis. For example, in Boston and San Francisco, light rail lines carry 9,600 and 13,100 passengers per hour, respectively, in the peak direction during rush hour.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the use of}} energy by Alaska’s transportation sectors {{to assess the impact}} of sudden fuel prices changes. We conducted three types of analysis: 1) Development of broad energy use statistics for each transportation sector, including total annual energy and fuel use, carbon emissions, fuel use per ton-mile and <b>passenger-mile,</b> and cost of fuel per ton-mile and <b>passenger-mile.</b> 2) Economic input-output analysis of air, rail, truck, and water transportation sectors. 3) Adjustment of input-output modeling to reflect sudden fuel price changes to estimate the potential impact on industry output and employment. Alaska air transportation used approximately 1. 9 billion gallons of fuel annually; 961 million gallons were used for intra-state and exiting Alaska flights. Water transportation used 101. 8 million gallons annually, approximately 84. 3 million gallons for intra-state and exiting segments. Railroad and truck transportation used 5. 1 and 8. 8 million gallons annually, respectively. Simulated fuel price increases resulted in an estimated $ 456. 8 million in value-added losses to the Alaska economy through the increase in cost of transportation services, as well as an equivalent loss in income to Alaska household of $ 26. 8 million. A carbon emissions tax would have the greatest impact on the cost of air transportation services followed by water, trucking and rail...|$|E

It is important for individuals and public officials to avoid overreacting to terrorist threats in ways that increase overall danger. Transit terrorism would cause more total casualties and harm to society if individuals respond to attacks by shifting from public transit to less safe modes, or if decision makers respond by reducing support for public transit.
