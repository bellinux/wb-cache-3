50|$|In France many {{varieties}} of <b>poularde</b> exist, including the <b>Poularde</b> de Bresse, the <b>Poularde</b> du Mans and the <b>Poularde</b> de Loué, which are generally {{protected by the}} AOC or Label Rouge certifications. The high price of these chickens meant that they were traditionally reserved for holiday meals, such as Christmas feasts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Poularde</b> Albufera, (Albufera Pullet) is {{a chicken}} dish {{attributed}} to French chef Adolphe Dugléré which was named {{in honour of}} the Duke of Albufera.

50|$|Poule, chapon, or <b>poularde</b> au riz is a dish in French cuisine {{consisting}} of a poached or braised chicken served with rice cooked in the chicken's cooking liquid or broth. It is sometimes compared to pilaf.|$|E
50|$|En vessie {{refers to}} a cooking method in which a meat or other dish is cooked in a (pig) bladder. A {{well-known}} application is with Bresse chicken: <b>Poularde</b> de Bresse en vessie; a prepared chicken is stuffed with foie gras, truffles, and other flavorings, then enclosed in the bladder and poached in chicken broth. The advantage of the method is that the meat does not {{come into contact with}} the cooking liquid; in <b>Poularde</b> de Bresse en vessie, the juices from the chicken all stay in the chicken, and turn into a flavorful jelly if the dish is served cold. The meat remains extremely moist. It has been likened to the cooking method of sous vide where meat is vacuum packed and cooked slowly in a water bath. A similar effect can be achieved by wrapping chicken in aluminum foil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Poularde</b> is culinary {{term for}} a chicken that is at least 120 days {{old at the time}} of {{slaughter}} and fattened with a rich diet that delays egg production.

The dishes he created there included panini au foie gras with an apricot based accompaniment, <b>poularde</b> marinated in Pepsi-Cola with popcorn, and panna cotta topped with caviar in a salted-butter caramel sauce. After the restaurant closed for renovations, he decided not to return. On a whim, Ludo asked his friend who owned Breadboard, Ali Chalabi, if he could take over the bakery at night for 3 months when it was otherwise closed. There he created a special event dining experience which ultimately became known as LudoBites and was deemed by LA Weeklys Pulitzer Prize-winning critic, Jonathan Gold, as [...] "a transforming moment in the Los Angeles restaurant scene." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, Clapisson soon {{decided to}} devote himself to {{composition}} instead. His first compositions were vocal pieces (quartets and duets) which were {{performed at the}} Paris Conservatory concert series from 1835. His first operatic work was La Figurante, a five-act opéra comique to a libretto by Eugène Scribe and Jean-Henri Dupin. It premiered on 24 August 1838. Twenty-one more would follow, almost all in the opéra comique genre, although he did produce one grand opera, Jeanne la folle, which premiered at the Paris Opera in 1848. His last work was an operetta, La <b>Poularde</b> de Caux. It was co-written with five other composers and premiered in 1861, the same year he was appointed professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatory. His most successful works were the opéras comiques La Promise (1854) and La Fanchonnette (1856). [...] His contemporary, Gustave Chouquet, wrote: ...|$|E
