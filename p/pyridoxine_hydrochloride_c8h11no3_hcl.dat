40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of water-soluble vitamins {{is very important}} in the food and pharmaceutical industries. A chemiluminescent method using flow injection is described for the {{determination of}} <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> Its detection limit, linearity and reproducibility were examined. The method is based on the enhancing effect of <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> on the chemiluminescence generated by the oxidation of luminol with hydrogen peroxide in aqueous potassium hydroxide and sodium oxalate. The proposed method is simple and inexpensive. The chemiluminescence intensity is a linear function of <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> concentration over the range 10 – 250 mg ml 1 with a detection limit of 6 mg ml 1. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by the determination of <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in different tablet formulations and some dietary sources...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is {{water-soluble}} B vitamin {{widely used}} for the prevention and treatment of vitamin B 6 deficiency and other several diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the effect of The Trivedi Effect® - Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment on the physicochemical and thermal properties of <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> using PXRD, PSA, DSC, and TGA/DTG analysis. <b>Pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was divided into two parts, one part of <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was considered as control (no Biofield Treatment was provided), while second part received The Trivedi Effect® - Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely by a renowned Biofield Energy Healer, Alice Branton. The PXRD analysis exhibited that the relative intensities and crystallite sizes of the most characteristic diffraction peaks in the Alice’s treated <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> were significantly decreased from 1. 59 % to 44. 47 % and 6. 31 % to 28. 28 %, respectively compared with the control sample. Overall, the average crystallite size of the treated sample was significantly reduced by 5. 55 % compared with the control sample. The particle size values at d 10, d 50, d 90, and D(4, 3) (average mass-volume diameter) in Alice’s treated sample were significantly reduced by 13. 87 %, 9. 95 %, 7. 87 %, and 6. 59 %, respectively compared to the control sample. The specific surface area of treated sample was significantly increased by 13. 67 % compared to the control sample. The DSC analysis revealed that the melting point of the treated sample was lower by 0. 20 % with a significant reduction of the latent heat of fusion by 24. 52 % compared with the control sample. The TGA analysis revealed that the total weight loss in the treated sample was increased by 1. 76 % compared with the control sample. The DTG analysis indicated that the maximum thermal degradation temperature of the treated sample was reduced by 0. 88 % compared to the control sample. Overall, the thermal analysis indicated that the thermal stability of the treated <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was declined compared to the control sample. Thus, The Trivedi Effect® might lead to the production of a polymorphic form of <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> which would be more soluble, absorbable, have a higher dissolution rate and be more bioavailable compared with the untreated sample. The Biofield Energy Treated <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> would be beneficial in the design of better nutraceutical and pharmaceutical formulations which might provide better therapeutic responses against vitamin B 6 deficiency, sideroblastic anemia, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, pyridoxine-dependency seizures, metabolic disorders, pulmonary tuberculosis, hyperhomocysteinemia, cancer, anxiety, asthma, depression, dysmenorrhea, etc...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{levels of}} pyridoxal- 5 '-phosphate (PLP), the active {{coenzyme}} form of vitamin B 6, {{were found to}} be significantly lower than normal in 22 out of 31 patients with decompensated cirrhosis or subacute hepatic necrosis.

Disease activity was monitored by clinical severity scores measuring the extent and degrees of erythema recorded by the investigator and symptom scores (daytime itch and nocturnal sleep disturbance) recorded by parents.

40|$|Two UV {{spectrophotometric}} {{methods have}} been developed, based on first derivative spectrophotometry for simultaneous estimation of doxylamine succinate, <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> and folic acid in tablet formulations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sustained {{intestinal}} {{delivery of}} thiamine hydrochloride (Vitamin B 1; VB 1) and <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (Vitamin B 6; VB 6) {{seems to be}} a feasible alternative to existing therapy. The vitamins (VB 1 /VB 6) intercalated in montmorillonite (MMT) and intercalated VB 1 /VB 6 -MMT hybrid is further used for synthesis of VB 1 /VB 6 -MMT-alginate nanocomposite beads by gelation method and in vitro release in the intestinal environment. The structure and surface morphology of the synthesized VB 1 /VB 6 -MMT hybrid, VB 1 /VB 6 -alginate and VB 1 /VB 6 -MMT-alginate nanocomposite beads were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, TGA and SEM. In vitro release experiments revealed that the VB 1 /VB 6 releases suddenly from VB 1 /VB 6 -MMT hybrid and is pH dependent. The controlled release of VB 1 /VB 6 from VB 1 /VB 6 -MMT-alginate nanocomposite beads was observed to be controlled as compared to their release from VB 1 /VB 6 -MMT hybrid and VB 1 /VB 6 -alginate beads.
