Around two-thirds of participants reported perceiving the demonstration of various stereotyping by police officers during interviews, half of whom indicated that the interviewers demonstrated racial/religious stereotypes via discriminatory behaviour. Given the potential and serious consequences of such racial/religious stereotypes and discriminatory behaviour, further training of police officers seems necessary to improve both interviewing performance and community cohesion...|$|E
40|$|On 26 January 2011, the Home Secretary {{unveiled}} {{the outcome of}} the much-anticipated Counter-Terrorism Review, which straddled a political fault line between Conservative and Liberal Democrat policies. This article considers the impact of that review on the treatment of terrorist suspects. It is suggested that the review was both over-inclusive and under-inclusive in scope. While welcome reform and rebalancing has been instigated in some areas, the review represents missed opportunities in others, and on occasion offers little more than modest rebranding of pre-existing powers. It is argued that the review falls short of its target in three main areas: consideration should have been given to the use {{of a wide range of}} commonly charged terrorism offences; diplomatic assur- ances that individuals will not be subjected to ill-treatment following their deportation still need to be meaningfully assessed and reformed; and the regime which is set to replace control orders requires careful scrutiny. More welcome advances are clear in relation to the use of <b>pre-charge</b> <b>detention</b> and powers of stop and search. It is contended that the current political momentum needs to be seized if further advances are to be made in restoring the balance of civil liberties in these areas...|$|E
40|$|The pre-emptive element {{has become}} an {{important}} part of the UK’s national counter-terrorism strategy. The UK domestic counter-terrorism operations in August and September 2006, against a suspected Islamist terrorist plot to bomb transatlantic airliners and against suspected terrorist training activities, are important examples of the pre-emptive element of the UK’s national counter-terrorism strategy. This resource-intensive strategy, in terms of the demands it makes on the intelligence services and the police, places great emphasis on maximising public protection by early intervention action. The alleged airliner bomb plot is believed to have been based upon the use of the easily obtained, though volatile when mixed, components for peroxide-based explosives. Such explosives pose major challenges to airline transport security arrangements, with the need to balance more intensive screening processes with the necessity to process passengers as rapidly as possible. The terrorist training case offers further potential evidence of the need for Western Europe to be alert to the domestic element within current Islamist terrorist activities. Finally, the analysis illustrates the utility of recent UK terrorism law changes in the Terrorism Act 2006, such as a longer <b>pre-charge</b> <b>detention</b> period...|$|E
40|$|The {{attacks against}} the United States of America (US) on 11 September 2001 {{paved the way for}} the coming into effect of much {{counter-terrorism}} legislation across the world. Ethiopia is one of the countries that have introduced new legislation on terrorism, which is mainly drawn from the UK and, to a lesser extent, from the US. The aim of this thesis is to comprehensively assess Ethiopia's counter-terrorism legislation in light of the experiences of the UK and the US in dealing with terrorism. Furthermore, this thesis discusses the consequences of ‘copying' Western counter-terrorism legislation into Ethiopian culture, drawing particular attention to the need for a proper balance between legitimate security interests and the protection of fundamental rights. This thesis is organized as follows. The first chapter introduces the significance, methodology, limitation, and scope of the thesis. The second chapter discusses the development of Ethiopian legal system, human rights and counterterrorism measures. Moving forwards, chapter three seeks to analyse two important factors encapsulated within the right to freedom of expression; that is, the content and medium of the expression and the identity of the speaker/publisher. The relevance of these factors in giving effect to the right to freedom of expression is evaluated in light of the need to protect against the incitement and/or encouragement of terrorism. The chapter then deepens its critical assessment by reviewing the difficulty of implementing these factors in Ethiopia. Chapter four seeks to widen the debate by exploring the legal regimes governing intercept evidence - an issue of great importance in terrorism discourse. The chapter critically examines why intercept evidence obtained through a warrant is inadmissible in UK courts. Additionally, this chapter compares the position of the UK with that of the US, isolating areas of similarities and differences with a view to comparing the Ethiopian position on intercept communications. Chapter five focuses on the arrest of individuals on suspicion of terrorism and the length of <b>pre-charge</b> <b>detention</b> under the three countries selected for this research. This chapter will then explore whether there is a need for a watered down version of ‘reasonable suspicion' in terrorism cases. This chapter further considers Ethiopia's position with regard to the level of knowledge required to execute arrests, considering whether Ethiopia could and should reflect on the UK's position in attempting to facilitate a greater accordance with fundamental rights by shortening the 120 days <b>pre-charge</b> <b>detention</b> currently available to police when arresting individuals on suspicion of terrorism. The final chapter draws on the preceding debate and provides the concluding remarks on the thesis...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a new dataset dubbed LeRIT which identifies the legislative response to international terrorism in 20 liberal Western democracies, 2001 – 08. The dataset distinguishes 30 regulations governments may implement {{with the intention}} of reducing the risk of terrorist attacks. LeRIT covers legislation dealing with, inter alia, the rights of the executive to intercept, collect and store communications for anti-terrorist purposes, changes in <b>pre-charge</b> <b>detention</b> for terror suspects and modifications of immigration regimes. I aggregate these distinct regulations into three composite indices, distinguishing according to the main target of regulations, citizens, suspects, and immi-grants. This dataset contributes to the analysis of the consequences of international terrorism and provides a detailed account of the patterns in the legislative response to international terrorism from 2000 to 2008. I show that while all liberal Western democracies reinforced their counter-terrorist legislation, the scope of countries ’ regulatory response to terrorism differed largely. Some countries (i. e. the UK and the USA) implemented the full battery of regulatory responses while others (i. e. Scandinavian countries but also Canada and Switzerland) remained reluctant to cut deeply into the net of civil rights for citizens, suspects and immigrants alike. To further demonstrate the potential usefulness of the dataset, the article includes an example of analysis on the legislative response to international terror-ism. The reported baseline model suggests that a combination of risk assessment and political factors influence gov-ernments ’ willingness to cut deep into the net of civil rights...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} UK Terrorism Act 2000 ’s stop and search and <b>pre-charge</b> <b>detention</b> powers against liberty and {{security}} rights. It proposes that criminalizing ‘terrorism’, and legitimacy of counter-terrorism laws, depends on moral and legal norms defining legitimate sovereign power. External norms of territorial sovereignty and non-intervention define and legitimize external defensive {{actions by the}} state to protect nation state security. Individual liberty and security rights, specifically pursuant to article 9, ICCPR and article 5 ECHR, have a special moral and legal status externally, but are not universally determinative of sovereign legitimacy. The thesis argues that these external norms accommodate contrasting paradigms of internal legitimacy, the ‘security state’ and the ‘liberal state’. Conceptually, sovereign legitimacy in the former is grounded on heteronymous collective or ideological values, grounding fundamental obligations legitimizing ‘balancing’ of individual liberty and security against security of those ultimate norms. The ‘balancing metaphor’ and exceptionalist theories are conceptually located within the security state paradigm. Conversely, political and individual autonomy (liberty and security of the person) circumscribe legitimacy of liberal state action, grounding fundamental obligations to prevent and punish harms, and to refrain from violating individual autonomy unless justified by those obligations. Liberal rule of law standards, including due process rights, are legitimized by the instrumental role of law as the primary source of justification in the liberal state. Evaluating the policy justifications, enactment, and scope of the TA provisions against those norms, the thesis concludes they contradict liberal norms, violate international norms and individual legal rights to liberty and security, and undermine {{the rule of law and}} due process rights. The pre-emptive counter-terrorism policy, balancing national security against individual liberty, and degradation of due process rights, belies a security state approach.

40|$|Following {{the attacks}} of 11 September 2001, the United Kingdom (UK) Government was the only state party to {{introduce}} new anti-terrorism legislation which required a formal derogation from its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It then subsequently proposed further anti-terrorism measures. These either necessitate derogation once more or raise issues of compatibility with the ECHR. For derogation from human rights obligations, as outlined by Article 15, to be deemed justified, not only should a ‘war or other public emergency threatening {{the life of the}} nation’ exist but the measures taken should also be ‘strictly required by the exigencies of the situation’. This article analyses whether such justification existed and the affect on the right to liberty and security of the new legislation. Throughout, the comparative legal response taken in Spain is examined, on the basis that Spain’s geographical position and experience of terrorism is analogous to that of the UK. While the European Court affords a margin of appreciation to states when assessing potential human rights abuses, this similarity affords a chance to assess whether the UK’s situation was in any way unique, while also illustrating whether other options of dealing with the terrorist threat exist, which are less in conflict with the country’s human rights obligations. The measures introduced before 11 September 2001 (9 / 11) to deal with Basque separatism and the conflict in Northern Ireland, and then the approach taken afterwards, relating to <b>pre-charge</b> <b>detention</b> and the right to an effective defence, are scrutinized. Allowing that threats might differ in scale and immediacy, in a climate where anti-terrorism is very much at the forefront of states’ priorities it is essential to ensure that human rights continue to be respected, rather than sacrificed. The question throughout this article is whether the UK’s legislation is justified and proportionate, or whether certain measures stem less from the existence of an actual emergency and more from a politicised construal of risk which seeks to avoid international obligations to allay public fears. While Spain’s treatment of suspected terrorists is in no way free from criticism, it is perhaps its attitude and outward dedication to full respect for internationally acknowledged human rights that forms a stark contrast to those of the UK...|$|E
40|$|We need a watch {{kept on the}} {{operation}} of Australia’s terrorism laws, writes ANDREW LYNCH THE return of the jury verdicts {{in the trial of}} Abdul Nacer Benbrika and others was correctly described as “the most successful terrorist prosecution that this country has seen” by the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland. But does this mean the laws are “working”? Despite the successful prosecution of Benbrika and others, and also the acquittal of some of their associates, the role that aspects of our anti-terrorism laws might be playing in national security is still open to question. Mr McClelland refrained from asserting the laws were perfect, but instead remarked that the government examines their operation generally on an “ongoing basis. ” That is reassuring, but there is a strong case for the ongoing review of the laws to be independent from the government. The Senate’s Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee is currently holding an inquiry to determine whether to create an Independent Reviewer of Australia’s terrorism laws. Where has this idea come from, and how would an Independent Reviewer help? The Liberal MP Petro Georgiou first called for an Independent Reviewer in October 2005 - during the debate over the Howard government’s introduction of control orders, sedition offences, and the banning of organisations for advocacy. He suggested that public alarm over the new laws would be eased by the creation of a sort of terrorism watchdog - modelled closely on the office of Independent Reviewer in the United Kingdom. Earlier this year, Georgiou introduced a private member’s bill to this end, arguing that “the challenge of protecting security without undermining fundamental rights requires constant vigilance, {{but the reality is that}} the machinery of vigilance in Australia is deficient. ” This has the support of experts and two bipartisan parliamentary committee reports. But disappointingly both the Howard and the Rudd governments have been cooler in their enthusiasm for the creation of an office of Independent Reviewer. When Georgiou introduced his Bill in the House of Representatives in March, the new government shut the debate down. The Bill was since been brought to the Senate by concerned Liberals. The Commonwealth probably suspects that the Reviewer will be a thorn in their side - but this is not at all borne out by experience in the United Kingdom. The position of Independent Reviewer was first created there to review “temporary” laws dealing with terrorism stemming from Northern Ireland. The office now exists mainly to review laws designed in the wake of September 11. The Reviewer, Lord Alex Carlile, reports annually to the Home Secretary about {{the operation}} of terrorism laws, taking into account both their effectiveness and impact upon individuals. Carlile also offers opinions on proposed changes to the law and also responds to ad hoc requests for reports from the government or parliament. These reports are used to inform political and public debate. On the whole, the Independent Reviewer is regarded as a success in the United Kingdom, though there has been some concern that the Reviewer is not “independent” enough. The UK Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights has recommended that Carlile should report directly to the legislature not the government, and it expressed surprise at Carlile’s unwillingness to offer clear criticism of some of the laws. When Carlile strongly supported the Brown government’s law allowing 42 day <b>pre-charge</b> <b>detention,</b> one commentator described him as “an enthusiastic advocate for the government. ” There are several lessons for Australia from Britain’s experience of an Independent Reviewer. The positives are clear. First, ongoing and integrated examination of how the complex body of anti-terrorism law works enables early identification of inherent problems. Second, it helps to depoliticise the very contentious debates about these laws and their importance overall to national security efforts. Third, it reassures the community that a kind of “watchdog” exists to report publicly on laws which they fear might be used against them. At the same time, the Georgiou bill should avoid some of the negative issues which have clouded praise of the UK’s Reviewer. The most important move would be to establish not one but several Independent Reviewers who function as a panel. This allows a range of perspectives and expertise while minimising the risk that the office is seen as too ready to accept the government’s position. Thankfully, Australia has little history of political violence. But we are overconfident if we think we have perfected our approach to the creation and implementation of laws in this complex area, while a jurisdiction like the UK, with decades of experience of terrorism, sees value in subjecting its laws to continual review. In the Lodhi case of 2006, Chief Justice Spigelman described Australia’s terrorism laws as “a special, and in many ways unique, legislative regime. ” It seems prudent to keep a steady eye on their operation. • Andrew Lynch is director of the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales Photo: Timothy Schenck/iStockphoto. co...|$|E
40|$|Serious {{breaches}} {{of human}} rights demand redress, writes ANDREW LYNCH   WHEN is saying “sorry” for past wrongs and injustices not enough? When should an apology be accompanied by compensation? Is an apology without more just a hollow gesture?   These questions {{lie at the heart}} of two major issues with which the new Rudd government must grapple over coming months. One is the long-anticipated formal apology for the past practice of forcibly removing Indigenous children from their families. The second is the fallout from the recent treatment of former terrorism suspect Dr Mohamed Haneef, which is slated for a judicial inquiry. In both cases, the parties affected are claiming a right to compensation but the government and perhaps many members of the public may not want to go that far. Over a decade ago, the Bringing Them Home report on the Stolen Generation found that regardless of any good intentions, “gross violations” of the human rights of indigenous families and communities had occurred and continued to blight their lives. Many Australians were frustrated by the refusal of the previous prime minister to apologise for these deeds carried out under the authority of the Commonwealth. So the preparedness of Kevin Rudd to do so is most welcome - though real efforts must be made to win over that portion of the public who were persuaded by the speciousness of the previous government’s arguments against saying “sorry. ” Perhaps it was with this group in mind that Jenny Macklin, the Indigenous affairs minister, made it clear earlier this week that any apology will not come with compensation for the damage done. The Rudd government doubtless thinks an official apology will be easier to accomplish if it is unencumbered by additional controversy. That may be so, but it doesn’t make it right. An apology without any attempt at atonement is a meanly given thing. Damaged lives and destroyed families denied even the prospect of a remedy, however belated, can draw little solace from an apology alone. The minister’s argument that instead of compensation it would be “far more productive to really put that money into addressing the very serious levels of disadvantage that still exist in indigenous communities” ignores that this is already an obligation upon the government. Closing the gap between indigenous peoples and the rest of us is obviously vital - but let’s not pretend that the provision of decent services, opportunities and the right to be protected from violence and abuse squares off any obligation the nation has to those individuals who were previously taken away from their families and cut off from their culture purely on the basis of their race. In contrast to Macklin’s comments on the Stolen Generation, there has been no signal as to how the government feels about compensating Dr Haneef for his ordeal at the hands of the Australian Federal Police and the former Minister for Immigration, Kevin Andrews. Andrews’s use of the Migration Act to keep Haneef detained was comprehensively discredited by a full bench of the Federal Court just before Christmas. So Haneef has his Australian work visa back, but on the weekend he indicated that he feels he is owed some compensation for the damage done to his career and reputation. Obviously it is ridiculous to suggest that everyone charged with a crime and detained should receive some redress when the case is dropped or they are ultimately acquitted. But Haneef is a unique case. His <b>pre-charge</b> <b>detention</b> was extraordinarily long - twelve days - due to the powers given to police under new anti-terrorism laws. His winning of bail through a judicial process was immediately negated by the intervention of a government minister which since been confirmed as having no legal justification. During the affair, grave aspersions were cast on Dr Haneef’s character and involvement in terrorist activity. It is hard to imagine how this treatment could not be said to have caused him damage justifying a remedy. Common to calls for compensation heard this week from Haneef and from the indigenous community is the challenge to the government, and indeed the Australian public, to recognise that serious breaches {{of human rights}} demand redress. Other communities appear far more comfortable with this. Canada, for instance, has not only established a compensation scheme for its aboriginal population who suffered through removal to “residential schools,” it recently paid out a former terrorism suspect whom its police force had allowed to be detained and mistreated by American agencies. The deprivation by the state of a person’s liberty without justification and absent a fair process is the most fundamental denial of an individual’s freedom. Compensation can go some way to making amends for its consequences. It also has the advantage of strongly impressing upon governments that they should not allow rights to be similarly disregarded in the future. • Andrew Lynch is director of the Terrorism and the Law project at the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law, University of NSW.
