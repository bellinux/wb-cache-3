50|$|PaintShop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate was {{released}} {{towards the end}} of life of PaintShop Pro Photo X2, in September 2008. It included 150 additional picture frames and Picture Tubes, the programs Background Remover, Corel Painter Photo Essentials 4, and <b>Photorecovery,</b> as well as RAW support for 250 cameras and a 2GB flash drive.|$|E
40|$|Various {{experiments}} are described which show {{the locus of}} action of ultraviolet radiation and of x-ray in delaying cell division of the fertilized egg of Arbacia punctulata {{to be in the}} nucleus. <b>Photorecovery</b> following ultraviolet radiation has its locus in the egg cytoplasm. Analogy is drawn with the action of ultraviolet radiation and <b>photorecovery</b> on the E. coli-bacteriophage system, and certain suggestions are made regarding a common mechanism. <b>Photorecovery</b> after x-ray exposure could not be demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The ultrafast excited-state {{dynamics}} {{underlying the}} receptor state <b>photorecovery</b> is {{resolved in the}} M 100 A mutant of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) from Halorhodospira halophila. The M 100 A PYP mutant, with its distinctly slower photocycle than wt PYP, allows isolation of the pB signaling state for study of the photodynamics of the protonated chromophore cis-p-coumaric acid. Transient absorption signals indicate a subpicosecond excited-state proton-transfer reaction in the pB state that results in chromophore deprotonation prior to the cis-trans isomerization required in the <b>photorecovery</b> dynamics of the pG state. Two terminal photoproducts are observed, a blue-absorbing species presumed to be deprotonated trans-p-coumaric acid and an ultraviolet-absorbing protonated photoproduct. These two photoproducts are hypothesized to originate from an equilibrium of open and closed folded forms of the signaling state,...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{is given}} for <b>photorecovery</b> of Anacystis nidulans after {{exposures}} to Co 60 gamma radiation. After irradiation {{the levels of}} viable cells were higher in cultures kept in white light than in cultures kept dark for 24 hr. The post-irradiation survival rate increase after 30 -min exposures to visible light is demonstrated in cultures irradiated with 35 krad. An increase in survival rates was not observed after exposures to ?red' light...|$|E
40|$|The {{demonstration}} of five different effects of ultraviolet radiation {{on the sea}} urchin's egg indicates {{that more than one}} basic photochemical process goes on there. <b>Photorecovery</b> is observed in only one of these. The need for caution in interpreting such effects is obvious. Evidence for a different mechanism for the timing of cleavage in eggs activated by ultraviolet radiation as compared to normally fertilized eggs is presented. The bearing of these studies on survival curves for microorganisms is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Three {{independently}} isolated {{ultraviolet light}} sensitive (uvs) mutants of Anacystis nidulans were characterized. Strain uvs- 1 showed the highest sensitivity to UV by its greatly reduced photoreactivation capacity following irradiation. Pretreatment with caffeine suppressed the dark-survival curve of strain uvs- 1, thus indicating {{the presence of}} excision enzymes involved in dark repair. Under 'black' and 'white' illumination, strain uvs- 1 shows <b>photorecovery</b> properties comparable with wild-type cultures. Results indicate that strains uvs- 1, uvs- 35, and uvs- 88 are probably genetically distinct UV-sensitive mutants...|$|E
40|$|Three {{independently}} isolated ultraviolet light-sensitive (uvs) mutants of Anacystis nidulans were characterized. Strain uvs- 1 {{was most}} sensitive to UV {{in the absence}} of photoreactivation. Pretreatment with caffeine suppressed the dark-survival curve of strain uvs- 1, indicating the presence of excision enzymes involved in dark repair. Under “black” and “white” illumination, strain uvs- 1 displays photoreactivation properties nearly comparable to wild-type culture. Mutants uvs- 35 and uvs- 88 appeared to have partial <b>photorecovery</b> capacities. Upon pretreatment with chloramphenicol, photoreactivation properties of strains uvs- 1 and uvs- 88 were not evident although the partial photoreactivation characteristics of strain uvs- 35 remained the same. Data indicate that strains uvs- 1, uvs- 35, and uvs- 88 are probably genetically distinct UV-sensitive mutants...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of UVA and visible radiation on the acute damage by {{short-wave ultraviolet radiation}} (UVR) (λ < 320 nm) was investigated in human volunteers, using delayed erythema and sunburn cell production as markers of injury. It was found that subsequent exposure to UVA + visible radiation produced a significant reduction of the threshold erythema dose by short-wave UVR, in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequent exposures to varying doses of UVA + visible radiation, {{as well as to}} visible light alone failed to influence sunburn cell production. It is concluded that there is a positive interaction between short-wave UVR and UVA in the induction of delayed erythema, but this may not apply to epidermal cell injury. <b>Photorecovery</b> was not observed...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} done to {{demonstrate}} quantitatively and graphically {{the way in which}} suberythemogenic doses of broadband UVA and UVB interact in producing a visible erythema. On the backs of fair-skinned human volunteers the minimal erythema dose (MED) was determined for polychromatic UVA and UVB. Increasing fractions of the UVA MED were given to sites already exposed to various fractions of the UVB MED resulting in sites exposed to various doses of both UVA and UVB. The same experiment was repeated with the order of wave- bands reversed. It was demonstrated that when UVA was followed by UVB an erythema was produced in those sites where the sum of the fractions was equal to one, an interaction termed photoaddition. When the UVA exposure followed the UVB, erythema was again predominantly noted in those sites demonstrating photoaddition. However, in the latter case, numerous sites of threshold erythema were noted where the sum of the fractions was greater than one. This is suggestive of <b>photorecovery.</b> No evidence of photoaugmentation was observed with either order of exposure...|$|E
40|$|Immediate pigment darkening (IPD) was induced on {{the backs}} of 11 human volunteers of skin types III and IV by exposing the skin to UVA {{radiation}} (382 nm). The minimum erythema dose (MED) of UVB radiation was also determined by exposing sites to graduated doses of 304 nm radiation. The order of exposure of distinct anatomic areas was as follow: (1) UVB followed by IPD induction; (2) IPD induction followed by UVB; (3) IPD induction followed 3 h later by UVB; and (4) UVB only. Erythema responses induced by UVB were graded by inspection 24 h later and the MEDs in the 4 areas were compared. The induction of IPD before UVB exposure caused no significant change in the MED compared to sites receiving UVB only, or receiving UVA radiation after UVB, confirming that the IPD reaction does not protect against UVB-induced erythema. There was also no evidence of <b>photorecovery,</b> i. e., an increase in the MED of UVB resulting from exposure to longer wavelength, UV or visible radiation following UVB exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} ozone {{depletion}} over the Antarctic continent {{has resulted in}} the increase of incident ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation, whose effects may be damaging to living organisms. To counteract the negative effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), aquatic organisms may display one or more strategies: (1) avoidance (i. e. deep distri-bution); (2) photoprotection through the use of ‘‘sunscreen’ ’ compounds, such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs); and (3) enzymatic repair of the damage. The effects of UVR were assessed on four populations of the copepod Boeckella poppei from Antarctic lakes using laboratory and field experiments. The results were related to measurements of DNA enzymatic repair activity and MAA concentration. This is the first study that combines these measurements in zooplankton. Boeckella poppei was highly tolerant to UVR (LD 50 5 2. 2 – 2. 78 J cm 22). However, measurements of <b>photorecovery</b> (comparison of UVB mortality in the presence and absence of photoreactivating light) and dosage of photolyase activity indicated low rates of enzymatic repair, which {{may be the result of}} low temperatures typical of Antarctic lakes. Three different MAAs were identified, both in phytoplankton and copepods: porphyra- 334, mycosporine-glycine, and shinorine. The population of B. poppei from Lake Boeckella had the lowes...|$|E
40|$|Lower {{vertebrates}} {{can detect}} UV light with the pineal complex independently of eyes. Electrophysiological studies, together with chromophore extraction analysis, {{have suggested that}} the underlying pigment in the lamprey pineal exhibits a bistable nature, that is, reversible photoreaction by UV and visible light, which is never achieved by known UV pigments. Here we addressed the molecular identification of the pineal UV receptor. Our results showed that the long-hypothesized pigment is a lamprey homologue of parapinopsin, which exhibits an absorption maximum at 370 nm, in the UV region. UV light causes cis-trans isomerization of its retinal 2 chromophore, forming a stable photoproduct having an absorption maximum at 515 nm, in the green region. The photoproduct reverts to the original pigment upon visible light absorption, showing photoregeneration of the pigment. In situ hybridization showed that parapinopsin is selectively expressed in the cells located in the dorsal region of the pineal organ. We successfully obtained the hyperpolarizing responses with a maximum sensitivity of ≈ 380 nm from the photoreceptor cells at the dorsal region, in which the outer segment was clearly stained with anti-parapinopsin antibody. These results demonstrated that parapinopsin is the pineal UV pigment having photointerconvertible two stable states. The bistable nature of the parapinopsin can account for the <b>photorecovery</b> of the pineal UV sensitivity by background green light in the lamprey. Furthermore, we isolated the parapinopsin homologues from fish and frog pineal complexes that exhibit UV sensitivity, suggesting that parapinopsin is a common molecular basis for pineal UV reception in the vertebrate...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experiments on}} the effects of ultraviolet radiation and of x-rays on the eggs and sperm of the sea urchin Arbacia punclulata, carried out during the summer of 1950. 1 These, together with earlier findings already described (Blum and Price, 1950 a, b; Blum, Loos, and Robinson, 1950) permit certain conclusions to be reached regarding the locus of action of these radia-' tions, and that of <b>photorecovery</b> after ultraviolet radiation. To aid in understanding the rationale of the experiments and their interpretation the results will be briefly recapitulated. Locus of Delay of Cleavage In moderate doses both ultraviolet radiation and x-ray delay cell division (cleavage) of the eggs of the sea urchin. To determine the locus of this action advantage was taken {{of the fact that the}} eggs of Arbacia can be separated by centrifugation into nucleate and enucleate halves. Thus whole eggs, nucleate, or enucleate halves may be exposed to ultraviolet or x-radiation, either before or after fertilization with normal sperm. Or the sperm may be exposed to the radiation before it is used to fertilize the eggs or halves. The various combinations are indicated in Text-fig. 1 A, which also summarizes our findings with regard to delay of cleavage by ultraviolet radiation. Cleavage is delayed in all cases except when the enucleate half is exposed to ultraviolet radiation before fertilization with normal sperm. This is also the only case in which the part that receives the radiation contains no nucleus. If the sperm nucleus is introduced into the enucleate half by fertilization before exposure, or if the sperm itself is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, there is delay of cleavage. We conclude that the locus of action of the radiation is the nucleus or something closely associated with the nucleus...|$|E
