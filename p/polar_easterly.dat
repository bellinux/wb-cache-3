50|$|There {{are many}} ancient land {{features}} {{scattered throughout the}} village, as exemplified by placenames such as Ballyara and Turoe. The townland of D4 Lakafinna, to the South of Bullaun, contains an old castle and the local water scheme. It is local folklore that an unused tunnel exists between this castle and close to a house in Ballyara formerly of Paddy Finnerty. There is also a river which flows through Bullaun which used to have vast quantities of fresh water salmon of high quality. A well known place for fishing this quality fish was down behind Mick Brophy's turf shed. There are no salmon there nowadays as over fishing and pollution has caused them to be virtually extinct in East Galway. Bullaun is renowned for its clean air. In 2011 it won the award for cleanest air in Ireland. This was later revoked however as the air coming across from Killimordaly and Loughrea (usually a <b>Polar</b> <b>Easterly</b> breeze) {{was said to have}} contaminated the clean air over Bullaun. A committee was set up at the time to try to stop this and {{it remains to be seen}} what the outcome of this committee will be.|$|E
40|$|An Early Cretaceous {{siliceous}} large igneous province (SLIP) {{that developed}} {{on the eastern}} margin of Gondwana produced {{some of the most}} voluminous siliceous volcaniclastic deposits known globally. We report U-Pb ages and trace-element and Hf-isotopic signatures of detrital zircons from the Madura Shelf (onshore Bight Basin), Western Australia. These zircons include a geochemically distinct 106 Ma component with age and Hf characteristics that match SLIP volcanics some 2300 km distant in eastern Australia. This young subpopulation shows limited grain abrasion, which contrasts with older detrital components that are stratigraphically persistent. Regional detrital zircon provenance demonstrates that sediment routing systems were disconnected in the eastern and western Bight Basin, negating terrestrial transport mechanisms as a possible vector of the zircons from the SLIP to their recovered position. Palynology indicates that the 106 Ma zircons are syn-depositional, and we interpret them as being significantly transported in an eruption plume. Given the grain size and distance from source, such distal zircon emplacement suggests previously undocumented 106 Ma super-eruptions. The 106 Ma zircons likely reflect Southern Hemisphere winter eruptions when tropospheric <b>polar</b> <b>easterly</b> winds would have been favored across southeastern Australia. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{idealized}} {{investigations of}} Southern Ocean overturning have omitted its {{connection with the}} Antarctic continental shelves, leaving the influence of shelf processes on Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) export unconsidered. In particular, the contribution of mesoscale eddies to setting the stratification and overturning circulation in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is well established, yet their role in cross-shelf exchange of water masses remains unclear. This study proposes a residual-mean theory that elucidates the connection between Antarctic cross-shelf exchange and overturning in the ACC, and the contribution of mesoscale eddies to the export of AABW. The authors motivate and verify this theory using an eddy-resolving process model of a sector of the Southern Ocean. The strength and pattern of the simulated overturning circulation strongly resemble those of the real ocean and are closely captured by the residual-mean theory. Over the continental slope baroclinic instability is suppressed, and so transport by mesoscale eddies is reduced. This suppression of the eddy fluxes also {{gives rise to the}} steep “V”-shaped isopycnals that characterize the Antarctic Slope Front in AABW-forming regions of the continental shelf. Furthermore, to produce water on the continental shelf that is dense enough to sink to the deep ocean, the deep overturning cell must be at least comparable in strength to wind-driven mean overturning on the continental slope. This results in a strong sensitivity of the deep overturning strength to changes in the <b>polar</b> <b>easterly</b> winds...|$|E

50|$|The <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> (also <b>Polar</b> Hadley cells) are the dry, cold {{prevailing}} {{winds that}} blow from the high-pressure {{areas of the}} polar highs at the North and South Poles towards low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Cold air subsides at the poles creating the high pressure, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is then deflected westward by the Coriolis effect. Unlike the westerlies in the middle latitudes, the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> are often weak and irregular. These prevailing winds blow from the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> {{are one of the}} five primary wind zones, known as wind belts, that make up our atmosphere's circulatory system. This particular belt of wind begins at approximately 60 degrees north and south latitude and reaches to the poles. When air moves near the poles, cold temperatures shrink the air. This promotes air from warmer latitudes to flow into the area, causing a polar high-pressure zone. Air from this high-pressure zone then rushes toward the low-pressure zone surrounding the sub-polar region. This flow of air is altered by the Earth's rotation and deflected west, hence the name between high- and low-pressure zones, its path is deflected—as we saw with the polar easterlies—thanks to the rotation of the Earth. All of this unequal heat, rushing air and spinning Earth combine to form global currents such as the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Bottom water export {{from the}} Ross Sea, February 2007 to January 2011, {{exhibits}} seasonal and interannual variability. Temperature minima coupled to salinity maxima in late austral summer, into the fall, indicate input from High-Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW). Secondary temperature minima lacking the high-salinity trait, characteristic of Low-Salinity Shelf Water (LSSW), {{appear in the}} spring. Warmer bottom water similar to modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) is observed in winter and in early summer. The LSSW and mCDW may {{be drawn from the}} Drygalski Basin, as the HSSW pool retreats poleward from the shelf break in response to increased winter <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> allowing these less dense overlying waters to spill into the deep ocean within the benthic layer. Bottom salinity decreased from 2007 to 2011 by 0. 007 [*]year− 1 significantly higher than regional decadal trends, which we propose is a result of HSSW retreat induced by strengthening <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies...</b>|$|R
50|$|Southern hemisphere: In the {{southern}} hemisphere the belts are reversed. The southeast trade winds blow from the southeast toward the equator. The southern equivalent of the horse latitudes (or Variables of Cancer) is called the Variables of Capricorn. The southern westerlies start somewhat south of South Africa. They tend to be stronger than the northern westerlies because they are mostly over water (roaring forties). The southern <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> are mostly over Antarctica.|$|R
50|$|Global wind patterns: Winds {{are named}} by the {{direction}} from which they blow. The globe is encircled by six major wind belts, three in each hemisphere. From pole to equator, they are the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies,</b> the westerlies, and the trade winds. All six belts move north in the northern summer and south in the northern winter. Each belt occupies about 30 degrees of latitude, that is, {{one third of the}} way from the pole to the equator.|$|R
5|$|The <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies,</b> {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold {{prevailing}} winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.|$|R

[...] Like trade winds and unlike the westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular.

25|$|The {{prevailing}} {{winds of}} the atmospheric circulation arise {{because of the}} difference in pressure at various latitudes and act as means for distribution of thermal energy on the planet. This pressure difference is because of the differences in solar insolation received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the planet. Alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the equator, the two tropics, the Arctic and Antarctic circles, and the two polar regions, giving rise to the trade winds, the westerlies, and the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies.</b> However, geophysical factors like Earth's orbit, its rotation, and its axial tilt cause these belts to shift gradually north and south, following the Sun's seasonal shifts.|$|R
50|$|Ocean Gyre: The {{fact that}} the {{westerlies}} and trade winds blow in opposite directions and that the continents prevent water from circling the globe contributes {{to the formation of}} circular ocean currents, clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. The Coriolis force also plays a part. The trade winds push water west. At the doldrums it flows back east producing the equatorial countercurrent. See Ocean gyre. Coriolis force, Hadley cell and other things: In the northern hemisphere, the Coriolis effect causes wind and water currents to bend to the right (clockwise). Cold heavy air flows south from the north pole and is bent west, forming the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies.</b> Warm air rises at the equator drawing air from the north which bends to the west, contributing to the trade winds. The Coriolis effect bends the westerlies and trade winds slightly clockwise in the northern hemisphere.|$|R
50|$|The Polar cell, likewise, is {{a simple}} system. Though cool and dry {{relative}} to equatorial air, the air masses at the 60th parallel are still sufficiently warm and moist to undergo convection and drive a thermal loop. At the 60th parallel, the air rises to the tropopause (about 8 km at this latitude) and moves poleward. As it does so, the upper level air mass deviates toward the east. When the air reaches the polar areas, it has cooled and is considerably denser than the underlying air. It descends, creating a cold, dry high-pressure area. At the polar surface level, the mass of air is driven toward the 60th parallel, replacing the air that rose there, and the polar circulation cell is complete. As the air at the surface moves toward the equator, it deviates toward the west. Again, the deviations of the air masses {{are the result of}} the Coriolis effect. The air flows at the surface are called the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{correction}} for katabatic {{winds and}} <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> is developed {{to deal with}} their dramatic underestimation by the atmospheric component of a coarse-resolution global coupled climate model. This correction relies on a comparison of the atmospheric surface circulation simulated by the model with the one provided by a regional atmospheric model, and consists of wind stress modifications {{in the vicinity of the}} Antarctic coast. Corrections are spatially varying and different for both wind components. The impacts of the correction on the modelled Antarctic sea ice and World Ocean's properties on long timescales are assessed, showing that katabatic winds thin sea ice and strongly enhance its production along the continent. Consequently, the formation rate, salinity and temperature of the Antarctic Bottom Water are increased. This leads to model results in better agreement with observations, especially in the deep ocean where the mean errors in temperature and salinity decrease by 9 % and 37 %, respectively. Hence, correcting katabatic winds seems to be an appropriate way to improve the representation of sea ice-related surface processes around Antarctica. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} the deep meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the Southern Ocean to changes in the easterly wind stress over the Antarctic continental slope. The deep MOC is driven by export of dense Antarctic Bottom Water from the Antarctic continental shelf, and exerts a strong influence on climate by ventilating the deep ocean with oxygen and storing carbon dioxide. The possibility that inter-climatic modifications of the deep overturning may have been driven by changes in the atmospheric circulation has motivated the recent interest in evaluating {{the sensitivity of the}} Southern Ocean MOC to modifications of the mid-latitude westerlies. Using a high-resolution eddy-resolving model of a sector of the Southern Ocean, we show that the deep cell of the MOC is highly sensitive to the strength of the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies,</b> and relatively insensitive to the strength of the mid-latitude westerlies. Our results highlight that determining the deep ocean ventilation in past and future climates demands an accurate evaluation of the concurrent surface wind stress throughout the Southern Ocean...|$|R
5000|$|While the Hadley and polar {{cells are}} truly closed loops, the Ferrel cell is not, and the telling point {{is in the}} Westerlies, which are more {{formally}} known as [...] "the Prevailing Westerlies." [...] The easterly Trade Winds and the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> have nothing over which to prevail, as their parent circulation cells are strong enough and face few obstacles either {{in the form of}} massive terrain features or high pressure zones. The weaker Westerlies of the Ferrel cell, however, can be disrupted. The local passage of a cold front may change that in a matter of minutes, and frequently does. As a result, at the surface, winds can vary abruptly in direction. But the winds above the surface, where they are less disrupted by terrain, are essentially westerly. A low pressure zone at 60° latitude that moves toward the equator, or a high pressure zone at 30° latitude that moves poleward, will accelerate the Westerlies of the Ferrel cell. A strong high, moving polewards may bring westerly winds for days.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the start}} of the Holocene, {{temperatures}} in the Arctic have steadily declined. This has been accredited to the orbitally forced decrease in summer insolation reconstructed over the same period. However, here we present climate modelling results from an Earth model of intermediate complexity (EMIC) that indicate that 17 - 40 % of the cooling in the Arctic, over the period 9 - 0 ka, was {{a direct result of the}} desertification that occurred in the Sahara after the termination of the African Humid Period. We have performed a suite of sensitivity experiments to analyse the impact of different combinations of forcings, including various vegetation covers in the Sahara. Our simulations suggest that over the course of the Holocene, a strong increase in surface albedo in the Sahara as a result of desertification led to a regional increase in surface pressure, a weakening of the trade winds, the westerlies and the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies,</b> which in turn reduced the meridional heat transported by the atmosphere to the Arctic. We conclude that during interglacials, the climate of the Northern Hemisphere is sensitive to changes in Sahara vegetation type...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the start}} of the Holocene, {{temperatures}} in the Arctic have steadily declined. This has been accredited to the orbitally forced decrease in summer insolation reconstructed over the same period. However, we present climate modelling results here that indicate that up to 42 % of the cooling in the Arctic, over the period 9 – 0 ka was {{a direct result of the}} desertification that occurred in the Sahara. Through a land–atmosphere teleconnection, increasing surface albedo in the Sahara leads to a regional increase in surface pressure, a weakening of the trade winds, the westerlies and the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies,</b> which in turn reduces the meridional heat transported by the atmosphere to the Arctic. Additionally, through a series of targeted sensitivity experiments we explored the affects that using a modern cloud data set has upon mid and early Holocene climate simulations, and show that despite an apparent weakness in our model our original conclusions are robust. We conclude that interglacial climate is sensitive to changes in Sahara vegetation type, which has significance in the future debate of the response of the Sahara to climate change, considering the uncertainty surrounding future precipitation projections for this region...|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of AAIW {{can be explained}} very simply through the Ekman transport process and the divergence and convergence of water masses. The winds over Antarctica are called the <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> where winds blow from the east to the west. This creates a counter-clockwise surface current near the coast of Antarctica, called the Antarctic Coastal Current. Ekman transport causes the water to push towards {{the left of the}} surface motion in the Southern Hemisphere. Thus, this westward directed coastal current in Antarctica will push the water towards Antarctica. At the same time there is a strong current north of the Antarctic Coastal Current, called the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) created by the strong westerlies in this region which flows clockwise around Antarctica. Again, Ekman transport will push this water {{to the left of the}} surface motion, meaning away from Antarctica. Because water just offshore of Antarctica is being pushed away and into Antarctica, it leads to the Antarctic Divergence region. Here, upwelling of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) takes place. NADW is cold and quite saline. Once the NADW is upwelled to the surface some of it diverges towards Antarctica, gets colder, and sinks back down as Antarctic Bottom Water.|$|R
50|$|Hudson Plains has short mild {{summers and}} long harsh winters. It is {{considered}} a continental climate. There is little opportunity to grow food because of the short growing season that is only around 110 days each year and the cold weather. The mean annual temperatures range from -7 degrees Celsius to -2 degrees Celsius. The annual precipitation ranges from around 400-800mm. The climate here is strongly influenced by the cold Hudson Bay low-pressured and polar high-pressure air masses. The climate depends largely on the water surface during {{certain parts of the}} year. In the winter months the bay is covered almost entirely by pack ice and this keeps the air chilled and thus temperatures stay consistently low. Cold, dry arctic air typically lingers over the area throughout winter. Gust can sometimes become violent, reaching speeds of up to 130 km/h. The ice begins melting in May and is almost completely gone by the beginning of June. This brings in the rainy season with an abundance of clouds and fog. After a brief and mild summer the temperatures begin to lower again and rain and snow showers become prominent in October and November. The temperature and precipitation correlate closely with latitude. The predominant global pattern that affects the climate is the polar cell. This system cycles the cool <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> with the <b>polar</b> front westerlies and in doing so creates the cold climate but also allows for a moderate amount of precipitation in the region.|$|R
40|$|The Southern Hemisphere {{westerlies}} exert {{an important}} influence on global climate, supplying {{nearly half of}} the mechanical energy for the deep overturning circulation. In a coarse-resolution ocean model, northward-shifted winds increase the work done on surface geostrophic flows due to enhanced velocities associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Alternatively, energy supply is diminished by southward-shifted winds, primarily through reduced correspondence between wind stress and surface velocity in the Southern Ocean due to dynamical and topographic constraints on the ACC. When combined perturbations in latitude and magnitude of the westerlies are applied, these results are reconciled with estimates of recent trends in wind work and volume transport in the Southern Ocean from observations and coupled climate models. This indicates that the strength of the winds exerts a dominant effect that masks the opposing consequences of latitudinal migration. In particular, transport through Drake Passage shows a clear relationship with wind work and velocity when the winds move poleward leading to a reduction in all three quantities. However, under equatorward-shifted winds, stronger <b>polar</b> <b>easterlies</b> adjacent to the Antarctic continent establishes a recirculation gyre leading to increased mechanical energy input and swifter currents but reduced transport. Significant (O(25 %)) changes in the mechanical energy supply from the winds may be possible on climatic time scales, particularly associated with the spatial correlation between winds and the ACC that does not depend critically on unresolved eddy processes in this model, leading to a pathway for altering abyssal diapycnal mixing rates and stratification of the ocean interior...|$|R

40|$|Remote open oceans were {{traditionally}} {{considered as}} sinks of {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) such as industrial chemicals (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). In the context of reduced primary emissions as well as global warming, previous polluted reservoirs such as soil, large water bodies, and glaciers may act as secondary sources returning these POPs back to the atmosphere and ocean. It was also hypothesized that biogeochemical activities associated with phytoplankton {{in the water column}} would lead to the coupling of air-plankton systems to draw down the lipophilic POPs from the overlying atmosphere, similar to the biological pump taking up CO 2 from the atmosphere during phytoplankton blooms and then depositing it to the deep ocean. It has been found that POPs accumulate to high levels in apex predators such as whales and polar bears. To fully understand how POPs biomagnify along the food web, it is important to quantify the transfer of POPs from environmental media (sediments and water) to the base of food webs. This dissertation research was conducted in three remote oceans to verify these hypotheses. 1) In the first study, air and water samples were collected simultaneously on R/V Revelle during a scientific cruise in the N. and S. Pacific for POPs analysis. Results suggest that the Pacific was acting as a secondary source returning PCBs back to the air. This was the first work documenting the open ocean as a secondary PCB source. In contrast, this study showed gas exchange hexachlorobenzene of (HCB) was at steady-state between the air and ocean with no net transfer of HCB. 2) In the second study, air, water, and zooplankton samples (copepod Calanus) were collected simultaneously during the North Atlantic Bloom (NAB) in 2008 in a relatively small area south of Iceland. The POPs measurement showed dissolved phase concentrations of lipophilic OCP remained constant with time as the bloom evolved. Also, the OCPs were not being drawn from air to water during the main bloom as previous studies have hypothesized. Further our data and data from prior Arctic measurements suggested that the Arctic was a source of higher concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and both the atmospheric (<b>polar</b> <b>easterlies)</b> as well as oceanic transport (East Greenland Current) would bring HCHs to the lower latitudes. Last, the measurements indicated that equilibrium partitioning governed the transfer of POPs from water into Calanus. To explore the measurements further, a box model was developed and used to investigate the fate of POPs during the bloom. Biogeochemical processes considered included air-water exchange, partitioning to particulate organic carbon (POC), removal by sinking POC, and biogeochemical degradation. Modeling results demonstrated that partitioning to POC was the dominant process determining the fate of OCPs in the NAB 2008. 3) In a final study, sediments and benthic biota were collected along the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research grids. For the first time, POPs concentrations in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) continental shelf sediments, porewater, and benthic deposit feeding holothurians were determined. High concentrations of POPs were found in close vicinity to major scientific research stations. Concentrations decreased sharply away from the locations with anthropogenic activity. This suggested that local activities were the dominant source of POPs in the WAP rather than long range transport by atmospheric and oceanic motion. The Westerlies and Antarctic Circumpolar Current may have acted as dynamical barriers to transports from the southern continents. The majority of POPs in the WAP sediments was bound to black carbon and was not available for uptake by benthic biota. POPs in the holothurians were in equilibrium with those in the porewater. Different bioaccumulation factors obtained suggestd that there were differences in lipids of the different benthos and in situ contamination patterns. ...|$|R
40|$|Daily {{observations}} of the Northern Hemisphere zonal mean zonal wind during July show an intermittent formation of multiple tropospheric jet streams. In particular, a tropospheric westerly, or easterly, jet occurs at latitudes greater than 75 degrees N: it co-exists with the mid-latitude jet and is characterized by variability on synoptic time scale. Two sample years are here considered, July 1996 and July 1985, when prevailing westerly and easterly jets occur at high latitudes: respectively. Analysis {{is consistent with a}} picture where the physical mechanism which creates and maintains the polar jet in the summer troposphere, is the baroclinic instability process acting on a westerly, or easterly,background Zonal flow. Due to the synoptic variability, monthly mean maps of the zonal mean zonal wind for July may show different jet patterns as a. function of the year, depending on the occurrences (number and duration) of westerly or <b>easterly</b> <b>polar</b> jet's within each month considered. The study of the inter-annual variability of the zonal mean zonal wind through the principal Component analysis indicates, in fact, that three tropospheric jet stream patterns can be distinguished.
