Using immunohistochemistry, CD43 can be demonstrated in the <b>paracortical</b> T-cells of healthy lymph nodes and tonsils; it is also positive in a range of lymphoid and myeloid tumours. Although it is present in over 90% of T-cell lymphomas, it is generally less effective at demonstrating this condition than is CD3 antigen. However, it may be useful as part of a panel to demonstrate B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, since the malignant cells in this condition are often CD43 positive, and may be difficult to stain with other antibodies. Because it stains granulocytes and their precursors, it is also an effective marker for myeloid tumours.|$|E
50|$|Some humoral and {{cellular}} {{components of the}} skin pass through the vessel lymph {{to get to the}} circulation. This circulation net has a big importance, it’s the way of direct communication between the specific site of the skin and the lymph cells found inside the lymph node and the systematic tissues.The epidermis antigens are connected with some cells of the skin. Among them there are the APC, antigen presenting cells (Langerhans, dentritic and cutaneous). They capture the antigen, they process it and they present it on their surface as being associated with the MHC-II. Keratinocytes produce TNFα and IL-1 which act on the Langerhans cells, inducing an increase of the expression of histocompatibility complex and cytokine secretion. Moreover, they induce their migration from the skin to the <b>paracortical</b> areas of the lymph nodes. Once there, these cells can provide the necessary stimulus for the lymphocytes T, who will proliferate and express the cutaneous receptor recruitment and to various chemo attractants that promote the accumulation of dermal micro vascular endothelial cells of inflamed skin to finally enter the skin tissue.Once the activated lymphocytes arrive, they get in contact with the antigen, they proliferate and develop their effector functions in order to neutralize or eliminate the pathogen. The Langerhans cells promote and permit the start of the cellular immune response of lymphocytes through the skin and are recruited from the peripheral blood. Antigen presentation may occur in peripheral lymphoid tissues.|$|E
40|$|Lymph {{nodes and}} spleens were {{collected}} at autopsy and by biopsy from 29 rhesus monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Lymph nodes were classified morphologically into stages of follicular hyperplasia, follicular involution, follicular depletion with normal or expanded paracortices, follicular and <b>paracortical</b> depletion, granulomatous lymphadenitis, or normal. The distribution of SIV RNA {{was determined by}} in situ hybridization using a nick translated, 35 S labeled, SIVmac DNA probe. Numbers of SIV-infected cells were rare during follicular hyperplasia, numerous during follicular and <b>paracortical</b> expansion, and rare during follicular and <b>paracortical</b> depletion. The splenic morphology reflected that of the lymph nodes; however, the numbers of SIV-positive cells were uniformly lower. SIV RNA was frequently restricted to a single nucleus within multinucleate syncytial cells in two cases of granulomatous lymphadenitis. These results, combined with those of a previous study, provide evidence for antigen trapping in SIV-infected hyperplastic lymph nodes and for widespread viral infection of macrophages and lymphocytes during <b>paracortical</b> expansion...|$|E
40|$|Seventy-seven {{lymph nodes}} were {{examined}} histologically from sixty-two leprosy patients representing {{the whole range}} of the disease spectrum from the high resistance form (tuberculoid) to the specific immunity deficiency form (lepromatous).

As resistance to infection increased across the leprosy spectrum, histiocytes became more differentiated eventually appearing epithelioid. This was paralleled by increasing numbers of small lymphocytes in the <b>paracortical</b> areas. In the borderline tuberculoid form of the disease an appearance was seen similar to that found in sarcoidosis.

40|$|With {{the use of}} in situ {{immunohistochemical}} techniques on freshly {{frozen and}} paraffin-embedded material from 63 reactive lymph nodes, the cellular composition of T-nodules observed in 30 cases with nodular alteration of the <b>paracortical</b> area was analyzed. T-nodules were composed of S- 100 beta + interdigitating reticulum cells (IDRCs), variable numbers of OKT 6 + dendritic cells (DCs), high endothelial venules, and a very high T helper/T suppressor ratio because of an enrichment of OKT 4 +, Leu 3 a+ helper/inducer T cells in these nodules. According to their localization in the <b>paracortical</b> area, and the arrangement of IDRCs and high endothelial venules, T-nodules could be divided into "primary" and "secondary" T nodules. In all cases of dermatopathic lymphadenitis, very large aggregates of S- 100 beta + and OKT 6 + DCs, admixed with few high endothelial venules and variable numbers of OKT 4 +, Leu 3 a+ helper/inducer T cells, were observed and were termed "tertiary T-nodules. " It is suggested that T-nodules represent the <b>paracortical</b> counterparts of B-lymphoid follicles and are the in vivo equivalents of DC/T-cell clusters observed in vitro. According to their cellular composition and localization in the lymph node, "primary" and "secondary" T-nodules probably represent subsequent maturation stages of distinctive nodular <b>paracortical</b> structures, which {{play an important role}} in the presentation of antigens to helper/inducer T cells and in the proliferation of antigen-responsive T cells.

40|$|The {{defects in}} {{lymphocyte}} apoptosis {{that underlie the}} autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) are usually attributable to inherited mutations of the CD 95 (Fas) gene. In this report, we present the histopathological and immunophenotypic features seen in the lymph nodes (n = 16), peripheral blood (n = 10), bone marrow (n = 2), spleen (n = 3), and liver (n = 2) from 10 patients with ALPS. Lymph nodes showed marked <b>paracortical</b> hyperplasia. Interfollicular areas were expanded and populated by T cell receptor-αβ CD 3 + CD 4 −CD 8 − (double-negative, DN) T cells that were negative for CD 45 RO. CD 45 RA+ T cells were increased in all cases studied. The <b>paracortical</b> infiltrate {{was a result of}} both reduced apoptosis and increased proliferation, as measured by in situ detection of DNA fragmentation and staining with MIB- 1, respectively. The <b>paracortical</b> proliferation may be extensive enough to suggest a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Many of the <b>paracortical</b> lymphocytes expressed markers associated with cytotoxicity, such as perforin, TIA- 1, and CD 57. CD 25 was negative. In addition, most lymph nodes exhibited florid follicular hyperplasia, often with focal progressive transformation of germinal centers; in some cases, follicular involution was seen. A polyclonal plasmacytosis also was present. The spleens were markedly enlarged, more than 10 times normal size. There was expansion of both white pulp and red pulp, with increased DN T cells. DN T cells also were observed in liver biopsies exhibiting portal triaditis. In the peripheral blood, the T cells showed increased expression of HLA-DR and CD 57 but not CD 25. CD 45 RA+ T cells were increased in the four cases studied. Polyclonal B cell lymphocytosis with expansion of CD 5 + B cells was a characteristic finding. Taken together, the histopathological and immunophenotypic findings, particularly in lymph nodes and peripheral blood, are sufficiently distinctive to suggest a diagnosis of ALPS.

In HANNLA cytoplasmic spotty stain of WATM- 1 was seen in dendritic cells of the paracortex. Image analysis of the modified lmmunoMax indicated gradual increase of p 40 tax from HANNLA to ATLL and appeareance of the large amount of HTLV-I p 27 rex protein in the <b>paracortical</b> lymphocytes in HANNLA. Estimating dose of HTLV-I DNA forms by means of image analysis or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HTLV-I pX DNA and for human β-globin gene, increase of HTLV-I DNA forms in HANNLA suggested reproduction and reinfection of HTLV-I.

Methods: Between 2002 and 2005, 105 patients with LSSC underwent total laryngectomy with bilateral selective neck dissection including levels II, III and IV. Most (69) received PO radiotherapy. All pathological specimens were either pT 3 or pT 4, and all necks were pN 0. All lymph nodes were analyzed and their reactivity status were classified as the following four patterns: follicular hyperplasia associated with humoral response, <b>paracortical</b> hyperplasia associated with cellular response, sinus histiocytosis with no association with specific immune response, or normal lymph node. Only the first two patterns were considered stimulated, whereas the last two were considered non-stimulated. The most prevalent pattern in a particular neck specimen was considered {{for the analysis of}} recurrence and survival. Results: The total number of lymph nodes studied was 3, 648, with an average of 34. 7 lymph nodes/neck specimens. The most frequent lymph node reactivity patterns were sinusal histiocytosis (50 cases), <b>paracortical</b> hyperplasia (35 cases), and follicular hyperplasia (20 cases). There was no statistical association of these individual patterns with recurrence rate (p = 0. 98) or mortality (p = 0. 49).

However, surgical excision of enlarged inguinal nodes is almost never performed to initially diagnose genital herpes simplex virus, due to the distinct external presentation of genital herpetic vesicles that usually occur with the first symptoms of infection. Therefore, the histologic and immunophenotypic features of HSV-associated inguinal lymphadenopathy are unfamiliar to most pathologists. The current report describes the lymph node pathology of two immunocompetent patients, whose initial HSV diagnosis was established through surgical excision of enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. Histologic examination showed features consistent with viral lymphadenopathy, including florid follicular hyperplasia, monocytoid B-cell hyperplasia, and <b>paracortical</b> hyperplasia without extensive necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains for HSV antigens, using polyclonal anti-HSV I and II antibodies, demonstrate strong immunoreactivity for HSV in {{a small number of}} cells in the subcapsular sinuses, especially in areas with monocytoid B-cell hyperplasia. Rare scattered HSV-positive cells also are identified in <b>paracortical</b> areas and germinal centers. We conclude that an initial diagnosis of genital HSV infection may be established by inguinal lymph node biopsy. 1...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{applied a}} battery of {{monoclonal}} antibodies to T cells and other hematolymphoid cells on frozen tissue sections of lymph nodes with involvement by MF and DL, both with and without a history of MF. All 13 lymph nodes showing histologic involvement with MF showed immunophenotypic abnormalities. All of these cases showed significant loss of Leu- 9 expression, and 10 cases showed significant loss of Leu- 8 expression. In addition, occasional cases showed loss of the pan-T-cell markers Leu- 1, 4, and 5. All cases of DL of histologic grade LN- 0 or 1, {{with or without a}} history of MF, showed a predominance of T helper cells in <b>paracortical</b> regions without evidence of immunophenotypic abnormalities. Three of the 4 cases of DL of histologic grade LN- 2 or 3 showed significant loss of Leu- 8 and/or Leu- 9 expression identified by a decrease in the ratio of <b>paracortical</b> Leu- 8 /Leu- 4 or Leu- 9 /Leu- 4 -expressing cells, all cases with a history of possible or definite MF. These results raise the possibility that the immunologic methods employed may be able to identify cases of DL with early involvement by MF...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -The {{growth in}} mice of {{subcutaneous}} isografts {{of any of}} 5 methyl-cholanthrene-induced fibrosarcomas was associated with macrophage stimulation, reflected in an increased incidence of DNA-synthesizing cells among macrophages in the uninjected peritoneal cavity. This occurred at some stage with 4 tumours that induced concomitant immunity and one that did not. Some degree of splenomegaly also occurred with all 5 tumours. The spleens of all the tumour-bearing mice showed histological evidence of increased haemopoietic activity. Histological changes in the lymphoid elements of the spleen were very different with different tumours, ranging from lymphoid stimulation to lymphoid atrophy. The lymph nodes draining the sites of primary isografts which induced concomitant immunity showed signs of stimulation in the <b>paracortical</b> areas, followed by plasmacytopoiesis in the medullary areas. Stimulation of the <b>paracortical</b> areas was not detected in the nodes draining sites of injection of a tumour not inducing concomitant immunity. Nodes draining the sites of challenge isografts in mice exhibiting concomitant immunity showed plasmacytopoiesis. IT IS NOW well established that macro-phages play {{a prominent role in}} resistance, specific or non-specific, to some trans-planted syngeneic tumours (Evans an...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundneoangiogenesis and {{the immune}} {{response}} are important mechanisms in metastasis development. Aimto evaluate lymph node reactivity and microvessel density in neck metastasis of occult primary {{squamous cell carcinoma}} considering their histological and clinical variables. Study designretrospesctive case-series. Method 19 patients with neck metastasis of occult primary squamous cell carcinoma who underwent neck dissection between 1983 and 2000 were selected. The lymph nodes were reevaluated {{on the type of}} reactivity in both the cortical and <b>paracortical</b> areas, and the metastasis were assessed as to grade, desmoplasia, necrosis and microvessel density (CD 34). The relationship between histological and clinical variables was evaluated. Resultsthe median microvessel density was 91 vessels/mm 2, varying from 28 to 145. <b>Paracortical</b> hyperplasia was more common in patients below 55 years of age (90 % x 44 %, p= 0. 05), but there was no relationship between reactivity patterns and microvessel density with prognosis. The disease-free survival was 52 % in 3 years, being similar in both groups, with higher or lower microvessel densities. Conclusionmicrovessel density in neck metastasis of occult primary squamous cell carcinoma had a great individual variability. It wasn't possible to establish the relationship between microvessel density and the clinical or histological variables studied...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three German {{shepherd}} {{dogs were}} inoculated with Leishmania chagasi and three with Leishmania donovani and the infection was followed for 82 days. All infected dogs developed splenomegaly and lymphadenomegaly. In lymph nodes {{there was a}} reduction in lymphocyte population in <b>paracortical</b> areas, extensive proliferation of macrophages in <b>paracortical</b> areas and medullary cords, follicular hyperplasia, and increased numbers of plasma cells. The spleen had decreased numbers of lymphocytes in periartenolar lymphoid sheaths, proliferation of macrophages in these regions, follicular hyperpla-sia, and enlargement of the red pulp with clusters of macrophages and plasma cells. The morphology of the tonsil {{was similar to the}} lymph nodes. Clusters of macrophages, often containing Leishmania spp, were present in liver, bone marrow, lung, and the intestines. The morphologic changes in lymph nodes and spleen were suggestive of a suppressed cell-mediated immunity and an active humoral immunity. The German shepherd dog may be a useful laboratory model for the study of immunopathologic changes in visceral leishmaniasis. The basic lesion in human and canine visceral leish-maniasis involves proliferation and parasitization of macrophages, with the most striking lesions observed in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.
