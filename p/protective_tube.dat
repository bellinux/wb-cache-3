2500|$|Serpula (also {{known as}} {{calcareous}} tubeworm, serpulid tubeworm, fanworm, or plume worm) is a genus of sessile, marine annelid tube worms {{that belongs to}} the Serpulidae family. Serpulid worms {{are very similar to}} tube worms of the closely related sabellid family, except that the former possess a cartilaginous operculum that occludes the entrance to their <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> after the animal has withdrawn into it. The most distinctive feature of worms of the Serpula genus is their colorful fan-shaped [...] "crown". The crown, used by these animals for respiration and alimentation, is the structure that is most commonly seen by scuba divers and other casual observers.|$|E
2500|$|The pole, {{of brown}} wood, is 240cm high and 3.5cm in diameter. A brass {{cylinder}} {{is at the}} base, 4cm long and closed on the bottom. The rod {{is attached to the}} pole by a brass ring, gilt on its lower part, and a 6cm high cylindrical <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> of the same material and gilt on its upper part. The ring (3.2cm high) is inscribed with the name of the unit. Another brass cylinder is placed on the tip of the pole, 6cm long and of brass. The eagle, of gilt copper, sheet, 15cm high and 11.5cm wide, is placed over this. Looking rightward, the eagle's wings are pointed downward and it holds the thunderbolts of Jupiter in its talons. It is placed on a parallelepipedic support of the same metal (10×3.5×2cm), which has a 3.4cm high ornament on its lower part. The support is screwed onto the brass cylinder and has inscribed into the front the motto [...] "Onoare şi Patrie" [...] ("Honor and Fatherland"). The name of the respective unit is engraved into the reverse.|$|E

However in the new design of Axle box guide, the guide cap is welded with the guide {{assembly}} and hence the need of a guide cap has been eliminated. The complete guide and lower spring arrangement is covered with a dashpot cover also known as <b>protective</b> <b>tube.</b> The <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> has a circular ring over it called the dust shield which prevents the ingress of the dust in the cylinder piston arrangement of the dashpot.|$|E

50|$|The coaches {{come to the}} {{workshop}} once in a year. During examination of these coaches, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers have not only damaged the axle box housing but also the lower spring seat {{as well as the}} <b>Protective</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
50|$|As the {{top portion}} of the lower spring seat is not sealed and only covered {{with the help of}} a <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> also called the dashpot cover, the rising oil has a {{tendency}} to shoot above the top rim of the lower spring seat and spill out.|$|E
50|$|A look at {{the drawing}} of the dashpot {{arrangement}} will suggest that this problem is universal for all the coaches, whether a new coach or an old coach.

50|$|Caddisfly larvae live {{in fresh}} water and {{naturally}} construct elaborate <b>protective</b> <b>tubes</b> for themselves from materials {{found in their}} environment. Under natural conditions they use the objects found in their stream bed homes such as pieces of wood, fragments of fish bone or crustacean shell, grains of sand, plant debris and small stones. The tubes serve various purposes; the stones are used to increase traction in fast-moving streams, they serve as disguise for the soft-bodied insect and the spiky bits make the tube and thus, the fly larva, more difficult for predators to swallow.|$|R

When they take off in a Stinson 108 light aircraft, Cal and Ruth watch as the facility and all its inhabitants are incinerated. Then their aircraft is drawn up by a bright beam into a flying saucer. They learn that Exeter and his men are from the planet Metaluna, having come to Earth seeking uranium deposits as well as scientists to help defend their planet in a war against the Zagons. Exeter takes the Earthlings back to his world, sealing them in <b>protective</b> <b>tubes</b> to offset pressure differences between planets.|$|R
50|$|The axial {{expansion}} joint absorbs movement in an axial direction. Standard connectors of the {{axial expansion}} joint are welded ends, fixed flanges and loose flanges. Axial expansion joints are often equipped with a guiding tube {{on the inside of}} the metal bellows. This reduces the flow resistance and prevents damage caused by direct contact with the flowing medium. Axial expansion joints, which can absorb large movements, frequently consist of two metal bellows and an inside or outside sleeve that protects against buckling under internal pressure. For small nominal diameters, <b>protective</b> <b>tubes</b> prevent mechanical damage during installation and operation. Axial expansion joints are suitable for internal and external overpressure. If pressure is applied to the outside of the metal bellows of {{axial expansion joint}}s, the expansion joints permit very large axial movements in case of internal pressure in a pipeline. Because there is no danger of buckling when an external overpressure is applied, the creator of the metal expansion joint was by a professor called Joshua Yap.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Numerous studies {{demonstrate}} how sessile marine organisms utilize chemical, structural, and nutritional deterrents {{to persist in}} predator-rich environments. Little is known, however, about how mobile, more behaviorally complex species minimize predation by integrating avoidance and deterrence strategies. We investigated this using sabellid polychaete worms from the Caribbean and temperate western Atlantic. Sabellids extend their feather-like radioles beyond their <b>protective</b> <b>tubes</b> for feeding and respiration; the body remains inside the tube and the radioles retract when threatened. We used co-occurring consumers to determine the palatability of radioles and bodies {{for each of the}} eight species tested. In addition, we examined chemical or structural traits aVecting palatability and evaluated predator escape traits, such as tube strength, speed of radiole retraction, completeness of retraction, and sensitivity to a nearby disturbance. All species had unpalatable radioles that were chemically or structurally defended, but only two species had unpalatable bodies. Thus, most species allocated defenses to tissues that were most exposed to predation. The two species with chemically defended bodies, Bispira brunnea and Bispira variegata, relied less on behavioral escape...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{identification}} of moisture {{changes in the}} individual construction layers of the railway substructure body is important for modelling the thermal regime of railway line construction. For this purpose, the model of railway line in scale 1 : 1 (Experimental stand DRETM II) was built, {{as a part of}} the experimental workplace of the Department of Railway Engineering and Track Management. It includes 6 <b>protective</b> <b>tubes</b> for TDR probes built in the stand, used for determining the moisture values of construction materials. The paper is devoted to the determination of moisture changes in the individual construction parts of the railway track model (Experimental stand DRETM II), where the measurements and monitoring of moisture changes have been carried out since the end of 2014. The paper also presents the results of measurements and assessment of moisture changes monitoring in the individual construction layers of the railway substructure body and its subgrades and the resulting determined design moisture values of materials applied into individual structural layers. They serve for subsequent railway substructure dimensioning of non-traffic load (climatic factors) and assessing the suitability of new building materials design for subgrade construction...|$|R

5000|$|They have {{a highly}} vascularized, red [...] "plume" [...] {{at the tip}} of their free end which is an organ for exchanging {{compounds}} with the environment (e.g., H2S, CO2, O2, etc.). The tube worm does not have many predators. If threatened, the plume may be retracted into the worm's <b>protective</b> <b>tube.</b> The plume provides essential nutrients to bacteria living inside the trophosome. Tube worms have no digestive tract, but the bacteria (which may make up half of a worm's body weight) convert oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, etc. into organic molecules on which their host worms feed. This process, known as chemosynthesis, was recognized within the trophosome by Colleen Cavanaugh.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to having ordinary radioles, some Canalipalpata possess one or more highly modified radioles located on the dorsal part of the head. This specialized structure is called an operculum. The operculum is a cone-shaped cartilaginous structure located at the distal {{end of a long}} cartilaginous stalk. When threatened or disturbed, the animal withdraws rapidly into its <b>protective</b> calcareous <b>tube</b> and employs the operculum as a plug to occlude the entrance to the tube. The operculum, which is usually similar in color to the other radioles, secretes a mucus which seems to possess antibiotic properties. It is not unusual for the animal to have two crowns, and hence two opercula.|$|R

50|$|Solid-state {{controls}} {{are used in}} gas and electric applications at the high range of the performance and cost spectrum. Composed of two parts, the sensor probe and the control box, solid state thermostats are the most precise control available for griddle operation. The probe consists of two thermocouple wires mounted in a <b>protective</b> capillary <b>tube</b> body that is mounted (typically threaded) into the griddle plate material at a location {{near the center of}} the heating element being controlled. When a temperature variation is detected the probe sends an electrical signal to the control box, which consists of an electrical circuit board that then activates or deactivates the burner system. This control system can respond almost instantly to temperature changes on the griddle surface, which provides a far superior temperature control response to the fluid filled capillary bulb found in Modulating and Snap Action thermostats. Temperature consistency to set point of +/- 5F is typical.|$|R
40|$|In {{relatively}} shallow coastal waters, {{a submarine}} outfall pipeline is often laid in a dredged trench and the wastewater jet discharges inside a concentric enclosure (a <b>protective</b> riser <b>tube)</b> before release at the seabed. The effect of such lateral confinement over a finite vertical length on {{the mixing of}} a buoyant jet is studied experimentally {{for a wide range}} of geometries. A confinement index β = Hr/(Dr - D) is proposed to categorize the confined buoyant jet, where Hr and Dr are the height and diameter of the confinement, respectively, and D is the jet diameter. Compared to the dilution of the corresponding free buoyant jet, it is found that mixing is impaired for β ≥ 3. For β » 1, the jet is highly confined and there is virtually no dilution within the riser. For β ≤ 1. 5, the confinement has no effect. For 1. 5 ≤ β ≤ 3, a wall-attached swirling plume with enhanced dilution is observed, and the mixing behavior is complex. Simple relations for predicting the initial dilution of a laterally confined plume are presented. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a measurement of temperature in a steelmaking furnace with an oxygen refining process, specifically in a tandem furnace. Knowledge of {{the temperature is}} important for optimizing the manufacturing process and extending {{of the life cycle}} of the inner furnace lining. Conditions in the furnace are very demanding; the temperature may temporarily exceed 2000 °C and exhibits changes of 60 °C s− 1. The atmosphere in the furnace is mainly oxidizing and its chemical composition is very variable. In the atmosphere there are also present liquid and solid compounds which act chemically and abrasively on the lining and on the sensor. These conditions make it impossible to use a suction pyrometer, contactless optical or acoustic measurement methods. It was decided to use a thermocouple in a <b>protective</b> <b>tube.</b> The sensor was inserted into the furnace through a steel bushing with water cooling. For the first measurement the type B thermocouple in Al 2 O 3 <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> inside an outer shielding tube made from SiC was used. The second sensor used the type C thermocouple in a special thick-walled <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> made from sintered SiC. The sensor does not measure the temperature of the gas itself, since it is affected by radiation of the surrounding areas. Conditions for heat transport from the furnace to the sensor are variable and difficult to determine; therefore, the accurate identification of the atmosphere temperature is not possible. Limit values of the temperature interval of the atmosphere were determined, for hypothetical cases of athermanous and ideally diathermic atmospheres. Web of Science 751039...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution of leakage radiation from two unshielded diagnostic-type X-ray tube housings. This information was used to determine the shielding required in the housings to bring them into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> housing, as set forth by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements in Report No. 33. Two special diagnostic X-ray tube units were used, one containing a rotating anode tube and the other a stationary anode tube. The only shielding supplied was that provided by the steel, oil-containing tube casing which surrounds the X-ray tube. A measurement of the distribution of leakage radiation on a sphere of one meter radius about the focal spot of the X-ray tube was made on each tube when the tube was operated at its maximum rated continuous current for its maximum rated operating voltage. From the leakage radiation measured, the thickness of lead shielding required to bring the X-ray tube housing into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> housing was calculated. Lead shielding was placed on each of the X-ray tube housings, and measurements were made to determine if each housing was then in compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type <b>protective</b> <b>tube</b> housing. As a result of this study, it was found that the distribution of leakage radiation from an unshielded diagnostic-type tube housing is non-uniform. The amount and location of shielding required in the housing is dependent upon the distribution of the leakage radiation, and is, therefore, a function of the design and rating of the X-ray tube used in the housing...|$|E

50|$|Knob-and-tube wiring (sometimes {{abbreviated}} K&T) is {{an early}} standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s. It consisted of single-insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities, passing through joist and stud drill-holes via <b>protective</b> porcelain insulating <b>tubes,</b> and supported along their length on nailed-down porcelain knob insulators. Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch, or were pulled into a wall, they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom. The first insulation was asphalt-saturated cotton cloth, then rubber became common. Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength, then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape (asphalt saturated cloth), or made inside metal junction boxes.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} role of eustachian tube {{function}} {{in the development of}} recurrent otitis media with effusion (OME) in children treated with tympanostomy tubes for OME. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Three academic and general hospitals. PATIENTS: Children aged 2 to 7 years with a first clinical episode of OME that persisted for at least 3 months; 136 (81 %) of 168 eligible children participated. All children received tympanostomy tubes for bilateral OME at study entry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Recurrence of OME within 6 months of tube extrusion. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were present in eustachian tube function test results between ears that developed recurrent OME and those that did not. The difference in passive ventilatory function between ears with and without OME recurrence was 10 daPa (95 % confidence interval, - 24 to 43 daPa) for opening pressure and - 3 daPa (95 % confidence interval, - 18 to 11 daPa) for closing pressure. The overall difference in the proportion of ears with and without OME recurrence that could not equilibrate positive and negative applied pressures was 12 % (95 % confidence interval, - 2 % to 26 %). The proportions of ears with and without OME recurrence that induced negative pressure in the middle ear by forcefully sniffing were 22 % and 31 %, respectively (P =. 75). CONCLUSION: Measurement of ventilatory and <b>protective</b> eustachian <b>tube</b> function using the forced response test, the pressure equilibration test, and the sniff test has no value in predicting whether children have an increased risk of OME recurrence...|$|R
