2500|$|The EPA {{has been}} criticized for its lack of {{progress}} towards environmental justice. Administrator Christine Todd Whitman was criticized for her changes to President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 12898 during 2001, removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation, and therefore defeating the spirit of the Executive Order. In a March 2004 report, the inspector general of the agency concluded that the EPA [...] "has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan, and has not established values, goals, expectations, and performance measurements" [...] for environmental justice in its daily operations. Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs, <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> towards environmental justice. Studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the EPA's Superfund program, and that this situation was worsening.|$|E
2500|$|The Prime Minister is {{the head}} of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. As the [...] "Head of Her Majesty's Government" [...] the modern Prime Minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In {{addition}} the Prime Minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower house of the legislature). As such the incumbent wields both legislative and executive powers. Under the British system there is a unity of powers rather than separation. In the House of Commons, the Prime Minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity the Prime Minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The Prime Minister also acts as the public [...] "face" [...] and [...] "voice" [...] of Her Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the Prime Minister, the Sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other honours.|$|E
