Carroll continued to practice law, making a small income from cases argued in the two courts where Catholics were still allowed to practice law, the chancery and prerogative courts.

5|$|Jennings's {{personal}} finances {{suffered from}} the panic of 1819, while the Indiana governorship continued to increase his financial burden. Jennings {{was never able to}} recover from his debts. One historian suggests that Jennings's financial situation may arisen from the expenses incurred during his political campaigns, his long-time service in state government, and being too busy to adequately manage his farm. Jennings and his wife frequently entertained visitors, legislators, and other dignitaries at their Corydon home. At a high-profile dinner in 1819, he hosted President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson at a dinner held in their honor in Jeffersonville, when the two leaders were making a tour of the frontier states. In 1822 Jennings solicited a $1,000 personal loan from the Harmonists {{in a letter to his}} political ally, George Rapp, but his request was denied. Jennings was able to secure <b>personal</b> <b>loans</b> from friends by granting mortgages on his land. Earlier in his career as a land speculator at Vincennes, when land prices decreased significantly, he was forced to sell several tracts of land at a loss.|$|E

25|$|City Bank of New York was {{chartered}} by New York State on June 16, 1812, with $2million of capital. Serving a {{group of}} New York merchants, the bank opened for business on September 14 of that year, and Samuel Osgood was elected as the first President of the company. The company's name was changed to The National City Bank of New York in 1865 after it joined the new U.S. national banking system, and it became the largest American bank by 1895. It became the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1913, and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a U.S. bank in Buenos Aires, although the bank had, since the mid-19th century, been active in plantation economies, such as the Cuban sugar industry.

This is consistent with mergers changing the size structure of <b>personal</b> <b>loan</b> markets and merger participants' desire to gain regulatory approval. Auto rates are unaffected by local concentration and mergers, suggesting that their market is nationwide. Rates for both loan types respond asymmetrically to changes in Treasury rates, being more sensitive to a rise than a fall. ...|$|R

According to the CCMM, property acquisition was evidence of significant income. The 1999 parliamentary report considered the church a [...] "small cult" [...] (a cult whose annual income is less than five million francs), which provided [...] "relatively accurate information" [...] to the Parliamentary Commission. The annual budget of the church was estimated between 2.4 and 3.1million francs (the total of donations in 1998 and 1995 respectively), mainly from Sunday offerings, donations, loans, financial products and property income. In 1999, the commission estimated the church's property at about 15million francs. As of 31December1998, the church's net active wealth (composed of real estate and stock) reached 7.3million francs. Concerning its finances, the church said it applies five major principles: economy, recovery, devotion, voluntary work and solidarity. Money comes from Sunday collections, sometimes from <b>personal</b> <b>loans</b> and from donations intended for a particular use; there is no external financial support. Accounts are published at the annual general assembly of the church, by the financial commission of the Federation and by Social Security. Trainee pastors work outside the church; permanent pastors receive a low salary, and are affiliated with the Caisse d'assurance vieillesse, invalidité et maladie des cultes (CAVIMAC).|$|E
