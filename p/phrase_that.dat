5|$|Like other Ojibwe dialects, Ottawa grammar {{includes}} animate and inanimate noun gender, subclasses of verbs {{that are}} dependent upon gender, combinations of prefixes and suffixes that are connected with particular verb subclasses, and complex patterns of word formation. Ottawa distinguishes {{two types of}} third person in sentences: proximate, indicating a noun <b>phrase</b> <b>that</b> is emphasized in the discourse, and obviative, indicating a noun <b>phrase</b> <b>that</b> is less prominent. Ottawa has relatively flexible word order compared with languages such as English.|$|E

Adam's leitmotifs are heard several times throughout the ballet. There is a leitmotif associated with Giselle and another with Albrecht. Hilarion's motif marks his every entrance.

5|$|Falco peregrinus {{was first}} {{described}} under its current binomial name by English ornithologist Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 work Ornithologia Britannica. The scientific name Falco peregrinus is a Medieval Latin <b>phrase</b> <b>that</b> {{was used by}} Albertus Magnus in 1225. The specific name taken {{from the fact that}} juvenile birds were taken while journeying to their breeding location rather than from the nest, as falcon nests were difficult to get at. The Latin term for falcon, falco, is related to falx, the Latin word meaning sickle, in reference to the silhouette of the falcon's long, pointed wings in flight.|$|E

5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure <b>phrase</b> <b>that</b> concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Silicon Glen is the <b>phrase</b> <b>that</b> {{was used}} to {{describe}} the growth and development of Scotland's hi-tech and electronics industries in the Central Belt through the 1980s and 1990s, analogous to the larger concentration of hi-tech industries in Silicon Valley, California.

25|$|This event {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} Rosh Hashanah. On that holiday, {{as he lay}} dying, Rabbi Amnon asked to be carried into the synagogue, where he recited the original composition of Unetanneh Tokef with his last breath (the story contains an ambiguous <b>phrase</b> <b>that</b> some commentators interpreted as saying {{that he did not}} merely die but that his body miraculously vanished). Three days later, he appeared in a dream to Rabbi Kalonymus ben Meshullam (died 1096), one of the great scholars and liturgists of Mainz, and begged him to transcribe the prayer and to see that it was included in the text of the High Holiday services. Thus, the legend concludes, Unetanneh Tokef became a part of the standard liturgy.|$|E
25|$|Bass once {{described}} his main goal for his title sequences as being to ‘’try {{to reach for}} a simple, visual <b>phrase</b> <b>that</b> tells you what the picture is all about and evokes {{the essence of the}} story”. Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world in an unfamiliar way. Examples of this or what he described as “making the ordinary extraordinary” can be seen in Walk on the Wild Side (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in Nine Hours to Rama (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape. In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for Anatomy of a Murder (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and live-action sequences.|$|E
