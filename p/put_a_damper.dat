5|$|Duquesne {{was unable}} to extend its streak on the road against St. Louis, as they lost 59–69. Bill Clark led the team with 17points and Saunders grabbed four steals, enough to raise his per-game average to 2.9, a nation-leading figure. With this, Saunders had at one point {{led the nation in}} double-doubles, rebounds, and steals. The Dukes lost again, 80–92, in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure. The loss <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on Duquesne's hopes for a home game {{in the first round of}} the Atlantic 10 tournament, as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1873 <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on this growth, and in {{the interim}} the city's steel {{industry}} began to decline, squeezed by competition from newer, more efficient producers in Western Pennsylvania and the Midwest {{on one side and}} labor unrest at home. But the textile industry remained strong, and even grew. Accordingly, its residents continued to embrace new movements in architecture. The 1880 pharmacy building at 137 Second Street featured a highly decorated cast iron storefront and curved windows showing the influence of the Queen Anne Style. Further down Second Street, industrialist Jonas Heartt's house built that same year {{is one of the best}} residential applications of the same style.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Operation Momentum brought about more {{extensive}} {{training for the}} Hmong and other hill tribes recruits such as the Lao Theung. Further training of Special Operating Teams of ADC graduates was begun in August 1961, {{with the aim of}} gradually replacing foreign trainers with Lao instructors. In July 1962, the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on Momentum operations until the following April. During this lull, Colonel (later Major General) Vang Pao gathered five ADC companies into a battalion-sized Special Guerrilla Unit. In later years, he would take the next step of organizing makeshift regiments of SGUs.|$|E
25|$|The Cold War, {{especially}} in the 1950s and 1960s, <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on the Esperanto movement as well, as there were fears on both sides that Esperanto {{could be used for}} enemy propaganda. However, the language experienced something of a renaissance in the 1970s and spread to new parts of the world, such as its veritable explosion in popularity in Iran in 1975. By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a pan-African congress. The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognised by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.|$|E
25|$|Although mining had {{provided}} foreign exchange, {{the vast majority}} of Hondurans gained their livelihoods from agriculture, usually on a subsistence level. Periodic efforts were made to develop agricultural exports, but they met with little success. Some tobacco, cattle, and hides were exported, mostly to neighboring countries. The recurring civil conflicts and the resultant confiscation of stock by various military commanders, however, <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on efforts to develop the cattle industry and contributed to its rather backward status. Some bananas and other fruits were exported from the Islas de la Bahía, much of this trade going to New Orleans, but the volume was small and the benefit {{for the rest of the}} nation almost imperceptible.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1967—after the album was completed—Evans flew with McCartney to Los Angeles to see McCartney's then-girlfriend, Jane Asher, who was acting there with the Old Vic theatre company. The three of them went {{on a trip to}} the Rockies, {{returning}} to LA in Frank Sinatra's jet. Evans: [...] "We left Denver in Frank Sinatra's Lear Jet, which he very kindly loaned us. A beautiful job with dark black leather upholstery and, to our delight, a well-stocked bar." [...] When they were back in LA, they were invited to visit the house of Michelle and John Phillips, from the Mamas & the Papas. Brian Wilson was also there, as he was working on the Beach Boys Smile album. Evans wrote about singing [...] "On Top of Old Smokey" [...] with McCartney and Wilson, but was not impressed by Wilson's avant-garde attitude to music: [...] "Brian [...] then <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on the spontaneity of the whole affair by walking in with a tray of water-filled glasses, trying to arrange it into some sort of session." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Great Depression was {{preceded by}} the [...] "Cotton Bust" [...] across the South. This reached Rome in the mid-1920s, and caused many farmers to move away, sell their land or convert to other {{agricultural}} crops, such as corn. Farm workers were displaced, and many African Americans left {{the area in the}} Great Migration, seeking work in cities, including those in the North and Midwest. Cotton crops were being destroyed by the boll weevil, a tiny bug that reached Georgia in 1915 (invading from Louisiana).

2500|$|After {{nearly a}} quarter century, a new face emerged as Eddie McCarter was hired to take Reedy's place. [...] McCarter’s first {{recruiting}} class featured Ryan Cross and Daniel Scott. [...] Both were {{on the list of}} Alabama’s top players. [...] However, academics <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> in their recruitment. [...] McCarter also brought along Roderick Ollie from UAB. [...] All three were red-shirted their first season. [...] Overall, the roster was made up of mostly new faces and a few holdovers from the Reedy era. [...] The McCarter era began on the road at Stillman where UWA registered an 88-82 win. [...] It became apparent after a while that the season was one of rebuilding. [...] With a lack of team chemistry and other issues, the team finished with a 10-17 mark. [...] The Tigers saw improvement in McCarter’s second season. [...] However, the roster was once again filled with new faces. [...] Cross and fellow redshirt freshman Jacquezz Brown left the team. [...] Ollie, Maurice Naylor, Glenn Miles, and Kevin Johnson left the team as well. [...] The biggest acquisition was Troy native Jason Swanson. [...] Swanson had previously played at nearby Shelton State Community College where he was a two-year starter. The 6'7" [...] forward averaged 16.8 points a game and was also known for his rebounding, which was an area McCarter heavily emphasized. [...] Brian Murphy, the Tigers leading scorer in 2007-2008, suffered a torn ACL before the season and was given a medical redshirt. [...] His injury left McCarter in need of a new go to scorer which he had hoped to find in newcomers Herman Mains, Jamaine Nance, Terrence Benson and Chris Davis. [...] UWA had an up and down start to the season. [...] The team could never find a consistence rhythm. [...] In similar fashion to McCarter’s first year as the coach, the team never developed a strong chemistry, and it strongly showed once again on the court. [...] Despite that, the Tigers finished the regular season 13-13 and clinched their first GSC tournament appearance since the 1997–98 season. The excitement was short lived as Harding eliminated UWA in the opening round. [...] McCarter added nine and returned five for the 2009-2010 campaign. [...] The team also featured three redshirt freshmen. [...] McCarter also once again lost several key players who decided to transfer including Daniel Scott. [...] This year’s squad was noticeably much improved over the two previous teams. [...] However, they never played up to potential. [...] The Tigers carried the momentum and a lead in almost every game they lost but was often defeated after their opponent staged a late rally. [...] Swanson led the team most of the way leading them in almost every category. [...] Newcomers Richard Sirju and Alquan Mendenhall also gave the team a major lift. [...] The season also saw the emergence of redshirt freshman Ryan Fitch. [...] Fitch broke into the starting lineup a couple games into the season. [...] McCarter will likely look to replace Jason Swanson going into the next season. The Tigers concluded this year’s season with a 13–14 record. However, after a loss to Alabama-Huntsville during the season's final game, UWA was eliminated from earning a second straight berth in the GSC tournament. [...] Swanson earned First Team All-GSC honors which occurred for the first team since 2005 when Stan Gill received the honor.|$|E
