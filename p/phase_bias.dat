A similar quality criterion is Rfree, which is calculated from a subset (~10%) of reflections {{that were not}} included in {{the structure}} refinement. Both R factors depend on the resolution of the data. As a rule of thumb, Rfree should be approximately the resolution in angstroms divided by 10; thus, a data-set with 2Å resolution should yield a final Rfree ~ 0.2. Chemical bonding features such as stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding and distribution of bond lengths and angles are complementary measures of the model quality. <b>Phase</b> <b>bias</b> is a serious problem in such iterative model building.

50|$|In many cases, {{an initial}} set of phases are determined, and the {{electron}} density map for the diffraction pattern is calculated. Then the map {{is used to}} determine portions of the structure, which portions are used to simulate {{a new set of}} phases. This new set of phases is known as a refinement. These phases are reapplied to the original amplitudes, and an improved electron density map is derived, from which the structure is corrected. This process is repeated until an error term (usually Rfree) has stabilized to a satisfactory value. Because of the phenomenon of <b>phase</b> <b>bias,</b> it is possible for an incorrect initial assignment to propagate through successive refinements, so satisfactory conditions for a structure assignment are still a matter of debate. Indeed, some spectacular incorrect assignments have been reported, including a protein where the entire sequence was threaded backwards.|$|E

We find a peculiar dependence of the pumped charge on the superconducting <b>phase</b> <b>bias</b> across the pump and that an arbitrarily large amount of charge can be pumped in a single cycle when the <b>phase</b> <b>bias</b> is π.

40|$|The {{existence}} of hardware induced <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> might influence the accuracy in precise positioning if not handled properly. This is extra problematic if the biases {{are dependent on}} the satellite tracked, as these biases no longer will be common between the satellites, and thus will not be absorbed by the receiver clock term of the positioning solution. In this paper, we carried out two studies to investigate whether there exists a satellite dependency of the relative <b>phase</b> <b>biases.</b> Even though small in size, satellite dependent variations were found in both cases. In the first case, relative receiver <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> were studied, while relative <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> between signals (e. g. between carrier phases from C/A-code and P-code tracking) were investigated in the second case. The biases {{in the first case}} had a size of 0. 8 mm between the satellites with the largest and smallest values, and additionally showed temporal variations that were consistent over time. The corresponding sizes of the biases second case were 2 mm and 3. 5 mm for GPS L 1 and L 2 respectively, and no temporal variations were found...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the transport properties of a bilayer exciton condensate that is contacted by four superconducting leads.

As long as the distance between the superconducting electrodes is much larger than the exciton coherence length, the Josephson current depends only on the difference between the <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> in the two layers. This result holds true in both short- and long-junction limits. We relate it to a new correlated four-particle Andreev process, which occurs at the superconductor/exciton-condensate interface.

40|$|An {{effective}} {{technique for}} real-time differential orbit determination with GPS bias fixing is formulated. With this technique, only real-time GPS orbits and clocks are needed (available from the NASA Global Differential GPS System with 10 - 20 cm accuracy). The onboard, realtime orbital states of user satellites (few meters in accuracy) {{are used for}} orbit initialization and integration. An extended Kalman filter is constructed for the estimation of the differential orbit between the two satellites {{as well as a}} reference orbit, together with their associating dynamics parameters. Due to close proximity of the two satellites and of similar body shapes, the differential dynamics are highly common and can be tightly constrained which, in turn, strengthens the orbit estimation. Without explicit differencing of GPS data, double-differenced <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> are formed by a transformation matrix. Integer-valued fixing of these biases are then performed which greatly strengthens the orbit estimation. A 9 -day demonstration between GRACE orbits with baselines of approx. 200 km indicates that approx. 80 % of the double-differenced <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> can successfully be fixed and the differential orbit can be determined to approx. 7 mm as compared to the results of onboard K-band ranging...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} PPP-RTK {{is to achieve}} integer {{ambiguity}} resolution (IAR) at a single GNSS user by providing network-derived satellite <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> (SPBs) {{in addition to the}} standard precise point positioning (PPP) corrections. These corrections enable recovering integerness of user ambiguities, thereby recovering the full capability of the precise carrier-phase observations. This contribution analyzes the capability of single-receiver positioning with IAR using new L 5 /E 5 a-frequency observations from GPS, the European Galileo, the Japanese quasi-zenith satellite system (QZSS) and the Indian regional navigation satellite system (IRNSS). In the absence of network products for new systems, especially for IRNSS, we use a small array of multi-GNSS stations to provide a batch of network-derived corrections. These array-aided corrections, comprising estimable combinations of the satellite clocks, first-order slant ionospheric delays as well as the satellite <b>phase</b> <b>biases,</b> are applied to the multi-system single-frequency L 5 /E 5 a-observations of the user station.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an analysis}} of the SAR impulse response function from the interferometric point of view, with the intention of studying its phase behavior in the presence of high squint angle values. It will be pointed out that in this case, a phase ramp is present in the range direction, which, in combination with a certain degree of misregistration between the two images induces an offset in the generated interferometric phase. This behavior, if not compensated, imposes strong limits on the performance of the interferometric techniques in a squinted case, especially for airborne SAR systems. The article proposes two new techniques, which are appropriate to correct the <b>phase</b> <b>bias</b> coming from this source. The first one is based on a modification of the azimuth compression filter, which cancels the phase ramp of the range impulse response function for one specific squint value. In case the SAR processing is performed with variable squint over range, the authors propose a second method oriented to estimating the expected misregistration and thus, the <b>phase</b> <b>bias</b> by means of an iterative approach. Simulated data as well as real corner reflector responses are used to show that the correct topography can be recovered precisely even in the presence of <b>phase</b> <b>bias</b> coming from the squinted geometry.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{research}} conducted until present {{on the subject of}} Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) hardware-induced <b>phase</b> and code <b>biases</b> is here provided. Biases in GNSS positioning occur because of imperfections and/or physical limitations in the GNSS hardware. The biases are a result of small delays between events that ideally should be simultaneous in the transmission of the signal from a satellite or in the reception of the signal in a GNSS receiver. Consequently, these biases will also be present in the GNSS code and phase measurements and may there affect the accuracy of positions and other quantities derived from the observations. For instance, biases affect the ability to resolve the integer ambiguities in Precise Point Positioning (PPP), and in relative carrier phase positioning when measurements from multiple GNSSs are used. In addition, code biases affect ionospheric modeling when the Total Electron Content is estimated from GNSS measurements. The paper illustrates how satellite <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> inhibit the resolution of the phase ambiguity to an integer in PPP, while receiver <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> affect multi-GNSS positioning. It is also discussed how biases in the receiver channels affect relative GLONASS positioning with baselines of mixed receiver types. In addition, the importance of code biases between signals modulated onto different carriers as is required for modeling the ionosphere from GNSS measurements is discussed. The origin of biases is discussed along with their effect on GNSS positioning, and descriptions of how biases can be estimated or in other ways handled in the positioning process are provided.

40|$|Two 9 -yr runs of the NCAR Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM 3) are {{compared}} in their simulations of the North American summer monsoon. In a control simulation, the Zhang–McFarlane deep convection scheme is used. For an experimental simulation, the following {{modifications to the}} scheme are implemented. The closure {{is based on the}} large-scale forcing of virtual temperature, and a relative humidity threshold on convective parcels lifted from the boundary layer is applied. The sensitivity to these modifi-cations for simulating the North American monsoon is investigated. Model validation relies on hourly precipitation rates from surface gauges over the United States, hourly precipitation rates derived from the combination of microwave and radar measurements from NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite over Mexico, and CAPE values as calculated from temperature, specific humidity, and pressure fields from the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis. Results show that the experimental run improves the timing of the monsoon onset and peak in the regions of core monsoon influence considered here, though it increases a negative bias in the peak monsoon intensity in one region of northern Mexico. Sensitivity of the diurnal cycle of precipitation to modifications in the convective scheme is highly geographically depen-dent. Using a combination of gauge-based rainfall rates and reanalysis-based CAPE, it is found that improvements in the simulated diurnal cycle are confined to a convective regime in which the diurnal evolution of precipitation is observed to lag that of CAPE. For another regime, in which CAPE is observed to be approximately in phase with precipitation, model <b>phase</b> <b>biases</b> increase nearly everywhere.

In {{previous studies of}} bacterial genomes, long phase- 1 overlaps {{were found to be}} more numerous than long phase- 2 overlaps.

Models that focused on the ability of the two genes to evolve independently did not predict this <b>phase</b> <b>bias.</b> Here, we propose that a purely compositional model explains the <b>phase</b> <b>bias</b> in a more parsimonious manner. Same-strand overlapping genes may arise through either a mutation at the termination codon of the upstream gene or a mutation at the initiation codon of the downstream gene. We hypothesized that given these two scenarios, the frequencies of initiation and termination codons in the two phases may determine the number for overlapping genes. Results We examined the frequencies of initiation- and termination-codons in the two phases, and found that termination codons do not significantly differ between the two phases, whereas initiation codons are more abundant in phase 1. We found that the primary factors explaining the phase inequality are the frequencies of amino acids whose codons may combine to form start codons in the two phases. We show that the frequencies of start codons in each of the two phases, and, hence, the potential for the creation of overlapping genes, are determined by a universal amino-acid frequency and species-specific codon usage, leading to a correlation between long phase- 1 overlaps and genomic GC content.
