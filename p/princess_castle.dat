5000|$|Lisa Fernandes of Next Projection {{rated the}} episode with 7.5/10 {{commenting on the}} plot around Joe, with Jay's {{reaction}} to Gloria painting Joe's toenails red and wanting him to get Lily's <b>Princess</b> <b>Castle</b> for him: [...] "This episode isn’t the worst thing the show’s ever produced but it also serves {{as an example of}} how far behind American society it’s fallen. In a world where transgender rights is being celebrated and the struggle for acceptance is reaching a new fever pitch, we should be beyond plots like these." [...] By concluding her review she says: [...] "Embarrassing gender politics combine with decent humor. Kudos to Ariel Winter for providing the episode’s biggest laugh with Alex’s multiple acceptance speeches over the credits." ...|$|E
