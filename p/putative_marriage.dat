5000|$|In Catholic canon law, a {{validation}} of marriage or con{{validation of}} marriage is the validation of a Catholic <b>putative</b> <b>marriage.</b> A <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> is one when {{at least one}} party to the marriage wrongly believes it to be valid. [...] Validation involves the removal of a canonical impediment, or its dispensation, or the removal of defective consent. However, the children of a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> are legitimate.|$|E

50|$|The Legitimacy Act 1926 of England and Wales legitimized {{the birth}} of a child if the parents {{subsequently}} married each other, provided that they had not been married to someone else in the meantime. The Legitimacy Act 1959 extended the legitimization even if the parents had married others in the meantime and applied it to <b>putative</b> <b>marriages</b> which the parents incorrectly believed were valid. Neither the 1926 nor 1959 Acts changed the laws of succession to the British throne and succession to peerage titles. The Family Law Reform Act 1969 (c. 46) allowed a bastard to inherit on the intestacy of his parents.

40|$|Following {{upon the}} Supreme Court of Appeal's {{judgment}} in Butters v Mncora 2012 4 SA 1 (SCA), which broadened the criteria {{and consequences of}} universal partnerships in cohabitation relationships, this article investigates the potential of universal partnerships and <b>putative</b> <b>marriages</b> to allocate rights to share in partnership property in other intimate relationships. It traverses several instances in which marriages are not recognised - bigamous marriages, Muslim and Hindu religious marriages and invalid customary marriages â€“ examining whether the wives in these marriages could use universal partnerships and <b>putative</b> <b>marriages</b> to claim a share in property. It then considers the use of universal partnerships to obtain a share of property in civil marriages out of community of property. It concludes by pointing out several issues which {{are in need of}} clarification and where the common law should be developed to give effect to fundamental constitutional rights...|$|R
50|$|Marriages annulled {{under the}} Catholic Church are {{considered}} as void ab initio, {{meaning that the}} marriage was invalid from the beginning. Some worry that their children will be considered illegitimate if they get an annulment. However, Canon 1137 of the Code of Canon Law specifically affirms the legitimacy of children born in both valid and <b>putative</b> <b>marriages</b> (objectively invalid, though at least one party celebrated in good faith). Critics point to this as additional evidence that a Catholic annulment is similar to divorce; although civil laws regard the offspring of all marriages as legitimate.|$|R
5000|$|Although an {{annulment}} is thus {{a declaration}} that [...] "the marriage never existed", the Church recognizes that the relationship was a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage,</b> which gives rise to [...] "natural obligations". In canon law, children conceived or born of either a valid or a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> are considered legitimate, and illegitimate children are legitimized by a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> of their parents, as by a valid marriage. Certain conditions are necessary for the marriage contract to be valid in canon law. Lack {{of any of these}} conditions makes a marriage invalid and constitutes legal grounds for a declaration of nullity. Accordingly, apart from the question of diriment impediments dealt with below, there is a fourfold classification of contractual defects: defect of form, defect of contract, defect of willingness, defect of capacity. For annulment, proof is required of the existence of one of these defects, since canon law presumes all marriages are valid until proven otherwise.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Putative</b> <b>marriage</b> - An {{apparently}} valid marriage, {{entered into}} {{in good faith}} on part {{of at least one}} of the partners, which is invalid because of an impediment. Cf. void marriage.|$|E
50|$|Canon law {{stipulates}} canonical {{impediments to}} marriage. A diriment impediment prevents a marriage from being validly contracted {{at all and}} renders the union a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage,</b> while a prohibitory impediment renders a marriage valid but not licit. The union resulting is called a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage.</b> An invalid marriage may be subsequently convalidated, either by simple convalidation (renewal of consent that replaces invalid consent) or by sanatio in radice ("healing in the root", the retroactive dispensation from a diriment impediment). Some impediments may be dispensed from, while those de jure divino (of divine law) may not be dispensed.|$|E
5000|$|If one of {{the parties}} were {{prohibited}} from marrying by a diriment impediment (from the Latin for [...] "interrupting"), the marriage is invalid. Because these impediments may not be known at all, the marriage is called a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> if at least {{one of the}} parties married in good faith.|$|E
50|$|Annulment of {{marriage}} {{does not change}} the status of legitimacy of children born to the couple during their <b>putative</b> <b>marriage,</b> i.e., between their marriage ceremony and the legal annulment of their marriage. For example, canon 1137 of the Roman Catholic Church's Code of Canon Law specifically affirms the legitimacy of a child born to a marriage that is declared null following the child's birth.|$|E
50|$|A marriage, however, {{which can}} be {{canceled}} {{at the option of}} one of the parties is merely voidable, meaning it is subject to cancellation if contested in court. A marriage that is entered into in good faith, but which is subsequently found to be void, may be recognized as a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> and the spouses as putative spouses, with certain rights granted by statute or common law, notwithstanding that the marriage itself is void.|$|E
50|$|Sanatio in radice retroactively {{dispenses}} the impediment {{and makes}} a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> valid {{from the time the}} sanatio is granted. The sanatio revalidates a marriage by reason of a consent formerly given, but ineffective because of an impediment. When the impediment is removed or dispensed, the consent is ipso facto ratified and no renovation is required. In such a case, it is requisite that the consent of both parties to the marriage had not ceased and that their marriage had had the external appearance of a true marriage.|$|E
50|$|Putative spouse {{status is}} a {{remedial}} doctrine {{designed to protect}} the reasonable expectations of someone who acts on the belief that they are married, and generally entitled a putative spouse to the rights a legal spouse would have for the period from the <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> until discovery that the marriage was not legal. It is possible that a person could have both a legal spouse and someone is a putative spouse, as when a person remarries, not realizing that the divorce decree had not been made final for his original marriage; in which case, courts are directed to do what seems appropriate in the circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Should {{the second}} {{marriage}} have been contracted in good faith, if only by one party, and it subsequently {{appear that the}} first spouse still lived, then the second marriage would not only be invalid, but the parties to it must be separated by the ecclesiastical authorities, and the first marriage re-established. However, the second and invalid marriage would enjoy {{the advantage of being}} <b>putative</b> <b>marriage.</b> This second marriage, though illegal during the lifetime of the first spouse, may be validly contracted after his or her death; indeed, should the party who acted bona fide demand it, the guilty one is then bound to contract marriage validly with the petitioner.|$|E
50|$|Hall {{started dating}} Mick Jagger in 1977, {{despite the fact}} he was already married, after first meeting the {{previous}} year. They held an unofficial, private, marriage-like ceremony on November 21, 1990, in Bali, Indonesia. The <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> was later declared invalid (i.e. void ab initio) by the High Court of England and Wales in London in 1999. They have four children together: Elizabeth Scarlett (born 1984), James Leroy (born 1985), Georgia May (born 1992), and Gabriel Luke (born 1997). The couple lived together at Downe House, Richmond Hill, in Greater London, which Jagger purchased in the early 1990s. The couple split in 1999. Hall cited Jagger's infidelity {{as the cause of}} the break-up.|$|E
50|$|A <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> is an {{apparently}} valid marriage, entered into {{in good faith}} {{on the part of}} {{at least one of the}} partners, but that is legally invalid due to a technical impediment, such as a preexistent marriage on the part of one of the partners. Unlike someone in a common-law, statutory, or ceremonial marriage, a putative spouse is not legally married. Instead, a putative spouse believes himself or herself to be married in good faith and is given legal rights as a result of this person's reliance upon this good-faith belief. Putative marriages exist in both Catholic canon law and in various civil laws, though the rules may vary. In some jurisdictions, putative marriages are a matter of case law rather than legislation. In many jurisdictions, under civil law, the marriage becomes valid if the impediment is removed. If it is not removed, the innocent spouse, at least, is often entitled to the protections of a divorce for division of property and child custody.|$|E

50|$|Douglas' seal {{is on the}} Treaty of Salisbury {{approving}} the <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> between Margaret, Maid of Norway with Edward of Caernarfon, and was amongst those nobles that hammered out the deal that would become the Treaty of Birgham. At Norham, in June 1291, the Guardians accepted King Edward as Lord Paramount of Scotland. Whilst the negotiations were progressing, regarding {{the choice of the}} next King of Scots, Edward was staying with Sir Walter de Lindsay at Thurston Manor, near Innerwick, when William Douglas paid an oath of fealty to him in the chapel there. By the end of 1291, Douglas had fallen again into disfavour and had his lands of Douglasdale forfeited to the English King. Edward appointed his own creatures as baronial officers and made one Master Eustace de Bikerton, Parson of St. Bride's Kirk, the spiritual home and burying ground of the Douglases. John Balliol was declared King of Scots on 17 November 1292, and called his first parliament on 10 February 1293. Douglas along with Robert de Brus, Earl of Carrick, Aonghus MÃ³r mac Domhnaill, Lord of Islay, John, Earl of Caithness failed to attend and were proclaimed defaulters. Douglas attended the second parliament of King John, but was imprisoned again for failing to comply with royal officers enforcing a judgement against him, and imprisoning said officers in Douglas Castle. Whilst in prison Douglas was duty bound to be at his lands in Essex, in order to provide service for Edward, his failure cost him Â£20 sterling in fines.|$|E
5000|$|All statesâ€”including {{those that}} have {{abolished}} the contract of common-law marriage within their boundariesâ€”recognize common-law marriages lawfully contracted in jurisdictions that permit it. Some states that do not recognize common-law marriage also afford legal rights to parties to a <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> (i.e. in circumstances when someone who was not actually married, e.g. due to a failure to obtain or complete a valid marriage license from the proper jurisdiction, believed in good faith {{that he or she}} was married) that arise before a marriage's invalidity is discovered. This is because all states provide that validity of foreign marriage is determined per lex loci celebrationis â€” that is, [...] "by law of the place of celebration." [...] In addition, the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. Constitution, discussed below, requires all U.S. states to recognize the validity of official acts of other U.S. states. Thus, a marriage validly contracted in Ohio, including common-law marriages entered into before that state abolished new common-law marriages in 1991, is valid in Indiana, even though the common-law marriage could not have been legally contracted in Indiana, because Ohio law is the basis of its validity. However, by the same principle, a marriage that was not lawfully contracted in Ohio would not be valid in Indiana even if it could have been lawfully contracted there. Additionally, some courts have held that all marriages performed within the U.S. must be valid in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution. [...] However, none of the cases to date has actually used the Clause to validate a sister-state marriage, and there is currently no known appellate case on the issue, working its way through U.S. courts, that is likely to reach the U.S. Supreme Court â€” whose decision would apply nationally, not just locally or within a particular state or a federal circuit.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the constitution of marriage legal regulation in the new Civil Code and the relating legislation. Primarily, it deals with the concept and the purpose of marriage, along with the moment of its constitution and, it outlines alternative forms of entering into marriage. The thesis further analyses the difference between the civil and religious marriage. The major chapter is devoted to entering into marriage with an international jurisdiction conflict because the number of marriages between Czech citizens with foreigners continues to increase. It becomes more frequent that the Czech citizens enter into marriage abroad. At the end, the causes and consequences of the <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> and the invalidity of the entering into marriage are examined...|$|E
40|$|The classic <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> {{doctrine}} is substantive, ameliorative or corrective; {{it is designed}} to allow all the civil effects [...] rights, privileges, and benefits [...] which obtain in a legal marriage to flow to parties to a null marriage who had a good faith belief that their 2 Ì† 2 marriage 2 Ì† 2 was legal and valid. Most jurisdictions in the United States have developed equitable analogues to the putative spouse doctrine that provide {{all or part of the}} relief afforded by the classic doctrine. If a marriage is declared to be null or void, that declaration is retroactive to the day that the null marriage was contracted. It could be said that the action in nullity does not produce a null marriage, but merely declares that the marriage has never existed. However, many jurisdictions only apply the relation-back doctrine when it will substantially fulfill justice and equity. Thus, generally, a marriage declared null produces no effects of marriage whatsoever. Unless some protective or corrective measure intercedes, the normal civil effects of marriage simply do not flow from a marriage, which is null. Thus, for example, if the results are consistent with the concept of nullity, a minor party to the null marriage would not be emancipated; no marital property regime would ever exist; all donations in contemplation of marriage should be null, as well as all donations in or since the marriage contract that were made to the party as spouse; children of the couple born during the null marriage would be illegitimate; children of the couple who would have been legitimated by the marriage have not been legitimated; neither 2 Ì† 2 spouse 2 Ì† 2 has a right to workers 2 Ì† 7 compensation or a wrongful death action through the other; and neither spouse would have a right to the marital portion of the other 2 Ì† 7 s estate. The <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> {{doctrine is}} a device developed to ameliorate or correct the injustice, which would occur if civil effects were not allowed to flow to a party to a null marriage who believes in good faith that he or she is validly married. A <b>putative</b> <b>marriage,</b> therefore, is a marriage which is in reality null, but which allows the civil effects of a valid marriage to flow to the party or parties who contracted it in good faith. It is a marriage which has been solemnized in proper form and celebrated in good faith by one or both parties, but which, by reason of some legal infirmity, is either void or voidable. The doctrine developed as a canon law palliative to protect those persons who went through a marriage ceremony in the good faith belief that the marriage was valid and proper, when it was actually null due to some impediment. It provides that, notwithstanding its nullity, the civil effects of a legal marriage flow to the parties who, in good faith, contract an invalid marriage...|$|E
40|$|The Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998 {{is a major}} {{legislative}} {{measure for}} the development of customary marriages in line with the constitutional principle of equality, specifically for women. The article explores the interactions between this ideal in the Act with empirical observations and the latest judicial decisions concerning its application. It considers various examples of the lack of protection of women in relationships of a customary nature, and it concludes that both the state and courts favour a formal or definitional approach to customary marriage. In considering alternative approaches that could adequately protect vulnerable parties, two conclusions emerge: First, the article recommends a wholesale revision of the South African family law approach from a focus on form to dependency. Second (and as a short-term measure), the article advocates for the <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> doctrine to be applied in the customary marriage context to protect many women who are denied access to 'customary marriage' as a form, and as a result, all of the benefits that flow from such marriage.

40|$|Marriage The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} legal institution of marriage - from the conclusion of marriage to the ending of it - according to the current legislation. I compare main changes introduced by the new Civil Code with legislation before 1 st of January 2014. The reason I chose this topic {{was the fact that}} institute of marriage affects everyday life of almost every individual. My thesis is composed of five chapters. Each of them deals with different aspects of marriage. Besides these five chapters this thesis includes Introduction, Conclusion, Index of Appendices and the List of Bibliographical References. Chapter one concentrates on the most important changes in the Family law area during the modern history, including recent recodification of private law. This chapter also contains summary of the main legal sources of marital law and examines the term marriage itself and its purpose. Chapter two focuses on the conclusion of marriage. Main focus is on engagement, the actual process of marriage, the purpose of marriage, proceedings preceding the conclusion of marriage and the types of forms of marriage. Conclusion of marriage based on extraordinary situation, qualifications to conclude marriage and its legal impediments are also discussed. Chapter three discusses <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is to {{describe}} and to compare individual aspects of invalid and <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands and to analyse the reasons which lead to existence of these marriages. The reason for which I have chosen this topic {{is the fact that}} marriage {{is one of the most}} important legal institutions of family law and since the commencement of the new statute 89 / 2012 Sb., some requirements for marriage have been changed. The Dutch law is based on very similar principles as the Czech law, but the application of these principles is different in many ways. The thesis is composed of six chapters, the introduction and the conclusion. The first chapter of my thesis characterizes marriage as a legal institution in terms of its concept, purpose and function. It also compares marriage to other forms of living arrangements that are possible in the Czech Republic. The second chapter focuses on formation of marriage, the possible forms of entering into marriage, and analyses the conditions that must be met in the marriage to be valid, including special requirements for entering into marriage in unusual situations. The next chapter characterizes the legal consequences of marriage defects depending on their severity. The fourth chapter deals with invalid marriage and divides [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to be a type of 2 Ì† 2 structuralist 2 Ì† 2 commentary upon selected provisions in Book I of the Louisiana Civil Code. Its sole purpose is to illustrate, both for pedagogical and doctrinal reasons, some of the analytical difficulties to which these code provisions might give rise when they are read in a close textual fashion. It should be emphasized that this study is a textual commentary and not a historical assessment of the sources or origins of the code texts â€“ the latter analysis is outside the purview of the present endeavor. Accordingly, this article consists of a critical textual evaluation of the relevant code provisions of Book I of the Louisiana Civil Code, emphasizing internal inconsistencies, ambiguities, and inequities which point to a need for legislative reconsideration and redrafting. For example, it is difficult from a reading of Book I to identify the actual impediments to marriage. In addition, the provisions relating to <b>putative</b> <b>marriage</b> appear to lead, in certain circumstances, to an easily resolvable injustice to children born of such unions. Moreover, the first book of the Code contains outmoded provisions, such as article 120, which no longer reflect contemporary conceptions about the role {{of men and women in}} marriage. Articles 138, 141, and 160 establish the primacy of fault in regulating marital breakdowns and their financial consequences; it is submitted that, upon a close examination of the code provisions and the applicable case law, the role of fault not only is ill-defined but also needs to be reevaluated in light of the evolution of mores and the emergence of trends in other civilian jurisdictions. Finally, the issue of legitimacy and the presumption of paternity in article 184 are analyzed for their possible gender-based discriminatory effect. The gravamen of this article is not to advocate a particular view of marriage or of the role of a fault analysis in the breakdown of marriage, but rather to begin an inquiry into the structural and substantive cohesion of Book I of the Code. The language of article 138 makes the dissolution of marriage a reality; the question remains, however, whether the state, in the exercise of its legitimate regulatory power in this area, has articulated a set of norms which continue to be viable in contemporary society. While moral, religious, and psychological perceptions of marriage may conflict, it is incumbent upon the legislature to arrive at a workable reconciliation of these values by elaborating a set of coherent guiding principles...|$|E
