40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} cold {{deformation}} on the yield strength and precipitate behavior of Al- 1. 3 Mg- 1. 2 Si- 0. 5 Cu- 0. 7 Mn alloy sheet subjected to T 4 P temper for automotive body panels {{before and after}} <b>paint-bake</b> treatment were investigated by tensile test and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The {{results show that the}} T 4 P alloy sheet has significant work-hardening response (WHR), and the yield strength increment exceeds 190 MPa as the tensile deformation strain approaches 15 %. The unstrained T 4 P alloy sheet has obvious paint-baking response (PBR), and the yield strength increment is up to 80 MPa, while the PBR of the cold stretched T 4 P alloy sheets decrease with increasing level of tensile deformation, and the minimal PBR is only 17. 8 MPa. The prior tensile deformation accelerates the precipitation of β ″ and β ′ phase from the T 4 P alloy matrix during <b>paint-bake</b> cycle but weakens the age-hardening response (AHR) and PBR of T 4 P alloy sheet. Moreover, it is evident that the T 4 P alloy sheet simulation <b>paint-bake</b> treated at 170 ℃ for 30 min can not fully exert the aging potential of the alloy sheet...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a heat treatment process using Taguchi’s robust design method {{to determine the}} optimal heat treatment conditions for Al-Mg-Si wrought alloys, which is an alloy used in automotive body panels. Important factors influencing the optimization criteria include solution temperature, solution time, pre-aging temperature, and pre-aging time. The optimal heat-treatment conditions for both microhardness and <b>paint-bake</b> response of the Al-Mg-Si wrought alloys are a solution temperature of 550 °C, solution time of 30 min, pre-aging temperature of 90 °C, and pre-aging time of 60 min. The optimal conditions for tensile strength are a solution temperature of 530 °C, solution time of 60 min, pre-aging temperature of 90 °C, and pre-aging time of 30 min. Experimental results indicate that solution temperature {{is the most significant}} factor for both microhardness and alloy elongation, solution time is the important factor for yield-strength, and pre-aging temperature is the most significant factor for <b>paint-bake</b> response and ultimate tensile strength...|$|E
40|$|Hardness {{measurements}} and 3 -dimensional atom probe analysis {{have been used}} to characterise the precipitation behaviour in two 6 xxx series aluminium alloys, one Cu-free alloy (Al- 0. 78 at%Mg 0. 68 at%Si) and one Cu-containing alloy (Al- 0. 78 at%Mg- 0. 68 at%Si- 0. 30 at%Cu). The heat treatments consisted of either natural ageing or pre-ageing at 353 K followed by a <b>paint-bake</b> treatment at 453 K. Natural ageing was seen to increase the hardness, and hence reduce formability compared to pre-ageing. In addition, the strengthening effect of artificial ageing was less after natural ageing than after pre-ageing. In the Cu-ftee alloy, needle-like beta" was observed to form only after a pre-ageing treatment during the first 60 minutes of a <b>paint-bake</b> treatment. In the Cu-containing alloy, needle-like beta" formed during paint bake in both the naturally-aged and pre-aged material, although it is formed more rapidly after pre-ageing. This was accompanied by an increase in strength over the Cu-ftee alloy and indicates that Cu reduces the deleterious effect of natural ageing...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is focused on}} the effect <b>paint-bake</b> cycles have on the tensile strength and microhardness of GMAW welded RX 82 aluminum extrusions in T 4 and T 6 base conditions. To simulate the <b>paint-bake</b> cycle, T 4 and T 6 RX 82 aluminum samples were GMAW welded and heat treated at 350 °F, 390 °F, and 425 °F for durations of 30 minutes, 1. 0 hour, and 2. 0 hours, with five replicates for each treatment. Microhardness profiles of T 4 samples treated at 350 °F for 30 minutes and 1. 0 hour display weld/HAZ HV values of 86. 04 and 82. 51 respectively, followed by maximums of 123. 21 and 121. 10. Average ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of T 4 samples treated at 350 °F started at 38. 26 ksi, dropped to 34. 91 ksi, and increased to 38. 24 ksi for 30 minutes, 1. 0 hour, and 2. 0 hour treatments. T 4 samples treated at 390 °F showed an increase in UTS with increasing exposure duration; however 425 °F treatments displayed a decrease in UTS. T 6 samples treated at 350 °F and 390 °F increased in average UTS, while T 6 samples treated at 425 °F increased then decreased in strength. A general linear model of the T 4 tensile samples shows no statistically significant difference in UTS between treatments or treatment levels, while T 6 tensile data shows statistically significant differences between the 350 °F and 390 °F/ 425 °F treatment temperature, with another significant difference between the 30 minute and 1. 0 hour/ 2. 0 hour treatment durations...|$|E

The effect of prestraining to 3. 5 % with or without successive annealing at 180 °C for 30 min has also been evaluated. These treatments were used to simulate pressing of the plates and the <b>paint-bake</b> cycle {{in the production of}} car bodies.

40|$|Abstract. The {{relationship}} between the cluster morphology formed during natural or artificial aging and the <b>paint-bake</b> hardening response in an Al- 0. 62 Mg- 0. 93 Si (mass%) alloy have been investigated using atom probe tomography (APT). Increasing the subsequent aging time at 170 ℃ causes a gradual increase in hardness in the artificially aged materials, while the retardation period of the hardness increase appears in the naturally aged materials at the early stage of aging. The statistically-proved records in the APT analysis {{have shown that the}} artificially aged materials have some large clusters. It is revealed that the hardening at the early stage of the subsequent aging at 170 ℃ is not promoted in the long-time naturally aged material although the number density of small clusters increases approximately 1. 3 times by prolonged natural aging. Hence, we believe that the small clusters are hard to transform continuously into the β’ ’ phase during aging at 170 ℃. As for the naturally aged materials, the long-time aging leads to a significant drop in hardness at the early stage of aging at 170 ℃. It is speculated that the Mg-Si mixed clusters formed after long-time natural aging can be reversed during the subsequent heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|Sandwich {{composites}} {{are becoming}} increasingly popular in the automotive sector as they are lightweight and facilitate noise attenuation. However, given that sandwich composites are relatively new in the sector, there are questions {{as to whether they}} can effectively replace monolithic metals and damping patches without compromising mechanical performance. Quiet Aluminum®, a sandwich composite produced by Material Sciences Corporation (MSC), employs as skins two aluminum alloys that are common in automotive manufacturing: 5754 -O and 6061 -T 4. The current study examines and compares the mechanical properties of Quiet Aluminum® with the main Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) requirements for laminates with non-structural loads. The adhesion mechanism between the layers of the sandwich composites received was examined through: T-Peel test, roughness measurements and metallographic cross sectioning technique. The current study then employed tensile tests with different treatments applied to the sandwich materials, a Self-Piercing Riveting (SPR) joining evaluation, and hardness tests on the core section of the aluminum skins. The samples, which presented rolling mill-finish surface roughness �� range of 0. 46 − 0. 56 ��, met the FCA adhesion requirements with adhesive failure mode even after the paint bake-cycle simulation (20 ��� at 185 ℃) and the hardening treatment applied on the sandwich with AA 6061 -T 4 skin (1 ℎ at 200 ℃). The tensile properties, computed simulating stamping process (2 % pre-applied strain), the <b>paint-bake</b> cycle and the hardening treatment were comparable to the monolithic ones.

40|$|Hardness {{measurements}} and Three-Dimensional Atom Probe (3 DAP) {{were used to}} characterize {{the early stages of}} precipitation in three different Al-Mg-Si alloys (Al- 0. 50 wt%Mg- 1. 00 wt%Si) with different Cu contents (0. 03 wt%, 0. 15 wt%, or 0. 80 wt% Cu). Heat treatments were chosen to simulate an industrial production line for car body-sheet material and included natural ageing (NA), pre-ageing at 80 °C (PA), <b>paint-bake</b> ageing at 180 °C (PB) and 10 second ageing at 180 °C (spike). The Cu content and the chosen heat treatments were found to influence the microstructural evolution of the alloy considerably. Based on the determined microstructures and matrix solute concentrations, mechanisms for the effect of NA, PA and Cu additions were proposed. NA had a deleterious effect on the PB hardening response, which was delayed dramatically after 20 minutes NA or longer. When the NA time was 1 minute, β" precipitates were formed within 30 minutes PB resulting in high hardness of the alloy. The delay with NA time was caused by a decrease in the nucleation rate of elongated precipitates during the subsequent PB. This decrease was thought to be due to a combination of a decrease in the matrix solute concentrations and clusters acting as vacancy sinks. PA before NA improved the PB response due to the formation of a high density of short elongated precipitates. Small Mg-Si clusters were detected after both NA and PA. Clusters formed during PA were found to be, on average, Mg-richer and larger than those formed during NA. Larger clusters were found to be more stable during PB and, upon PB, to grow into nucleation sites for elongated precipitates. Application of a spike before PA resulted in faster growth of clusters during PA. Growth of clusters and nucleation of short elongated precipitates during PB was found to be enhanced with increasing Cu content when no PA was given. Cu was found to be present in all precipitates and clusters in the alloy with the highest Cu content. These precipitates were thought to be precursors to the Q' phase.

40|$|Stretch forming is {{a common}} {{deformation}} mode during the stamping of 6 xxx series Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) automotive body panels. Good formability in this mode requires high work hardening and strain rate hardening capabilities, which are controlled by the alloy composition and processing (particularly heat treatments) through their influence on the microstructure. The influence of composition and heat treatment on the formability of 6 xxx alloys has been previously investigated, but systematic research is still {{needed in order to}} provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} underlying mechanisms for the purpose of maximising the formability of 6 xxx alloys, whenever possible, by composition and heat treatment modifications. Therefore, in this PhD project, the effects of alloy composition (Si, Mg and Cu contents) and heat treatment (natural ageing and/or pre-ageing at 100 ºC for 2 h or at 200 ºC for 20 s) on the formability of eight 6 xxx alloys were systematically studied. The microstructure of these alloys was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The macro-texture was characterised by X-ray diffraction. A surface profilometer was used to characterise the strain localisation. Tensile testing was used to determine the uniaxial tensile properties, and to study the work hardening and strain rate hardening behaviour of these alloys, which were used to correlate the microstructural features with the formability results. The use of Kocks-Mecking-Estrin model enabled a separation of the contributions of different microstructural features to the work hardening capability of the alloys studied. Furthermore, based on the knowledge from the experimental and constitutive modelling results, thermodynamic modelling was employed to predict the microstructure that could improve the formability of a high Mg content alloy. In this work it was found that solutes in solution are the most important factor that influences the stretch formability. It increases the work hardening capability by increasing the dislocation storage rate and impeding the dynamic recovery. For instance, Cu atoms were found to have a significant influence on the dislocation storage rate while having little influence on the dynamic recovery rate; conversely, Mg atoms have a substantial influence on the dynamic recovery rate while having little effect on the dislocation storage rate; and, finally, Si atoms have a slight influence on both the dynamic recovery rate and the dislocation storage rate. It should be noted that increasing Si content also leads to a high number density of dispersoids, although the contribution of dispersoids to work hardening is much smaller than that of solute atoms in solution. In terms of strain rate hardening behaviour, solute atoms in solution (particularly Mg atoms) reduce the strain rate sensitivity (SRS). However, if the addition of solutes promotes the natural ageing kinetics, then a high SRS is observed after extended natural ageing. This is the case in the high Si content alloys. By contrast, high Mg content alloys normally show a sluggish natural ageing kinetics, thus a larger negative contribution to SRS associated with dynamic strain ageing (DSA) can be observed. It was also found that Cu additions can retard the natural ageing kinetics regardless of the magnitude of the Mg/Si ratio in the alloys. The degree of retardation does depend on the Mg/Si ratio, though. This is particularly the case in the alloys with a high Mg/Si ratio where serrated yielding can still be observed in the alloy after one week of natural ageing. This is at variance with other alloys where serrated yielding disappeared within one day of natural ageing after quenching, which can be associated with the depletion of solutes and quenched-in vacancies. Vacancies were also found to influence the formability. This is particularly important in pre-aged samples. After one week of natural ageing, pre-aged samples showed a lower SRS than those without pre-ageing, which is probably due to a higher vacancy concentration in the pre-aged samples. The excess vacancies may exist as solute-vacancy complexes or be bound with solute clusters depending on pre-ageing time. A model was proposed to account for the decreased SRS in the pre-aged samples. Stretch formability is a property that is crucial in the selection of Al alloys for targeted applications. It was investigated in the course of the project in great detail. The overall effect of the alloy composition on the formability is that increasing Si content or decreasing Mg/Si ratio can improve the stretch formability due to the increased work hardening and strain rate hardening capabilities. The addition of Cu can significantly enhance the stretch formability of alloys with Mg/Si > 1, which is because the magnitude of the work hardening is more important than that of the strain rate hardening. An important property that influences acceptance of an alloy of the 6 xxx series by industry is its bake-hardening response. This aspect of alloy development was also studied in the thesis. It was shown that although pre-ageing can improve the <b>paint-bake</b> response of the 6 xxx alloys, pre-ageing was found to reduce their stretch formability due to the decreased work hardening and strain rate hardening capabilities. This effect is especially pronounced in the case when the samples are pre-aged at 100 ºC for 2 h, as pre-ageing reduces the strain rate hardening appreciably. Therefore, this work suggests that any attempts at improving the stretch formability of 6 xxx alloys must also consider their effects on the <b>paint-bake</b> response. Finally, thermodynamic modelling results show that the stretch formability of the excess Mg alloy A 2, which has a relatively poor stretch formability, can be improved by increasing the Si and Mn contents and/or decreasing the Mg content. Thus, a tangible outcome of the PhD project is a detailed set of reliable experimental results on the effect of the alloy composition and heat treatment of 6 xxx alloys studied on their strength and ductility characteristics, stretch formability, and bake-hardening response. Moreover, practically, this PhD project not only explains why most of the commercial 6 xxx alloys for automotive outer panels are Si-rich alloys, but also provides guidance for the development of Mg-rich 6 xxx alloys for automotive panel applications...|$|E
