50|$|James Buist, {{a farmer}} in Saskatchewan, {{borrowed}} {{money from the}} Innovation Credit Union in October 1991. In return, he provided the credit union with a security interest {{in all of his}} present and after-acquired personal property, which would be governed by the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Security</b> Act (Saskatchewan). The interest was not entered into Saskatchewan's PPSA registry until June 2004.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> rule – no one {{can transfer}} a better title to property than they had – is subject to exceptions in the Sale of Goods legislation, which aim to protect innocent buyers who are deceived by a seller’s apparent physical possession of property. These exceptions cover a limited range of transactions and are restrictive in their operation. Australia now has national legislation - the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Securities</b> Act 2009 (Cth) - which will apply to many transactions {{outside the scope of}} the Sale of Goods Act and which includes rules for sales by non-owners which will provide exceptions to the nemo dat quod non habet rule for many common commercial transactions. This article explores the effect of the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Securities</b> Act 2009 (Cth) on the Sale of Goods exceptions, explains that the new provisions are so wide that there is little continuing relevance for the Sale of Goods Act exceptions, and indicates where they may still apply...|$|R

40|$|Australia has new {{national}} legislation - the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Securities</b> Act 2009 (Cth) and the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Securities</b> Regulations 2010 – which commenced operation on 30 January 2012. The policy {{objectives of the}} new legislation are to increase certainty and consistency and to reduce complexity and cost. To achieve this, the legislation treats like transactions alike, by focusing on substance over form, and so removes distinctions between security interests which {{have been based on}} their structure. Differences based on the location or nature of the secured property and the debtor’s legal form, as an individual or company, have also disappeared. We now have one single national scheme and one national electronic registration system for all security interests throughout Australia. The Act applies to security interests in tangible and intangible <b>personal</b> <b>property,</b> including those based on some form of title retention which are not security interests under the general law. This legislation rationalises previous laws and bring about substantial changes to this area of law. This paper seeks to explain the principal changes and their implications. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{characterization}} of property as a fixture or as chattel is important. In most jurisdictions, the law respecting the registration of security against debt, or proof that {{money has been}} lent on the collateral of property, is different for chattels {{than it is for}} real property. For example, in the province of Ontario, Canada, mortgages against real property must be registered in the county or region's land titles office. However, mortgages against chattels must be registered in the province-wide registry set up under the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Security</b> Act.|$|E
50|$|For {{personal}} property (moveable property in Quebec), secured creditors create their security interests through registration under the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Security</b> Act ("PPSA") in force in their province, {{or under the}} Civil Code in Quebec by way of hypothec through the Registre des droits personnels et réels mobiliers. Banks can also create security interests under SS. 426-427 of the Bank Act, which normally have priority over PPSA registrations. However, as noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Bank of Montreal v. Innovation Credit Union, with regard to unperfected security interests, this depends on {{the provisions of the}} PPSA in effect in the province concerned.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{portions}} of the UCC have been highly influential outside of the United States. Article 2 had some influence on the drafting of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), though the end result departed from the UCC in many respects (such as refusing to adopt the mailbox rule). Article 5, governing letters of credit, has been influential in international trade finance simply because so many major financial institutions operate in New York. Article 9, which established a unified framework for security interests in personal property, directly inspired the enactment of <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Security</b> Acts in every Canadian province and territory but Quebec from 1990 onward, followed by the New Zealand Personal Property Securities Act 1999 and then the Australia Personal Property Securities Act 2009.|$|E
40|$|This month’s column {{coincides with}} the six-month anniversary of the {{commencement}} of the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Securities</b> Act 2009 (Cth) (PPSA). The Australian courts have, apart from the very recent Federal Court consideration of unclaimed <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> owned or {{in the possession of}} a company subject to administration in the Hastie group been otherwise dormant with respect to the PPSA. This is hardly surprising, especially given another 18 months 'grace period' remains to protect transitional security interests. Even for new security interests, litigants may be waiting for others to dip their toe in the judicial waters; this {{is only a matter of}} time, particularly given the size and nature of some recent retail and construction insolvencies. But this curial vacuum should not lull us into a false sense of security after the early cases addressing conceptual issues under the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Securities</b> Act 1999 (NZ) (PPSA NZ), its courts are now in the second phase, interpreting more intricate points. Over the coming months, this column will explore some of those and other points, but in this issue we are focusing on a security interest that is not governed by the PPSA.

5000|$|As noted above, UCC Article 9's core insight {{was that}} the {{traditional}} distinctions were hopelessly obsolete, which was highly influential elsewhere and inspired {{the enactment of the}} <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Security</b> Acts throughout Canada during the 1990s. Although Ontario was the first province to enact such a law in 1990, all other Canadian provinces and territories followed the example set by Saskatchewan's PPSA enacted in 1993. The PPSAs are generally similar to UCC Article 9. However, they differ substantially on several issues such as the treatment of rental property, and the effectiveness of a financing statement after a debtor changes its name. Quebec has not enacted a PPSA but the sections of the 1994 Quebec Civil Code governing hypothecs were clearly influenced by the PPSAs and Article 9, and the province has made further amendments to the Civil Code to make possible more types of transactions that are already available in Article 9 jurisdictions.|$|E
5000|$|In turn, {{international}} development experts {{recognized in the}} mid-1990s that reform {{of the law of}} security interests was a major reason for the prosperity of both Canada and United States, in that it had enabled their businesses to finance growth through forms of secured lending which simply did not exist elsewhere. [...] The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other international lenders began to encourage other countries to follow Canada's example as part of the structural adjustment process (a consultation process often required as a condition of their loans). The Canadian PPSAs were subsequently followed by the New Zealand Personal Property Securities Act 1999, the Vanuatu Personal Property Securities Act 2008, the Australia Personal Property Securities Act 2009, the Papua New Guinea <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Security</b> Act 2012, the Jersey Security Interests Law 2012 (covering intangible personal property only), the Samoa Personal Property Securities Act 2013, and the Jamaica Security Interests in Personal Property Act 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Fourteen new {{pieces of}} {{legislation}} were adopted in Fall 2011, including the Nurse Practitioners Statutes Amendment Act which inserted roles for nurse practitioners {{in the health care}} system; the Greater Vancouver Transit Enhancement Act which raised the fuel tax within Metro Vancouver to fund the proposed Evergreen Line SkyTrain extension; the Regulatory Reporting Act which requires the provincial government to annually report on changes to regulations; the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Security</b> Amendment Act which allows transferable licences issued by the province to be used as collateral; and the Natural Resource Compliance Act which merged all Crown land compliance and enforcement staff into a new positions called [...] "natural resource officers". The Metal Dealers and Recyclers Act created a Registrar of Metal Dealers and Recyclers in which people who buy and sell scrap metal will be registered and requires them to record and report transactions. The Teachers Act repealed the Teaching Profession Act and dissolved the old act's BC College of Teachers {{to make way for the}} new BC Teachers' Council and a Disciplinary and Professional Conduct Board. The new teacher regulations and disciplinary procedures were meant to fix the old system which had become ineffective, but it was criticized for making disciplinary hearings of teachers open to the public. The Family Law Act gave couples who have lived together for two or more years the same rights as married couples.|$|E
