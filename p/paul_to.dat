5|$|Paul is {{rescued by}} Stewie Wilkes (Stewie), Paul's self-proclaimed number-one fan, {{who takes the}} injured <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> his/her remote cabin. Upon finding and reading the {{manuscript}} of Paul's latest Snuggly Jeff book, Stewie is infuriated about the main character's death and forces <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> rewrite it and bring Snuggly Jeff back to life, holding him hostage until he manages to do so. Stewie rejects the idea of bringing Snuggly Jeff back to life with a child's wish, calling it bad storytelling and comparing it to a plot hole in the film Contact.|$|E

5|$|On December 8, 2011, the Hornets {{agreed to}} a three-team trade sending <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> the Los Angeles Lakers. The NBA, who owned the team at the time, nullified the deal, with {{commissioner}} David Stern claiming New Orleans {{would be better off}} keeping Paul. The teams involved in the trade attempted to lobby the league to reverse its ruling and reconstruct the deal to no avail. On December 12, the Hornets {{agreed to a}} trade sending <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> the Los Angeles Clippers, but the deal broke down after the NBA added additional demands to the original terms. Two days later, the teams finally made the trade, sending Paul and two future second round draft picks to the Clippers for future teammate Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first round pick in the 2012 draft. Upon the deal's completion, Paul announced that he would opt into the final year of his contract and remain in Los Angeles for at least two more seasons.|$|E

While driving through a snowstorm, Paul accidentally hits Stephen King with his car, causing <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> swerve {{off the road and}} crash into a snowbank, while King gets the idea for another novel within seconds and manages to finish writing the plot in just a few seconds before hitting the ground completely unscathed.|$|E

5|$|I-35E was {{completed}} {{north of downtown}} Saint Paul in 1970. The first section to open ran north from Maryland Avenue in Saint <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> I-694 in Little Canada; this {{was completed}} in the early 1960s, concurrently with I-694 west to old MN49 (Rice Street). Later that decade, I-35E was extended south to downtown Saint Paul, opening first to Pennsylvania Avenue and then to I-94, including the I-35E / I-94 concurrency (and I-94 in both directions). In 1970, I-35E was extended north along the I-35E / I-694 concurrency in Little Canada– Vadnais Heights and also extended northbound to its northern terminus at Columbus near Forest Lake; the adjacent sections of I-35, I-35W, and I-694 opened {{at about the same}} time.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{has been}} married to Carol (Carolyn) Wells since 1957. They met in 1952 when Wells asked <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> be her escort to her 16th {{birthday}} party. They have five children, who were baptized Episcopalian: Ronald, Lori, Randal, Robert, and Joy. Paul's son Randal is the junior United States senator {{from the state of}} Kentucky. Raised a Lutheran, Paul later became a Baptist. Since 1995, Carol Paul has published the Ron Paul Family Cookbook, a collection of recipes she and her friends contributed, and which was sold in part to support Ron Paul's political campaigns. His life and career is the subject of the 2012 film Ron Paul Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{joined a}} Manchester City side which {{had just been}} relegated to the Second Division, and were thus playing {{at the same level}} as Swansea. Paul made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 1950–51 season, a 4–2 victory against a Preston North End side {{featuring}} Tom Finney. Manchester City went ten matches unbeaten {{at the start of the}} season, until a 4–3 defeat at Doncaster Rovers, where City blew a 3–0 half-time lead. Paul played in all but one match that season, becoming club captain and helping his club win promotion, as runners-up behind champions Preston. Writer HD Davies, under his pen name Old International, attributed much of City's cohesive play over the season to the addition of <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> the side.|$|E

5|$|Paul was {{considered}} a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States since at least January 2013. He delivered the Tea Party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on February 13, 2013, while Marco Rubio gave the official Republican response. This prompted some pundits to call that date {{the start of the}} 2016 Republican primaries. That year, he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C., where he won the 2016 Presidential straw poll. Paul {{went on to win the}} straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.|$|E
5|$|When Terese {{goes through}} a rough patch in her {{marriage}} to Brad (Kip Gamblin), Paul arranges her former boss, Ezra Hanley (Steve Nation), to come to Erinsborough, {{with the intention of}} breaking up the Willis' marriage. However, Ezra tries to force himself on Terese and is fired from Lassiter's. When he tries to sue Paul and Terese, Paul pays Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) to attack Ezra. When Gary confesses to the police, Paul gives him more money to keep quiet about their arrangement. Paul hires Naomi to organise the Erinsborough Festival, two weeks of events celebrating the suburb. Hilary Robinson returns and convinces <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> reinstate some of the community services. Paul tries to stop Daniel and Amber's wedding by sending Amber away on a photography trip and planning for her flight to be cancelled, so she will not make the wedding. He also asks Des Clarke (Paul Keane) to talk to Daniel about the dangers of marrying the wrong person. Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) forces <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> bring Amber back, but he realises Imogen loves Daniel and tells Amber. Daniel fails to appear for the wedding after he goes looking for Imogen. Paul realises Nina Tucker (Delta Goodrem) is in town and with help from Lou and Karl, he convinces her to sing at the festival's closing concert.|$|E
5|$|According to Nicol, Tagaris was {{probably}} {{born in the}} 1320s, while other sources like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium and the Prosopographisches Lexikon der Palaiologenzeit put it later, around the year 1340. His parents arranged his marriage {{at the age of}} 14 or 15, but soon he abandoned his wife and left Constantinople to become a monk in Palestine. After a while he returned to Constantinople, where he quickly became embroiled in scandal: he claimed that an icon in his possession had miraculous properties, and made money out of gullible believers. This affair scandalized his family, but Patriarch Kallistos I declined to take action against him. It was not until the patriarch went on a visit to Serbia in July 1363 that his locum tenens, the hieromonk Dorotheos, confiscated the icon and forced <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> return to Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Elle {{manages to}} {{convince}} <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> sign over {{his share of}} Lassiter's {{to her and she}} leaves him with nothing. Paul has a brain tumour removed and he loses his memory. He later apologises to his neighbours for all the bad things he did. Paul begins a relationship with Oliver's mother, Rebecca Napier, and she and her youngest son, Declan (James Sorensen), move in with him. Remembering that he murdered Gus, Paul confesses all to the police and Gus's sister Laura (Jodi Flockhart). The police inform Paul {{that they will not be}} pursuing the case, while Laura and her boyfriend Nick Thompson (Marty Grimwood) try to blackmail Paul by kidnapping Declan. Paul has an affair with Kirsten Gannon (Nikola Dubois) and Rebecca ends their relationship. Paul regains his assets from Elle and he buys the Erinsborough News. Paul briefly dates Cassandra Freedman (Tottie Goldsmith), but he and Rebecca soon reconcile. Paul is initially blamed for his half-sister Jill Ramsay's (Perri Cummings) death. He goes on the run, but his name is cleared by Jill's daughter Sophie (Kaiya Jones). When Paul and Rebecca get engaged, Lyn interrupts their wedding to announce she and Paul are still married. After divorcing Lyn, Paul marries Rebecca.|$|E
5|$|Felicia {{takes in}} Paul's son, Zach (Cody Kasch), informing him that Paul {{will not be}} returning. Zach violently attacks Felicia, forcing her to reveal that Mike has taken Paul away to kill him. Later that day, Susan goes to Mike's house to feed his dog and discovers Zach waiting with a gun. He holds Susan hostage and {{explains}} his plan to kill Mike when he returns home. Meanwhile, Mike takes <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> a desert and coerces him into explaining the truth behind Dierdre's death. Paul explains that twelve years earlier, Dierdre, a drug addict, sold Mary Alice and Paul her baby. The couple relocate to Wisteria Lane to avoid the discovery of their crime. Sometime later, a sober Dierdre finally tracked down the Young family and attempted to take her son back. Mary Alice stabbed and killed Dierdre to prevent her from taking Zach. Together, Mary Alice and Paul buried Dierdre's body beneath their pool.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Saint Paul Neighborhood Network's youth {{department}} {{produced a}} short video, reporting on Arlington's diminishing {{financial support for}} its art program, a video that would win SPNN the 2007 Alliance for Community Media Hometown Video Award for Visual Art-Youth entry. Arlington {{is one of three}} schools in Minnesota and one of two in Saint <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> have a Naval Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps unit. Arlington's NJROTC unit was named a Distinguished Unit for the fifth consecutive year. Only 20 percent of units earn the Distinguished Unit recognition yearly. The Mural is the school's student published newspaper. Issues are published monthly. A number of partnerships with community organizations are offered. Local colleges such as Saint Paul College, Century College and the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management. Internships with local multinational conglomerate 3M are also offered. The school also participates in Upward Bound with the University of Minnesota, Advancement Via Individual Determination Program (AVID) and Admission Possible, a program that helps low-income students attend college. The school has a Multicultural Excellence Program (MEP) that gives guidance to students of color who wish to earn a college degree.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running {{for re-election}}. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed {{a bill that would}} allow <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up. Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.|$|E
5|$|In his 1988 book Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, the {{freelance}} dinosaurologist Gregory Paul {{proposed that}} A. fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build {{compared to a}} postulated second species A. atrox, and was not a different gender due to rarity. Allosaurus atrox was originally named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus, Creosaurus, {{and is based on}} YPM 1890, an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull, portions of nine tail vertebrae, two hip vertebrae, an illium, and ankle and foot bones. Although the idea of two common Morrison allosaur species was followed in some semi-technical and popular works, the 2000 thesis on Allosauridae noted that Charles Gilmore mistakenly reconstructed USNM 4734 as having a shorter skull than the specimens referred by <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> atrox, refuting supposed differences between USNM 4734 and putative A. atrox specimens like DINO 2560, AMNH 600, and AMNH 666.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1852, McClellan {{published}} a manual on bayonet tactics that he had translated from the original French. He also received an assignment to the Department of Texas, with orders to perform a survey of Texas rivers and harbors. In 1853 he participated in the Pacific Railroad surveys, ordered by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, to select an appropriate route for the planned transcontinental railroad. McClellan surveyed the western portion of the northern corridor along the 47th and 49th parallels from St. <b>Paul</b> <b>to</b> the Puget Sound. In so doing he demonstrated a tendency for insubordination toward senior political figures. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington Territory, became dissatisfied with McClellan's performance in scouting passes across the Cascade Range. McClellan selected Yakima Pass without a thorough reconnaissance and refused the governor's order to lead a party through it in winter conditions, relying on faulty intelligence about the depth of snow pack in that area. In so doing, he missed three greatly superior passes in the near vicinity, {{which would be the}} ones eventually used for railroads and interstate highways. The governor ordered McClellan to turn over his expedition logbooks, but McClellan steadfastly refused, most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout.|$|E
