5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Okello had given orders to kill no whites, the Americans living in Stone Town {{fled to the}} English Club, where the point for {{evacuation}} was. Those travelling in the car convoy to the English Club were shocked to see the battered bodies of Arab men lying {{out on the streets}} of Stone Town with their severed penises and testicles shoved into their mouths. As part of Okello's carefully laid out plans, all over the island, gangs of Africans armed with knives, spears and pangas (machetes) went about systemically killing all the Arabs they could find. The American diplomat Don Petterson described his horror as he watched from his house as he saw a gang of African men storm the house of an Arab, behead him in public with a <b>panga,</b> followed by screams from within his house as {{his wife and three children}} were raped and killed, followed by the same scene being repeated at the next house of an Arab, followed by yet another and another. After taking control of Stone Town on the first day, the revolutionaries continued to fight the Manga for control of the countryside for least two days afterwards with whole families of Arabs being massacred after their homes had been stormed.|$|E

2500|$|While most slasher movies owe a {{considerable}} debt to Bays somewhat nonsensical narrative and {{its emphasis on}} bodily mutilation, at least one film was directly imitative: Friday the 13th Part 2 notoriously copied two of Bava's murder sequences almost shot for shot: one character is slammed {{in the face with}} a <b>panga</b> machete (even though Bava's film had a billhook and not a machete), and two teenage lovers are interrupted when a spear impales both of them. Along with The Burning, Just Before Dawn (1981) and several other similarly-plotted slashers, Friday specifically [...] "followed Bava's inspired cue, having young people stalked by violent death amid beautiful wooded settings." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{sample of}} over 6, 000 {{specimens}} of frogs belonging to about 120 species of all families occurring in West Africa and Madagascar were screened for parasitic mites. Three species of Endotrombicula Ewing, 1931 {{were found in}} representatives of two African and two Madagascan frog families. All Trombiculidae found in African frogs belonged to Endotrombicula pillersi (Sambon, 1928), whereas in Madagascar E. madagascariensis (Sambon, 1928) and E. ptychadenae sp. n. were sampled. These three species are described, data about their parasitic associations are provided, and their zoogeographical distribution is discussed. Only those frog species that spend a considerable time in terrestrial ground habitats were parasitized; neither arboreal nor strictly aquatic frogs were infected. The geographic distribution of Endotrombicula, restricted to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar, suggests that these mites invaded Madagascar from the African continent. This {{is supported by the}} observation that the ancestors of Ptychadena mascareniensis (Duméril et Bibron) (Ptychadenidae), the host of E. ptychadenae, colonized Madagascar from the African continent quite recently, possibly accompanied by its Endotrombicula parasites. The phylogenetic relationships of amphibians have recently attracted much attention (e. g., Frost et al. 2006) and are often explained largely in terms of vicariance during the break-ups of the supercontinents <b>Pangae...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Riflemen were {{required}} to carry a <b>panga,</b> {{which could be used}} to chop down bush to create a landing zone so that helicopters could extract them. [...] Strangely, some riflemen tried not to carry this piece of equipment, while some gunners and stop commanders (also known as stick leaders and whose rank varied from Trooper to Captain) did carry them. Only the Stop Commanders carried mini-flares. [...] These devices were about {{the size and shape of}} a large pencil, which were used to signal positions, though never at night, and were popular with the troops. The parachute harnesses were Saviac Mk1s, of U.S. manufacture. They were extremely reliable with a reserve parachute on the chest. The parachutes were overhead static line.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the turn}} of the {{millennium}} Sony has released [...] more Kalahari Surfers albums. Akasic Record (2001) is [...] "a highly sophisticated foray into African-flavoured dubfunk"; Muti Media (2003) features a sculpture by Brett Murray on the cover, and Zukile Malahlana from Marekta appears on the album. Conspiracy of Silence (2005) and <b>Panga</b> Management (2007) followed. One Party State (2010) was released on Microdot and debuted at the African Soul Rebels Tour in the UK alongside Oumou Sangaré & Orchestre Poly-Rythmo De Cotonou. It features Sowetan poet Lesego Rampolokeng on four tracks. The Mail & Guardian called it [...] "a politically drenched album... track for track the most solid South African release of 2010". The Kalahari Surfers performed at the Cape Town Electronic Music Festival in early 2012, and released a live album of the performance. Agitprop was released later in 2012, on Sjambok Music; it was first played at the Unyazi Festival in Durban in September. Agitprop explores Sony's fears about South Africa in the 2010s becoming a one party state under the African National Congress, and includes a song about chemical warfare scientist Wouter Basson. South African Rolling Stone compared it to the KLF, Sly and Robbie and Pink Floyd, and described its [...] "slow evolution of nuance" [...] towards the [...] "desolately upbeat" [...] "Hostile Takeover". Sony says the album was mostly written on the train while commuting to work; he calls the genre [...] "Voktronic, ... a blend of folktronic, and volkspiele with a dose of electronic experimental dubstoep and experimental rolled up into one fat two blade stereo hit." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>Panga</b> {{is a type}} of modest-sized, open, outboard-powered, {{fishing boat}} common {{throughout}} much of the developing world, including Central America, the Caribbean, parts of Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia.

The name comes from the <b>panga</b> fish which is commonly netted, note the upswept bow of the boat which resembles the machete or knife called a <b>panga.</b> In addition to being used by fishermen, pangas are also popular with Somali pirates.|$|E

50|$|Key {{features}} of the <b>panga</b> design are a high bow, narrow waterline beam, and a flotation bulge along the gunwale, or top edge of the hull. The high bow provides buoyancy for retrieving heavy nets, and minimizes spray coming over the bow. The narrow beam allows the hull to be propelled by a modest-sized outboard motor. The flotation bulge along the gunwale provides increased stability at high angles of roll. These features link the <b>panga</b> design to traditional Japanese wasen fishing boats.|$|E
