40|$|Two {{standard}} {{schemes for}} learning in classifier {{systems have been}} proposed in the literature: the bucket brigade algorithm (BBA) and the <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>plan</b> (PSP). The BBA is a local learning scheme which requires less memory and lower peak computation than the PSP, whereas the PSP is a global learning scheme which typically achieves a clearly better performance than the BBA.

By the 1970s, the Winter Hill Gang, now led by Whitey Bulger, moved bookies under its protection away from the numbers game to sports betting, as the state was starting its own lottery and the National Football League did not allow betting on its games outside of Nevada, thereby the state could not compete with them.
