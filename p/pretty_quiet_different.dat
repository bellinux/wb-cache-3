6000|$|... 'If you fish did {{you ever}} try the Perch--I mean an inn, not the fish of the same name--at Walton-on-Dove? A <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> place, two miles of water, local history perhaps interesting. It is not very far from Tutbury, where Queen Mary was kept, I think.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] Charlie said. [...] "And I am by {{no means}} sorry of the {{opportunity}} of getting a glimpse of Calcutta, which I might never otherwise have done.

50|$|Today {{the temple}} {{is usually a}} <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> place where people can contemplate, study, and relax. It {{also serves as a}} {{cultural}} center in the sense that people can take a handful of culture related classes (i.e. calligraphy). However, the place becomes the center of attention on the morning of September 28 every year, as Taiwanese celebrate Confucius' birthday (officially known as Teachers' Day in Taiwan) with performances at the temple.|$|R
5000|$|... “He was so good, he {{just kind}} of set the {{standard}} for toughness,” according to Bob Julian Jr., the cross country coach for Ashland High School. “He basically was the standard around here, and nobody could compete with him.

If they fire a shot from the house we burn the house down and every house near it, and shoot the natives, so they are <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> in town now." ...|$|R
50|$|The resort {{was mainly}} popular amongst inland Bulgarian tourists, but {{recently}} there is {{rapid growth in}} the number of foreign tourists, mainly from Russia, but also from Great Britain, Poland, Romania and Scandinavia. Even though Sveti Vlas was heavily developed in 2000's it remained <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> and calm down place, making it good place to have a rest. Due to that fact the typical visitors in the resort are families with children.|$|R

6000|$|... 'My day? I don't {{remember}} being hit, you know. I don't remember anything till the quietness came. When {{you have been}} killed it suddenly becomes very quiet; quieter even than you have ever known it at home. Sunday {{used to be a}} <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> day at my tutor's, when Trotter and I flattened out on the first shady spot up the river; but it is quieter than that. I am not boring you, am I?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I shall {{give it all}} the {{painting}} it wants to do, and we and the family will make it as comfortable and contented as we can. No occasion to restrain its movements. I hope to persuade it to remain <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet,</b> though, because a materialization which {{is in a state}} of arrested development must of necessity be pretty soft and flabby and substanceless, and--er--by the way, I wonder where It comes from?" ...|$|R
50|$|The Nordiques had a <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> off-season, {{with the}} only trade during the summer was {{acquiring}} John Anderson from the Toronto Maple Leafs for Brad Maxwell.

Quebec also made a trade late in the pre-season, as the Nordiques acquired Gilbert Delorme from the St. Louis Blues for Bruce Bell. Delorme, a stay-at-home defenseman, had two goals and 14 points in 74 games with the Blues.|$|R
6000|$|Harry chuckled. [...] "You don't want to {{get them}} mixed with the redskins of the plains, though I suppose where they're not wiped out they're <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> too. These fellows are a {{different}} breed. Most of them are sailors and fishermen, and they dress {{much the same as}} you and I do. They come up these rivers now and then after the salmon, and they made this trail. You can tell that by the looks of it." ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{now about}} a week since my stag hunt, and Jone and I have kept <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet,</b> taking short walks, and doing {{a good deal of}} reading in our garden {{whenever}} the sun shines into the little arbor there, and Mr. Poplington {{spends most of his time}} fishing. He works very hard at this, partly for the sake of his conscience, I think, for his bicycle trip made him lose three or four days he had taken a license for.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning, dearest father," [...] {{said the}} sweet girl, passing an arm round Mr. Hardinge's neck, {{with more than}} her usual {{tenderness}} of manner, and imprinting a long kiss on his bald head. [...] "Good morning, Miles," [...] stretching towards me a hand, but averting her face, as afraid it might reveal too much, when exposed fully to my anxious and inquiring gaze.

6000|$|... "She can't {{possibly}} {{get out of}} that unless she tears the fence down," [...] she reflected. [...] "She looks <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> now. I daresay she has sickened herself on those oats. I wish I'd sold her to Mr. Shearer when he wanted her last week, but I thought {{it was just as well}} to wait until we had the auction of the stock and let them all go together. I believe it is true about Mr. Harrison being a crank. Certainly there's nothing of the kindred spirit about HIM." ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that {{reflective}} phenomena of singularities at the boundary for solutions of free boundary value problems of elastic equations are <b>quiet</b> <b>different</b> form these for solutions of usual wave equations. Here we shall show that similarly <b>quiet</b> <b>different</b> and interesting reflective and refractive phenomena of singularities are caused from boundary points of two solids for solutions of elastic equations. First we shall study the propagation of regularities for solutions and next we shall study reflective and refractive phenomena for tangential rays with singularities...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} last month, had I been a Pall Mall preacher, I {{would have}} liked to send a whip round to all the Clubs in St. James's, and convoke the few members {{remaining}} in London to hear a discourse sub Dio on a text from the Observer newspaper. I would have taken post under the statue of Fame, say, where she stands distributing wreaths to the three Crimean Guardsmen. (The crossing-sweeper does not obstruct the path, and I suppose is away at his villa on Sundays.) And, when the congregation was <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet,</b> I would have begun:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blome sat on {{the edge}} of a table an' he faced the door. Of course, there was a pard outside, ready to pop in an' tell him if Steele was comin'. But Steele didn't come in that way. He wasn't on the street just before that time, because Zimmer told me afterward. Steele must have been in the Hope So somewhere. Any way, just like he dropped from the clouds he came through the door near the bar. Blome didn't see him come. But most of the gang did, an' I want to tell you that big room went <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He rested <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> till {{it might}} want {{a few minutes}} of five, and then he starts up with a scream, and screams out, 'Here she is! She's got the shroud again.

Don't let her throw it over my shoulders. Don't let her lift me up to get it round me. She's lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he lifted himself up hard, and was dead.|$|R
60|$|But the Stokesley secrets {{have lasted}} long enough; {{and there is}} no time to tell of the happy days of Dora's visit, and the good care that Johnnie took of her {{whenever}} she went out, and of her <b>pretty</b> <b>quiet</b> ways that made Bessie take her for her dearest of friends. And still less can be told of the smooth, peaceful, free spirit that seemed to have come home with Mamma, even though she was still able to do little among the children, for the very having her in the house appeared to keep things from going wrong.|$|R
