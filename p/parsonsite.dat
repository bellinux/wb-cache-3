The weight loss obtained from TG curve is 3. 70 wt. %, corresponding to 1. 93 mols of H&# 060;sub&# 062; 2 &# 060;/sub&# 062;O.

40|$|The mineral <b>parsonsite</b> with {{samples from}} The Ranger Uranium Mine, Australia and La Faye Mine, Grury, Saone-et-Loire, Burgundy, France has been characterised by Raman spectrocopy at 298 and 77 K and complemented with {{infrared}} spectroscopy. Two Raman bands close to 807 and 796 cm- 1 {{are attributed to}} the ￮ 1 (UO 2) 2 + symmetric stretching modes, whilst two bands close to 953 or 945 cm- 1 and 863 - 873 cm- 1 are assigned to the ￮ 3 (UO 2) 2 + antisymmetric stretching vibrations. Four or five bands (953, 926, 910, 883 cm- 1) are observed in the infrared spectrum in this region. Bands at 965 - 967 and 972 cm- 1 are assigned to the ￮ 1 (PO 4) 3 - symmetric stretching modes and bands that are observed in the 987 to 1078 cm- 1 to the ￮ 3 (PO 4) 3 - antisymmetric stretching modes. Bands at 465, 439, 406, 394 cm- 1 (298 K) and 466, 442, 405, 395 cm- 1 (77 K) are assigned to the split doubly degenerate ￮ 2 (PO 4) - 3 bending vibrations. Bands of very low intensity at 609, 595, 591, 582, 560 and 540 cm- 1 are attributed to the split triply degenerate ￮ 4 (PO 4) - 3 bending modes. Bands observed at wavenumbers lower than 300 cm- 1 are connected with the split ￮ 2 (￤) (UO 2) 2 + bending, ￮ (U-Oligand), ￤ (U-Oligand), and lattice vibrations. U-O bond lengths in uranyl are calculated frm the Raman and infrared spectra which are in agreement with those from available X-ray single crystal structure analysis of <b>parsonsite.</b> Short comment {{is given to the}} water content and possibility of a hydrogen bonding network in <b>parsonsite</b> crystal structure...|$|E
30|$|Except {{traditional}} uranium-containing ores, such minerals as autunite [3], <b>parsonsite</b> [4], and monazite [5] can be {{a source}} of uranium [6], particularly deposit of monazite is located along the Sea of Azov in Ukraine [7]. Processing of monazite involves hydrochloride acid [8], in media of which uranium (VI) exists in cationic forms [9]. The problem of waste utilization arises, since the maximal permissible concentration for soluble U(VI) compounds in water is 0.015  mg dm− 3, but even lower values are recommended [10]. The requirements are so strict due to both radioactivity and chemical toxicity of uranium (toxicity is more dangerous than radioactivity). Uranium and decay products inflect all organs and tissues of living organisms.|$|E

The alteration mineral assemblage consisting mostly of uranyl phosphates and silicates exhibits relatively high contents of REE and Pb. Minerals with a composition corresponding to pure mineral end-members have not been observed; instead most of the studied phases represent members of isomorphic series. Studied mineral assemblage is a stable association in surface conditions resulting apparently from a long-term alteration of the primary uranium mineralization. &# 060;br&# 062;Dedicated to everlasting memory of outstanding mineralogist Ing.
