50|$|In Sweden, the {{industry}} together with universities {{and health care}} sector has developed a method for environmental risk assessment and environmental classification of drugs. Environmental risk refers {{to the risk of}} toxicity to the aquatic environment. It is based on the ratio between <b>predicted</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>concentration</b> of the substance (PEC) and the highest concentration of the substance that does not have a harmful effect in the environment (PNEC). Environmental hazard expresses the inherent environmentally damaging characteristics of the substance in terms of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The toxicity tests used are acute toxicity of fish, acute toxicity of Daphnia sp. and growth inhibition test of algae. Most medications on the Swedish market are now classified. This gives the health care possibilities to make better choices when prescribing medicines.|$|E

However, the detection of engineered nanoparticles in environmental matrices is challenging because of the low <b>predicted</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> which may be in the ng/L range. In this study nanosized Ag, CeO 2 and TiO 2 have been measured in multiple surface water samples collected along the rivers Meuse and IJssel in the Netherlands using single-particle ICP-MS as measurement technique. Validation of the analytical method showed its capability to quantitatively determine nanoparticles at low concentrations.

The results of the study confirm the presence of nano-sized Ag and CeO 2 particles and micro-sized TiO 2 particles in these surface waters. n-Ag was present in all samples in concentrations ranging from 0. 3 to 2. 5 ng/L with an average concentration of 0. 8 ng/L and an average particle size of 15 nm. n-CeO 2 was found in all samples with concentrations ranging from 0. 4 to 5. 2 ng/L with an average concentration of 2. 7 ng/L and an average particle size of 19 nm.

30|$|Homo-aggregation of NP (Fig.  2 c) is {{positively}} correlated with their concentration in the media. Since <b>predicted</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> are rather low (in the pg/L to the low µg/L range for surface waters [16]), homo-aggregation is less likely due to the low probability for collisions. Nonetheless, this factor is relevant—but largely ignored—for laboratory-based ecotoxicological investigations that often use high NP <b>concentrations</b> compared to <b>predicted</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> [76]. Under field conditions, the ionic strength of the surrounding medium seems more relevant as aggregation rates increase with ionic strength [e.g. 93, 94]. The aggregation dynamics are in most cases characterized by classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory [95, 96]. Furthermore, multivalent cations are more efficient than monovalent cations [97], whereas the efficiency within both groups of cations depends on their respective identity as judged by critical coagulation concentrations (CCCs): the aggregation of citrate-coated Ag NP was, for instance, more efficient for Ca 2 + than Mg 2 + [76], which {{may be explained by}} the higher ability of Ca 2 + to form citrate complexes [98]. At the same time, the impact of cations and anions can be concentration dependent. Whereas high concentrations of Cl− ions enhance the aggregation of Ag NP due to the bridging by AgCl [99], low concentrations may stabilize NP via the formation of negatively charged surface precipitates [76]. Similarly, soils and soil extracts modulate NP aggregation [100].|$|R

40|$|The EC {{has issued}} {{directives}} (1981, 1992) requesting for registration of {{veterinary medicinal product}} information to enable {{an assessment of the}} product's safety for the environment. As a whole, the risk assessment is structured around the hazard quotient approach used in USES (1994). <b>Predicted</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> are compared with effect values established in toxicity studies. In the a risk assessment methodology presented in directive 81 / 852 /EEC the assessment process is described in two phases. The first phase (I) shall assess the potential of exposure of the environment to the product, its ingredients, or relevant metabolites. The first phase is thus limited to product identification and exposure assessment. Several exemptions for further testing are given, such as trigger values for <b>predicted</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> (PECs). When these exemptions fail to apply and trigger values are exceeded, Phase II is entered. Phase II is also divided in two parts, Tier A and Tier B. Tier A begins with an elaborate evaluation of the possible fate and effects. If the applicant is unable to demonstrate that exposure is minimised to a level of no concern to the environment, then the effects in the relevant compartments must be adequately investigated in Tier B.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{nanoparticles}} {{have been used}} more frequently in industrial applications and in consumer and medical products, and these applications of nanoparticles will likely continue to increase. Concerns about the environmental fate and effects of these materials have stimulated studies to <b>predict</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> in air, water, and soils and to determine threshold concentrations for their ecotoxicological effects on aquatic or terrestrial biota. Nanoparticles {{can be added to}} soils directly in fertilizers orplant protection products or indirectly through application to land or wastewater treatment products such as sludges or biosolids. Nanoparticles may enter aquatic systems directly through industrial discharges or from disposal of wastewater treatment effluents or indirectly through surface runoff from soils. Researchers have used laboratory experiments to begin to understand the effects of nanoparticles on waters and soils, and this Account reviews that research and the translation of those results to natural conditions. In the environment, nanoparticles can undergo a number of potential transformations that depend on the properties both of the nanoparticle and of the receiving medium. These transformations largely involve chemical and physical processes, but they can involve biodegradation of surface coatings used to stabilize many nanomaterial formulations. The toxicity of nanomaterials to algae involves adsorption to cell surfaces and disruption to membrane transport. Higher organisms can directly ingest nanoparticles, and within the food web, both aquatic and terrestrial organisms can accumulate nanoparticles. The dissolution of nanoparticles may release potentially toxic components into the environment. Aggregation with other nanoparticles (homoaggregation) or with natural mineral and organic colloids (heteroaggregation) will dramatically change their fate and potential toxicity in the environment. Soluble natural organic matter may interact with nanoparticles to change surface charge and mobility and affect the interactions of those nanoparticles with biota. Ultimately, aquatic nanomaterials accumulate in bottom sediments, facilitated in natural systems by heteroaggregation. Homoaggregates of nanoparticles sediment more slowly. Nanomaterials from urban, medical, and industrial sources may undergo significant transformations during wastewater treatment processes. For example, sulfidation of silver nanoparticles in wastewater treatment systems converts most of the nanoparticles to silver sulfides (Ag₂S). Aggregation of the nanomaterials with other mineral and organic components of the wastewater often results in most of the nanomaterial being associated with other solids rather than remaining as dispersed nanosized suspensions. Risk assessments for nanomaterial releases to the environment are still in their infancy, and reliable measurements of nanomaterials at <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> remain challenging. <b>Predicted</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> based on current usage are low but are expected to increase as use increases. At this early stage, comparisons of estimated exposure data with known toxicity data indicate that the <b>predicted</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> are orders of magnitude below those known to have environmental effects on biota. As more toxicity data are generated under environmentally-relevant conditions, risk assessments for nanomaterials will improve to produce accurate assessments that assure environmental safety.
