40|$|Agriculture {{has done}} more damage to nature than any other human activity, and yet food {{production}} could need to be doubled {{by the middle of}} this century. As agricultural land is expanded and intensified, critical thresholds in the loss of natural habitats are crossed. This loss of non-crop habitats can have negative feedback on crop production, because it can cause a loss of “ecosystem services” that support and regulate crop production, such as the pollination of crops by bees and the biological control of crop pests by their natural enemies. Because of this connection between non-crop habitats and crop yields, there could be potential for habitat conservation to benefit both agriculture and nature. The research in this thesis focuses on pollinators and natural enemies, because these species constitute a vital connection between food production and biodiversity conservation. Could habitat management be used to conserve both pollinators and natural enemies in agricultural landscapes? Will the relationships between pollinators, natural enemies, and natural habitats change with climate change? Where should we <b>prioritize</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> of conflict between agriculture and nature, and how? This thesis addresses these questions through literature review and meta-analysis, geographic information systems (GIS) and hotspot analysis, field research on the distributions of trap-nesting bees and wasps on environmental gradients, and laboratory research on the development of bees and wasps at high temperatures. This thesis suggests that {{it might be possible to}} conserve communities of both pollinators and natural enemies, in general, by means of habitat management, but it might not be possible to conserve specific combinations of pollinators and natural enemies, which might have opposite responses to some forms of environmental change, such as global warming. This thesis also suggests that the resolution of conflict between agriculture and nature should be prioritized in sub-Saharan Africa, and it outlines a conceptual framework for systematic conservation planning in agricultural landscapes...|$|E
40|$|The author {{introduces}} the special section on mindfulness: four articles that between them explore the correlates of mindfulness in both cross-sectional and treatment studies. Results from these studies, taken together, suggest a {{close association between}} higher levels of mindfulness, either as a trait or as cultivated during treatment, {{and lower levels of}} rumination, avoidance, perfectionism and maladaptive self-guides. These four characteristics can be seen as different aspects of the same 'mode of mind', which <b>prioritizes</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> of discrepancies between ideas of current and desired states using a test-operate-test-exit sequence. Mindfulness training allows people to recognize when this mode of mind is operating, to disengage from it if they choose, and to enter an alternative mode of mind characterized by prioritizing intentional and direct perception of moment-by-moment experience, in which thoughts are seen as mental events, and judgemental striving for goals is seen, accepted and 'let go'. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
30|$|Inspired by {{the work}} of Araújo Filho et al. (2010) and Couto et al. (2013), and trying to {{overcome}} the problem they faced of evaluating the direct correspondence between warnings and faults due to the small number of real faults, we revisited their work evaluating the correspondence between static warnings and mutations. We decided to use mutation testing due to the following reasons: 1) it is considered a good fault model for experimentation and has been successfully used for test set evaluations (Andrews et al. 2005); 2) mutants are generated by mutation operators which can be seen as fault categories so we can try to correlate warnings and specific types of faults; 3) it allows to increase fault concentration per Kilo Lines of Code (KLOC) by summing up the number of mutants derived from each source code line; and 4) it eases experimentation with a large number of software products. These reasons help overcoming limitations of previous works on these subjects. Moreover, from this study, we intend to define a strategy for static warnings prioritization based on their correspondence with mutations. The results can be used to evolve either static analyzers or mutation testing, or both. The former in the sense {{it will be possible to}} compare different static analyzers against the same fault model to decide which kind of mutations they are really adequate to detect. This information can be used to <b>prioritize</b> <b>the</b> warnings <b>resolution</b> starting from <b>the</b> ones more correlated with some mutation operator and also to guide the evolution of static analyzers by creating additional static verification rules to detect uncovered mutations. The later by avoiding the generation of mutants for that mutation operators which static analyzers are adequate to detect their faults statically.|$|R

40|$|Quantitative risk {{analysis}} provides practitioners {{a deeper understanding}} of the risks in their projects. However, the existing methods for impact assessment are inaccurate and the metrics for risk prioritization also can not properly <b>prioritize</b> <b>the</b> risks for certain cases. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring risk impact by using AHP. We also propose a new indicator, risk intensity (RI), to <b>prioritize</b> <b>the</b> risks of a project. Compared with the widely used metric Risk Exposure (RE), the contours of RI show a convex pattern whereas the contours of RE show a concave pattern. RI allows practitioners weight probability and risk impact differently and can better satisfy the needs of risk prioritization. Through a case study, we found that RI could better <b>prioritize</b> <b>the</b> risks than RE. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R
