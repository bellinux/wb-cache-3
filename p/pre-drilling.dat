40|$|The {{requirements}} of production engineering for a precision hole are {{to ensure the}} required quality as well as minimal production costs. The interactions between machine, tool and the <b>pre-drilled</b> hole result in uncertainties during the final reaming process. For this purpose the reaming process itself {{and the appearance of}} process faults were focused in a large number of publications. Due {{to the fact that the}} reaming process is an inherent part of a process chain and thus directly linked to a pre-machining process (drilling process), the influence of a <b>pre-drilled</b> hole is neglected till date. For that reason the present paper deals with the influence of a diagonal <b>pre-drilled</b> hole on the reaming process with multi blade tools. Pretests show that the radial deviation of the <b>pre-drilled</b> hole seems to be an important input parameter for the reaming process within the process chain. Based on this new input parameter the question whether the reaming tool follows the path of the <b>pre-drilled</b> hole or not has arisen. To achieve a better understanding of this issue, cutting tests were accomplished to investigate this influence. For this purpose, holes with different radial deviations were manufactured on a five axis machining center and reamed in a second step.

30|$|According {{to several}} studies, welding {{properties}} could be significantly improved using smaller <b>pre-drilled</b> holes, dry wood dowels {{and increasing the}} contact area with non-vertical insertion methods.

It was found that native extractives of some special wood species could improve the water resistance [18 – 20]. Placencia and Pizzi compared welded joints with and without additives and found that welded joints with natural additives (rosin and lignin) showed improved water resistance [21, 22].

50|$|A 2012 study out of Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine by Robert Oswald, a {{professor}} of molecular medicine at Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine, and veterinarian Michelle Bamberger, DVM, soon {{to be published in}} 'New Solutions: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy,' suggests that hydraulic fracturing is sickening and killing cows, horses, goats, llamas, chickens, dogs, cats, fish and other wildlife, as well as humans. The study covered cases in Colorado, Louisiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. The case studies include reports of sick animals, stunted growth, and dead animals after exposure to hydraulic fracturing spills from dumping of the fluid into streams and from workers slitting the lining of a wastewater impoundment (evaporation ponds) so that it would drain and be able to accept more waste. The researchers stated that it was difficult to assess health impact because of the industry's strategic lobbying efforts that resulted in legislation allowing them to keep the proprietary chemicals in the fluid secret, protecting them from being held legally responsible for contamination. Bamberger stated that if you don't know what chemicals are, you can't conduct <b>pre-drilling</b> tests and establish a baseline to prove that chemicals found postdrilling are from hydraulic fracturing. The researchers recommended requiring disclosure of all hydraulic fracturing fluids, that nondisclosure agreements not be allowed when public health is at risk, testing animals raised near hydraulic fracturing sites and animal products (milk, cheese, etc.) from animal raised near hydraulic fracturing sites prior to selling them to market, monitoring of water, soil and air more closely, and testing the air, water, soil and animals prior to drilling and at regular intervals thereafter.|$|E

50|$|As {{one of the}} long-time {{researchers}} on Jurassic coal measure-derived hydrocarbon reservoirs in NW China, Zhao took Turpan-Hami basin as {{the breakthrough}} point to summarize the basic petroleum geological conditions and distributional regularity of oil/gas accumulations. After doing a comprehensive research and assessment on the favorable plays and drilling targets in 1987, he took the responsibility to write the <b>pre-drilling</b> research report to proof the location of drilling the first scientific exploration well (SEW) in onshore China, and he suggested the Shanshan local structural high {{is the best place}} to drill a wildcat in Turpan-Hami basin. In 1989, the well Taican-1 got the commercial oil flow of 25.9 cubic meters per day in the Jurassic interval, which was the first breakthrough, since the exploration activity had long been stopped in 1950s-1960s. Up to date, Turpan-Hami basin has established a medium oil/gas production unit under PetroChina management with the annual production reaching 3 million tons of oil equivalents. Since the discovery of Shanshan oil field, Zhao had been keeping research on the whole Jurassic strata in NW China in particular, and summarized the favorable conditions for coal measure-derived oil/gas accumulations as the followings: ①the Jurassic prototype basin must exist to accumulate abundant and good-quality source kitchen with coal beds and coaly seams dominantly developed where both the oil-prone and gas-prone maceral materials are rich accumulated; ②the successive basin are moderately developed sitting on the Jurassic prototype basin, which is necessary not only to keep the source rock in an appropriate maturation, but also to maintain the reservoir having certain amount of porosity; ③the good association of source rock-reservoir-cap rock are well reserved for late occurrence of oil/gas migration and accumulation and ④certain degree of tectonic compression is needed to push the oil expulsing in quantity from the coal measure source rocks which have strong absorption on the oil and gas. Based on his research, Zhao proposed six favorable regions for doing further exploration in 1995 in NW China, which have been proved by a number of exploration wells and discoveries to be the best regions where traps the major oil/gas accumulations of Jurassic and Jurassic source rock-related in NW China.According to statistics, so far the proved oil and gas reserves discovered in Zhao’s predicted six zones have exceeded 1.5 billion tons of oil equivalents, which has yearly provided more than 15 million tons of oil equivalents. It is also confirmed that there is no oil and gas reserve output outside these 6 zones. Due to his contribution in pushing exploration of Jurassic coal measure-derived oil/gas reservoirs, he won the First Prize of provincial-level Award (CNPC) in 1995, and an award for significant discoveries of Oil & Gas Fields from CNPC in 1997.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Self-drilling mini-implants are {{commonly}} used in orthodontics, {{but there is little}} information regarding their fracture resistance in areas of high density bone without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Purpose: To determine the peak fracture torques of six commonly used self-drilling mini-implants, and to examine how each performs in extreme conditions without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Materials and Methods: Fifteen mini-implants from six different manufacturers were drilled into acrylic blocks using a custom-made insertion device incorporating a 6 -DOF load cell for torque measurements. Peak fracture torques were recorded and compared for each of the six manufacturers. Additionally, ten mini-implants from each manufacturer were inserted into high density mandibular bone substitutes (Sawbones®) without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Measures of peak insertion torque for each manufacturer were recorded. Groups that experienced fracture upon insertion into the bone substitutes underwent further testing specifically following their manufacturer <b>pre-drilling</b> recommendations. Results: Resistance to fracture varied significantly among implants from different manufacturers. Tomas-pin and Aarhus experienced fractures during insertion into the non-pre-drilled bone substitutes. When manufacturer’s <b>pre-drilling</b> recommendations were followed, Aarhus continued to experience fractures during insertion. Conclusions: Unitek, Vector TAS, Dual Top, and Ortho Easy can be inserted into areas of thick and dense cortical bone without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Tomas-Pin can be inserted provided manufacturer <b>pre-drilling</b> recommendations are followed.
