40|$|This review {{examines}} {{the role of}} long- and short-term repetition <b>priming</b> research in the theoretical debate between episodic and abstractionist accounts of implicit memory. The empirical research and theoretical accounts of <b>priming</b> reviewed indicate that neither episodic or abstractionist theories alone can successfully account for the processes of long- and short-term repetition <b>priming.</b> The major variations between studies in experimental methods used to measure repetition <b>priming</b> are also examined, providing a possible explanation for contrasting results obtained within repetition <b>priming</b> research and a reason for why the episodic versus abstractionist debate persists. Finally, research examining the underlying mechanisms responsible for <b>priming</b> is also discussed, indicating that it still has not been determined whether or not long- and short-term <b>priming</b> rely upon the same underlying mechanism. One method proposed for providing further clarification to this issue is to examine whether fluctuations in long-term <b>priming</b> levels result in changes in the magnitude of short-term <b>priming.</b> Previous models of word recognition assume the presence of only a single underlying mechanism in repetition <b>priming.</b> Recent research has, however, suggested that <b>priming</b> may be generated by two distinct processes; namely a long-term <b>priming</b> component and a short-term <b>priming</b> component. An experiment was conducted {{in order to examine}} the relationship between long- and short-term <b>priming</b> in order to determine whether or not these two processes can be attributed to a single underlying process. A total of 60 people (45 females, 15 males) participated in a computer-based lexical decision task designed to measure levels of short-term <b>priming</b> at varying levels of long-term <b>priming.</b> It was anticipated that if the <b>priming</b> components represented two distinctly different processes, a change in the level of long-term <b>priming</b> should not influence the obtainable level of short-term <b>priming</b> when other factors are held constant. The results demonstrated that changes in long-term <b>priming</b> were typically accompanied by changes in short-term <b>priming</b> (p 3 ̆c. 05).

40|$|Structural <b>priming,</b> i. e., the {{tendency}} to repeat linguistic material, {{can be explained by}} two alternative representational assumptions: either as the repetition of hierarchical representations generated by syntactic rules, or as the repetition of lexical sequences.
