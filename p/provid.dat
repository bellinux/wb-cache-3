500|$|MacDonald characterises McCartney's [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] as a song [...] "aimed chiefly at parents", {{borrowing}} {{heavily from}} the English music hall style of George Formby, while invoking {{images of the}} illustrator Donald McGill's [...] "seaside postcards". Its sparse arrangement includes chimes, clarinet and piano. Everett singles it out as a case of McCartney's [...] "penchant for the audience-charming vaudeville... that Lennon detested". Moore characterises the song as a synthesis of ragtime and pop, noting that its position following [...] "Within You Without You" [...] – a blend of Indian classical music and pop – demonstrates {{the diversity of the}} album's material. McCartney asked that the clarinets be arranged [...] "in a classical way", which according to Martin [...] "got... round the lurking schmaltz factor... gave added bite to the song, a formality that pushed it firmly towards satire". MacDonald notes that the song's inclusion amidst Sgt. Pepper [...] "multi-layered psychedelic textures... <b>provid</b> a down-to-earth interlude". Moore credits Martin's clarinet arrangement and Starr's use of brushes with establishing the music hall atmosphere, which is reinforced by McCartney's vocal delivery and the recording's use of chromaticism, a harmonic pattern that can be traced to Scott Joplin's [...] "The Ragtime Dance" [...] and The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss. Varispeeding was used on the track, raising the music's pitch by a semitone in an attempt to make McCartney sound younger. Everett notes that the lyric's protagonist is sometimes associated with the Lonely Hearts Club Band, but in his opinion the song is thematically unconnected to the others on the album.|$|E

The older generation {{had the experience of}} growing up in a stable society and of having fought for Ukraine in regular armies; the younger generation perceived Polish repression and an underground struggle. The leadership abroad, or <b>Provid,</b> thought of itself as an unapproachable elite. Most of the <b>Provid,</b> such as general Mykola Kapustiansky, referred to themselves using their military titles acquired during the war, which the youthful members could never attain. The older faction was also more politically moderate, and adhered to an officer's code of honor and standards of military discipline that prevented them from fully following the belief that any means could be used to achieve the goal. In contrast, the younger faction was more impulsive, violent, and ruthless. The older leaders living in exile admired aspects of Benito Mussolini's fascism but condemned Nazism while the younger more radical members based within Ukraine admired fascist ideas and methods as practiced by the Nazis.|$|E
