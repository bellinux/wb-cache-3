40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{studies the}} use of model {{predictive}} control (MPC) to handle <b>power</b> <b>converters.</b> The focus is on technical and theoretical issues regarding {{the use of}} a particular class of predictive strategy called Finite Control Set MPC (FCS-MPC). The main advantage of this predictive strategy {{comes from the fact that}} switching actions are explicitly taken into account as constraints on the control input of the system in the problem formulation. Consequently, modulation stages (to handle the converter switches) are not required. Throughout this thesis, we illustrate how to implement this predictive technique to improve the performance, in terms of power quality and dynamic response, in some classes of <b>power</b> <b>converters.</b> We show that FCS-MPC allows <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> to operate near to their limits of achievable performance when. In this thesis we also show that the benefits of using FCS-MPC can be obtained not only to handle <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> under normal operating conditions but also to achieve fault tolerance of these devices. Additionally, in this thesis we present a presented a stability analysis of MPC for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with discrete input alphabets.
