50|$|Many {{companies}} advertise {{food and}} {{have a tendency to}} include fantasies when targeted towards children. This is one of the persuasive ways which companies can use to advertise to children, along with promotional characters and <b>premium</b> <b>offers.</b> A study from Australia found that the rate of promotional characters in advertisements is twice as high during popular children’s programs compared to popular adult programs. Examples of promotional characters include celebrities, cartoon characters and sports stars, this is as these characters increase the persuasiveness of the advertisements on both children and adults. <b>Premium</b> <b>offers</b> is another persuasive marketing which includes competitions, giveaways and vouchers, the same study found that unhealthy food advertisements contain 18 times as many <b>premium</b> <b>offers</b> during children’s program in comparison to adult programs.|$|E

40|$|What {{is already}} {{known about this}} subject Food {{marketing}} has come under scrutiny for its likely contribution to promoting unhealthy eating and obesity in children. There is limited published evidence regarding the effects of food packaging promotions on children. Nutrient content claims and sports celebrity endorsements on food packs influence adults to prefer energy-dense and nutrient-poor (EDNP) products bearing such promotions, especially among the majority who do not read the nutrition information panel. What this study adds This study experimentally tested pre-adolescent children 2 ̆ 7 s responses to three common food marketing techniques: nutrient content claims, sports celebrity endorsements and <b>premium</b> <b>offers.</b> On-pack nutrient content claims made pre-adolescents more likely to choose EDNP products and increased perceptions of their nutrient content. Sports celebrity endorsements made pre-adolescent boys more likely to choose EDNP products. Objectives To assess pre-adolescent children 2 ̆ 7 s responses to common child-oriented front-of-pack food promotions. Methods Between-subjects, web-based experiment with four front-of-pack promotion conditions on energy-dense and nutrient-poor (EDNP) foods: no promotion [control]; nutrient content claims; sports celebrity endorsements (male athletes) and <b>premium</b> <b>offers.</b> Participants were 1302 grade 5 and 6 children (mean age 11 years) from Melbourne, Australia. Participants chose their preferred product from a randomly assigned EDNP food pack and comparable healthier food pack then completed detailed product ratings. Child-oriented pack designs with colourful, cartooned graphics, fonts and promotions were used. Results Compared to the control condition, children {{were more likely to}} choose EDNP products featuring nutrient content claims (both genders) and sports celebrity endorsements (boys only). Perceptions of nutritional content were enhanced by nutrient content claims. Effects of promotions on some product ratings (but not choice) were negated when children referred to the nutrition information panel. <b>Premium</b> <b>offers</b> did not enhance children 2 ̆ 7 s product ratings or choice. Conclusions Nutrient content claims and sports celebrity endorsements influence pre-adolescent children 2 ̆ 7 s preferences towards EDNP food products displaying them. Policy interventions to reduce the impact of unhealthy food marketing to children should limit the use of these promotions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{explore the}} extent and nature of {{television}} food advertising especially unhealthy food advertising to primary school children in Xi’an, China. Methods Television data were recorded for 2 weekdays and 2 weekend days between 6 : 00 and 22 : 00 during May and June in 2012 from {{a total of five}} television channels most popular with children in Xi’an. Pearson χ 2 tests and logistic regression were applied to determine differences in the proportion of healthy food, unhealthy food and miscellaneous food advertisements for different channels, programs, dates, viewing periods and the use of persuasive marketing tactics. Results Of the 5527 advertisements transcribed, 25. 5  % were for food, among which 48. 1  % were considered to be unhealthy. The frequency of food advertisements was 6 per hour per channel, including 3 unhealthy food advertisements. Compared with healthy and miscellaneous food advertisements, more unhealthy food advertisements were shown during afternoon, weekends and children’s non-peak viewing times as well as on children’s television channels, central television channels and non-children’s programmes. Unhealthy foods contributed the highest proportion of all food advertisements containing promotional characters (51. 7  %) and <b>premium</b> <b>offers</b> (59. 1  %). Both promotional characters and <b>premium</b> <b>offers</b> appeared more on non-children’s television channels. Conclusions The majority of food advertisements were for unhealthy food. More unhealthy food ads were shown in children’s non-peak time and afternoon as well as non-children’s channels. More children-oriented persuasive marketing tactics were used in unhealthy food ads especially in non-children’s channels. Therefore, intervening in the entrance of unhealthy foods into the market and establishing regulations related to food advertising especially unhealthy food advertisements are important strategies to prevent children’s exposure to unhealthy food and childhood obesity...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{a sample}} of food advertisements shown during 63 hours of children's programming to investigate compliance and non-compliance {{with one of the}} Australian Children's Television Standards (CTS) : CTS 20. 2 a. This standard regulates the way <b>premium</b> <b>offers</b> may, and may not, be used to sell products to children. Of the 1721 advertisements contained in the sample, 544 (32 %) were for food. A significantly higher number of food advertisements (41 %) were shown during ‘C’ programs (which are specifically regulated and produced for children six to 13 years of age and suitable for viewing without adult supervision), compared with 30 % during the less regulated ‘G’ programs (P= < 0. 001) (suitable for children to view without adult supervision but not produced specifically for a child audience). Over one-third of food advertisements (36 %) in ‘C’ time contained a premium offer compared with 17 % in ‘G’ time (P= < 0. 0001). Using a precisely defined interpretation of CTS 20. 2 a, this study found 30 (31 %) of food advertisements breached the standard during ‘C’ programs. This was a significantly higher proportion than the 54 (12 %) of breaches in ‘G’ time (P= < 0. 0001). From this study, the current regulatory system has not resulted in more responsible food advertising during ‘C’ programs, and the widespread breaches of CTS 20. 2 a indicate this standard is ineffective as a means of regulating food advertising. The Australian Broadcasting Authority has recognised that children need protection from unfair marketing practices and the improper use of <b>premium</b> <b>offers</b> to promote a food product, therefore CTS 20. 2 a needs urgent review to make it more effective.

40|$|Background: Despite {{recent and}} {{heightened}} {{concern about the}} marketing of food to children as a health issue, there is little previous research describing the product packaging characteristics of specific products intensely marketed to children. Purpose: In order to better understand food marketing tactics targeting children, {{the purpose of this}} study was to examine the promotional techniques and content features of ready-to-eat (RTE) cereal packages. Methods: A content analysis of 122 cereal product packages assessed front panel characteristics, <b>premium</b> <b>offers,</b> cross-promotions, activity features, characters and celebrities, web sites, and other content features. Results: It was observed that cereal packaging contains a wide variety of features likely to enhance the impulsivity of children to choose a particular prod-uct at the point-of-sale (e. g., children’s characters, appears ready-to-eat, games and other fun activities). Discussion: The product packaging practices of food companies selling high sugar products, including presweetened cereals, is one area that needs serious examination in setting forth public policy measures surrounding the issue of food marketing to children. Translation to Health Education Practice: These findings are useful in the context of the planning of health education and public policy interventions which aim to reduce children’s (and their parents’) susceptibility to aggressive food marketing tactics...|$|E

An audit was conducted on food and beverage television advertisements broadcast in five major Australian cities during children’s programming time from 1 st September 2010 to 31 st October 2010. The data were assessed against mandatory and voluntary advertising regulations, the information contained in an industry report of breaches, and the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. Results During the two months of data collection there were a total of 951 breaches of the combined regulations. This included 619 breaches of the mandatory regulations (CTS) and 332 breaches of the voluntary regulations (RCMI and QSRI). Almost 83 % of all food and beverages advertised during children’s programming times were for foods classified as ‘Extras’ in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.
