40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: The {{goal of this}} {{observational}} {{study was to determine}} factors predictive of the type of powered mobility pre-scribed to veterans with disability. Material/Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all veterans (n= 170) who received powered mobility from a designated power mobility clinic. Logistic regression analysis was used to determined factors predictive of the type of powered mobility provided. Results: Sixty-four (38 %) veterans were provided powered wheelchairs and 106 (62 %) were provided <b>powered</b> <b>scooters.</b> Of the variables examined, only primary medical conditions for referral and disability severity (as measured by the 2 -minute timed walk test; 2 -MWT) were predictive of the types of powered mobility prescribed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} powered wheelchair (PW) and <b>powered</b> <b>scooter</b> (PS) users' {{experiences of}} accessibility and housing adaptions in their homes. METHOD: A qualitative research approach with focus group methodology was used. Four focus groups were created, {{with men and}} {{women as well as}} PW and PS users in different groups. Applying a descriptive approach, data were analysed according to the principles described by Krueger and Casey. FINDINGS: With a specific focus on how PW and PS and housing adaptations operate together, the findings of this paper formed two categories: "Possibility of receiving housing adaptations according to individual needs" and "Importance of receiving the correct type of PW and PS in relation to individual needs". CONCLUSION: It is vital to acknowledge the characteristics and requirements of PW and PS as well as housing adaptations in order to optimize the use of such devices in the home, as a prerequisite for independence, activity and participation. The provision of PW and PS and housing adaptations should be considered and planned simultaneously, applying an explicitly user-centred perspective.

40|$|Internoise 2014, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIE, 16 -/ 11 / 2014 - 19 / 11 / 2014 Transportation {{in urban}} areas is often synonymous of traffic congestion. In the last decade, this {{situation}} led users to give up passenger cars and incited them to adopt powered two-wheelers (PTW), better adapted to the traffic hazards. However, {{the question of the}} noise emitted by PTW remains a concern for the population. In France, these vehicles are quoted in second position in the opinion surveys relative to the transportation noise. The main objective of the French research project Ascoot (Acoustique des scooters et des motocycles) is to propose solutions aiming to reduce the noise emitted by the most represented PTW in the current traffic. This paper summarizes the results obtained on the acoustical investigation of a panel of ten PTW (including an electric <b>powered</b> <b>scooter).</b> Global and third-octave noise analysis has been performed, relying on the classical Controlled Pass-by procedure, and on a determination of the directivity characteristics. Pass-bys at constant speed, with acceleration and deceleration have been considered, and the influence of mechanical parameters, as the engine capacity, is also analyzed. The noise emission of PTW has been finally compared with those of other means of transportation usually met in urban zones (light vehicles, medium heavy vehicles, buses, trams) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} a simulation study of the Taiwan Electrical Fuel Cell Power Scooter. This study applies a more detailed modeling which is complex as existing modeling methods, yet not more difficult to solve numerically. In most simulation studies, the influence of non-linearity (for example, saturation, losses, reluctance effects) of the power electronics and electrical machine are neglected. Therefore the simulation results are only valid in the ideal case. Especially the influence of losses, harmonics, saturation, reluctance and time delay in the control, can be a decisive factor in the design. Therefore in this simulation study, it is shown to include these details. The conduction and switching losses in the power electronics during the drive cycle are simulated. Also the temperature stress on the semiconductors will be calculated in order to give a prediction of the life time of the semiconductor modules. Influence of the saturation and reluctance in the electrical machine and the impact on the overall system performance as well as the influence in the field oriented control. Detailed modeling of the field oriented control is discussed. Finally the implementation of the digital control in hardware directly from the simulation control model will be explained.

5000|$|Gasoline <b>powered</b> <b>scooters</b> {{were once}} quite popular for college students, working age people {{of both sexes}} and seniors. Use {{declined}} dramatically from June 1, 2006 [...] when new road safety law put parking enforcement {{into the hands of}} private traffic wardens, with the intent of freeing up police to pursue violations greater than parking. Prior to introduction of the new law, automobile tires were chalked by police, who could issue a violation after the vehicle had been illegally parked for 15 minutes or greater. Female officers traveling in specially designed vehicles would rotate through congested areas, reaching out of their window with chalk on long sticks to mark tires. The logistics involved meant scooters were all but ignored and could park freely on sidewalks and roadways. However, under the new guidelines, tickets could be issued immediately by a new privatized patrol force. As a consequence of near zero enforcement prior to June 1, 2006, paid hourly parking for scooters was nearly non-existent.|$|R

40|$|Taiwan {{is a place}} marketed by {{intensive}} scooter use {{because of}} limited space and transportation habits. Because internal-combustion-engine scooters cause serious environmental pollution, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) executes policies—such as the strict exhaust standard, “Electric Motorcycle Development Action plan” [...] and provides a subsidy for purchasing electric scooters. The main objective of the EPA has been to {{encourage the use of}} electric scooters and gradually weed out the highly polluting engine scooters. However, the policies have not worked well because of the poor performance of lead-acid or nickel-hydrogen batteries as well as the lack of recharge stations. Therefore, consumers have not been willing to purchase electric scooters.

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{describe}} how {{men and women}} experience their use of powered wheelchairs (PW) and <b>powered</b> <b>scooters</b> (PS) in everyday occupations, {{in the home and}} in society at large. Methods: A qualitative research approach with focus-group methodology was used. Four focus groups were created, with men and women as well as PW and PS users in different groups. Applying a descriptive approach, data were analysed according to the principles described by Krueger. Findings: Three categories emerged and revealed that even though use of PW and PS increased independence and enabled everyday occupations, participants struggled to be independent powered mobility device (PMD) users. They experienced many accessibility problems in dwellings and in society, described similarly by users of PW and PS. Men and women experienced their use of (PMD) differently, especially in relation to the service delivery process. Conclusions: The study contributes with new knowledge on accessibility for PW and PS users and related service delivery processes, stating that gender differences regarding provision and training must be taken into account. Occupational therapists can contribute to an enhanced understanding of PMD users' challenges in person-environment-occupation transactions in the home and society, and thereby promote occupational justice for PMD users...|$|R

Method: The study was a prospective cohort study, using an instrument focusing on mobility-related participation outcomes of mobility device interventions (NOMO 1. 0), at baseline, after 4 -months and 1 -year use. Results: The {{results show that the}} outcomes in terms of participation frequency and easiness in mobility occur in a short time perspective, and that the effects remained stable at 1 -year follow-up. The frequency of going for a walk increased most prominently (26 %). Even though the majority of the participation aspects were not performed, more often they became easier to perform: 56 - 91 % found that shopping, walking and visiting family/friends were easier. Moreover, independence outdoors and indoors increased. Conclusions: This small study provides knowledge about the outcomes of <b>powered</b> wheelchairs and <b>scooters</b> in terms of mobility and mobility-related participation in real-life situations. The study supports results from former studies, but even so, larger studies are required in order to provide evidence for the effectiveness of <b>powered</b> wheelchairs and <b>scooters.</b> [Box: see text]...|$|R
