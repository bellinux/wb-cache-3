5|$|It {{has been}} {{associated}} with Bruton Abbey and the Berkley family who owned the estate after the dissolution. It is known that the conversion to house <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves</b> took place around 1780. It was acquired by the National Trust in 1915 and they have managed the site since then undertaking restoration work.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves</b> are {{distributed}} everywhere on Earth, {{except for the}} driest areas of the Sahara Desert, Antarctica and its surrounding islands, and the high Arctic. They have colonised most of the world's oceanic islands, reaching eastern Polynesia and the Chatham Islands in the Pacific, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Réunion in the Indian Ocean, and the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} imperial pigeon (Ducula badia), {{also known}} as the maroon-backed imperial pigeon or Hodgson's imperial pigeon, is a species of bird in the <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> family with a wide range in south-eastern Asia.|$|R
50|$|Nesoenas is a bird genus in the <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> family, Columbidae. It {{is often}} {{included}} with the typical turtle-doves in Streptopelia or the typical pigeons (Columba). By those who accepted it, it was usually treated as monotypic, containing only the pink pigeon (N. mayeri) of Mauritius.|$|R
50|$|The fruit doves, {{also known}} as fruit pigeons, are a genus (Ptilinopus) of birds in the <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> family (Columbidae). These colourful, frugivorous doves are found in forests and {{woodlands}} in Southeast Asia and Oceania. It is a large genus with about 50 species, some threatened or already extinct.|$|R
5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} (Pezophaps solitaria) is an extinct, flightless {{bird that}} was endemic {{to the island}} of Rodrigues, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Genetically within the family of <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves,</b> it was most {{closely related to the}} also extinct dodo of Mauritius, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae. The Nicobar pigeon is their closest living genetic relative.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is variable. Granivorous species tend to have dull plumage, with a few exceptions, whereas the frugivorous species have brightly {{coloured}} plumage. The Ptilinopus (fruit doves) {{are some of the}} brightest-coloured pigeons, with the three endemic species of Fiji and the Indian Ocean Alectroenas being the brightest. <b>Pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves</b> may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic. In addition to bright colours, pigeons may sport crests or other ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|While {{many species}} of <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves</b> have benefited from human {{activities}} and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) {{are two of the}} most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.|$|E
5000|$|Macropygia is a genus of {{bird in the}} <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> family Columbidae. The genus is one {{of three}} genera known as cuckoo-doves. They are long tailed, range between 27-45 cm in length and have brown plumage. The genus ranges from India and China through Indonesia and the Philippines to Vanuatu and Australia.|$|R
5|$|The Choiseul pigeon (Microgoura meeki) is an {{extinct species}} of {{bird in the}} <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> family, Columbidae. It was endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands, {{although}} there are unsubstantiated reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands. The last confirmed sighting was in 1904. Other common names were Solomons crested pigeon, Solomon Islands crowned-pigeon and Kuvojo.|$|R
50|$|Behind it, to the east, is the barn, {{built into}} the slope. It is two stories high, with a {{similarly}} steep slate gable roof topped with a cupola and randomly placed hipped dormers. Inside are horse stalls and a hayloft on the upper level and a calf barn on the lower. A one-story stucco-sided slate-covered gable-roofed <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> roost {{is attached to the}} southeast.|$|R
5|$|The {{conversion}} to be a dovecote took place around 1780. <b>Pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves</b> were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh, and dung. Although {{it is now}} a roofless ruin with some of the windows blocked up, it previously had a chimney and the fireplace can still be seen. The National Trust acquired the freehold from Sir Henry Hugh Arthur Hoare of the Hoare baronets, whose family seat was at Stourhead, in 1915. The tower was subsequently designated as a scheduled monument in 1953 and a listed building (Grade II*) in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless {{bird that}} was endemic {{to the island}} of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo's closest genetic {{relative}} was the also extinct Rodrigues solitaire, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae {{of the family of}} <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves.</b> The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of Réunion, but this is now thought to have been confusion based on the Réunion ibis and paintings of white dodos.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{written record}} of the dovecote was in 1393 although the exact date of construction is not known. It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875. The manor previously belonged to Montacute Priory, a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order, founded between 1078 and 1102 {{although it is not}} known if the construction of the dovecote was undertaken by the priory or the Lovel family who later held the manor. <b>Pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves</b> were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh (squab), and dung.|$|E
50|$|The Choiseul pigeon (Microgoura meeki) is an {{extinct species}} of {{bird in the}} <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> family, Columbidae. It was endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands, {{although}} there are unsubstantiated reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands.

5000|$|Zentrygon is a bird genus in the <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> family (Columbidae). Its {{members are}} called quail-doves and {{all live in}} the Neotropics. The species of this genus {{primarily}} range from southern Mexico throughout Central America. Quail-doves are ground-dwelling birds that live, nest, and feed in dense forests. They are remarkable for their purple to brown coloration with light-and-dark facial markings. It contains the following species: ...|$|R
5000|$|The tooth-billed pigeons are {{the only}} genus (Didunculus) of the {{subfamily}} Didunculinae, in the <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> family, (Columbidae). It has no close living relatives, {{but it has been}} shown to be genetically close to the dodo, and the genus name Didunculus means [...] "little dodo". The jaw and tongue structure, and the superficially parrotlike bill have suggested a relationship to the parrots, but these features have arisen from its specialised diet rather than any real relationship.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves</b> {{are used as}} food; however, all types are edible. The {{powerful}} breast muscles characteristic of the family make excellent meat. Domesticated or hunted pigeons {{have been used as}} the source of food since the times of the Ancient Middle East, Ancient Rome, and Medieval Europe. It is familiar meat within Jewish, Arab, Assamese and French cuisines. According to the Tanakh, doves are kosher, and they are the only birds that may be used for a korban. Other kosher birds may be eaten, but not brought as a korban. It is also known in Asian cuisines, such as Chinese and Indonesian.|$|E
5|$|Seeds {{and fruit}} form the major {{component}} of the diets of <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves.</b> In fact, the family {{can be divided into}} the seed-eating or granivorous species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or frugivorous species (the other four subfamilies). The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. There are morphological adaptations {{that can be used to}} distinguish between the two groups: granivores tend to have thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi whereas the frugivores tend to have thin walls. In addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.|$|E
5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves</b> are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most {{of these are}} tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E

50|$|The Adamawa {{turtle dove}} (Streptopelia hypopyrrha) is {{a species of}} bird in the <b>pigeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> family Columbidae. It {{is also known as}} the pink-bellied turtle dove. The species is closely related to and has been {{considered}} the same species as the dusky turtle dove. The species has a disjunct distribution, being native to Cameroon Nigeria and south-west Chad, and further west in Gambia, Senegal and Mali. It has also been reported defending a territory in Togo, suggesting a population may exist there too.|$|R
30|$|We retraced the {{evolution}} of pigeon representation in France through an extensive review of ancient texts related to pigeons in the following domains: religious, legal, economic, administrative, and literary, and in military reports, and treatises on zoology, agriculture, medicine, and cooking. We used texts available from the French numerical library Gallica from the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (2013), which provides access to over {{a million and a}} half documents, representative of the documents issued in France over the past centuries, that have been digitized by the Bibliothèque Nationale de France and other partner libraries. We searched for the French terms for <b>pigeon</b> (<b>pigeon)</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> (colombe) <b>and</b> reviewed more than 240 source texts, dating from the seventh century (except for the Old Testament, which dates from the eighth to the second century BCE) to the 1990 s. We narrowed the selection to 50 texts that reflected the variability of all the information and arguments. We selected these texts based on their pertinence to our subject, as a large part of the reviewed documents mentioned the words <b>pigeon</b> (<b>pigeon)</b> <b>and</b> <b>dove</b> (colombe) without providing any relevant information or providing repetitive material, such as the dove being a representation of the Holy Spirit.|$|R
25|$|Regurgitation {{has been}} {{mentioned}} above under abomasum and crop, referring to crop milk, a secretion from {{the lining of the}} crop of <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves</b> with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation.|$|E
25|$|The black {{sparrowhawk}} (Accipiter melanoleucus), sometimes {{known as}} the black goshawk or great sparrowhawk, is the largest African member of the genus Accipiter. It occurs mainly in forests and non-desert areas south of the Sahara, particularly where there are large trees suitable for nesting; favored habitat includes suburban and human-altered landscapes. It preys predominantly on birds of moderate size, such as <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves,</b> in suburban areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{south and}} westwards range {{expansion}} of black sparrowhawks in South Africa has {{led them to}} colonise the urban and suburban areas of Cape Town where they have thrived in the past 15 years, {{with none of the}} expected negative impacts on their health that might have been expected from the disturbances associated with a novel climate (from a subtropical, summer rainfall regimen to a Mediterranean, winter rainfall region), or other possible sources of stress in their newly urbanised environments. This is probably due to the abundance of prey, mainly various species of Columbidae (the wide variety of <b>pigeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>doves)</b> in these urban areas, and, therefore, their lack of nutritional stress.|$|E
50|$|It {{is legal}} for persons {{authorized}} by the landowner or tenant to carry out vermin control with an air rifle. The legal airgun quarry species include brown rats, magpies, carrion crows, rooks, jays, squirrels, woodpigeons, feral <b>pigeons,</b> <b>and</b> collared <b>doves.</b>|$|R
