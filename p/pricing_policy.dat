We first argue {{that some form of}} service-class sensitive pricing is required for any multiclass service discipline 4 to attain the desired level of performance.

Effective multiclass service disciplines allow networks to focus resources on performance sensitive applications, while effective <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> allow us to spread the benefits of multiple service classes around to all users, rather than just having these benefits remain exclusively with the users of applications that are performance sensitive. Furthermore, service disciplines and <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> combine to form the incentive system facing a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} {{effective}} strategies to affect people’s car use, but, {{due to a lack}} of public support, these policies are often not implemented. Therefore, we examined which factors influence the acceptability of these <b>pricing</b> <b>policies.</b> First, the acceptability of transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> was shown to be strongly related to the revenue allocation: acceptability increased when revenues were allocated to car users. Second, the acceptability was also shown to increase when people expected car-related problems, such as congestion, pollution and parking problems, to reduce. Reductions in car-related problems will benefit society as a whole, but also individual car users, for example when their travel times decrease or local air quality improves. The acceptability of transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> increased particularly when people actually experience that car-related problems were solved or decreased. Third, acceptability of transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> was shown to be strongly related to the extent to which people consider the costs and benefits of these policies to be fairly distributed. We found that transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> were particularly perceived to be fair and acceptable when the distribution of costs and benefits would benefit nature, the environment and future generations and when everybody would be equally affected. This study has important practical implications: the acceptability of transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> can be enhanced when it is clearly communicated that <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> will result in a reduction of car-related problems. In addition, the acceptability is also likely to increase when people experience the positive effects of policies, for example via trials. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{economic}} slowdown {{was triggered by}} weaker international commodities markets, coupled with the perverse effects of economic policies designed to fuel consumption. For instance, Petrobrás artificially depressed petrol prices to control inflation between 2011 and 2014, {{under the influence of}} the government, its major stockholder. This in turn depressed ethanol prices, making ethanol uneconomic to produce. The ethanol industry was forced to close plants and cut back on its investment in research. Petrobrás’ low <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> ended up eating into its own revenue, forcing it to cut back its own investment in oil and gas exploration.|$|E
25|$|Domestic water {{charges in}} Ireland were thus {{prohibited}} under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997, passed in May 1997 {{shortly before the}} June 1997 general elections in which Fine Gael lost to Fianna Fáil under Bertie Ahern. However, because of popular discontent, the new government chose not to pursue domestic water charges. Instead, it embarked on consultations {{which resulted in the}} 1998 Water Services <b>Pricing</b> <b>Policy.</b> This policy banned cross-subsidy of domestic services from non-domestic charges. For non-domestic users, the policy required the recovery of average operational and marginal capital costs of water services from these users. It also foresaw the metering of all non-domestic users by 2006. Domestic operational costs were to be paid for through a local government fund, and capital costs were to be financed through the capital programme of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.|$|E

25|$|Although the Constitution of 1848 {{gave the}} federal {{government}} powers in relation to railways, it initially decided to decentralise rail policy. The first Railway Act of 1852 gave responsibility for administering policy {{in relation to the}} construction and operation of railways to the cantons, including licensing of companies, coordination of lines, technical specifications and <b>pricing</b> <b>policy.</b> Railways were to be built by private limited-liability companies, with contributions to be provided by the municipalities and cantons that stood to benefit from projects. Despite the lack of overall planning and the rivalry among the companies, a rail network similar to that proposed by Stephenson and Swinburne soon formed in northern and western Switzerland, with the completion of a link from the French border in the far west near Geneva to the Austrian border in the far northeast at St. Margrethen on 10 December 1860.|$|E
25|$|To ensure {{every single}} {{operation}} showed a clear profit {{on a full}} costing basis, i.e. inclusive of all overhead costs, the company required each operation to be budgeted in detail before deciding whether to accept it. The managing director's authorisation was required to dispense with this rule in exceptional cases where the risk of accepting a contract that was only marginally profitable, i.e. excluding overheads, was outweighed by {{the risk of having}} an aircraft sit idly on the ground. An immediate financial analysis that compared actual costs and revenues with their budgets followed the completion of each flight, thereby instantly gauging that flight's profitability and validating the effectiveness of the firm's <b>pricing</b> <b>policy.</b> A policy of requiring aircraft commanders to pay for all operating expenses other than fuel in cash proved to be an effective method to exercise instant cost control over fees and charges incurred for products and services supplied by third parties, such as ground handling fees, technical support services and catering supplies.|$|E
25|$|Even more importantly, the Third Anglo-Dutch War {{temporarily}} interrupted VOC {{trade with}} Europe. This caused {{a spike in}} the price of pepper, which enticed the English East India Company (EIC) to enter this market aggressively in the years after 1672. Previously, one of the tenets of the VOC <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> was to slightly over-supply the pepper market, so as to depress prices below the level where interlopers were encouraged to enter the market (instead of striving for short-term profit maximisation). The wisdom of such a policy was illustrated when a fierce price war with the EIC ensued, as that company flooded the market with new supplies from India. In this struggle for market share, the VOC (which had much larger financial resources) could wait out the EIC. Indeed, by 1683, the latter came close to bankruptcy; its share price plummeted from 600 to 250; and its president Josiah Child was temporarily forced from office.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL) {{the only}} legally {{recognized}} party of Bangladesh founded on 7 June 1975 following the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh. Mujib's government soon began encountering increased dissatisfaction and unrest. His programs of nationalization and industrial socialism suffered {{from lack of}} trained personnel, inefficiency, rampant corruption, and poor leadership. Mujib focused almost entirely on national issues and thus neglected local issues and government. The party and central government exercised full control and democracy was weakened, with virtually no elections organized at the grass roots or local levels. Political opposition included communists as well as Islamic fundamentalists, who were angered by the declaration of a secular state. Mujib was criticized for nepotism in appointing family members to important positions. A famine in 1974 further intensified the food crisis, and devastated agriculture– the mainstay of the economy. Intense criticism of Mujib arose over the lack of political leadership, a flawed <b>pricing</b> <b>policy,</b> and rising inflation amidst heavy losses suffered by the nationalized industries. Mujib's ambitious social programs performed poorly, owing to scarcity of resources, funds, and personnel, and caused unrest amongst the masses.|$|E

40|$|Finding ways {{to improve}} the {{efficiency}} in water usage {{is one of the most}} important challenges in integrated water resources management. One of the most promising solutions is the use of scarcity-based <b>pricing</b> <b>policies.</b> This contribution presents a procedure to design efficient <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> based on the opportunity cost of water at the basin scale. Time series of the marginal value of water are obtained using a stochastic hydro-economic model. Those series are then post-processed to define step <b>pricing</b> <b>policies,</b> which depend on the state of the system at each time step. The case study of the Mijares River basin system (Spain) is used to illustrate the method. The results show that the application of scarcity-based <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> increases the economic efficiency of water use in the basin, allocating water to the highest-value uses and generating an incentive for water conservation during the scarcity periods. The resulting benefits are close to those obtained with the economically optimal decisions...|$|R
