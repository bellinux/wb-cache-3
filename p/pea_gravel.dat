40|$|Chemical {{mutagenesis}} with ethyl methanesulfonate {{followed by}} selective culturing {{was used to}} develop strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii that tolerated increased lactic acid concentrations while continuously producing the acid. In stirred-tank-batch fermentations, mutant DP 3 in 12 % glucose, 3 % yeast extract-mineral salt-oleic acid medium produced lactic acid {{more than four times}} faster than the wild type. Mutant DP 3 produced 117 g/l lactic acid compared with 67 g/l for the wild type. Mutant DP 3 exhibited faster specific growth rates, shorter lag phases, greater lactic acid fields, and better lactic acid tolerance than the wild type. Mutant DP 3 was stable for over 1. 5 years (stored freeze dried). Mutants with enhanced lactic acid-producing capacity were obtained each time the strain development procedure was employed;Combinations of lactobacilli and biofilm-forming bacteria were evaluated in continuous fermentations for lactic acid production using various supports. Twelve different bacteria, including species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Thermoactinomyces, and Thermomonospora, were tested for biofilm-forming capabilities. Solid supports that were evaluated in either batch or continuous fermentations were <b>pea</b> <b>gravels,</b> porcelain berl saddles, 3 M-macrolite ceramic spheres, and polypropylene (pp) mixed with 25 % various agricultural materials (e. g. corn starch, oat hulls) and extruded to form chips. The best biofilm formation was observed with Pseudomonas fragi, Streptomyces viridosporus T 7 A, and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris. Biofilm formation on the pp-composite chips was detected at harvest by chip clumping and gram-staining. Lactic acid bacteria used in the fermentations were Lactobacillus amylophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii mutant DP 3. S. viridosporus T 7 A and L. casei on pp-composite chips were the best combination of those tested. In 25 -ml continuous fermentations, biofilm reactors produced 10 to 14 g/l lactic acid at a flow rate of 0. 24 ml/min, whereas 4. 5 g/l of lactic acid was produced by the suspension culture. Furthermore, production rates that were two to five times faster than those of the suspension culture were observed for the pure- and mixed-culture bioreactors. Also, lactic acid concentrations and production rates were consistently higher in mixed-culture than in pure-culture fermentations on pp-composite chips...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns a}} study {{of the nature of the}} process of removal of suspended sediment by filtration of turbid water through 1 aged" <b>pea</b> size <b>gravel.</b> A hypothesis is formulated that the removal process occurs as the result of adsorption of the suspended sediment to the schmutzdecke coating the gravel rather than by the classic concept of straining, sedimentation and to a small degree, adsorption. The method of indicating the validity of this contention is to show the relationship between the electrokinetic potential of the suspended sediment and the efficiency with which this material is removed during filtration, and to determine if, during filtration, there is any fractionation as to particle size. Values of influent and effluent turbidity and specific surface area of suspended material, along with the electrophoretic mobility of the clay particles were determined during the process of filtration. An analysis of the data showed that there was an excellent correlation between an increase in removal efficiency and an increase in particle electroktnetic potential, and that there is essentially no fractionation as to particle size. The results were interpreted to mean that the removal process is, by nature, one of adsorption...|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, the {{geothermal}} system for the Center for Architecture was installed.

50|$|When the {{planning}} application for Phase 4 was submitted, {{it was expected}} that construction would commence in July or August 2007. Construction of Phase 3 commenced in July 2007. Bachy Soletanche Ltd, who received the £1.5 million contract, commenced work on the site by installing a deep contiguous piled wall around the site. The 220 m perimeter wall consists of 241 contiguous piles, which were chosen by project design consultant WSP. The piles are 750 mm in diameter. The piles will hold back the ground that consists of a few metres of fill, then a 3 m to 5 m thick sand layer which becomes weathered sandstone further down. Because the bedrock slopes from 2 m to 14 m down across the site, the piles must be up to 17.5 m deep. As excavation on the site commenced, the company installed 70 ground anchors to the wall. Each of the anchors are 15 m long and 178 mm diameter. These are for temporary support of the wall whilst the basement is being constructed. When construction is completed, they will remain. Some of the piles were drilled using a cased Large Diameter Auger (LDA) rotary bored piling method, while other parts of the wall were drilled using the Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) method. Alongside the contiguous piled wall, Bachy Soletanche Ltd also constructed ten 1200 mm diameter LDA plunge column piles and fourteen 750 mm diameter bearing piles.Ten plunge columns were installed on the site for the main access ramp. These consisted of large, steel H-section columns surrounded by <b>pea</b> <b>gravel</b> within their pile casings. Bachy Soletanche installed a basic bored pile with casing and then used its special plunge column rig to achieve the 5 mm accuracy needed for the positioning of the I section steel columns. A steel frame sitting on the casings, had three sets of hydraulic rams for precision adjustment of the central steel while it was fixed with around 5 m of concrete at the pile base. As site excavation progressed, these were slowly being exposed again. PC Harrington is doing the excavation and the concreting of the base whilst Altius will commence the main construction works. The crane base for TC1, the second tower crane, was delivered to the site on 30 January 2008. The crane was assembled on 16 February, however, not to the anticipated 82 m.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{within a}} {{tunneling}} project, {{a method for}} reinjecting discharged groundwater at tunnel level has been investigated. The method was performed by pressurizing a long section of the lining With ungrouted <b>pea</b> <b>gravel</b> as backfill, in a rock mass with low hydraulic conductivity. Water was reinjected through watertight lining into a section where un-grouted <b>pea</b> <b>gravel</b> was used as backfill. The pressure response was measured both behind the lining and in the rock mass, the latter by means of several observation wells drilled from ground level. Reinjecting water into a rock mass by pressurizing a lining with a permeable backfill (Such as un-grouted <b>pea</b> <b>gravel)</b> {{was found to be}} possible and feasible. Well testing methods developed for vertically drilled wells, such as a step injection test and constant head/pressure tests, Were used and found to be applicable, even for testing at tunnel level. It was also found that well known analytical Solutions, developed for vertically drilled wells, can be used for interpretation, e. g. transmissivity from tests performed at tunnel level and from the pressure response in two of the observation wells.

40|$|Solid waste {{landfills}} {{have become}} rather commonplace in urbanized and industrialized {{regions of the}} world. If designed, managed, and restored properly, they {{can be converted to}} useful land uses. However, restoration of woody vegetation can be difficult when animal damage occurs. Numerous species of voles occur throughout the northern hemisphere and several may become serious pests of restoration plantings at high population density, increasing the expense and difficulty of establishing targeted plant communities. We anticipated that meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) were responsible for causing the majority of damage to seedlings planted on restored landfill sites in Brooklyn, New York. We evaluated the ability of two habitat manipulations (e. g. mowing, <b>pea</b> <b>gravel</b> barrier) and rodenticides to protect seedlings. We documented substantial damage and deaths of seedlings caused by rodents in the study plots with losses (damaged or dead seedlings combined) ranging from 40 to 73 %. These losses occurred regardless of seedling species. Because of the preponderance of voles (71 % of all first-time captures), we suspect that voles are the main species causing seedling damage. Substantial losses of seedlings occurred across treatments, although there were fewest losses with a <b>pea</b> <b>gravel</b> barrier treatment. While the <b>pea</b> <b>gravel</b> treatment reduced seedling losses about 55 % compared to control plots, it is clear that additional research is needed to identify more efficient ways to reduce seedling losses to rodents in restoration plantings...|$|E

40|$|The sound {{propagation}} properties of two air-filled granular materials: large sifted <b>pea</b> <b>gravel</b> and 10 mm diameter glass spheres have been measured in an impedance tube. The experimental method was {{essentially the same}} as reported earlier [Swenson et al., ???Low-frequency sound wave parameter measurement in gravels,??? Appl. Acoust. 71, 45 - 51 (2010) ] for two other kinds of gravel: crushed limestone and undifferentiated <b>pea</b> <b>gravel.</b> Additional sampling and processing steps were applied to the microphone signals such that instead of tones, band-limited random noise was used as the input signal, and spectral domain complex pressures are now offered as input to the estimation algorithm. The estimation process extracts the best-fit attenuation coefficient, phase velocity, and characteristic impedance for the material over the signal frequencies, all with better precision than we previously obtained. Quadratic approximations for the acoustical parameters are given over the frequency range 25 - 160 Hz. The media are both slightly attenuating and dispersive, having attenuation coefficients within (0. 13 - 0. 34 Np/m), phase velocities smaller than those in air (180 - 240 m/s), and characteristic impedance approximately 3 - 5 times that for air. <b>Pea</b> <b>gravel</b> was more attenuating, and had slightly higher characteristic impedance, but lower phase velocities than the glass spheres.
