[...] After her commissioning, Yorck served with the fleet in the cruiser squadron. In 19081909, Erich Raeder served aboard the ship as Yorcks navigation officer. From 1 October 1911 to 26 January 1912, Franz von Hipper, later commander-in-chief of the German navy, served as the ship's commanding officer.|$|E

The Board raised strong objections to the film's action scenes, fearing that they would influence young children to emulate the stunts.

The British Board of Film Classification rated the film 12A for [...] "moderate fantasy violence". In March 2012, a Mid-Day report alleged that Ra.One had received a favourable rating, pointing out that the producers had violated the rules by meeting the Board officials during the screening.|$|E

[...] Myrlie Evers-Williams, the wife of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers, said of the film, [...] "It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the movie could remember." [...] Benjamin Hooks, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), stated that the film, in its fictionalization of historical events, [...] "reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud" [...] and portrays African Americans as [...] "cowed, submissive and blank-faced".|$|E

500|$|Ritvo {{then moved}} Mucho Macho Man to Santa Anita Park {{almost two months}} before the Breeders' Cup races because she felt he [...] "thrived" [...] in California.

Dean Reeves said, [...] "Everybody has basically <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> and their family second to the benefit and {{the best we can do}} for Macho." [...] The horse's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. [...] Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. [...] In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed Seabiscuit's jockey George Woolf in the eponymous film, Ritvo later joked, [...] "I was in Hollywood. How could I not use a film star?" [...] In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn.

[...] One witness in Zamora said: [...] "Many priests acted very badly. The bishop of Zamora in 1936 was more or less an assassinI don't remember his name. He must be held responsible because prisoners appealed to him to save their lives. All he would reply was that the Reds had killed more people than the falangist were killing."

60|$|Three of his brave men, {{apparently}} Abishai, Benaiah, and Eleazar, {{heard the}} wish. Between their mountain fastness and the dearly loved spring lay {{the host of}} the Philistines; but their love for their leader feared no enemies. It was not only water that he longed for, but the water from the fountain which he had loved in his childhood. They descended from their chasm, broke through the midst of the enemy's army, and drew the water from the favorite spring, bearing it back, once again through the foe, to the tower upon the rock! Deeply moved was their chief at this act of self-devotion--so much moved that the water seemed to him to be too sacred to be put to his own use. 'May God forbid it me that I should do this thing. Shall I drink the blood of these men that have <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> in jeopardy, for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it?'

60|$|Then {{there is}} a whole field of {{proprietary}} sensations in relation to official duties and responsibility. Men who have done good work in any field are not to be lightly torn from it. A medical officer of health who has done well in his district, a teacher who has taught a generation of a town, a man who has made a public garden, have a moral lien upon their work for all their lives. They do not get it under our present conditions. I know that it will be quite easy to say all this is a question of administration and detail. It is. But it is, nevertheless, important to state it clearly here, to make it evident that the coming of Socialism involves no destruction of this sort of identification of a man with the thing he does; this identification that is so natural and desirable--that this living and legitimate sense of property will if anything be encouraged and its claims strengthened under Socialism. To-day that particularly living sort of property-sense is often altogether disregarded. Every day one hears of men who have worked up departments in businesses, men who have created values for employers, men who have <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> into an industrial machine, being flung aside because their usefulness is over, or out of personal pique, or to make way for favourites, for the employer's son or cousin or what not, without any sort of appeal or compensation.

6000|$|It was in vain {{that this}} unhappy {{creature}} endeavoured to avert their resentment by submitting {{to all the}} ill-usage they chose to put upon her; in vain that she underwent unresistingly the worst usage at the hand of Lady Cromwell, her landlady, who, abusing her with the worst epithets, tore her cap from her head, clipped out some of her hair, {{and gave it to}} Mrs. Throgmorton to burn it for a counter-charm. Nay, Mother Samuel's complaisance in the latter case only led to a new charge. It happened that the Lady Cromwell, on her return home, dreamed of her day's work, and especially of the old dame and her cat; and, as her ladyship died in a year and quarter from that very day, it was sagaciously concluded that she must have fallen a victim to the witcheries of the terrible Dame Samuel. Mr. Throgmorton also compelled the old woman and her daughter to use expressions which <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> in the power of these malignant children, who had carried on the farce so long that they could not well escape from their own web of deceit but by the death of these helpless creatures. For example, the prisoner, Dame Samuel, was induced to say to the supposed spirit, [...] "As I am a witch, and a causer of Lady Cromwell's death, I charge thee {{to come out of the}} maiden." [...] The girl lay still; and this was accounted a proof that the poor woman, who, only subdued and crushed by terror and tyranny, did as she was bidden, was a witch. One is ashamed of an English judge and jury when it must be repeated that the evidence of these enthusiastic and giddy-pated girls was deemed sufficient to the condemnation of three innocent persons. Goody Samuel, indeed, was at length worried into a confession of her guilt by the various vexations which were practised on her. But her husband and daughter continued to maintain their innocence. The last showed a high spirit and proud value for her character. She was advised by some, who pitied her youth, to gain at least a respite by pleading pregnancy; to which she answered disdainfully, [...] "No, I will not be both held witch and strumpet!" [...] The mother, to show her sanity of mind and the real value of her confession, caught at the advice recommended to her daughter. As her years put such a plea out of the question, there was a laugh among the unfeeling audience, in which the poor old victim joined loudly and heartily. Some there were who thought it no joking matter, and were inclined to think they had a Joanna Southcote before them, and that the devil must be the father. These unfortunate Samuels were condemned at Huntingdon, before Mr. Justice Fenner, 4th April, 1593. It was a singular case to be commemorated by an annual lecture, as provided by Sir Samuel Cromwell, for the purposes of justice were never so perverted, nor her sword turned to a more flagrant murder.|$|E
