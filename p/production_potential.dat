5|$|The Dutch air force, {{which was}} not an {{independent}} arm of the Dutch armed forces, {{but part of the}} Army, on 10 May operated a fleet of 155 aircraft: 28 Fokker G.1 twin-engine destroyers; 31 Fokker D.XXI and seven Fokker D.XVII fighters; ten twin-engined Fokker T.V, fifteen Fokker C.X and 35 Fokker C.V light bombers, twelve Douglas DB-8 dive bombers (used as fighters) and seventeen Koolhoven FK-51 reconnaissance aircraft—thus 74 of the 155 aircraft were biplanes. Of these aircraft 125 were operational. Of the remainder the air force school used three Fokker D.XXI, six Fokker D.XVII, a single Fokker G.I, a single Fokker T.V and seven Fokker C.V, along with several training airplanes. Another forty operational aircraft served with the marine air service along with about an equal number of reserve and training craft. The <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> of the Dutch military aircraft industry, consisting of Fokker and Koolhoven, was not fully exploited due to budget limitations.|$|E
5|$|Originally, 300 AMX-30s {{were ordered}} by the French Army, and by 1971 the order had been {{increased}} to 900, divided between eight batches, including all variants based on the chassis. Beginning in 1966, ten AMX-30s were assembled per month, and the first five were issued in August 1966 to the 501st Régiment de Chars de Combat. Monthly production grew to 15–20 tanks as new factories began to manufacture components of the vehicle and existing factories increased their <b>production</b> <b>potential.</b> However, in April 1969, production was again reduced to ten per month. By 1971, about 180 vehicles were in service; in 1975 delivery began of the last 143 units of the final eighth batch of the original order. In 1985, the number of AMX-30s had risen to 1,173. By the end of production, France had accepted 1,355 AMX-30s into service, including 166 brand-new AMX-30B2s. Another 493 tanks were refitted and modernized to AMX-30B2 standards; originally 271 new and 820 refitted vehicles had been planned. The French Army also accepted {{a large number of}} variants, including 195 self-propelled howitzers, 44 AMX-30 Pluton tactical nuclear missile launchers, 183 AMX-30Rs, 134 AMX-30Ds and 48 engineer vehicles (AMX-30EBG). The last 35 new battle tanks were in 1989 ordered by Cyprus and the last new variant vehicles, a batch of twenty GCTs, in 1994 by France.|$|E

40|$|Millet and sorghum stover protect intensively {{cultivated}} soils from rapid {{degradation and}} promote sustained productivity. Quantities of stover found on {{farms in the}} Sahel are mostly inadequate for effective mulching. Surveys conducted in western Niger revealed that the inadequacy of stover for mulching is principally due to the low millet stover yields, particularly in drier areas of the Sahel. The application of P fertilizer represents a feasible option for increasing stover yields. Also, evidence of historical relationships between yearly amounts of stover remaining on farms suggests the possibility of gradual build-up of stover for mulching on farms. Other important determinants of observed level of millet stover are: distance of farms from household compounds, differences in crop <b>production</b> <b>potentials,</b> cropping practice, and interactions between amounts of previous stover, cropping practice and crop <b>production</b> <b>potentials...</b>|$|R
40|$|Peat {{chemistry}} {{appears to}} exert primary control over methane production {{rates in the}} Canadian Northern Wetlands Study (NOWES) area. We determined laboratory methane <b>production</b> rate <b>potentials</b> in anaerobic slurries of samples collected from a transect of sites through the NOWES study area. We related methane production rates to indicators of resistance to microbial decay (peat C: N and lignin: N ratios) and experimentally manipulated substrate availability for methanogenesis using ethanol (EtOH) and plant litter. We also determined responses of methane production to pH and temperature. Methane <b>production</b> <b>potentials</b> declined along the gradient of sites from high rates in the coastal fens to low rates in the interior bogs and were generally highest in surface layers. Strong relationships between CH 4 <b>production</b> <b>potentials</b> and peat chemistry suggested that methanogenesis was limited by fermentation rates. Methane production at ambient pH responded strongly to substrate additions in the circumneutral fens with narrow lignin: N and C: N ratios (delta CH 4 /delta EtOH = 0. 9 - 2. 3 mg/g) and weakly in the acidic bogs with wide C: N and lignin: N ratios (delta CH 4 /delta EtOH = - 0. 04 - 0. 02 mg/g). Observed Q(sub 10) values ranged from 1. 7 to 4. 7 and generally increased with increasing substrate availability, suggesting that fermentation rates were limiting. Titration experiments generally demonstrated inhibition of methanogenesis by low pH. Our {{results suggest that the}} low rates of methane emission observed in interior bogs during NOWES likely resulted from pH and substrate quality limitation of the fermentation step in methane production and thus reflect intrinsically low methane <b>production</b> <b>potentials.</b> Low methane emission rates observed during NOWES will likely be observed in other northern wetland regions with similar vegetation chemistry...|$|R

The feedstock contained 20 % DGS in CSTR 1, 30 % DGS in CSTR 2 and 40 % DGS in CSTR 3 on a volatile solids (VS) basis. Organic loading rates (OLR) of 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 3. 0 kg VS/m 3 /d were studied and {{it was found that}} the OLR affected the digester performance more than the DGS proportion in the feedstock.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a spatially specific {{assessment of the}} potential impacts of the greenhouse effect on crop <b>production</b> <b>potentials</b> and land productivity in Nigeria. To this effect {{a large number of}} scenarios were used consisting of results from experiments with General Circulation Models (GCM’s) as well as sensitivity scenarios in which single variables were changed. Each scenario is characterised by level of increase of atmospheric CO 2, change of stomatal resistance and climate change in terms of temperatures, rainfall and radiation. The effects of such changes have been assessed {{within the framework of the}} agro-ecological zones methodology, that was adapted and expanded for the purpose of the present study. Climate changes are applied to observed baseline conditions for the period 1960 - 1990 and simulated climate is used in combination with soil and landform conditions, plant physiological adaptations to elevated CO 2 and a number of sustainability criteria (e. g. fallow period requirements) to calculate crop <b>production</b> <b>potentials</b> and land productivity. Scenario outputs are compared with current conditions to assess potential impacts and sensitivity of agricultural production to global change phenomena. A large number of maps and tables summarise the potential impacts on crop <b>production</b> <b>potentials</b> and land productivity. The low predictive value of GCM’s and large differences between GCM’s only allow to draw conclusions of policy relevance taking into account a cautionary bandwidth of possible events. The Nigerian middle belt will hardly be affected because changes are likely to be limited and farmers may adapt by choosing other crop varieties. The north of the country is very sensitive to changes of climate and the prevailing crops show little response to elevated CO 2 levels. GCM’s are consistent in indicating climatic changes that lower land suitability for perennial crops in the south. The south-west, with a bimodal rainfall tendency, is particularly sensitive to climate change. Here small changes in scenario may cause either one long growing period or two short ones. However, lower productivity due to climate change, if any, is likely to be more than compensated by the effects of enhanced CO 2 levels. Prevalent crops in the south have a C 3 photosynthesis pathway, that is responsive to enhanced CO 2 levels, which is likely to result in increased of productivity of annual crops such as yams and cassava. Global change may thus exacerbate the current disparities of crop <b>production</b> <b>potentials</b> between the north and the south of the country...|$|R
