40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a new method to support designers to find optimal and robust solutions of engine mounting system. The mounting system design is {{a compromise between}} isolation of the vehicle from engine vibration and constraining {{the motion of the}} powertrain within vehicle packaging. Based on the classical <b>pendulum</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> of a front wheel drive vehicle with a transversely four-cylinder engine, this study deals with the definition of a new global engine mounting concept for the NVH (Noise Vibration and Harshness) improvement of the vehicle characteristics at idle speed. The practical application of the numerical optimization is {{complicated by the fact that}} engine mounting system is a stochastic system. Its characteristics have a probabilistic nature. Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), i. e. Pareto-optimization, is taken as the appropriate framework for the definition and the solution of the addressed multi-objective robust optimization problem. An experimental correlation analysis has been conducted on a Pareto-optimal solution to show the model accuracy...|$|E
40|$|In Part I a {{technique}} for the swing-up control of single inverted pendulum system is presented. The requirement is to swing-up a carriage <b>mounted</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>system</b> from its natural pendent position to its inverted position. It works for all carriage balancing single inverted pendulum systems as the swing-up control algorithm {{does not require}} knowledge of the system parameters. Comparison with previous swing-up controls shows that the proposed swing-up control is simpler, eaiser. more efficient, and more robust. In Part II the technique is extended {{to the case of}} the swing-up control of double inverted pendulum systems. Use is made of a novel selective partial-state feedback control law. The nonlinear, open-loop unstable, nonminimum-phase. and interactive MIMO pendulum system is actively linearised and decoupled about a neutrally stable equilibrium by the partial-state feedback control. This technique for swing-up control is not at all sensitive to uncertainties such as modelling error and sensor noise, and is both reliable and robust...|$|R

The control strategy is based on partial feedback linearization, in a first stage, to linearize only the actuated coordinate of the inverted pendulum, and then, a suitable Lyapunov function is formed to obtain a stabilizing feedback controller.

A Graham dead-beat escapement replaced the foliot, with a 4m <b>pendulum,</b> <b>mounted</b> away from the central arbor, beating once every 1.97 seconds. The new striking system used a new pair of hammers that struck six groups of 22 blows at 12:00 and 0:00 on the great bell on the tower. Ferracina also restored the Magi procession, which then was restricted to occurring only on 15 days of the year around Ascension Day.|$|R

30|$|The design {{strategies}} for powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>systems</b> {{play an important}} role in the reduction of vehicular vibration and noise. As stiffness and damping elements connecting the transmission system and vehicle body, the rubber mount exhibits better vibration isolation performance than the rigid connection. This paper presents a complete design process of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> including the vibration decoupling, vibration simulation analysis, topology optimization, and experimental verification. Based on the 6 -degrees-of-freedom vibration coupling model of the powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> an optimization algorithm is used to extract the best design parameters of each mount, thus rendering the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> fully decoupled and the natural frequency well configured, and the optimal parameters are used to design the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Subsequently, vibration simulation analysis is applied to the <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> considering both transmission and road excitations. According to the results of finite element analysis, the topological structure of the metal frame of the front mount is optimized to improve the strength and dynamic characteristics of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, the vibration bench test is used to verify the availability of the optimization design with the analysis of acceleration response and vibration transmissibility of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The results show that the vibration isolation performance of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> can be improved effectively using the vibration optimal decoupling method, and the structural modification of the metal frame can well promote the dynamic characteristics of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

40|$|The vehicle engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> which {{consists}} of several mounts connecting the engine to the vehicle structure, not only supports {{the weight of the}} engine but also isolates the noise, vibration and the transmitted forces to the vehicle structure. At present conventional elastomeric mounts are widely used in engine <b>mounting</b> <b>systems</b> for commercial vehicles. However, these mounts cannot fulfill the conflicting characteristic requirements for the best isolation concerning both road and engine induced vibrations. Therefore, to improve the noise and vibration isolation of commercial vehicles it is necessary to go beyond traditional passive isolators and use semi-active or active vibration control systems due to their capabilities of addressing the conflicting requirements in different road and engine conditions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to first develop mathematical and computational models of elastomeric engine mounts for heavy trucks and investigate the nonlinear behavior of dynamic stiffness and damping of the mounts, and finally use the developed models to design and analyze an adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is referred to a <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> where actuators, sensors and controller are optimally incorporated in the conventional elastomeric <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The developed computational model of the engine mounts is implemented in Matlab/ Simulink and used in a 3 D engine model with which vibration dynamics analysis under different engine and realistic road inputs is conducted. Moreover, the possibility and advantages of using active engine mounts have been studied by incorporating actuators into the above mentioned 3 D engine model with conventional <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> for heavy trucks. Simulations of the engine vibration dynamics under similar engine and road excitations have been done for the adaptronic <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> and compared to the results from the conventional engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The results of simulations of engine vibration dynamics and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure have shown good potential for vibration isolation improvement in heavy trucks by using adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

The first model is conventional elastomeric engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> comprising elastic, viscous and friction functional components which expresses the nonlinear behaviour {{of the dynamic}} stiffness and damping of the engine mounts as functions of both the frequency and amplitude of excitation. The second model is based on adding actuators, sensors and a controller to the elastomeric mounts making the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> an adaptronic one.

According to the actual state of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> the 6 -DOF vibration model is established. The natural frequency and vibration mode are obtained using eigenvalue analysis. Considering the low-frequency vibration decoupling rate as the objective function, the design parameters (including mount hardness, thickness, and stiffness in all directions) that render the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> fully decoupled and the natural frequency well configured are extracted, and the optimal parameters are used to design the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Subsequently, the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is simulated and analyzed to study the vibration response. The torsional excitation of the shafting is calculated as the transmission excitation using the equivalent model, and the road excitation is simulated using the sinusoidal scanning signal based on the data of acceleration measured by the actual vehicle. A comprehensive analysis shows that the strength and dynamic characteristics of the front mount should be improved, and hence, topology optimization {{is applied to the}} metal frame. Finally, the vibration bench test of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is carried out to extract the acceleration signals in time domain and frequency domain of the upper and lower parts of the mounts.
