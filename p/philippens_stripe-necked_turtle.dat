5000|$|... ==Conservation== Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{protected}} by the CITES and IUCN, captive-breeding Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> are approved. Another reason that affects its population is the invasion of red-eared sliders. In Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan and in some other countries, it is a popular pet turtle.|$|R
50|$|A case of {{hybridization}} {{between a}} male Cyclemys (oldhamii) shanensis {{and a female}} Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> has been described.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> (Mauremys sinensis) or golden thread turtle, is {{a species}} of turtle in the Geoemydidae family.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} known to {{hybridize}} with the Chinese pond <b>turtle,</b> the Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle,</b> and the Chinese box turtle (and possibly other Geoemydidae) in captivity. As these three species are much rarer and strongly declining in the wild, this should be avoided.|$|R
50|$|Three turtle species {{occur in}} the Yilan River: the native Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> and yellow pond turtle, and the {{introduced}} red-eared slider, which outnumbers the native species. Glass eels of two eel species, Anguilla japonica and Anguilla marmorata, {{are found in the}} river.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle, several smaller turtle species {{are found in the}} Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Pan's box turtle, Yunnan box turtle, yellow pond turtle, Chinese pond <b>turtle,</b> Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> and Chinese softshell turtle, which all are considered threatened.|$|R
2500|$|... by 1999 {{the price}} for farm-raised {{softshell}}ed turtles dropped to CNY 60 per Chinese pound, and by 2009, to merely CNY 15-16 per Chinese pound. Other species bred and raised in large numbers (in excess of 10,000 per year, each) in China are the wattle-necked softshell turtle (Palea steindachneri), Chinese pond turtle (Chinemys reevesii), yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica), Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> (Ocadia sinensis) and red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans).|$|R
40|$|Tien-Hsi Chen and Kuang-Yang Lue (2009) Changes in the {{population}} structure and diet of the Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> (Mauremys sinensis) inhabiting a disturbed river in northern Taiwan. Zoological Studies 48 (1) : 95 - 105. The population structure and diet of the Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle,</b> Mauremys (Ocadia) sinensis, were investigated in the Keelung River, northern Taiwan, following severe habitat disturbances. During a 2 -yr levee construction and channel dredging project, the physical characteristics and riparian vegetation of the river were dramatically altered. Compared with results obtained prior to the disturbance, sex ratios were significantly skewed toward males, {{and the proportion of}} larger females significantly decreased both during and after project construction. Moreover, fewer small-sized juveniles were found following the construction disturbance. The diet of M. sinensis also changed, with plant materials assuming greater importance than they had prior to the disturbance. Furthermore, the mean volume of food ingested decreased both during and after the project. This tendency was more pronounced in females than males. Dietary overlap indices between the sexes during (0. 591) and after (0. 922) the project suggest that intraspecific food competition increased throughout the duration of the study...|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} notorious {{for its ability}} to produce hybrids with other Geoemydidae, even species that are only distantly related. The {{supposed}} new species [...] "Mauremys" [...] pritchardi was based on a hybrid of unknown origin between a male of this species and a female yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica). Furthermore, it has hybridized with the Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> (Ocadia sinensis), female Malayan box turtles (Cuora amboinensis), a male four-eyed turtle (Sacalia quadriocellata), and the Japanese pond turtle (Mauremys japonica) in captivity.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is known}} {{only from a}} few {{specimens}} including the type series, all from the pet trade supposedly from Guangxi or Vietnam. Either found in the wild or bred for the pet trade, it was later determined to be the offspring of a male Chinese <b>Stripe-necked</b> <b>Turtle</b> and a female Vietnamese Pond Turtle (Spinks et al. (2004), Stuart & Parham (2006)). If it is a wild-born hybrid, the specimen thus must have originated in central Vietnam, the only area where Mauremys annamensis / the Vietnamese Pond Turtle is known to exist and overlaps with the range of Ocadia sinensis ...|$|R
5000|$|Hybridization {{with other}} Geoemydidae genera {{is known to}} occur. The species has {{produced}} hybrids with the Malayan Box Turtle in captivity. In addition, the supposed new species Ocadia glyphistoma {{has turned out to}} be the offspring of a male Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> and a female of the present species; it might have been taken from the wild or also have been captive-bred. Captive Vietnamese pond turtles - which are occasionally available to experienced hobbyists, under the auspices of the IUCN-coordinated captive-breeding program - must therefore never be housed with related species. Hybridization in the wild would not seem to constitute a major threat, as the two parent species of [...] "Ocadia" [...] Ã— glyphistoma are not closely related, and the hybrids are thus likely to be sterile. However, with a species as rare as the Vietnamese pond turtle, more research into this issue is certainly necessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} species raised by Chinese turtle farmers is the Chinese {{softshell}} turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis), accounting for over 97% of all reported sales, {{both in terms}} of head count (124.8 million in the 684-farm sample) and weight. Large-scale production of this species appears to have been successful in satisfying China gourmets' demand for its meat, which has been reflected in the price drop: while in the mid-1990s, wild-caught softshelled turtles retailed for CNY 500 per Chinese pound or jin (500 g), and farm-raised ones at over CNY 200 / Chinese pound,by 1999 the price for farm-raised softshelled turtles dropped to CNY 60 per Chinese pound, and by 2009, to merely CNY 15-16 per Chinese pound. Other species bred and raised in large numbers (in excess of 10,000 per year, each) in China are the wattle-necked softshell turtle (Palea steindachneri), Chinese pond turtle (Chinemys reevesii), yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica), Chinese <b>stripe-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> (Ocadia sinensis) and red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans).|$|R
