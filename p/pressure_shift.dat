50|$|Scores of {{adolescents}} in the justice system {{differ from those of}} adults. Richardson (1995), administered the GSS to 65 juvenile offenders. When matched with adult offenders on IQ and memory, juveniles were much more susceptible to giving into interrogative <b>pressure</b> (<b>Shift),</b> specifically by changing their answers after they were given negative feedback. Their answers to the leading questions, however, were no more affected by suggestibility than their adult cohorts. These results were likely not due to memory capacity, as studies have shown that information that children can retrieve during free recall increases with age and is equal to adults around age 12. Singh (1992) compared non-offending adults and adolescents and showed that adolescents still showed higher suggestibility scores than adults. A study comparing delinquent adolescents to normal adults found the same results Researchers suggest that police interviewers not place adolescent suspects and witnesses under excessive pressure by criticizing their answers.|$|E

Comparisons of air-broadened halfwidths and pressure-induced line shifts made for identical transitions in the nu(4) bands of C- 12 H 4 and C- 13 H 4 have shown that C- 13 H 4 air-broadened halfwidths are about 5 percent smaller than the corresponding C- 12 H 4 halfwidths, and the <b>pressure</b> <b>shifts</b> for C- 13 H 4 lines are about 5 - 15 percent larger than those for C- 12 H 4...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{limitations}} in function and adjustment strategies of lower limb amputees in gait termination. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: University Medical Centre. Participants: Unilateral transfemoral and transtibial amputees, and able-bodied control subjects. Main outcome measures: Leading limb preference, temporal variables, lower limb joint angles, ground reaction forces, and centre of <b>pressure</b> <b>shift.</b> Results: Compared to able-bodied subjects, amputees showed a decreased peak braking ground reaction {{force in the}} prosthetic limb, no anterior centre of <b>pressure</b> <b>shift</b> during leading with the prosthetic limb and an increased mediolateral centre of <b>pressure</b> <b>shift.</b> Amputees used several adjustment strategies {{to compensate for the}} limitations in function; leading limb preference for the non-affected limb, longer production of braking force in the non-affected limb, decreased gait termination velocity and more weight-bearing on the non-affected limb. Conclusion: Limitations in function and adjustment strategies were mainly similar in transfemoral and transtibial amputees. Due to the lack of active ankle function, amputees were not able to increase the braking force and to shift the centre of pressure anteriorly. Leading with the non-affected limb is favourable for adequate deceleration and balance control, but in daily life not always applicable. It is important that amputees are trained in gait termination during rehabilitation and prosthetic design should focus on a more active role of the prosthetic foot and knee. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Objective: To study {{limitations}} in function and adjustment strategies in lower limb amputees during gait initiation. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: University Medical Center. Participants: Amputees with a unilateral transfemoral or transtibial amputation, and able-bodied subjects. Main outcome measures: Leading limb preference, temporal variables, ground reaction forces, and centre of <b>pressure</b> <b>shift.</b> Results: Amputees demonstrated {{a decrease in}} peak anterior ground reaction force, a smaller or absent posterior centre of <b>pressure</b> <b>shift,</b> and a lower gait initiation velocity. The main adjustments strategies in amputees were more limb-loading on the non-affected limb, prolonging the period of propulsive force production in the non-affected limb and initiating gait preferably with the prosthetic limb. Conclusion: Since an intact ankle joint and musculature is of major importance in gait initiation, functional limitations and adjustment strategies in transfemoral and transtibial amputees were similar. Improving prosthetic ankle properties and initiating gait with the prosthetic limb may facilitate the gait initiation process in amputees. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} {{of at least}} three low-energy chlorophyll a (Chl a) antenna states is shown for photosystem I (PS I) of Synechococcus elongatus by the use of nonphotochemical hole burning (NPHB) spectroscopy. In addition to the pre-viously reported states at 708 and 719 nm, it is demonstrated that there is a third state at 715 nm. The responsible Chl a molecules are referred to as C- 708, C- 715 and C- 719. For both Synechococcus and Synechocystis, the lowest energy state is shown to be characterized by strong electron–phonon coupling (large Huang-Rhys factor S), large permanent dipole moment change ðf DlÞ, and large linear <b>pressure</b> <b>shift</b> rates attributable to electron exchange of dimeric Chl a. The lowest energy state of Synechocystis is at 714 nm. The properties of the 714 and 719 nm states are very similar, sug-gesting that their dimer structures are also similar. Although the other red antenna states of these cyanobacteria have smaller values for S, f Dl, and linear <b>pressure</b> <b>shift</b> rate, these are still larger than typically measured for monomeric antenna Chl a.
