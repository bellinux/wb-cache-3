Lignin and pectin are the main constituents of the layer which sticks the flax cells together within the multicellular technical fiber.

40|$|Fibre {{extracted}} from {{the leaves of the}} Agave sisalana plant and its hybrids can be used to produce high quality <b>papermaking</b> <b>pulp.</b> Sisal pulp has certain characteristics such as high tear resistance, high alpha cellulose content, high porosity, high bulk, high absorbency and high folding endurance which make sisal pulp suitable for many specialty papers. Also, because sisal pulp has physical properties superior to softwood kraft pulp, there may be opportunities to cost effectively replace softwood kraft with sisal pulp in commodity papers. For example, sisal pulp may be used as a reinforcing fibre in high recycle content papers, or its use may permit basis weight reductions while maintaining product quality. Markets for sisal pulp are established in the specialty paper sector; however, currently there are no markets established in the commodity paper sector. This paper explores the following topics that hopefully will provide some background and a direction towards establishing sisal pulp in the commodity paper sector: • global papermaking fibre consumption • global nonwood fibre resources • specialty pulps for specialty papermaking • HurterConsult sisal pulp market surveys • potential sisal pulp applications • hurdles to overcome • the next step...|$|E

The adsorbed amount was calculated from the depletion of starch polymers in the starch-fibre suspension. The molecular composition of the adsorbed starch product was determined from the difference in the SEC chromatograms before and after adsorption. In addition, handsheets were formed to correlate starch adsorption on the pulp with the resulting paper strength. The value of the method was demonstrated using the example of a low DS cationic potato starch derivative. This sample from a slurry process was adsorbed to a significantly higher extent in virtually electrolyte-free deionised water (DW) than in water with a high electrolyte content (36 degrees German Hardness - 36 dGH). In DW, both amylopectin and amylose were adsorbed on the pulp, whereas in water of 36 dGH only the amylopectin-rich fraction was adsorbed.

40|$|The {{papermaking}} {{industry has}} been continuously developing intelligent solutions to characterize the raw materials it uses, to control the manufacturing process in a robust way, and to guarantee the desired quality of the end product. Based on the much improved imaging techniques and image-based analysis methods, it has become possible to look inside the manufacturing pipeline and propose more effective alternatives to human expertise. This study {{is focused on the}} development of image analyses methods for the <b>pulping</b> process of <b>papermaking.</b> <b>Pulping</b> starts with wood disintegration and forming the fiber suspension that is subsequently bleached, mixed with additives and chemicals, and finally dried and shipped to the papermaking mills. At each stage of the process it is important to analyze the properties of the raw material to guarantee the product quality. In order to evaluate properties of fibers, the main component of the pulp suspension, a framework for fiber characterization based on microscopic images is proposed in this thesis as the first contribution. The framework allows computation of fiber length and curl index correlating well with the ground truth values. The bubble detection method, the second contribution, was developed in order to estimate the gas volume at the delignification stage of the pulping process based on high-resolution in-line imaging. The gas volume was estimated accurately and the solution enabled just-in-time process termination whereas the accurate estimation of bubble size categories still remained challenging.

Metso Paper Sundsvall {{is a part of the}} fiber business line. The aim of this project was to develop, and evaluate a concept for a new pulp feeding system to one of Metso's machines. This new system shall enable feeding with a higher pulp consistency, and require a lower pressure drop, compared to existing pulp feed systems. A pre-study was conducted to get acquainted with, and understand the problem. This study resulted in a number of goals and demands. After the pre-study concepts were generated, and evaluated, one was selected to continue working with. The selected concept was further evaluated through lab trials. The result from these trials showed that the concept has potential to fulfil most of the stated goals and demands. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

Thus, in this preliminary work, naturally dried durian rind were pulped under Soda-Anthraquinone (Soda-AQ) pulping process with 18 % to 22 % alkali charge, 0 % to 0. 1 % Anthraquinone (AQ) charge, 90 minutes to 150 minutes of cooking time and 150 °C to 170 °C to investigate the effect of pulping variables {{on the characteristics of}} the pulp and paper. Pulping condition with 0 % of AQ charge was also conducted for comparison. Results indicated that the best screen yield percentage, reject yield percentage, freeness, drainage time, tear index, number of folds and optical properties were shown by the pulp produced with {{combination of}} the highest active alkali (22 %), AQ charge (0. 1 %), cooking time (150 minutes) and cooking temperature (170 °C) except apparent density, tensile index and burst index. This preliminary result shows that the optimum quality of durian rind pulp as a potential <b>papermaking</b> raw material <b>pulp</b> could be produced by selecting the good combination of pulping variables which influences the pulp and paper characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The use of acid-tolerant precipitated calcium {{carbonate}} fillers, including phosphoric acid/sodium hexametaphosphate modified precipitated CaCO 3 filler, and sodium silicate/phosphoric acid/sodium hexametaphos-phate modified precipitated CaCO 3 filler in <b>papermaking</b> of deinked <b>pulp</b> derived from recycled newspaper was explored. These two acid-tolerant fillers provided considerably more brightness improvement in papers in comparison the unmodified filler, presumably indicating alleviated pulp darkening achieved {{as a result}} of better acid-resistant properties. The addition of acid-tolerant fillers into the furnish slurries gave lower system pH as compared with unmodified filler. Among the three fillers used in this work, the effect on retention of modification of the filler with sodium silicate/phosphoric acid/sodium hexametaphosphate was probably the best, as evaluated from ash content measurements. For air permeability of the paper, the use of acid-tolerant fillers provided slightly more improvement in comparison to the unmodified filler. For tensile and burst strength of the paper, the use of sodium silicate/phosphoric acid/sodium hexameta-phosphate modified precipitated {{calcium carbonate}} filler gave better results as compared with the other two fillers. Additionally, the improving effect of acid-tolerant fillers on furnish static drainage was found to be slightly weaker than that of unmodified filler...|$|R
