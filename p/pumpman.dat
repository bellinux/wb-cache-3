2500|$|A <b>pumpman</b> is an {{unlicensed}} {{member of}} the Deck Department of a merchant ship. [...] Pumpmen are found almost exclusively on tankers, and on oil tankers in particular. [...] Variations on the title can include chief <b>pumpman,</b> QMED/pumpman, and second <b>pumpman.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Those {{that work}} aboard ships have general duties, in {{addition}} to their job-specific duties. [...] For the <b>pumpman,</b> this largely translates to proficiency during drills and actual emergencies. [...] The <b>pumpman</b> will participate in shipboard drills such as engineering casualty drills, fire drills, and collision drills, and must be able to perform assigned duties and carry out instructions safely and efficiently. [...] As a non-entry level rating, the <b>pumpman</b> is expected to take the initiative in emergencies without specific orders or instructions, and have a complete knowledge of safety policies and practices. [...] Some policies that are particularly important to the <b>pumpman</b> rating include handling of flammable/dangerous liquids, confined space entry procedures, and the ship's tag-out program.|$|E
2500|$|The pumpman's job {{has three}} aspects: {{repairing}} equipment when it breaks, monitoring equipment to ensure it is working, and maintaining equipment to prevent breakage.

2500|$|<b>Pumpmen</b> {{employed}} on Great Lakes ships work 60 {{days and}} have 30 days off, {{but do not}} work in the winter when the lakes are frozen. Workers on rivers, on canals, and in harbors {{are more likely to}} have year-round work. [...] Some work 8-hour or 12-hour shifts and go home every day. [...] Others work steadily for a week or a month and then have an extended period off. When working, they usually are on duty for 6 or 12 hours and off for 6 or 12 hours. Those on smaller vessels are normally assigned to one vessel and have steady employment.|$|R
25|$|Able seamen and {{ordinary}} seamen operate the vessel and its deck equipment under officer supervision {{and keep their}} assigned areas in good order. They watch for other vessels and obstructions in the ship's path, {{as well as for}} navigational aids such as buoys and lighthouses. They also steer the ship, measure water depth in shallow water, and maintain and operate deck equipment such as lifeboats, anchors, and cargo-handling gear. On tankers, mariners designated as <b>pumpmen</b> hook up hoses, operate pumps, and clean tanks. When arriving at or leaving a dock, they handle the mooring lines. Seamen also perform routine maintenance chores, such as repairing lines, chipping rust, and painting and cleaning decks. On larger vessels, a boatswain — or head seaman — will supervise the work.|$|R
50|$|Ship's {{engineers}} operate, maintain, {{and repair}} engines, boilers, generators, pumps, and other machinery. Merchant marine vessels usually have four engineering officers: a chief engineer and a first, second, and third assistant engineer. On many ships, Assistant Engineers stand periodic watches, overseeing the safe operation of engines and other machinery. However, most modern ships sailing today utilize Unmanned Machinery Space (UMS) automation technology, and Assistant Engineers are Dayworkers. At night and during meals and breaks, {{the engine room}} is unmanned and machinery alarms are answered by the Duty Engineer.Able seamen and ordinary seamen operate the vessel and its deck equipment under officer supervision and keep their assigned areas in good order.

50|$|The <b>PUMPMAN</b> series pumps {{invented in}} INDIA in 2015-16 are however {{completely}} different from the presently available hydraulically operated piston pumps. The <b>PUMPMAN</b> series Pumps have been recently invented which do not use a hydraulic pump and complex hydraulic circuits for their operation. However they use a very simple mechanism which multiplies the reciprocating force several times without using a hydraulic system. These Pumps are protected under multiple patent applications, {{some of them are}} already published by the Indian Patent office. They have been invented by Amit & Anand Gokhale.|$|E

50|$|Davis was a miner {{and began}} working for the Dominion Coal Company Limited (DOMCO) in 1905 at various collieries along the Sydney Coal Field, {{eventually}} graduating to become a <b>pumpman</b> and a roadmaker, lastly at the No. 12 Colliery in New Waterford. He married in 1907 and was raising a family of nine children by 1925 with his wife carrying a tenth child due in September.|$|E
50|$|When fired up, {{there were}} {{personnel}} assignments specified underway, {{as well as}} in port. For example, for an , in normal steaming four boilers were operated. This was sufficient to power the ships at speeds up to 27 kn. For higher speeds, all eight boilers were lit. Each operating boiler required a minimum of four trained operators on watch: a boiler supervisor (BTOW), a superheater burnerman and saturated burnerman to control the steam temperature and pressure and a checkman, who monitored and controlled the water level in the steam drum. In addition, there was a fireroom messenger and a lower level <b>pumpman</b> on duty whenever the fireroom was steaming.|$|E
50|$|The {{grade was}} built for the Biggar-Loverna line of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1912, and steel was laid in 1913. The {{construction}} of the rail site in Coleville began in 1913 {{with the construction of}} the railway station and coal box. Jack Binks, section foreman, was the station's first occupant, and George Barrett was the first station agent. After the construction of the station, a water well was required for the steam engines. In 1914 a two-pen, four-car stock yard and hog chute were built, and an 18 metre (60 foot) well was dug by hand. A pump house was built, and the Coleville water tower, which is still in use today, was erected. The first <b>pumpman</b> was Mike Crown. The Bigger-Loverna line became part of the Canadian National Railway in 1923. The section toolhouse was built in 1926, and in 1953 a two-car loading platform was built, and an electric pump was installed in the pumphouse.|$|E
