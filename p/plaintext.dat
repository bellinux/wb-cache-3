5|$|The {{scramble}} display has {{exactly the}} same letter frequencies as the underlying <b>plaintext.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{encryption}} itself due to {{the block}} cipher exhibited a regular pattern due to repeated text in the original <b>plaintext.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the <b>plaintext,</b> a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the <b>plaintext</b> frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E
50|$|Differential {{cryptanalysis}} {{is effective}} against Khafre: 16 rounds {{can be broken}} using either 1500 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> or 238 known <b>plaintexts.</b> Similarly, 24 rounds can be attacked using 253 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> or 259 known <b>plaintexts.</b>|$|R

50|$|CMEA is {{severely}} insecure. There is a chosen-plaintext attack, effective for all block sizes, using 338 chosen <b>plaintexts.</b> For 3-byte blocks (typically used to encrypt each dialled digit), {{there is a}} known-plaintext attack using 40 to 80 known <b>plaintexts.</b> For 2-byte blocks, 4 known <b>plaintexts</b> suffice.|$|R
5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the <b>plaintext</b> is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a {{flat file}} <b>plaintext</b> format to {{represent}} and store data which is typically {{referred to as}} EMBL-Bank format. EMBL-Bank format uses a different syntax to the records in DDBJ and GenBank, though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature, such as taxonomies {{as defined by the}} NCBI Taxon database. Each line of an EMBL-format file beings with a two-letter code, such as AC to label the accession number and KW for a list of keywords relevant to the record; each record ends with //.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the <b>plaintext</b> of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The known 3 -round {{distinguisher}} of Rijndael- 256 is byteoriented and 2 8 <b>plaintexts</b> {{are needed}} to distinguish 3 -round Rijndael from a random permutation.

25|$|The basic use of {{frequency}} analysis is to first count {{the frequency of}} ciphertext letters and then associate guessed <b>plaintext</b> letters with them. More Xs in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that X corresponds to e in the <b>plaintext,</b> {{but this is not}} certain; t and a are also very common in English, so X might be either of them also. It is unlikely to be a <b>plaintext</b> z or q which are less common. Thus the cryptanalyst may need to try several combinations of mappings between ciphertext and <b>plaintext</b> letters.|$|E
25|$|For this example, {{uppercase}} {{letters are}} used to denote ciphertext, lowercase letters {{are used to}} denote <b>plaintext</b> (or guesses at such), and X~t is used to express a guess that ciphertext letter X represents the <b>plaintext</b> letter t.|$|E
25|$|Decryption is {{performed}} {{by going to}} the row in the table corresponding to the key, finding the position of the ciphertext letter in this row, and then using the column's label as the <b>plaintext.</b> For example, in row L (from LEMON), the ciphertext L appears in column A, which is the first <b>plaintext</b> letter. Next we go to row E (from LEMON), locate the ciphertext X which is found in column T, thus T is the second <b>plaintext</b> letter.|$|E

50|$|Jakobsen & Knudsen's {{higher order}} {{differential}} cryptanalysis breaks KN-Cipher with only 512 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> and 241 running time, or with 32 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> and 270 running time.|$|R
50|$|The {{attack is}} notable for {{requiring}} {{only a handful}} of known <b>plaintexts</b> to perform; previous methods of cryptanalysis, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis, often require unrealistically large numbers of known or chosen <b>plaintexts.</b>|$|R
25|$|Euler's theorem also {{forms the}} basis of the RSA {{encryption}} system, where the net result of first encrypting a <b>plaintext</b> message, then later decrypting it, amounts to exponentiating a large input number by , for some positive integer k. Euler's theorem then guarantees that the decrypted output number is equal to the original input number, giving back the <b>plaintext.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{a simple}} {{substitution}} cipher, each {{letter of the}} <b>plaintext</b> is replaced with another, and any particular letter in the <b>plaintext</b> will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext. For instance, if all occurrences of the letter e turn into the letter X, a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter X would suggest to a cryptanalyst that X represents e.|$|E
25|$|In cryptography, {{a stream}} cipher is a {{symmetric}} key cipher where <b>plaintext</b> bits are {{combined with a}} pseudorandom cipher bit stream, typically by an exclusive-or (xor) operation. In a stream cipher the <b>plaintext</b> digits are encrypted one at a time, and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption. Also known as a state cipher, the stream cipher was invented in 1917 by Gilbert Sandford Vernam at Bell Labs.|$|E
50|$|Van Rompay et al. (1998) {{attempted}} to apply differential cryptanalysis to ICE. They described {{an attack on}} Thin-ICE which recovers the secret key using 223 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> with a 25% success probability. If 227 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> are used, the probability can be improved to 95%. For the standard version of ICE, an attack on 15 out of 16 rounds was found, requiring 256 work and at most 256 chosen <b>plaintexts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The same paper also {{describes}} two attacks which break 12 {{rounds of}} Serpent-256. The first requires 2118 known <b>plaintexts,</b> 2228.8 time and 2228 memory. The other attack requires 2116 known <b>plaintexts</b> and 2121 memory but also requires 2237.5 time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Camellia is {{the final}} winner of 128 -bit block cipher in NESSIE. In this paper, we {{construct}} some efficient distinguishers between 4 -round Camellia and a random permutation of the blocks space. By using collision-searching techniques, the distinguishers are used to attack on 6, 7, 8 and 9 rounds of Camellia with 128 -bit key and 8, 9 and 10 rounds of Camellia with 192 / 256 -bit key. The 128 -bit key of 6 rounds Camellia can be recovered with 2 10 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> and 2 15 encryptions. The 128 -bit key of 7 rounds Camellia can be recovered with 2 12 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> and 2 54. 5 encryptions. The 128 -bit key of 8 rounds Camellia can be recovered with 2 13 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> and 2 112. 1 encryptions. The 128 -bit key of 9 rounds Camellia can be recovered with 2 113. 6 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> and 2 121 encryptions. The 192 / 256 -bit key of 8 rounds Camellia can be recovered with 2 13 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> and 2 111. 1 encryptions. The 192 / 256 -bit key of 9 rounds Camellia can be recovered with 2 13 chosen <b>plaintexts</b> and 2 175. 6 encryptions.

25|$|An {{improvement}} to the Kasiski examination, {{known as}} Kerckhoffs' method, matches each column's letter frequencies to shifted <b>plaintext</b> frequencies {{to discover the}} key letter (Caesar shift) for that column. Once every letter in the key is known, the cryptanalyst can simply decrypt the ciphertext and reveal the <b>plaintext.</b> Kerckhoffs' method is not applicable when the Vigenère table has been scrambled, rather than using normal alphabetic sequences, although Kasiski examination and coincidence tests can still {{be used to determine}} key length in that case.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea behind}} the Vigenère cipher, like all {{polyalphabetic}} ciphers, is to disguise <b>plaintext</b> letter frequencies, which interferes with a straightforward application of frequency analysis. For instance, if P is the most frequent letter in a ciphertext whose <b>plaintext</b> is in English, one might suspect that P corresponds to E, because E is {{the most frequently used}} letter in English. However, using the Vigenère cipher, E can be enciphered as different ciphertext letters at different points in the message, thus defeating simple frequency analysis.|$|E
25|$|In some ciphers, such {{properties}} of the natural language <b>plaintext</b> are preserved in the ciphertext, and these patterns {{have the potential to}} be exploited in a ciphertext-only attack.|$|E
