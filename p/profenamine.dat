50|$|<b>Profenamine</b> (INN, {{trade names}} Parsidol, Parsidan, Parkin), {{also known as}} ethopropazine (BAN), is a {{phenothiazine}} derivative used as an antiparkinsonian agent that has anticholinergic, antihistamine, and antiadrenergic actions. It is also used in the alleviation of the extrapyramidal syndrome induced by drugs such as other phenothiazine compounds, but, like other compounds with antimuscarinic properties, is of no value against tardive dyskinesia.|$|E
40|$|Cyamepromazine maleate, <b>profenamine</b> hydrochloride, {{triflupromazine}} hydrochloride, and fluphenazine dihydrochloride {{were used}} as redox indicators in the macro- and micro-titrns. of hydroquinone and phenylhydrazine hydrochloride with N-bromosuccinimide in different acid media. The indicators give very sharp and reversible color changes at the equivalence point. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|Cyamepromazine maleate, <b>profenamine</b> hydrochloride, {{triflupromazine}} hydrochloride, fluphenazine dihydrochloride, and perphenazine dihydrochloride {{are proposed}} as redox indicators in macro- and micro-titrns. of Fe(II), Tl(III), U(IV), Mo(V), hydroquinone, metol, and ascorbic acid with Ce(IV) sulfate in H 2 SO 4, HCl, and HOAc. The indicators give very sharp and reversible color {{changes at the}} equivalence point. Their transition potentials are detd. The present indicators have certain advantages over the existing indicators in ceriometry. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Profenamine</b> hydrochloride, {{fluphenazine}} dihydrochloride, trifluopromazine hydrochloride, cyamepromazine maleate, perphenazine dihydrochloride and mepazine hydrochloride {{are proposed}} as redox indicators in the titration of hydroquinone, metol and ascorbic acid with chloramine-T and chloramine-B in sulphuric, hydrochloric and acetic acid media. They give a sharp reversible colour {{change at the}} equivalence point. A simple but accurate method for the determination of hydroquinone, metol and ascorbic acid is described. The conditional potentials and molar absorptivities of the indicators and redox potential of chloramine-B are reported...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid {{spectrophotometric}} method for the detn. of 6 phenothiazines {{is based on}} the formation of a colored compd. between molybdophosphoric acid (I) and phenothiazines. The IR and ESR spectra of the colored compds. showed that I oxidizes phenothiazines to a radical cation with which it then forms a colored compd. Absorbances were detd. at 510 nm for triflupromazine [146 - 54 - 3] and trifluperazine [117 - 89 - 5], at 525 nm for butaperazine [653 - 03 - 2], <b>profenamine</b> [522 - 00 - 9], and mepazine [60 - 89 - 9] and 540 nm for perphenazine [58 - 39 - 9].

40|$|<b>Profenamine</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{is proposed}} as a sensitive and selective reagent for the spectrophotometric detn. of V(V). It forms a red-colored species with V(V) instantaneously in 5. 5 - 7. 5 M H 3 PO 4 medium. An 11 -fold molar {{excess of the}} reagent {{is necessary for the}} full development of color intensity. The red species exhibits absorption max. at 510 nm with molar absorptivity of 7. 09 Ã� 103. The Sandell sensitivity is 7 ng/cm 2. Beer's law is valid over the concn. range 0. 1 - 6. 0 Î¼g V/mL. The influence of some common ions is reported. The proposed method was successfully used for the detn. of V in V steels. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic {{method has}} been developed for the simultaneous analysis of the 12 phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, levomepromazine, perazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, <b>profenamine,</b> promethazine, propericiazine, thioproperazine, thioridazine and trifluoperazine) in human serum using HPLC/UV. The separation was achieved using a C 18 reversed-phase column (250 mm × 4. 6 mm I. D., particle size 5 μm, Inersil ODS-SP). The mobile phase, consisting of acetonitrile–methanol– 30 mM NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 5. 6) (300 : 200 : 500, v/v/v), was delivered at a flow rate of 0. 9 mL/min and UV detection was carried out at 250 nm. The recoveries of the 12 phenothiazines spiked into serum samples were 87. 6 – 99. 8 %. Regression equations for the 12 phenothiazines showed excellent linearity, with detection limits of 3. 2 – 5. 5 ng/mL for serum. The inter-day and intra-day coefficients of variation for serum samples were commonly below 8. 8 %. The selectivity, accuracy and precision of this method are satisfactory for clinical and forensic purposes. This sensitive and selective method offers the opportunity for simultaneous screening and quantification of almost all phenothiazines available in Japan {{for the purposes of}} clinical and forensic applications...|$|E
