5000|$|The <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>task</b> is {{a simple}} pure visual-motor {{tracking}} test that has consistent results within age groups. [...] This displays a measurement of procedural memory as well as demonstrates the participant's fine motor skills. The <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>task</b> tests the fine-motor skills which are controlled by the motor cortex illustrated by the green section below. [...] The results are then calculated by the participant's time-on and time-off the object. Amnesic participants show no impairment in this motor task when tested at later trials.

50|$|Genetic makeup {{has been}} found to impact skill {{learning}} and performance, and therefore plays a role in achieving expertise. Using the <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>task,</b> one study examined the effects of practice in identical and fraternal twins raised in separate homes. Because identical twins share 100% of their genes while fraternal twins share 50%, the impact of genetic makeup on skill learning could be examined. The results of the <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>task</b> test became more identical with practice over time for the identical twins, whereas the results for the fraternal twins became more disparate with practice. In other words, the performance of the skill by the identical twins became closer to 100% identical, while the fraternal twins' skill performance became less identical, suggesting the 50% difference in genetic makeup is responsible for the difference in skill performance. The study shows that more practice leads to a closer representation of a person's innate capability, also known as talent. Therefore, some of the differences people show after extended practice increasingly reflects their genetics. The study also confirmed the idea that practice improves skill learning by showing that, in both the identical and fraternal groups, more practice aided in shedding ineffective tendencies in order to improve execution of a given skill. Currently, the link between learning and genetics has been limited to simple task learning, while a link to more complex forms of learning, such as the learning of cognitive skills, has not been confirmed.|$|E

The women {{reported}} to the laboratory weekly {{at the same time}} to be tested on concept formation, digit symbol substitution, choice reaction time and <b>rotor</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>tasks.</b> The mood, energy and performance data were normalised to a standard 28 day cycle firmly anchored around menstruation and ovulation, which was pinpointed by using the temperature curves. Mood and energy were both found to be high around ovulation but low paramenstrually. No significant differences associated with different phases of the menstrual cycle, were found in performance on the digit symbol substitution and <b>rotor</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>tasks</b> but performance on concept formation and choice reaction time was found to be good premenstrually and preovulatory but deteriorated following ovulation and during menstruation. It is hypothesised that changes in estrogen levels may be responsible for the mood and energy levels observed; that the changes in performance are a function of the information load of the task and that this may be due to fluctuations in arousal across the cycle or to the direct effect of gonadotrophins upon information processing. The generalis-ability of the data obtained from the sample studied was investigated using a menstrual questionnaire which was administered to 300 students...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In Western {{societies}} {{a considerable}} percentage {{of young people}} expose themselves to the combination of 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or “ecstasy”). Cannabis (main active compound D 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol or THC) is frequently co-used with ecstasy (Parrott et al., 2007). Despite the prevalence of co-administration of MDMA and THC, the effects of combined use of these substances on behaviour in humans have {{so far not been}} investigated. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the acute effects of (co-) administration of MDMA and THC (the main psychoactive compound of cannabis) on pharmacokinetics, psychomotor performance, memory and subjective experience over time. Methods: We performed a four-way, double blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (12 male, 4 female) between the ages of 18 and 27. MDMA (100 mg) was given orally, THC (4, 6, and 6 mg, interval of 90 minutes) was vaporized and inhaled. Outcome measures were assessed repeatedly, i. e. before MDMA administration and at 15, 60, 105, 150, 240 and 300 minutes post drug administration, with the exception of the 18 word list memory task, which was performed 120 minutes after drug administration. Repeated measures consisted of blood sampling for analysis of study drug kinetics and assessments of postural stability (body sway), psychomotor function (eye movements and the <b>Rotor</b> Pusuit <b>Task),</b> memory (18 word list and N-back task), and subjective effects (VAS). Results: Body sway was increased, i. e. postural position was impaired, in all drug conditions compared to placebo. THC alone as well as co-administration of THC plus MDMA increased body sway compared to the MDMA alone condition. Eye movements were unaffected by THC, MDMA increased the peak velocity of eye movements. The <b>Rotor</b> <b>Pursuit</b> <b>task</b> (see Figure 1) performance was significantly impaired in the THC condition and the MDMA plus THC condition compared to the placebo and MDMA condition. MDMA alone did not affect the <b>Rotor</b> <b>Pursuit</b> <b>task.</b> Immediate recall of words was impaired in all drug conditions compared to placebo. Delayed recall and delayed recognition did not show a significant main effect of drug administration. The effects of (co-administration) of THC on the N-back working memory task were time- and dose dependent, where THC generally induced a robust but short-lived impairment of working memory. N-back performance was unaffected in the MDMA condition. Co-administration of THC and MDMA enhanced separate subjective drug effects: ratings of 'drug strength', 'internal and external perception', and 'feeling high' were increased compared to the MDMA condition. Conclusion: These results suggest that THC may exert much of its cognitive impairment via a common mechanism of reduced alertness. The stimulant effects of MDMA may attenuate this effect, but could not overcome THC induced impairments in the current study. Overall, THC induced more robust cognitive impairment compared to MDMA. Co-administration of THC with MDMA increased desired subjective drug effects and drug strength compared to the MDMA condition, which may explain the widespread use of this combination...|$|R

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that neuroplasticity is impaired in depression. This study aimed to compare neuroplasticity in 23 subjects with DSM-IV {{major depressive episode}} and 23 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, using an objective test that is independent of subject effort and motivation. Neuroplasticity was assessed in the motor cortex using a brain stimulation paradigm known as paired associative stimulation (PAS), which induces transient changes in motor cortical function. Motor cortical excitability was assessed before and after PAS using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to induce motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in a hand muscle. After PAS, MEP amplitudes significantly increased in healthy controls compared with depressed subjects (P= 0. 002). The functional significance of motor cortical changes was assessed using a motor learning task-a computerized version of the <b>rotor</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>task.</b> Healthy controls also performed better on motor learning (P= 0. 02). BDNF blood levels and genotype were assayed to determine any relationship with motor cortical plasticity. However, PAS results did not correlate with motor learning, nor appear {{to be related to}} BDNF measures. The significance of these findings is that it provides one of the first direct demonstrations of reduced neuroplasticity in depressed subjects, using an objective test.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{advanced}} age and cognitive {{resources on the}} course of skill acquisition are unclear, and discrepancies among studies may reflect limitations of data analytic approaches.

The analyses conducted at the single-trial level indicated that the negative exponential function described performance well.

40|$|Tracking {{a digital}} <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>task</b> {{was used to}} measure dual task costs of {{language}} production by young and older adults. Tracking performance by both groups was affected by dual task demands: time on target declined and tracking error increased as dual task demands increased from the baseline condition to a moderately demanding dual task condition to a more demanding dual task condition. When dual task demands were moderate, older adults’ speech rate declined but their fluency, grammatical complexity, and content were unaffected. When the dual task was more demanding, older adults’ speech, like young adults’ speech, became highly fragmented, ungrammatical, and incoherent. Vocabulary, working memory, processing speed, and inhibition affected vulnerability to dual task costs: vocabulary provided some protection for sentence length and grammaticality, working memory conferred some protection for grammatical complexity, and processing speed provided some protection for speech rate, propositional density, coherence, and lexical diversity. Further, vocabulary and working memory capacity provided more protection for older adults than for young adults although the protective effect of processing speed was somewhat reduced for older adults as compared to the young adults...|$|E

The subjects performed the <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> test for 1 min in 20 trials with a 1 -min interval alternately using the dominant and non-dominant hands. After continuing for 10 trials, a 5 -min rest was taken. The measurement order was randomly assigned. Contact time of a steel pen and a target was measured in units of 1 / 10 sec. The measurements showed a constant increasing tendency at every trial until the 6 th trial in both hands. Significant linear regressions were identified, but the increase-rate of the dominant hand was significantly larger. Individual differences showed a decreasing tendency at every trial in the dominant hand, but in the non-dominant hand it increased until the 4 th trial then decreased. The relationships between measurements of the 1 st and 10 th trial in both hands and both hands in the 1 st or 10 th trial were not high. The performance of the <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> test improves at every trial in both hands, but the improvement rate decreases after the 7 th trial.

40|$|Background. The Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) {{software}} {{consists of}} over one-hundred computerized tests based on classic and novel cognitive neuropsychology and behavioral neurology measures. Although the PEBL tests {{are becoming more}} widely utilized, there is currently very limited information about {{the psychometric properties of}} these measures. Methods. Study I examined inter-relationships among nine PEBL tests including indices of motor-function (<b>Pursuit</b> <b>Rotor</b> and Dexterity), attention (Test of Attentional Vigilance and Time-Wall), working memory (Digit Span Forward), and executive-function (PEBL Trail Making Test, Berg/Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Iowa Gambling Test, and Mental Rotation) in a normative sample (N = 189, ages 18 – 22). Study II evaluated test–retest reliability with a two-week interest interval between administrations in a separate sample (N = 79, ages 18 – 22). Results. Moderate intra-test, but low inter-test, correlations were observed and ceiling/floor effects were uncommon. Sex differences were identified on the <b>Pursuit</b> <b>Rotor</b> (Cohen’s d = 0. 89) and Mental Rotation (d = 0. 31) tests. The correlation between the test and retest was high for tests of motor learning (<b>Pursuit</b> <b>Rotor</b> time on target r =. 86) and attention (Test of Attentional Vigilance response time r =. 79), intermediate for memory (digit span r =. 63) but lower for the executive function indices (Wisconsin/Berg Card Sorting Test perseverative errors =. 45, Tower of London moves =. 15). Significant practice effects were identified on several indices of executive function. Conclusions.

Sleep spindles have also been observed to vary following learning in both young and older adults. We examined the effect of procedural task acquisition on sleep stages and on sleep spindles in an adolescent sample. Participants were 32 adolescents (17 female) between the ages of 12 and 19 years. Spindle activity was examined in three different frequency ranges: 11. 00 – 13. 50 Hz (slow), 13. 51 – 16. 00 Hz (fast), and 16. 01 – 18. 50 Hz (superfast). No changes in spindle density were observed after successful learning of the <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>task.</b> This result was in contrast to a number of studies reporting spindle density increases following successful learning. In the present study, participants who successfully learned the task showed no changes in their sleep stage proportions, but participants who were not successful showed a decrease in the proportion of Stage 2 and increases in both SWS and REM sleep.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the role of prefronto-striatal loop systems for {{cognitive}} procedural learning (PL) brought inconsistent results. To examine whether the integrity of the dorsolateral prefrontal loop is indispensable for normal cognitive PL, we examined the acquisition of cognitive skills in 35 patients with focal prefrontal lesions, focal caudate lesions, and Huntington's Disease (HD), and compared it with a control group. To examine the potential role of the processing demands made by the cognitive tasks, a set of tasks was applied whose acquisition places demand either on reasoning and problem solving, or on the establishment of fast and repetitive processing routines. The <b>Pursuit</b> <b>Rotor</b> <b>task</b> was also studied with the aim to re-examine earlier findings of a functional segregation of motor and complex prefronto-striatal loops. Deficits of cognitive and motor PL were found to be limited to certain tasks and groups. PL of one task, which demanded rapid, repetitive processing of visuo-spatial stimuli, was impaired in all patient groups. PL of two problem-solving tasks was impaired in patients with focal and degenerative caudate lesions only. None of the groups was impaired at PL of Mirror Reading, another task demanding rapid and repetitive visuo-spatial processing, and none was impaired in a fifth task of language skill. Deficits of motor learning were only observed in patients in whom the motor loop was affected. These results suggest that the dorsolateral prefronto-striatal loop is involved in the establishment of cognitive processing routines. The comparison of patients with and without caudate lesions suggests that disconnection of this circuit is critical. However, the normal acquisition of two cognitive tasks even in this group indicates that the integrity of the dorsolateral prefrontal loop is not mandatory for normal cognitive PL. We discuss these dissociations with regard to the demand profiles of the applied tasks and the locations of the lesions...|$|E

The present study manipulated all three mediating variables with 240 undergraduate 18 - 25 year old female subjects with the <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>task</b> that requires tracking a moving (40 rpm's) white light with a hand-held stylus for 60 seconds. Response measurement was based upon time on target. Subjects were tested over five trials while setting goals for each trial. Females {{were randomly assigned to}} a male appropriate, female appropriate, or gender neutral task condition, a competition or alone condition, and to one of four feedback conditions (no feedback, feedback about own performance only, feedback about own performance that provided the perception that subject was performing better than an opponent and/or average on each trial, or feedback about own performance that provided the perception that subject was performing poorer than an opponent and/or average on each of the five trials). Results from the 2 (social comparison) X 3 (task appropriateness) X 4 (feedback) ANOVA were contradictory to previous findings (Corbin, 1981; Petruzzello & Corbin, 1988) as females performed significantly better in competition than alone. Data support the conclusion that presentation of clear and unambiguous feedback enhanced female self-confidence (Corbin, 1981; Petruzzello & Corbin, 1988; Lenney, 1977). Data also provide null findings for the task appropriateness condition which contradicts the previous research (Corbin, 1981; Lenney, 1977) in that females perceiving the task as male appropriate did not exhibit less self-confidence and perform poorer than when the task was perceived as either female appropriate or gender neutral.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of amplitude compression on speech perception as reflected by attention and intelligibility. Previous investigations of the effects of compression on intelligibility have shown inconsistent results. Additional measures were investigated in the present work because percent-correct measures of intelligibility are not a complete indicator of compression effectiveness. Listening effort was considered as an additional parameter. Two dual-task paradigms were constructed to measure listening effort associated with amplitude compression. In the first experiment, an auditory word recognition task was employed as the primary task and a visual motor tracking task as the secondary task. Monosyllabic words were mixed with speech-shaped noise at a fixed signal-to-noise ratio and compressed using fast-acting wide dynamic range compression. Participants with normal hearing performed a word recognition and a <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>task</b> in single and dual-task conditions. Results showed that compressed speech decreased visual motor tracking performance but not word recognition as compared to linearly processed speech. In the second experiment, an auditory word recognition task again served as the primary task, and a visual lexical decision task was employed as the secondary task. In the secondary task subjects were asked to decide whether an item on a computer screen was a word or not. The visual lexical decision task was expected to interfere more with the auditory word recognition task as compared to the visual motor tracking task of the first experiment because the lexical decision task shares more similarities in processing modes with the auditory task. However, the results showed that the lexical task did not interfere with the auditory task and did not reduce the dual-task performance. Several explanations for this finding are proposed. The use of dual-tasks to measure listening effort can be affected by many factors. Additional research will reveal the particular dual-task methods that are best for evaluating compression. ...|$|E

A pretest-posttest control group randomized blocks design was used in this study. Sixteen transcendental meditators with three or more years regular practice were selected as the meditation group. Subjects with no history of relaxation training were recruited and 16 nonmeditators were selected to create matched pairs with subjects in the meditation group. Matching criteria were: sex, age, height, weight, current and customary activity level. Each matched pair of subjects was assigned to one of two groups with an attempt to balance matching criteria for each group. One group was randomly assigned to experimental procedures, the other group served as a control group.

Deci and others have been investigating a paradigm with human subjects evaluating the effect of rewards on intrinsic motivation (IM). He suggested that money causes a decrease in a person's level of IM for an activity when money is used as a reward for that activity. It could be argued that in the situations where people engage in behaviors without an explicit reinforcer there is an inherent reward: e. g., the reduction of a curiosity drive. In this case, a more parsimonious explanation of the results in terms of a Negative Contrast Effect (NCE) would be possible, suggesting that the extrinsic reward of money does not have a special effect on behaviors {{with a high level of}} IM. In the present experiment, 160 male college students were divided into 8 experimental groups (n = 20). During Phase I, each subject performed the <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>task,</b> then rated his interest in it. Based on the rating, the subjects were assigned to either the high IM or low IM condition, or were dismissed if their rating was neutral. During Phase II, in the first experiment half of the subjects were rewarded with money, and the remaining subjects received no monetary reward. In the second experiment, half of the subjects were rewarded with a relatively high verbal reward, and the remaining subjects received a relatively low verbal reward. During Phase III, all subjects received either no monetary reward (first experiment), or relatively low verbal reward (second experiment). The results of the monetary reward experiment provided evidence for an NCE in the low but not the high IM condition. The results of the verbal reward experiment suggested a trend toward an NCE in both the low and high IM conditions. The findings of NCE-like effects under the two IM conditions (monetary or verbal reward) could be explained by Amsel's frustration theory, and possibly by Deci's theory of IM. The failure to find an NCE under the condition of high IM and monetary reward could be explained by frustration theory, but was problematic for Deci's theory of IM...|$|E

However, task completion times indicated that dyads performed significantly faster than individuals, even though dyad members exerted large task-irrelevant forces in opposition to one another, and despite many participants’ perceptions that their partner was an impediment. A much earlier study of teams using a <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> (Wegner & Zeaman, 1956) found a similar performance increment. Since that study, there has been little research on physically coupled dyads (Sallnas & Zhai, 2003; Shergill, Bays, Frith, & Wolpert...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{experiment}} which examined the relative effects of hypnosis, exhortative instructions, and routine task-performance {{instructions on the}} performance which individuals who differed in their degree of hypnotic susceptibility rendered on a continuous performance task both under normal conditions and under conditions of induced stress. High-susceptible (T) and low-susceptible (UT) 5 s operated a <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> at room temperature and then under extreme heat. Performance of all Ss under stress improved after they were either hypnotized or exhorted to perform better; exhortation had a slightly but nonsignificantly greater effect. The initial performance of UTs was not significantly superior to that of Ts. Though the performance of Ts appeared more strongly affected by both hypnosis and exhortation than performance of UTs, this difference proved nonsignificant when subjected to conservative statistical test. The study of hypnotic effects upon different kinds of performance {{has a long history}} o...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{expectancy}} {{in producing}} perceptual motor-performance deficits following alcohol consumption {{was investigated in}} a 2 × 2 factorial experiment. Forty male normal drinkers (1) either were or were not administered 0. 414 g ethanol/kg body weight and (2) either were or were not instructed they were consuming an alcoholic beverage (regardless of actual beverage content). Performance on a divided-attention <b>task</b> requiring simultaneous <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> tracking and choice reaction-time responding provided the main dependent measures. Alcohol disrupted tracking performance and interacted with instructions regarding beverage content to influence choice reaction-time performance. Results confirmed previous reports of divided-attention task performance deficits induced by a low alcohol dose, but, more importantly, indicated that subjects 2 ̆ 7 expectancies also influence performance levels. These findings demonstrate the importance of controlling for expectancy effects in alcohol research, and suggest that alcohol and expectancy may influence perceptual motor performance through different processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} ethanol and amphetamine {{on the performance}} of selected tests were evaluated. No differences were shown between the effects of ethanol-amphetamine and ethanol-lactose {{on the performance of}} balance, skipping, Minnesota manipulation, Purdue peg board, Maudsley Personality Inventory, <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> or digit span tests; but ethanol plus amphetamine produced less impairment of performance of coding, mental addition, and trail making tests than did ethanol plus a placebo. Ethanol increased the errors in performance of the Wonderlic Personnel Test, but the simultaneous administration of amphetamine did not reduce this effect. Conversely, amphetamine reduced the test-retest reliability of the Wonderlic Personnel Test, but alcohol appeared to counteract this effect of amphetamine. These experiments indicate that, when ethanol and amphetamine are used together, each drug modifies some of the effects produced by the other in a manner that cannot be predicted on the assumption that a depressant versus stimulant competition is operative...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{reports have}} {{identified}} {{variation in the}} GABRA 2 gene as contributing to the genetic susceptibility to alcohol dependence. However, both the mechanism behind this association, {{and the range of}} alcohol-related phenotypes affected by variation in this gene, are currently undefined. Other data suggest that the risk of alcohol dependence is increased by relative insensitivity to alcohol 2 ̆ 7 s intoxicating effects. We have therefore tested whether GABRA 2 variation is associated with variation in the subjective and objective effects of a standard dose of alcohol in humans. Data on responses to alcohol from the Alcohol Challenge Twin Study (Martin et al., 1985) have been tested against allelic and haplotype information obtained by typing 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in or close to the GABRA 2 gene. Nominally significant allelic associations (p <. 05, without correction for multiple testing) were found for body sway, motor coordination, <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> and arithmetical computation tasks, and for the personality dimension of Neuroticism. Because of the large number of phenotypes tested, these possibly significant findings will need to be confirmed in further studies...|$|R
40|$|Effects of a {{standard}} dose of alcohol (1. 3 g/kg) {{in the form of}} Canadian rye whisky, Canadian beer and a sparkling table wine were compared with those of a nonalcoholic carbonated control beverage. Sixteen young male and eight female subjects, all moderate drinkers, were tested in a Latin square design. Measurements were made on the <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor</b> and quantitative Romberg tests, and of skin temperature, heart rate, malar flush and blood alcohol concentration during the prealcohol baseline period and at regular intervals over the 4 -hour drinking period. The three alcoholic beverages produced blood alcohol curves that did not differ significantly. All three alcoholic beverages produced increasing sensorimotor impairment over time, which corresponded in degree to the increasing blood alcohol concentration. There {{were no significant differences between}} the three beverages on either the sensorimotor or physiological measures at any blood alcohol value. The results of this study indicate that the degree of impairment after alcohol ingestion in a socially relevant manner is not dependent on the type of beverage consumed, but only on the resulting blood alcohol concentration...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{procedural}} deficit hypothesis of specific language impairment (SLI) by comparing children's performance in two motor procedural learning tasks and an implicit verbal sequence learning task. Participants were 7 - to 11 -year-old children with SLI (n = 48), typically developing age-matched children (n = 20) and younger typically developing children matched for receptive grammar (n = 28). In a serial reaction time task, {{the children with}} SLI performed {{at the same level}} as the grammar-matched children, but poorer than age-matched controls in learning motor sequences. When tested with a motor procedural learning task that did not involve learning sequential relationships between discrete elements (i. e. <b>pursuit</b> <b>rotor),</b> the children with SLI performed comparably with age-matched children and better than younger grammar-matched controls. In addition, poor implicit learning of word sequences in a verbal memory task (the Hebb effect) was found in the children with SLI. Together, these findings suggest that SLI might be characterized by deficits in learning sequence-specific information, rather than generally weak procedural learning...|$|R
