40|$|Owing to lags in the {{transmission}} mechanism of monetary policy, central banks put {{much weight on}} forecasts of the future paths of output and inflation. So there has been considerable recent interest in forward-looking Taylor-type reaction functions. Using publicly available data on the Monetary Policy Committees forecasts for UK inflation and output growth, 1997 - 2003, we examine how the coefficients in such reaction functions changed as we switched between ex post forecasts those published after, and incorporating, the <b>preceding</b> <b>interest</b> rate decision and ex ante forecasts those presented to the MPC before that decision and also as we vary the (forecast) horizon, out to eight quarters ahead. In our data set, the coefficients vary sensitively as the horizon/forecast basis changes. Our {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that the MPC tried aggressively to eliminate any predicted, ex ante, deviation of inflation from target immediately it emerged, with no apparent indication of intended inertia, or gradualism, in response. Nevertheless the time path of official short term interest rates during these years shows the usual record of consecutive similarly-signed small steps. ...|$|E
40|$|Working paper dell'Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Abstract In {{this paper}} we provide a unifying {{view of the}} main factors that interacted to produce the globa inancial crisis, {{inspired}} {{by the work of}} Knut Wicksell. We revive Wicksell’s theory in a different way from the Neo-Wicksellian approach that has produced the Taylor’s rule. Instead of refining for modern use the analysis of the Swedish economist we found it more fruitful {{to go back to the}} basics of the neo-classical. This suggestion arose from the observation of two stylized facts of the world economy preceding the outburst of the crisis: growing profit rates and declining real long-term interest rates. In terms of the standard neo-classical model this can be hardly explained by real factors as an excess of savings or shortage of investments. It rather evokes the problem, especially dealt with by Wicksell, of monetary and banking policies not tracking the movements of the return on capital and therefore fixing the rate on loans to such a level that the real long-term rate is below (as it was before the crisis) or above its “natural” level (as in the decades <b>preceding</b> <b>Interest</b> and Prices). The widening gap between the market real interest rate and “natural” one indicates a disequilibrium much more fundamental than that signalled by the short-run downward deviations of central banks’ policy rates detected by Taylor’s rules. Such a disequilibrium did not, however, put in motion the well- known neo-classical mechanism of adjustment- the “cumulative process” in Wicksell’s words- driven by inflation. It rather generated much more dangerous outcomes. It fed asset bubbles and pushed banks and other financial institutions to a “search for yield” to align their rate of return, that was depressed by low interest rates, to that of the real sectors of the economy. Thus, the “cumulative process” turned out to be highly destabilizing, spurring risk taking and leverage and at the same time global imbalances by bubble driven growth till the sudden adjustment brought about by the financial crisis...|$|E

A forest bench of Justices Aftab Alam, K S Radhakrishnan and Ranjan Gogoi allowed reopening of 27 category 'A' and 63 category 'B' mines, subject to conditions, including adherence of the reclamation and rehabilitation plans.

40|$|We {{established}} a tetracycline-regulated {{gene expression system}} that tightly controls expression of genes in Dictyostelium discoideum. The control elements are contained in two plasmid vectors, one being an integrated plasmid encoding a chimeric tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator protein (tTA(s) *). The second component is an extrachromosomal plasmid harboring the gene of <b>interest</b> <b>preceded</b> by an inducible promoter. This promoter contains a tetracycline-responsive element, which is the binding site for tTA(s) *. Tetracycline prevents tTA(s) * from binding to the tetracycline-responsive element, rendering the promoter virtually silent. In the absence of tetracycline, tTA(s) * binds to its target sequence and strongly induces gene expression. The kinetics of activation and repression of the system were monitored using luciferase as a reporter. The results reveal efficient inhibition of gene expression by low concentrations of tetracycline and an induction of gene expression by several orders of magnitude {{within a few hours}} after removal of tetracycline. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) provided information about the effects of modulation of the tetracycline concentration on gene expression, at the single cell level, using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).

30|$|Alongside these {{intrinsic}} {{limitations of}} occupation-level task measures, there are practical difficulties {{stemming from the}} design of the job content descriptors provided by the major U.S. data sources (DOT and O*NET). In both data sources, job content measures are often vague, repetitive, and constructed using ambiguous and value-laden scales that are likely to confuse respondents. 14 The DOT, which was first issued by the U.S. Department of Labor in 1939 and last revised in 1991, contains 44 objective and subjective job content scales. When the DOT was replaced by the O*NET in 1998, the complexity of the database increased by an order of magnitude. Version 14.0 of the O*NET database, released in June of 2009, contained 400 separate rating scales, which is almost half as many scales as the number of occupations coded by O*NET. These scales were not of course developed with “task measurement” in mind since the design of DOT and O*NET <b>preceded</b> recent research <b>interest</b> in job tasks. In practice, this means that researchers who wish to use these databases as sources for task measures are essentially required to pick and choose among the plethora of scales available, a problem that is much more severe for O*NET than for DOT. Researcher discretion again becomes paramount in this data construction process, and some transparency is inevitably lost. While I have found that task measures distilled from DOT and O*NET can serve as powerful proxies for occupational tasks, I am at best only moderately comfortable with these tools because their complexity and opacity places little discipline on how they are applied and interpreted.|$|R

Japanese interest in Taiwan studies <b>preceded</b> significant Western <b>interest</b> in the island and its diverse set of people beginning {{as a part of}} maintaining its own colonial interests there (Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1895-1945), and continuing in a post-colonial mode following the handover of Taiwan to the Republic of China (ROC) following its defeat in World War II. An early peak of interest by Western scholars in studying Taiwan occurred following the defeat of the Kuomintang (KMT) in the Chinese civil war and its subsequent retreat to Taiwan beginning in 1947. With China's Communist Party taking power in mainland China, the mainland quickly became off-limits {{for the vast majority of}} Western sinologists (exceptions included William Hinton, author of Fan Shen).

Following diplomatic shifts of recognition away from the Taiwan-based ROC towards the China-based PRC beginning in the late 1970s and picking up speed with China's reform and opening, academics once again began to shift their focus on China to the mainland. Western academic interest in Taiwan continued at a lower rate with a relatively strong focus on the politics of Taiwan-China-United States relations across the Taiwan Straits.|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} story {{tells us}} that since {{the birth of the}} discipline of sociology, the economic orientation of the discipline has peaked twice: the first peak was during the classical era between 1890 and 1920; the second peak was sometime after 1985, marking Granovetter´s Economic Action and Social Structure paper. We have tested this story by using all full-text articles provided by JSTOR between the periods 1890 to 2014 : this contains 142 040 articles and 157 journals. We used a combination of topic modelling (machine learning applied to text) and multilevel modelling (regression) to accomplish this. We have found the following. (1) there is strong evidence for the first peak, but contrary to this narrative, we also find a decreasing proportion of economic topics over the last century. (2) The rise of the new economic sociology as a sub-discipline of sociology, comes not {{in the form of an}} increasing focus on general economic issues, but rather in the form of a particular topic mix of organization and social-theory research. (3) We show, accordingly, that this particular topic mix reached its bottom and started to rise by the 1929; it peaked by 1989. (4) We suggest, therefore, that Granovetter´s article (and the new economic sociology) does not mark the beginning of a second peak – as the conventional story has it – but it is rather a product of a <b>preceding</b> sociological <b>interests,</b> innovations, and orientation towards socio-economic theory development. (5) Moreover, we discover that neither the classics nor the new economic sociologists contribute much to an empirical (applied) type of economic topic found in industrial relations and political economy research. In conclusion, the future impact that the discipline of sociology might have on economic oriented research in the social sciences, will most likely require (a) less of a within- and between disciplinary fragmentation that is most likely hampering the potential contributions sociologists can make; (b) more of engaging with applied economic affairs and thus bridge current sub-disciplinary divides. This is crucial in the age of austerity and if we seek to conceive of better socio-economic theories than existing economic theories. 1 Introduction 2 Literature background 3 Data and Methodology 3. 1 Data – the full JSTOR sociology data between 1890 to 2014 3. 2 Limitations of the data 3. 3 Topic modeling 3. 4 Multilevel modeling 4 Analysis and Result 4. 1 The topic model: validation, interpretation, and analysis 4. 1. 1 The first validation step: The word-over-topic distribution 4. 1. 2 The second validation step: The topics-over-articles distribution 4. 1. 3 The third step: Leading economic sociologists and their topic distribution 4. 2 Hypotheses and questions derived from the topic model results 4. 3 The multilevel modeling: analyzing the time-trend of the economic orientation of sociology over the last 124 years 4. 3. 1 Journal rankings 5 Discussion and Conclusions 6 References 7 Appendi...|$|R
