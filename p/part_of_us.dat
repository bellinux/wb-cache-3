5|$|In 1927, all of {{the current}} M-91 was {{originally}} part of M-66. A second usage of M-91 was designated from Rogers City towards Cheboygan County along the Lake Huron shore by 1930. It became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 23 {{by the end of}} 1940.|$|E
5|$|An {{automobile}} {{bridge across}} Ebey Slough and the Snohomish River estuary to Everett {{was completed in}} 1927, with funding {{from the state department}} of highways to complete the Pacific Highway (later <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 99, and present-day State Route 529). The city remained relatively unchanged through the Great Depression, with the diversity of industries credited for Marysville avoiding the worst of economic hardship experienced by other nearby communities. During World War II, an ammunition depot was built on the Tulalip Reservation near present-day Quil Ceda, later being re-used as a Boeing test site after the aerospace company expanded in Everett.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{completion}} of the freeways in the Port Huron area, the route of the business loop was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> Highway25 (US25). After the freeway was completed in the area, the former route was redesignated Business US25 (Bus. US25) in 1964. The US25 designation was decommissioned in 1973, and the former Bus. US25 through the area was designated as part of an extended M-25. In 1986, the BL I-94 designation was created, and the former BS I-69 was extended with it through downtown Port Huron. At the same time, M-25 was truncated to end {{on the north side of}} Port Huron.|$|E

5|$|DE 202 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 13 Bus. (Market Street) {{in the city}} of Wilmington, heading north on two-lane undivided Concord Avenue. The road passes homes and businesses {{in the northern part of}} the city. Concord Avenue crosses several streets including Washington Street and Baynard Boulevard. At the intersection with the latter, the road becomes four lanes and becomes a divided highway at the Franklin Street intersection. After passing under CSX’s Philadelphia Subdivision, DE 202 reaches an interchange with I-95 and US 202, where DE 202 ends and the road continues north as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 202 (Concord Pike).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{being part of the}} state highway system (as a portion of the unsigned Sacramento-Los Angeles Legislative Route 4), the road was also part of the National Park to Park Highway, a privately designated auto trail, and became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 99 in 1926. The continuation south via Saugus and the Newhall Tunnel towards Los Angeles, also part of Route 4, was added to the state highway system in 1917.|$|E
5|$|M-331 is an {{unsigned}} state trunkline {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan {{located within the}} city of Kalamazoo. It runs from the southern city limits north into downtown Kalamazoo.

M-331 uses streets in Kalamazoo that were once <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> Highway 131 (US131) before a freeway was built that bypassed the downtown area.|$|E

5|$|Officially {{designated}} on 1924-08-24, {{the original}} route encompassed all of current SH-9 west of Blanchard. East of Blanchard, SH-9 followed a more northerly route. Bypassing Norman, SH-9 ran north to Oklahoma City before going east through Harrah, Meeker, Prague, Henryetta, and Checotah. The highway ended {{at the original}} State Highway 3 in Spiro. Upon {{the creation of the}} United States Numbered Routes system in 1926, the section between Oklahoma City and Warner was overlaid with U.S. Highway 266. Four years later in 1930, SH-9 was truncated to Chickasha. By this time, much of the route had become <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> Highway 62.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century brought {{improvements}} to energy and domestic systems: electrical service {{was introduced in}} 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarII, the town installed a water system. The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 11, had led traffic {{through the center of}} town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.|$|E
5|$|The Bayshore Freeway is a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 101 (US 101) in the San Francisco Bay Area of the U.S. {{state of}} California. It {{runs along the}} west shore of the San Francisco Bay, {{connecting}} San Jose with San Francisco. Within the city of San Francisco, the freeway {{is also known as}} James Lick Freeway, named after the California philanthropist. The road was originally built as a surface road, the Bayshore Highway, and later upgraded to freeway standards. Before 1964, it was mostly marked as U.S. Route 101 Bypass, with US 101 using the present State Route 82 (El Camino Real).|$|E

From this interchange, MS 198 heads east into Forrest County on Hardy Street, a four-lane divided highway that passes several businesses. The highway passes {{to the south of}} the University of Southern Mississippi before ending at an intersection with US 49. Past this intersection, Hardy Street continues east as a four-lane undivided city street.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} highway along the general route of M-54 was M-10, {{one of the}} {{original}} state trunklines signed in 1919. Later, it was redesignated as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> Highway10 (US10) in the 1920s. After a series of realignments in the 1940s and 1960s, the roadway was given the M-54 designation in 1962. A segment of Saginaw Road through Flint was redesignated a business route in the 1940s that became Business M-54 (Bus. M-54) as well in 1962. That business loop was decommissioned in 1974. Previously, two other highways in Michigan bore the M-54 designation: a roadway that is now part of M-37 and one that is Bus. US2 in Ironwood.|$|E
5|$|The north–south {{split in}} Kansas was {{eliminated}} {{in the late}} 1950s, with the south route—which was to be US 250—becoming <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 50, and most of US 50N becoming {{part of a new}} U.S. Route 56. Another split was located between Athens, Ohio and Ellenboro, West Virginia from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s, when US 50 went back to its original southern route; that U.S. Route 50N is now Ohio State Route 550 and part of West Virginia Route 16.|$|E

US 1 Alt. was created in 1953 after US 1 was moved to a freeway between Morrisville and the Brunswick Circle. By the 1980s, when the Trenton Freeway was extended to its current terminus, US 1 Bus. was created onto its current alignment and US 1 Alt. was removed through Trenton and Morrisville.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} had brought about {{significant}} diversification in the area's industrial base.

In 1952 the Gulf Freeway, then <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 75, was completed providing a fast automobile link between Houston and Galveston. The new freeway, considered an engineering marvel at the time, greatly encouraged new development in the western region of the bay.|$|E
