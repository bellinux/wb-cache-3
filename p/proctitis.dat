25|$|Systemic steroids such as {{prednisone}} are {{not used}} unless <b>proctitis</b> fails {{to respond to the}} above treatments.|$|E
25|$|FI {{may present}} with signs similar to rectal {{discharge}} (e.g. fistulae, <b>proctitis</b> or rectal prolapse), pseudoincontinence, encopresis (with no organic cause) and irritable bowel syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal {{prolapse}} syndrome (MPS) {{is recognized}} by some. It includes solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, rectal prolapse, <b>proctitis</b> cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps. It {{is classified as}} a chronic benign inflammatory disorder.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative colitis {{is usually}} {{continuous}} from the rectum, with the rectum almost universally being involved. Perianal disease is rare. The degree of involvement endoscopically ranges from <b>proctitis</b> or {{inflammation of the}} rectum, to left sided colitis, to pancolitis, which is inflammation involving the ascending colon.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} {{conditions}} known as Mucosal prolapse syndrome (MPS) {{has now been}} recognized. It includes SRUS, rectal prolapse, <b>proctitis</b> cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps. It is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder. The unifying feature is varying degrees of rectal prolapse, whether internal intussusception (occult prolapse) or external prolapse.|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects of}} {{radiation}} therapy might occur {{after a few weeks}} into treatment. Both types of radiation therapy may cause diarrhea and mild rectal bleeding due to radiation <b>proctitis,</b> as well as potential urinary incontinence and impotence. Symptoms tend to improve over time except erections which typically worsen as time progresses.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} stage most often occurs 10–30 days later, but can present {{up to six}} months later. The infection spreads to the lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. The most frequent presenting clinical manifestation of LGV among males whose primary exposure was genital is unilateral (in 2/3 of cases) lymphadenitis and lymphangitis, often with tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy because of the drainage pathway for their likely infected areas. Lymphangitis of the dorsal penis may also occur and resembles a string or cord. If the route was anal sex the infected person may experience lymphadenitis and lymphangitis noted above. They may instead develop <b>proctitis,</b> inflammation limited to the rectum (the distal 10–12cm) that may be associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, and rectal discharge, or proctocolitis, inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12cm above the anus and associated with symptoms of <b>proctitis</b> plus diarrhea or abdominal cramps.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{colorectal}} cancer is significantly increased {{in patients with}} ulcerative colitis after ten years if involvement is beyond the splenic flexure. Those patients with only <b>proctitis</b> or rectosigmoiditis usually have no increased risk. It is recommended that patients have screening colonoscopies with random biopsies to look for dysplasia {{after eight years of}} disease activity, at one to two year intervals.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{therapy is}} with Mesalazine 1g QHS or Q3HS. Those with anal {{irritation}} or discomfort from the suppositories may switch to oral medications, such as sulfasalazine, Mesalazine, or Colazol, {{although they are}} not as effective as suppositories for <b>proctitis.</b> Maintenance therapy is not recommended for those with a first episode that responded to the Mesalazine. Steroid foam is not shown to prevent relapse.|$|E
25|$|Another {{condition}} {{associated with}} internal intussusception is colitis cystica profunda (also known as CCP, or <b>proctitis</b> cystica profunda), which is cystica profunda in the rectum. Cystica profunda {{is characterized by}} formation of mucin cysts in the muscle layers of the gut lining, and it can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. When it occurs in the rectum, some believe to be an interchangeable diagnosis with SRUS since the histologic features of the conditions overlap. Indeed, CCP is managed identically to SRUS.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Proctitis</b> is an {{inflammation}} of the anus and {{the lining of the}} rectum, usually involving the distal, or lower, [...] of the colon, including the rectum. Approximately 30% of ulcerative colitis patients initially present with <b>proctitis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract can be damaged following abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy. [...] Atrophy, fibrosis and vascular changes produce malabsorption, diarrhea, steatorrhea and bleeding with bile acid diarrhea and vitamin B12 malabsorption commonly found due to ileal involvement. [...] Pelvic radiation disease includes radiation <b>proctitis,</b> producing bleeding, diarrhoea and urgency, {{and can also}} cause radiation cystitis when the bladder is affected.|$|E
2500|$|Patients with {{ulcerative}} colitis {{usually have a}}n intermittent course, with periods of disease inactivity alternating with [...] "flares" [...] of disease. Patients with <b>proctitis</b> or left-sided colitis usually have a more benign course: only 15% progress proximally with their disease, and up to 20% can have sustained remission {{in the absence of}} any therapy. Patients with more extensive disease are less likely to sustain remission, but the rate of remission is independent of the severity of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Diseases {{affecting}} the rectum and anus are extremely common, especially in older adults. [...] Hemorrhoids, vascular outpouchings of skin, are very common, as is pruritus ani, referring to anal itchiness. Other conditions, such as anal {{cancer may be}} associated with ulcerative colitis or with sexually transmitted infections such as HIV. [...] Inflammation of the rectum is known as <b>proctitis,</b> one cause of which is radiation damage associated with radiotherapy to other sites such as the prostate. Faecal incontinence can result from mechanical and neurological problems, and when associated with a lack of voluntary voiding ability is described as encopresis. Pain on passing stool may result from anal abscesses, small inflamed nodules, anal fissures, and anal fistulas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{functioning}} of the anal canal can be damaged, traumatically or atraumatically. The resting tone of the anal canal {{is not the only}} factor which is important, both the length of the high pressure zone and its radial translation of force are required for continence. This means that even with normal anal canal pressure, focal defects such as the keyhole deformity can be the cause of substantial symptoms. External anal sphincter (EAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired voluntary control, whereas internal anal sphincter (IAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired fine tuning of fecal control. Lesions which mechanically interfere with, or prevent the complete closure of the anal canal can cause a liquid stool or mucous rectal discharge. Such lesions include piles (inflamed hemorrhoids), anal fissures, anal cancer or fistulae. Obstetric injury may tear the anal sphincters, and some of these injuries may be occult (undetected). The risk of injury is greatest when labor has been especially difficult or prolonged, when forceps are used, with higher birth weights or when an midline episiotomy is performed. Only when there is post operative investigation of FI such as endoanal ultrasound is the injury discovered. FI is a much under-reported complication of surgery. The IAS is easily damaged with an anal retractor (especially the Park's anal retractor), leading to reduced resting pressure postoperatively. Since the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions contribute 15% of the resting anal tone, surgeries involving these structures may affect continence status. Partial internal sphincterotomy, fistulotomy, anal stretch (Lord's operation), hemorrhoidectomy or transanal advancement flaps may all lead to FI post operatively, with soiling being far more common than solid FI. The [...] "keyhole deformity" [...] refers to scarring within the anal canal and is another cause of mucus leakage and minor incontinence. This defect is also described as a groove in the anal canal wall, and may occur after posterior midline fissurectomy or fistulotomy, or with lateral IAS defects. Rare causes of traumatic injury to the anal sphincters include military or traffic accidents complicated by pelvic fractures, spine injuries or perineal lacerations, insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and sexual abuse. [...] Nontraumatic conditions causing anal sphincter weakness include scleroderma, damage to the pudendal nerves and IAS degeneration of unknown cause. Radiation induced FI may involve the anal canal as well as the rectum, when <b>proctitis,</b> anal fistula formation and diminished function of internal and external sphincter occur. Irradiation may occur during radiotherapy, e.g. for prostate cancer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Proctitis</b> <b>Proctitis</b> is {{pain and}} {{inflammation}} of the rectal lining caused by infection.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Proctitis</b> {{has many}} {{possible}} causes. It may occur idiopathically (idiopathic <b>proctitis).</b> Other causes include damage by irradiation (for example in radiation therapy for cervical cancer and prostate cancer) or as a sexually transmitted infection, as in lymphogranuloma venereum and herpes <b>proctitis.</b> Studies suggest a celiac disease-associated [...] "proctitis" [...] {{can result from}} an intolerance to gluten.|$|E
50|$|Endoscopic therapies {{including}} argon plasma coagulation {{have been}} used for bleeding telangiectasia in radiation <b>proctitis</b> and at other intestinal sites, although there is a rick of perforation. Sucralfate enemas look promising in <b>proctitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Proctitis</b> is an {{inflammation}} of the anus and {{the lining of the}} rectum, usually involving the distal, or lower, 10 - 15 cm of the colon, including the rectum. Approximately 30% of ulcerative colitis patients initially present with <b>proctitis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Radiation <b>proctitis</b> (and {{the related}} {{radiation}} colitis) is inflammation and {{damage to the}} lower parts of the colon after exposure to x-rays or other ionizing radiation {{as a part of}} radiation therapy. [...] Radiation <b>proctitis</b> most commonly occurs after treatment for cancers such as cervical cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer. Radiation <b>proctitis</b> involves the lower intestine, primarily the sigmoid colon and the rectum and is part of the conditions known as pelvic radiation disease and radiation enteropathy.|$|E
50|$|Treatment for <b>proctitis</b> varies {{depending}} on severity and the cause. For example, the physician may prescribe antibiotics for <b>proctitis</b> caused by bacterial infection. If the <b>proctitis</b> is caused by Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the physician may prescribe the drug 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5ASA) or corticosteroids applied directly to the area in enema or suppository form, or taken orally in pill form. Enema and suppository applications are usually more effective, but some patients may require a combination of oral and rectal applications.|$|E

5000|$|Acute {{radiation}} <b>proctitis</b> [...] - [...] symptoms {{occur in}} the first few weeks after therapy. These symptoms include diarrhea and the urgent need to defecate, often with pain while doing so (tenesmus). Acute radiation <b>proctitis</b> usually resolves without treatment after several months, but symptoms may improve with butyrate enemas. This acute phase is due to direct damage of the lining (epithelium) of the colon.|$|E
