5|$|On September 15, 1955, the Bureau of Public Roads {{approved}} the Interstate Highway System spurs and connections in urban areas. Among these was a loop around the San Francisco Bay, soon numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) incorporated {{a number of}} existing legislative routes, including Routes 69, 108, 107, 75, and 74, crossing the Carquinez Strait on the proposed Benicia-Martinez Bridge and ending at I-80 near downtown Vallejo. The first <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> freeway north of the Carquinez Strait was at the I-80 cloverleaf interchange, built in the late 1950s when I-80 was upgraded through Vallejo. This was an extremely short roadway, beginning at Lemon Street, crossing under I-80 and Laurel Street, and ending at Reis Avenue and Cedar Street. In about 1960, it was extended east to the old highway (Columbus Parkway) between the cities, and was completed to the new bridge in about 1962, the year the bridge opened.|$|E

25|$|The {{revival of}} Hinduism from its nadir during the Kalabhras spurred the {{construction}} of numerous temples and these in turn generated Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional literature. Jain and Buddhist authors flourished as well, although in fewer numbers than in previous centuries. Jivaka-chintamani by Tirutakkatevar and Sulamani by Tolamoli are among notable works by non-Hindu authors. The grammarian Buddhamitra wrote a text on Tamil grammar called Virasoliyam. Commentaries were written on the great text Tolkāppiyam which deals with grammar but which also mentions ethics of warfare. Periapuranam was another remarkable literary <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period. This work is in a sense a national epic of the Tamil people because it treats {{of the lives of}} the saints who lived in all parts of Tamil Nadu and belonged to all classes of society, men and women, high and low, educated and uneducated.|$|E

25|$|The Sedition Act plays {{its part}} by criminalizing the doing of any act or the uttering of any words having a seditious tendency, and {{dealings}} with seditious publications. The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act ("MRHA") is another <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> legislative jigsaw. It {{was introduced to}} ensure that adherents of different religious groups exercise tolerance and moderation, and to keep religion out of politics. Minister for Home Affairs S. Jayakumar stated that the MRHA takes a pre-emptive approach and can be invoked in a restrained manner to enable prompt and effective action. In contrast with the punitive approach of the Sedition Act where a breach of the statute carries criminal liability, under the MRHA restraining orders may be imposed upon people causing feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different religious groups, among other things. Criminal sanctions only apply if such orders are contravened.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} been used as a tool for {{analysis}} on a number of issues. In September 2008, Slate published an article that interpreted The Big Lebowski as a political critique.

His most famous <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period was Underwater Swimmer, Esztergom, 1917, the only surviving work {{of a series of}} a swimmer whose image is distorted by the water.

500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor {{was originally devised}} by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, with his depiction as a rough-living and dangerous man developed through various pieces of concept art by Metzen. In an interview, Raynor's voice actor Robert Clotworthy cited one <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> concept art in how he decided to voice the character. The art, showing Raynor on a hoverbike and outfitted with futuristic weaponry, gave Clotworthy the impression that as Raynor was someone people [...] "wouldn't mess with", {{he would not have}} to raise his voice as [...] "other characters [...] shut up and listen" [...] or face the consequences. Clotworthy also stated that in the event that a StarCraft film was produced, he believed Clive Owen would be the perfect choice to play Raynor due to him [...] "being dangerous".|$|E

[...] Rater training also helps the raters [...] "develop a common frame of reference for evaluation" [...] of individual performance. [...] Many researchers and survey respondents support the ambition of effectual rater training. [...] However, {{it is noted that}} such training is expensive, time consuming, and only truly functional for behavioral assessments.|$|E

Though {{this was the}} form of music most {{commonly}} considered [...] "ragtime" [...] in its day, many people today prefer {{to put it in}} the [...] "popular music" [...] category. Irving Berlin was the most commercially successful composer of ragtime songs, and his [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band" [...] (1911) was the single most widely performed and recorded <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sort, even though it contains virtually no ragtime syncopation.

2500|$|This {{species of}} {{butterfly}} is uniquely named in that its common {{name is not}} [...] "butterfly", but [...] "fritillary".

2500|$|What is now Interstate 10 east of Los Angeles was {{generally}} {{part of the}} Atlantic and Pacific Highway, one of many transcontinental national auto trails. By 1926, when the United States Numbered Highways were assigned, the road across the desert east of Indio was unimproved, while the road from Indio west to San Bernardino (as well as various roads west to Los Angeles) was paved. In late 1926, U.S. Route 99 was designated along the section of road from San Bernardino to Indio, where it turned south along present State Route 86 {{on the west side}} of the Salton Sea. West of San Bernardino, US 99 ran to Los Angeles concurrent with U.S. Route 66 (via Pasadena) before turning north; this route to Los Angeles is north of the later alignment of Interstate 10. The <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> between San Bernardino and Indio was defined in 1915 as Legislative Route 26. (It continued south from Indio via El Centro to Heber; see U.S. Route 99 and State Route 86 for details. A 1931 extension took it south to Calexico on present State Route 111.) ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{his arrival}} in London, being demanded of sundry his friends what thing he had brought them home of that country, [...] had nothing left to present them withal but a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> black stone. And it fortuned a gentlewoman, one of the adventurer’s wives, to have a piece thereof, which by chance she threw and burned in the fire so long that at the length being taken forth and {{quenched}} in a little vinegar it glistered with a bright marquesset of gold. Whereupon the matter being called in some question, it was brought to certain goldfinders in London to make assay thereof, who indeed found it to hold gold, and that very richly for the quantity. Afterwards the same goldfinders promised great matters thereof {{if there were any}} store to be found, and offered themselves to adventure for the searching of those parts from whence the same was brought. [...] Some that had great hope of the matter sought secretly to have a lease at her Majesty’s hands of those places, whereby to enjoy the mass of so great a public profit unto their own private gains. In conclusion, the hope of the same gold ore to be found kindled a greater opinion in the hearts of many to advance the voyage again.|$|E
