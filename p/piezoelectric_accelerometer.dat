40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} Finite Element (FE) approach {{for the development of}} <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometers.</b> An accelerometer is simulated using the FE approach as an example. Good agreement is achieved between simulated results and calibrated results. It is proved that the FE modeling can be effectively used to predict the specifications of the accelerometer, especially when modification of the accelerometer is required. The FE developing technology forms the bases of fast responsiveness and flexible customized design of <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometers...</b>|$|R
30|$|The main {{components}} of the experimental apparatus shown in Fig.  3 are two <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometers</b> [2302 B, Showa Sokki Co. Ltd., Japan (one degree-of-freedom, 1.3  g), valid in 20 – 1000  Hz] and a vibration generator.|$|R
5000|$|Piezoelectric sensor {{velocity}} receivers {{are similar}} to a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometer,</b> except that {{the output of the}} device is proportional to the velocity of the transducer. Unlike the moving coil variety, piezoelectric sensors will likely require an amplifier due to the small generated signal.|$|E
50|$|Simply stated, the {{inherent}} {{properties of the}} piezoelectric accelerometers made it a much better alternative to the strain gage types because of its high frequency response, {{and its ability to}} generate high resonant frequencies. The <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometer</b> allowed for a reduction in its physical size at the manufacturing level and it also provided for a higher g (standard gravity) capability relative to the strain gage type. By comparison, the strain gage type exhibited a flat frequency response above 200 Hz while the piezoelectric type provided a flat response up to 10,000 Hz. These improvements made it possible for measuring the high frequency vibrations associated with the quick movements and short duration shocks of aircraft which before was not possible with the strain gage types. Before long, the technological benefits of the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometer</b> became apparent and in the late 1940s, large scale production of piezoelectric accelerometers began. Today, piezoelectric accelerometers are used for instrumentation in the fields of engineering, health and medicine, aeronautics and many other different industries.|$|E
50|$|Behind {{the mystery}} of the {{operation}} of the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometer</b> lie some very fundamental concepts governing the behavior of crystallographic structures. In 1880, Pierre and Jacques Curie published an experimental demonstration connecting mechanical stress and surface charge on a crystal. This phenomenon became known as the piezoelectric effect. Closely related to this phenomenon is the Curie point, named for the physicist Pierre Curie, which is the temperature above which piezoelectric material loses spontaneous polarization of its atoms.|$|E
5000|$|First, {{integrated}} circuit <b>piezoelectric</b> (ICP) <b>accelerometers</b> {{have a very}} high signal output, better resolution and the easy of two-wire electrical connections compared to piezoresistive technology. Mechanical isolation of ferroelectric ceramic accelerometers, coupled with an internal 2-pole filter available in an ICP circuit, is allowing <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometers</b> to operate successfully at higher G-levels than were previously achievable. Good design practices are allowing their elastomeric isolation materials to perform in a dynamically linear fashion within the accelerometers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometers</b> {{are used}} in many {{different}} industries, environments and applications. Piezoelectric measuring devices are widely used today in the laboratory, on the production floor, and as original equipment for measuring and recording dynamic changes in mechanical variables including shock and vibration.|$|R

A general system calibration procedure is proposed which allows the enduser to establish a real-time link between {{the energy of the}} received signals and the bedload transport phenomena...|$|R
50|$|Active {{vibration}} isolation systems contain, {{along with the}} spring, a feedback circuit which consists of a sensor (for example a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometer</b> or a geophone), a controller, and an actuator. The acceleration (vibration) signal is processed by a control circuit and amplifier. Then it feeds the electromagnetic actuator, which amplifies the signal. As {{a result of such}} a feedback system, a considerably stronger suppression of vibrations is achieved compared to ordinary damping. Active isolation today is used for applications where structures smaller than a micrometer have to be produced or measured. A couple of companies produce active isolation products as OEM for research, metrology, lithography and medical systems. Another important application is the semiconductor industry. In the microchip production, the smallest structures today are below 20 nm, so the machines which produce and check them have to oscillate much less.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of the commercial <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometer</b> came about {{through a number of}} attempts to find the most effective method to measure the vibration on large structures such as bridges and on vehicles in motion such as aircraft. One attempt involved using the resistance strain gage as a device to build an accelerometer. Incidentally, it was Hans J. Meier who, through his work at MIT, is given credit as the first to construct a commercial strain gage accelerometer (circa 1938). [...] However, the strain gage accelerometers were fragile and could only produce low resonant frequencies and they also exhibited a low frequency response. These limitations in dynamic range made it unsuitable for testing naval aircraft structures. On the other hand, the piezoelectric sensor was proven to be a much better choice over the strain gage in designing an accelerometer. The high modulus of elasticity of piezoelectric materials makes the piezoelectric sensor a more viable solution to the problems identified with the strain gage accelerometer.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of cable fault detection, a new structure of <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometer</b> was designed and analyzed in detail. The structure was composed of a seismic mass, two sensitive beams, and two added beams. Then, simulations including the maximum stress, natural frequency, and output voltage were carried out. Moreover, comparisons with traditional structures of <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometer</b> were made. To verify which vibration mode is the dominant one on the acceleration and the space between the mass and glass, mode analysis and deflection analysis were carried out. Fabricated on an n-type single crystal silicon wafer, the sensor chips were wire-bonged to printed circuit boards (PCBs) and simply packaged for experiments. Finally, a vibration test was conducted. The results show that the proposed <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometer</b> has high sensitivity, low resonance frequency, and low transverse effect...|$|E
50|$|Integrated {{electronic}} <b>piezoelectric</b> (IEPE) <b>accelerometers</b> are a {{class of}} <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometers</b> that incorporate an electronic amplifier and use a single two-pole coaxial connector for both power input and signal output. The devices are also known by proprietary names such as integrated circuit piezoelectric sensor (ICP). Compared with earlier sensor interface systems requiring a charge-sensitive preamplifier external to the sensor, {{the use of a}} single coaxial connector with integrated electronics gives IEPE devices their main advantages: small size, light weight, robustness and low cabling costs. Microphones and other vibration sensors are also made using an IEPE-compatible interface.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of instrumentation to collect real-time vibrational data from a quasi-steady state machine (a dry vacuum pump) for fault prediction diagnostics is presented. When simultaneous multiple data collection points are required on the same machinery, the use of conventional transducers such as <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometers</b> becomes impractical due to their price, as each needs an expensive associated charge amplifier. The use of inexpensive micromachined integrated micro-electrical-mechanical system accelerometers such as ADXL 105 has been explored here {{as an alternative to}} <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>accelerometers</b> for obtaining reliable and predictable data for diagnostics. Surface micromachined accelerometers are a new technology and their usage for vibrational analysis has been conservative due to concerns over increased noise levels and tolerance to high temperatures. In this article, it is shown that such concerns can be allayed. The time and frequency domain vibration signatures obtained using both types of accelerometers are compared. The study shows that ADXL 105 accelerometers can be an effective alternative low-cost high-quality solution for machine condition monitoring...|$|R

Therefore, datasheets of 118 accelerometers from 27 manufacturers of eight countries have been analyzed. Focus of the analysis were the parameters overload shock limit, measurement range, frequency response, resonance frequency, volume, weight, power consumption and operating temperature of both uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers. Accelerometers with overload shock limits in the range of 50 g to 200 x 103 g and within a measurement range of 2 g to 110 x 103 g have been analyzed.
