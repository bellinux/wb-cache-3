40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the availability of}} information from <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and other sources that would characterise the nature of accidental exposure to household chemical products to improve risk management. The DeNaMiC project was funded by European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and {{was carried out by}} the <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> in Göttingen, Lille, London and Prague, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the World Health Organization and the Health Protection Agency (UK). Method: The project involved developing an analytical tool to compare data on accidental poisoning obtained from the published literature, <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> annual reports and official mortality and morbidity statistics, and comparing and mapping the data collection and product classification schemes used by three <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> (Göttingen, Lille and London). A retrospective analysis of 3 years of enquiry data from Göttingen and Lille was also carried out to determine routinely available data on circumstances of exposure. European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> were surveyed to {{determine the}} availability of data useful for product risk assessment. In addition, an analysis of published literature on toxicovigilance and a survey of toxicovigilance activities of European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> was carried out. Finally, the project explored the feasibility of using <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> to obtain additional information about circumstances of exposure through a prospective followup study. Results: A range of publicly available data on accidental exposures was found; however, this provided little on the circumstances of exposure and could only be compared qualitatively. The product classification schemes used by three <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> showed some degree of comparability for household products. European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> collected the same base data set but varied in collecting data relevant for risk assessment. European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> varied in their understanding of ‘toxicovigilance’ but most stated that they perform it. It was possible to collect additional prospective data on exposures to household products relevant for risk assessment and management. Conclusions: <b>Poisons</b> <b>centres</b> are an important potential source of data useful for product risk assessment and management. In most cases, however, this requires additional work that needs to be resourced. Cooperation between <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and industry can contribute to improving product safety...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe {{burden of}} {{poisoning}} exposures in Africa {{is a significant}} public health concern, yet only ten African countries have <b>poisons</b> information <b>centres.</b> The establishment of <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> was subsequently identified as a priority. This article focuses on workshop discussions with international multi-sector stakeholders in Eastern Africa regarding {{the possibility of a}} sub-regional <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> serving multiple countries. MethodsThe project was led by an independent consultant under the guidance of an international steering group. Steering group members provided input at international multi-stakeholder meetings and during monthly teleconferences. ResultsParticipants of the stakeholder meetings agreed that the establishment of a sub-regional <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> in Eastern Africa was necessary and feasible. Virtual collaboration is possible due to recent technological developments, and the overall suggestion was for countries to establish their own <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and to network and coordinate these centres through a network hub. ConclusionA number of benefits might result from such a <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> network hub, including: (1) Improved cooperation between countries on poisoning problems; (2) Harmonisation and strengthening of research and surveillance; (3) Common standards and best practices e. g. regulating chemicals, data management, and staff training; and (4) Greater bargaining power to secure resources. Further investigation is needed to identify the most suitable location for the network hub, the activities it should fulfil, and the availability of specialists in poisons information who could become members of the hub...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} and strengthening of <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> {{was identified as}} a regional priority at the first African regional meeting on the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) in June 2006. At this meeting, the possibility of a subregional <b>poisons</b> <b>centre,</b> that is, a centre in one country serving multiple countries, was suggested. The WHO Headquarters following consultation with counterparts at the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and the SAICM Africa Regional Focal Point successfully submitted a proposal to the SAICM Quick Start Programme (QSP) Trust Fund Committee for a feasibility study into a subregional <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> in the Eastern Africa subregion. However, before such a study could be conducted it was deemed necessary to carry out a literature review on the patterns and epidemiology of poisoning in this region so as to inform the feasibility study. The current paper presents the results of this literature review.

As part of this project, a questionnaire on detecting medication errors was circulated to pharmacovigilance <b>centres</b> and <b>poison</b> control <b>centres</b> around the world, in order to assess their ability to detect and analyse medication errors. The results showed that through their databases pharmacovigilance centres can detect, identify, analyse, and classify medication errors and carry out root cause analysis, which is an important tool in preventing medication errors. The duties of pharmacovigilance centres in preventing medication errors include informing health-care professionals about the importance of reporting such errors and creating a culture of patient safety. Pharmacovigilance centres aim to prevent medication errors in collaboration with <b>poison</b> control <b>centres.</b> Such collaboration allows improved detection and improved preventive strategies. In addition, collaboration with regulatory authorities is important in finalizing decisions.

40|$|Objective: Within the European Union {{there is}} a mesh of rapid alert systems (RAS) for {{different}} hazards, e. g. food and feed (RASFF), dangerous consumer products (RAPEX) and communicable diseases (EWRS = early warning and response system). The abbreviation RAPEX stands for the rapid alert system for all dangerous consumer products, {{with the exception of}} food, pharmaceutical and medical devices. These systems link national and European public health authorities. Although the rapid alert system for biological and chemical attacks (RAS-BICHAT) connects national focal points in case of confirmed terror attacks with chemicals, there is still a gap for chemical hazards in cases of mere suspicion: in the future <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and the EAPCCT will {{play an important role in}} the process of exchanging warnings concerning these hazards within the European Union. The ASHT research project prepares tools for these important new functions. The scope of the ASHT I projects was the creation of an EUwide alerting system to detect covert release of chemicals with a criminal or terrorist intent. The acronym “ASHT” stands for “Alerting System and Development of a Health Surveillance System for the Deliberate Release of Chemicals by Terrorists”. In ASHT II this task expands to all chemical incidents. Methods: Description of political, financial, toxicological and technical aspects of the project. Results: In the first phase of the project, ASHT I, two major tasks were accomplished: the feasibility of both a rapid alert system for chemicals (RAS-CHEM) by creating DEV RAS-CHEM, a preliminary “developmental” version, and a European surveillance system between <b>poisons</b> <b>centres.</b> Like ASHT I the second phase of the project is funded by the European Commission, the EAPCCT and the other project members. The duration of the project is 36 months. In ASHT II several tasks will have to be accomplished. Firstly, the DEV RAS-CHEM draft version must be converted into an EU-wide operating rapid alert system for chemicals (RAS-CHEM). The data base must be accessible via the internet. The data base shall carry out the delivery of “chemical event” alerting. The member states’ public health surveillance authorities are to be integrated in the process. On the other hand the ‘EU PC Forum’ as a means of emergency communication between European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> is to be created. This includes the testing of a prototype toxicosurveillance tool using automated data sampling in <b>poisons</b> <b>centres.</b> Toxicological aspects include the refinement of lists of chemicals, symptoms or toxidromes as important bases for mutual data exchange. Concerning the information technology level, several requirements are to be taken into consideration: for the creation of an event and for retrieval functions an appropriate relational data base structure is essential. National Public Health Authorities of the member states of the European Union and the WHO are integrated into the project as associate partners. Conclusion: The early warning system for chemicals (RAS-CHEM) will be integrated into the suite of other pre-existing EU early warning systems in the near future. There is a chance that <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and the EAPCCT could upgrade their role for chemical alertness in Europe...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In the European Union (EU), {{notification}} of product information by industry to <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and/or competent authorities {{is a legal}} obligation for mixtures classified as hazardous. However, EU legislation does not specify the precise information needed for this product notification. As a consequence, varying requirements have been developed in different EU Member States. The European Commission (EC) carried out an assessment of whether harmonisation of product notification can be achieved. This manuscript {{provides an overview of}} the most important (discussion) points to reach harmonisation. COMPOSITION AND CONCENTRATION OF INGREDIENTS: Discussions have focused mainly on whether non-classified ingredients should be notified only above a concentration threshold and on the use of defined, narrow concentration ranges instead of exact concentrations for hazardous ingredients. ELECTRONIC DATA EXCHANGE FORMAT: All stakeholders agree to the development of an electronic data exchange format for product notification and identify the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) as the most appropriate format. EUROPEAN PRODUCT DATABASE: Instead of multiple notifications to national databases, the EC will analyse the benefits, feasibility and costs of a European product database to provide a centralised portal for companies to upload their product information. <b>Poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and competent authorities need to have access to this information. UNIQUE PRODUCT IDENTIFIER: A Unique Product Identifier (UPI) on the product label can unambiguously identify the product and its formula and links it to the corresponding notified product information. A procedure {{for the creation of a}} UPI by companies has already been proposed. PRODUCT CATEGORY SYSTEM: There is broad support for the development of a hierarchical product category system to facilitate statistical analyses and comparability of poisoning incidents in EU Member States. OUTLOOK: Following a 3 -year assessment period, the EC concluded that harmonisation of product notification is an achievable goal. In order to draft an Annex to the CLP Regulation concerning this topic, a new working group with representatives of EU Member States, European Association of <b>Poisons</b> <b>Centres</b> and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and other stakeholders will attempt to find consensus on harmonisation of product notification...|$|R
