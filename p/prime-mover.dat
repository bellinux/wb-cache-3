5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the <b>prime-mover</b> speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E

40|$|Involving the {{intrinsic}} power transmission torque/speed coupling characteristics of <b>prime-movers,</b> a rotating elastic connection disk subjected to periodically fluctuating transmitted torque and rotational speed {{generated by the}} fluctuation of external loads is investigated. Using Galerkins method, the rotating elastic connection disk is modeled as a parametrically excited gyroscopic system. The effects of the torque/speed coupling, transmitted torque fluctuation amplitude and frequency, and constant parts of the transmitted torque and the rotational speed on the system dynamic stability are explored for the disk modes possessing different nodal diameters. The rotational speed, transmitted torque and their fluctuations can all result in system instability of the elastic connection disk. The instability can be suppressed or avoided by operating at small amplitude and low frequency of the transmitted torque fluctuation, and by operating in the weakly coupled torque/speed regime of the <b>prime-movers.</b> Low rotational speed avoids the instability {{in the case of}} a small transmitted torque, but medium rotational speed operation is valuable to suppress the instability induced by a large transmitted torque and its fluctuation. Instability parameter regions for the positive and negative torque/speed coupling coefficient are roughly similar in shape, but there are some differences in the value of the instability coefficient. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The crank arm is connected to the walking beam by means of a pitman arm. The walking beam is supported by a Samson post and saddle bearing. The horse head and bridle are used to ensure that the pull on the sucker rod string is vertical all times so that no bearing movement is applied to that part of sucker rod string above stuffing box.

40|$|Vessel {{discharge}} {{and load}} jobs {{in a container}} terminal {{can be divided into}} sequences, one for each assigned quay crane (QC). A QC sequence lists containers in their desired handling order. The common practice for operators is to make do with just this sequence, without generating a job schedule (i. e. desired start-times of handling each container). Operators who need job schedules generate crude ones by using an average gross crane rate (GCR) gleaned from past experience. For realism, the job schedules should recognize the limit the maximum number of <b>prime-movers</b> and yard cranes that it can deploy. In this paper, we study how job schedules can be efficiently generated that maximizes the GCR (or equivalently minimizes the QC total make-span). With an effective algorithm, resources available to a QC can be adjusted, sharing with other QCs, to ensure that its job sequence can be completed by the target end-time. This would lead to more efficient use of terminal resources and good control on the overall vessel completion time...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{analytical}} description of temperature "elds and heat #uxes in thermoacoustic devices (such as refrigerators and <b>prime-movers)</b> is discussed. It is demonstrated {{that for the}} precise analysis of the thermoacoustic process near {{the edges of the}} stacks and the heat exchangers, and also for the prediction of the heat #uxes between the stack and the heat exchangers, it is necessary to avoid the traditional &&mean-"eld’’ approximation. In other words, on the spatial scale of the order of a particle displacement in the standing acoustic wave, hydrodynamical (advective) transport of heat cannot be described as a di!usional transport with an e!ective (depending on the acoustic wave power) di!usivity. In order to get insight into the non-linear phenomena, related to axial (along the stack) advective transport of heat, the simpli"ed description of the transverse heat exchange between the gas and the stack (the relaxation-time approximation) has been adopted in the present investigation. The analytical descriptions obtained of the temperature distribution and of the heat #ux predict, in particular, that in some cases the thermoacoustic heat #ux between two stacks separated by an adiabatic gap can increase with the increasing width of the gap.

40|$|The {{need for}} a {{simulator}} of the slow dynamics of multi-machine power systems is outlined {{and the development of}} such a simulator described. The program represents the dynamic behaviour of the generator <b>prime-movers</b> and the loads from the initiation of a disturbance such as a major loss of generation through the ensuing frequency and voltage variations until a new steady state is reached. The effects of turbine governing, turbine transients and boiler response are all considered. The known or assumed load variations with frequency and voltage are represented, the necessary busbar voltages being calculated by a fast load flow routine. Line flows are an important by-product of these calculations, and may be monitored to provide a check on the possibility of steady state stability or thermal limits being exceeded. The effects of automatic under frequency load shedding may also be represented. The simulator described has been verified by comparison with field tests on an actual power system, and has been used in several applications, including the evaluation of spinning reserve policies, an investigation of the effects of starting large pumped storage units in a small system and the selection of load shedding policy and the appropriate relay settings...|$|R

Introduction: Whole-body vibration (WBV) {{has been shown to}} increase muscle fiber recruitment during isotonic contractions. No prior published studies have used elastic resistance. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the acute effects of a single bout of WBV on electromyography (EMG) activity during exercise when using elastic resistance. METHOD: 30 participants (14 male; 16 female) aged 18 - 30 were recruited for this study. Surface electromyography (sEMG) activity was then determined while participants performed the arm curl and squat using elastic resistance under three conditions: no vibration exposure, during acute vibration exposure, and immediately following acute vibration exposure. Seven muscles of interest were chosen: gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, biceps femoris biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and lateral deltoid. Vibration was administered using a vibration platform (Wave®; ProElite, Windsor, ON Canada) at a frequency of 35 Hz at 2 mm displacement amplitude. RESULTS: Results indicate significant increases (. 05) in sEMG in all seven muscles of interest between the pre-vibration (control) trial and the vibration trial. Additionally, the vastus medialis, gastrocnemius, biceps brachii and lateral deltoid yielded increased sEMG activity immediately following vibration. CONCLUSION: These data suggest sEMG activity is significantly increased during WBV.

It then identifies episodes of high economic growth over 4 and 10 consecutive years in each sector in the state {{over the last two}} decades and derives plausibly optimistic growth potential of the state in future. In order to examine the feasibility of such optimistic growth targets, a preliminary attempt is made to estimate traditional sources of economic growth in Gujarat in the neoclassical growth accounting framework for the primary and non-primary sectors in the two sub-periods. Sources of growth acceleration are derived and implications of targeting substantial growth acceleration implied by earlier estimate of optimistic growth potential in the state are examined. In the process, the paper provides first estimates of capital stock, growth of land input, factor shares and total factor productivity growth for Gujarat broadly comparable and consistent with the national level estimates.
