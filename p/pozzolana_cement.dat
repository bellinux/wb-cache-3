40|$|ABSTRACT PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the clinical applicability of <b>Pozzolana</b> Biologic Silva <b>cement</b> (PBS(r)) in endodontic surgery. METHODS: Persistent apical periodontitis was diagnosed in 30 teeth of 12 patients by cone-beam computed tomography (CT). All patients had 2 or 4 affected teeth and underwent endodontic surgery with root-end filling. Patients with 2 affected teeth had one tooth (control) treated with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA-Angelus(r)) as a root-end filling material, {{and the other}} tooth treated with PBS (experiment). When the patient had four affected teeth, {{two of them were}} treated with MTA and two with PBS. Six months after surgery, all patients were assessed by CT scan. Between-group comparisons of measurements were performed using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: Periradicular tissue regeneration was observed in all cases. Significant within-group differences in long axes of the lesion were found in the bucco-palatal direction (PBS group, p= 0. 0012; MTA group, p= 0. 024) and coronal-apical direction (PBS group, p= 0. 0007; MTA group, p= 0. 0015) between pre- and postoperative measurements.

40|$|Self-degradable slag/Class F fly ash blend <b>pozzolana</b> <b>cements</b> were formulated, {{assuming}} {{that they might}} serve well as alternative temporary fracture sealers in Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) wells operating at temperatures of {ge} 200 C. Two candidate formulas were screened based upon material criteria including an initial setting time {ge} 60 min at 85 C, compressive strength {ge} 2000 psi for a 200 C autoclaved specimen, {{and the extent of}} self-degradation of cement heated at {ge} 200 C for it was contacted with water. The first screened dry mix formula consisted of 76. 5 wt% slag- 19. 0 wt% Class F fly ash- 3. 8 wt% sodium silicate as alkali activator, and 0. 7 wt% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as the self-degradation promoting additive, and second formula comprised of 57. 3 wt% slag, 38. 2 wt% Class F fly ash, 3. 8 wt% sodium silicate, and 0. 7 wt% CMC. After mixing with water and autoclaving it at 200 C, the aluminum-substituted 1. 1 nm tobermorite crystal phase was identified as hydrothermal reaction product responsible {{for the development of a}} compressive strength of 5983 psi. The 200 C-autoclaved cement made with the latter formula had the combined phases of tobermorite as its major reaction product and amorphous geopolymer as its minor one providing a compressive strength of 5271 psi. Sodium hydroxide derived from the hydrolysis of sodium silicate activator not only initiated the pozzolanic reaction of slag and fly ash, but also played an important role in generating in-situ exothermic heat that significantly contributed to promoting self-degradation of cementitious sealers. The source of this exothermic heat was the interactions between sodium hydroxide, and gaseous CO{sub 2 } and CH{sub 3 }COOH by-products generated from thermal decomposition of CMC at {ge} 200 C in an aqueous medium. Thus, the magnitude of this self-degradation depended on the exothermic temperature evolved in the sealer; a higher temperature led to a sever disintegration of sealer. The exothermic temperature was controlled by the extent of thermal decomposition of CMC, demonstrating that CMC decomposed at higher temperature emitted more gaseous reactants. Hence, such large emission enhanced the evolution of in-situ exothermic heat. In contrast, the excessive formation of geopolymer phase due to more incorporation of Class F fly ash into this cementitious system affected its ability to self-degrade, reflecting that there was no self-degradation. The geopolymer was formed by hydrothermal reactions between sodium hydroxide from sodium silicate and mullite in Class F fly ash. Thus, the major reason why geopolymer-based cementitiuos sealers did not degrade after heated sealers came in contact with water was their lack of free sodium hydroxide...|$|R
40|$|Fly ash {{is widely}} used as a {{supplementary}} cementitious material in concrete.

In addition to <b>pozzolana</b> blended <b>cement</b> production, it is very imperative to use raw fly ash in concrete.

Moreover, utilization of raw fly ash in special concrete such as self-compacting concrete is essential to comprehend the performance of raw fly ash blended concrete compared to ordinary Portland concrete. Additionally, it will help to achieve maximum utilization of raw fly ash as a supplementary cementitious material rather than disposal as a waste, which eventually leads to several environmental issues.

The interest for these soft pyroclastic rocks, widespread in many volcanic regions worldwide, is noticeable because they are often found alternated to stronger volcanic rocks in thick sequences, thus giving a significant impedance contrast that could increase the ground-shaking hazard. A cross-hole (CH) test and a spectral analysis of superficial waves (SASW) test, carried out from the ground surface and in {{the floor of a}} cavity respectively, provided in situ vertical profiles of the shear waves velocity. Cyclic and dynamic properties were investigated in the laboratory through velocity measurements of ultrasonic pulses (UPV), cyclic simple shear (DSDSS), torsional shear (TS) and resonant column (RC) tests.

The collected data allowed the analysis of the influence that mean confining stress, strain amplitude and number of cycles have on both shear stiffness and material damping.

40|$|Abstract—Numerous {{research}} findings {{have shown the}} cost saving benefits and potencies of using <b>pozzolanas</b> in blending <b>cement</b> without compromising standards. The use of artificial pozzolanas as Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) in concrete engineering is well established. In the continual search for substitute building/construction materials, the introduction of Rice Husk Ash (RHA) as a cementitious material in green concrete was investigated. The availability of this material provided {{the impetus for the}} study of the compressive strength of concrete using RHA as a partial replacement for Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). Chemical analysis on RHA showed it to have significant qualities of a pozzolana. A total of 60 cubes of 150 mm dimensions were cast with the percentage cement replacement by RHA ranging from 0 to 40 % while 28 -day targeted strength of 25 MPa was adopted as control. The cubes were 0 cured at a relative humidity of 95 to 100 % and temperature of 22 - 25 C in a curing chamber for extended periods of 56, 90, 120 and 150 days. The results and analysis showed trends of strength development, revealing a decrease in the density and compressive strength of samples with increase in RHA content. The 150 -days density and compressive strength of the normal concrete was 2459 Kg/m 3 and 77. 03 MPa while the 10 %RHA sample (i. e. best replacement matrix) had 2395 Kg/m 3 and 78. 79 MPa respectively. The strength of 10 %RHA/OPC concrete (78. 79 MPa) was higher than the strength of the control specimen (77. 03 MPa) at 150 -days; which proves that pozzolanas can produce concrete with close characteristics as normal concrete beyond age 28 -days, thereby making it a suitable green construction material. It can be a major cost reduction factor in rural housing and development; where buildings of less structural emphasis are needed.

The main objective {{of this study was to}} obtain a better knowledge in the use of zeolite-rich tuffs as SCM and more specifically the goals were to find the optimal proportions and to find possibilities to increase the reactivity of the tuffs. In this study, two different zeolite-rich tuffs and one calcareous siltstone were selected from the Chongon Colonche range. Although the zeolite tuffs show similar chemical compositions, they are different in mineralogy – one is a mordenite-rich tuff and the other comprised clinoptilolite, heulandite, and mordenite -. Additionally one calcareous siltstone, used as current <b>pozzolana</b> by local <b>cement</b> plant, was also chosen for comparison. This study was divided into two parts. The first part, which deals with blended cement pastes, is focused on the effect of proportioning on blended cement pastes cured under two different conditions, i. e., water and air curing conditions, in terms of compressive strengths and hydration products up to 91 days, using a water to binder ratio (W/B) of 0. 3, and without any chemical additions. In addition, an optimal proportion is explored between 5 and 27. 5 % of dosage under these experimental conditions. The second part, which deals with blended cement mortars, studied amorphizing treatments like heating and milling as an attempt to improve the reactivity of the zeolite tuffs, then incorporated into cement mortar at a constant proportion of 15 %. For two parts, the hydration Nowadays, the growing interest of using zeolitic tuffs as Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCM) is based on their significant availability, and that they contain meaningful amounts of reactive silica, alumina, and a high natural surface. All these characteristics make such tuffs a potential source of mineral additions in cement-based materials.

Moreover, big attempts on cement researches are straightforwardly focused one part on energy-saving processes to develop less expensive and more rdquo; cement, and other part on developingrdquo; cement to fulfill up-to-date engineering requirements. Thus, blending process could be, amongst others, a potential solution. It means that if the cement industry would add to current composite cement 10 % of mineral additions more, consequently a reduction of CO 2 emission could be nowadays about 8. 5 % (Taylor, 2006). Therefore,nbsp;use of local natural resources and/or by-products blended with Portland cements is an important topic of research. This performance should be fulfilled using the proper amountnbsp;quality of mineral addition (i. e. pozzolana, limestone filler, and so on); thus resulting in pozzolanic/composite cement designedto realize specific properties. Fragoulis et al (1997) reported thatzeolites as mineral admixture blended to Portland cement could be used as pozzolanic supplementary materials, thus achieving high strength at both early and late ages depending, amongst other, on which type of zeolites are being used. However, Blanco Varela el at (2006), Perraki et al (2003), Canpolat et al (2003) showed that shortcomings in zeolite blended cement could be found as well as constraint in amounts to blend. These shortcomings and constraints can possibly be related to how these materials would behave during pozzolanic reaction depending strongly on mineralogical composition, crystalline or amorphous structure, grain size, impurities, etc. The main objective of this research is tonbsp;the basic role that reactive silica and alumina play during pozzolanic reactions in cement paste under controlled laboratory condition taking into account the following factors such as curing time, curing conditions, proportioning, testing age. status: publishe...|$|R
