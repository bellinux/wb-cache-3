5000|$|Super Bowl ads in 1967 {{were sold}} for at $37,000 for a 30-second ad. For comparison, 30 second {{television}} advertising {{spots in the}} 2014 Super Bowl sold at up to $4 million. This reflects increased competition of national and international level brand names as well as developing interest and demand among viewers for television broadcast mega-events. The cost of mega event advertising spots are determined to some degree by the costs the network paid to air the event and generally, like regular advertising time, are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. However, prices can increase with increasing advertiser demand. Advertisers may pay additional for specific demands such as placement of their advertisement at a specific point during the progression of an event or at the beginning or end of an advertising break when viewers {{are more likely to}} be attentive to what is being advertised. Certain events also allow sponsors the right to brand themselves as [...] "exclusive" [...] event sponsors in television and print media for an additional charge. In general, advertisers are advised to divide television advertising budgets so that approximately 20% is used to secure a spot and the remaining 80% is used to develop the content of the advertisement. Networks may also offer advertising time packages in which much less desirable advertising time spots are offered in a package with the <b>premium</b> <b>time</b> spots that advertisers want. This allows networks to fill advertising space more cost effectively.|$|E

A puzzle for human capital theory. A part of this derives {{from the use of}} measures of time spent in education for the calculation of overqualification. Analysing data from four European countries, we split years of education into two components, one reflecting certification, another reflecting time. While a qualification higher than required mostly generates a wage <b>premium,</b> <b>time</b> does not. The result is that the combination of time with excess (or deficit) qualification may make overqualification either a major or a minor mismatch. The probability of either outcome varies with the institutional arrangements of different countries' educational systems. Overqualification Wages Comparative analysis...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} discrete-time real {{endowment}} economy featuring Epstein-Zin recursive utility and a Levy time-change subordinator, which represents a clock that connects business time to calendar time. This setup provides a convenient equilibrium framework for pricing non-Gaussian risks, where the solutions for financial prices are available up to integral operations in general, or in closed-form for tempered stable shocks. The non-Gaussianity of fundamentals due to time-deformation induces compensations for higher order moments and co-moments of consumption and dividend {{growth rates of}} the assets. Forecastability of the time change leads to predictability of the endowment streams and therefore to time-variation in financial prices and risk premia on assets. In numerical calibrations, we quantitatively analyze the compensations for different types of systematic risk. Risk <b>premium,</b> <b>time</b> change, Levy processes, recursive preferences...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between the volatilities of pricing kernels associated with di�erent currencies and the volatility of the exchange rate between the currencies is derived under the assumption of integrated capital markets, and the volatilities of the pricing kernels {{are related to the}} foreign exchange risk <b>premium.</b> <b>Time</b> series of pricing kernel volatilities are estimated from panel data on bond yields for five major currencies using a parsimonious term structure model that allows for time varying pricing kernel volatilities. The resulting estimates are used to test hypotheses about the {{relation between}} the volatilities of the pricing kernels in di�erent currencies and the volatility of the exchange rate. As predicted, time variation in foreign exchange risk premia is found to be related to time variation in both the volatility of the pricing kernels and the volatility of exchange rates: the estimated pricing kernel volatilities can account for the forward premium puzzle in an ‘average’ sense across exchange rates...|$|E

40|$|An ex-ante {{equity risk}} premium is the {{difference}} between the expected return of a risky asset at time t for a given future time horizon and an equivalent maturity risk-free interest rate. Using annual US secular data from 1871 to 2008, this study aims to model simultaneously the measures and the explanations of ex-ante equity risk premia for two polar horizons: the one period ahead horizon (i. e. the "short term" premium) and the infinite time horizon (i. e. the "long term" premium). Expectations being represented by traditional adaptive processes, large disparities in the dynamics of the two premia are evidenced. According to the conditional CAPM, each premium is at time t explained by the product of the price of risk by the expected variance of returns, these two magnitudes being horizon dependant. The expected variances depend on the past values of the centered squared returns (we found 5 and 8 years for the one year and the infinite horizon, respectively). For each horizon, the price of risk is determined by a spread of interest rates capturing economic factors of uncertainty and by an unobservable variable determined according to the kalman filter methodology (i. e. a state variable). The state variables are supposed to capture the influence of hidden variables and of non directly measurable psychological effects. The model gives a valuable representation of the "short term" and "long term" premia. equity risk <b>premium,</b> <b>time</b> horizon...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} trade unions in the US and the UK and elsewhere. In both the US and the UK, despite declining membership numbers, unions are able to raise wages substantially over the equivalent non-union wage. Unions in other countries, such as Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal and Spain, are also able to raise wages by significant amounts. In countries where union wage settlements frequently spill over into the non-union sector (e. g. France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden) {{there is no significant}} union wage differential. The estimates from the seventeen countries we examined averages out at 12 per cent. Time series evidence from both the US and the UK suggests three interesting findings. First, the union differential in the US is higher on average than that found in the UK (18 per cent compared with 10 per cent). Second, the union wage premium in both countries was untrended in the years up to the mid- 1990 s. Third, in both countries the wage premium has fallen in the boom years since 1994 / 95. It is too early to tell whether the onset of a downturn in 2002 will cause the differential to rise again or whether there is a trend change in the impact of unions. It is our view that most likely what has happened is that the tightening of the labor market has resulted in a temporary decline {{in the size of the}} union wage <b>premium.</b> <b>Time</b> will tell whether the current loosening of the labor market, that is occurring in both countries, will return the union wage premium to its long run values of 10 per cent in the case of the UK and 18 per cent in the case of the US. On the basis of past experience it seems likely that they will. ...|$|E
