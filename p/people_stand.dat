25|$|The Cherokee <b>people</b> <b>stand</b> at the {{forefront}} of language preservation. Upon learning that their traditional language was at risk, the Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home. This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language. The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used. Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation & Education Program (KPEP) on the Qualla Boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade, developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.|$|E

25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} {{the pros and}} cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of <b>people</b> <b>stand</b> in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, you count around the circle n times. Once you reach the nth person, take them out of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count around the circle the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if you view the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E
500|$|The {{secondary}} plot line, {{about the}} auditions for New Directions soloist at Nationals, was roundly criticized. Canning {{called it a}} [...] "faux drama", though he added that Jesse was [...] "a delight to despise", and VanDerWerff said it was [...] "completely ridiculous {{to do this with}} Nationals coming up" [...] in a week's time, and [...] "constructed almost entirely" [...] to make Jesse a [...] "jerk". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also hit on the lack of preparation for the upcoming competition and stated that it seemed [...] "like a very bad idea" [...] to be going without a setlist already decided on, much less with songs unwritten. He said the four audition numbers were [...] "awkwardly paced", though he thought they were [...] "fantastic"; Reiter said they [...] "stood out like glinting gems in a somewhat muddy episode". Canning and VanDerWerff also criticized the block of four songs {{in the middle of the}} episode which, as VanDerWerff put it, [...] "stops the show cold". James Poniewozik of Time was unhappy for another reason altogether: [...] "Having four <b>people</b> <b>stand</b> up and sing solos into a microphone may be music; but it ain't a musical." ...|$|E

The Gospel predominates in the Sermon. The Sermon usually relates to {{the lessons of the}} day." [...] After the sermon the <b>people</b> <b>stand</b> and the pastor says the Votum (Lat.

2500|$|A Chinese {{game called}} Cuju (蹴鞠), Tsu' Chu, or Zuqiu (足球) has been {{recognised}} by FIFA {{as the first}} version of the game with regular rules. [...] It existed during the Han dynasty, the second and third centuries BC. [...] The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period. This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600AD. In kemari several <b>people</b> <b>stand</b> in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie). The game appears to have died out sometime before the mid-19th century. It was revived in 1903 and is now played at a number of festivals.|$|E

2500|$|Prayer in [...] (jama'ah) is {{considered}} to have more social and spiritual benefit than praying by oneself. When praying in congregation, the <b>people</b> <b>stand</b> in straight parallel rows behind one person who conduct the prayer, called imam, and face the qibla. The imam is usually chosen to be a scholar or {{the one who has}} the best knowledge of the Qur'an, preferably someone who has memorised it (a hafiz). In the first row behind the imam, if available, would be another hafiz to correct the imam in case a mistake is made during the performance of the salah. The prayer is performed as normal, with the congregation following the actions and movements of the imam as he performs the salah.|$|E

I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of <b>people</b> <b>stand</b> and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance.
