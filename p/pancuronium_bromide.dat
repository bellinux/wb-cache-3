25|$|Opponents of lethal injection, as {{currently}} practiced, {{argue that the}} procedure employed is designed to create the appearance of serenity and a painless death, rather than actually providing it. More specifically, opponents object {{to the use of}} <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> arguing that its use in lethal injection serves no useful purpose since the inmate is physically restrained. Therefore, the default function of <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> would be to suppress the autonomic nervous system, specifically to stop breathing.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{administration}} {{is the most}} reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20mg/kg thiopental sodium (Nesdonal) in a small volume (10 ml physiological saline). Then, a triple dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug is given, such as 20mg <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Pavulon) or 20mg vecuronium bromide (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should be given intravenously to ensure optimal availability but <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> may be administered intramuscularly at an increased dosage level of 40mg.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{point to}} the fact that sodium thiopental is {{typically}} used as an induction agent and not used in the maintenance phase of surgery because of its short-acting nature. Following the administration of thiopental, <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> is given. Opponents argue that <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> not only dilutes the thiopental, but (since the inmate is paralyzed) also prevents the inmate from expressing pain. Additional concerns have been raised over whether inmates are administered an appropriate level of thiopental owing to the rapid redistribution of the drug out of the brain {{to other parts of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|Typically, three {{drugs are}} used in lethal injection. Sodium thiopental is used to induce unconsciousness, <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Pavulon) to cause muscle {{paralysis}} and respiratory arrest, and potassium chloride to stop the heart.|$|E
25|$|Typically, three {{drugs are}} used in lethal injection. An {{anesthetic}} such as sodium thiopental or pentobarbital is used to induce unconsciousness, <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Pavulon) to cause muscle paralysis and respiratory arrest, and potassium chloride to stop the heart.|$|E
25|$|The typical dose for <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{in capital}} {{punishment}} {{by lethal injection}} is 0.2mg/kg and the duration of paralysis is around 4 to 8 hours. Paralysis of respiratory muscles will lead {{to death in a}} considerably shorter time.|$|E
25|$|In total, opponents {{argue that}} the effect of {{dilution}} or improper administration of thiopental is that the inmate dies an agonizing death through suffocation due to the paralytic effects of <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> and the intense burning sensation caused by potassium chloride.|$|E
25|$|Several states {{continue}} to use the historical three-drug protocol: an anesthetic, <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> a paralytic, and potassium chloride to stop the heart. Eight states have used a single-drug protocol, inflicting only an overdose of a single anesthetic to the prisoner.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{the death}} penalty agree that the use of <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> is not {{absolutely}} necessary in the lethal injection protocol. Some supporters believe that the drug may decrease muscular fasciculations when the potassium is given, but this has yet to be proven.|$|E
25|$|Sodium thiopental is used {{intravenously}} for {{the purposes}} of euthanasia. In both Belgium and the Netherlands, where active euthanasia is allowed by law, the standard protocol recommends sodium thiopental as the ideal agent to induce coma, followed by <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> to paralyze muscles and stop breathing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Trade name: Pavulon): The related drug curare, like pancuronium, is a non-depolarizing {{muscle relaxant}} (a paralytic agent) that blocks {{the action of}} {{acetylcholine}} at the motor end-plate of the neuromuscular junction. Binding of acetylcholine to receptors on the end-plate causes depolarization and contraction of the muscle fiber; non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents like pancuronium stop this binding from taking place.|$|E
25|$|The Florida Department of Corrections {{does not}} publish its {{information}} about lethal injection, {{and so the}} only source available describing Floridaâ€™s use of the lethal injection death penalty comes from Sims v. State, which indicated that the lethal injection death penalty {{was carried out by}} first administering sodium thiopental, an anesthetic, then <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> which paralyzes the lungs, and followed lastly by potassium chloride, which inflicts cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|First a coma is {{induced by}} {{intravenous}} administration of 1 g sodium thiopental (Nesdonal), if necessary, 1.5-2.0 g {{of the product}} in case of strong tolerance to barbiturates. Then, 45 mg alcuronium chloride (Alloferin) or 18 mg <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Pavulon) is injected. To ensure optimal availability, these agents are preferably given intravenously. However, {{they can also be}} injected intramuscularly. In severe hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver, alcuronium is the agent of first choice.|$|E
25|$|Along with <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> and {{potassium}} chloride, thiopental {{is used in}} 34 states of the United States to execute prisoners by lethal injection. A very large dose is given to ensure rapid loss of consciousness. Although death usually occurs within ten minutes {{of the beginning of}} the injection process, some have been known to take longer. The use of sodium thiopental in execution protocols was challenged in court after a study in the medical journal The Lancet reported autopsies of executed inmates showed the level of thiopental in their bloodstream was insufficient to cause unconsciousness.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{administration}} {{is the most}} reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia, so can be safely recommended. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg sodium thiopental in a small volume (10 ml physiological saline). Then, a triple intravenous dose of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular muscle relaxant is given, such as 20 mg <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> or 20 mg vecuronium bromide (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should preferably be given intravenously, to ensure optimal availability. Only for pancuronium dibromide, the agent may also be given intramuscularly in a dose of 40 mg.|$|E
25|$|The {{drugs are}} not mixed {{externally}} because {{that can cause}} them to precipitate. Also, a sequential injection is key to achieve the desired effects in the appropriate order: administration of the phenobarbital essentially renders the person unconscious; the infusion of the <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> induces complete paralysis, including that of the lungs and diaphragm rendering the person unable to breathe. If the person being executed were not already completely unconscious, the injection of a highly concentrated solution of potassium chloride could cause severe pain {{at the site of}} the IV line, as well as along the punctured vein, but it interrupts the electrical activity of the heart muscle and causes it to stop beating, bringing about the death of the person being executed.|$|E
2500|$|Under Texas law, executions {{are carried}} out at or after 6 p.m. Huntsville (Central) time [...] "by {{intravenous}} injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death and until such convict is dead". [...] The law does not specify the substance(s) to be used; previously, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice the chemicals used for the lethal injection were the commonly-used three-drug combination of (in order) sodium thiopental (a dose which sedates the offender, {{but not enough to}} kill outright), <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (a muscle relaxant which collapses the diaphragm and lungs), and potassium chloride (which stops the heartbeat). The offender is usually pronounced dead approximately seven minutes after start of the injection process; the cost for the three substances is $86.08 per offender. As a result of drug shortages, sodium thiopental was replaced by pentobarbital in 2011. Further shortages of this drug have pushed the cost of the drugs to approximately $1300 per offender. Still further shortages of <b>pancuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (and the expiration of the existing stock) forced the state into switching to a single-drug protocol, using solely pentobarbital.|$|E
