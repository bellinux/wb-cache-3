40|$|The rate of {{occupational}} accidents in British agriculture {{is higher than}} in most other industries. The most common fatal accidents are those involving vehicles and machinery, falls from a height and electrocution. A substantial proportion of reported non-fatal injuries in agricultural employees is attributable to manual handling, but among self-employed farmers the contribution is much smaller. Few data are available on longer-term determinants of risk, but accidental deaths are most frequent in July, August and September. The main approaches to preventing agricultural accidents are through engineering improvements, and education and training of the workforce. The introduction of roll-over protection structures for tractors {{has been an important}} development in recent decades. Other engineering controls include guards for <b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>shafts,</b> guard rails to prevent falls, better handling facilities for animals and closed transfer systems for pesticides.

40|$|The {{conventional}} agro-waste disposal is {{a traditional}} and oldest method of waste disposal in which agriculture wastes are dumped {{as it is to}} degrade in a particular place for decomposing. As the wastes are dumped as such, it takes more time to degrade and it causes environmental pollution. The waste shredder machine aims to reduce the agro waste and convert it into useful nourishing fertilizer. It decreases the man work making the farm neat and clean. Also it reduces the heap amount of pollution, disease causing agro-wastes and produces a better fertilizer with vermin compost. The waste shredder machine is an attachment as like a ploughing attachment. In the shredder attachment input power and rigid support is provided by a KAMCO Tera-trac 4 W tractor by means of PTO (<b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>off)</b> <b>shaft</b> and three point linkage. PTO shaft of the tractor acts as a basic power input and the three point linkage provide a rigid support to the machine. Various kinds of blades are used for chipping and powdering operations like sawing blades, rotatory blades, and triangular shape blades. The blades are mounted on the shaft. The power is transmitted to another shaft by means of pulley and belt. For designing waste shredder machine, Creo parametric 1. 0 software is used...|$|E
40|$|Background: Agricultural tractor is the {{agricultural}} machinery which conducts several operations using various implements such as harvester, baler and trailer. Power {{from the engine}} is directly transmitted to driving shafts and PTO (<b>Power</b> <b>Take</b> <b>Off)</b> <b>shaft.</b> Power delivered to PTO shaft is transmitted to the implements through the PTO gear. The gears are components of transmission which transmit the power of an engine to a machine and offers various speed ratios, a compact structure and high efficiency of power transmission. A gear train design in the automotive industry uses simulation software. However, the PTO gear design for agricultural applications uses the empirical method because of {{the wide range of}} load fluctuations in agricultural fields. Methods: Therefore, severity analysis with agricultural operation of PTO gear using a simulation is essential to the optimal design of the PTO gear. In this study, severity analysis using a simulation proceeded in full load condition and real work condition (70 % rotary tillage, 30 % baler operation) during the rotary tillage, baler operation. Results: Simulation results showed the severity of full load condition was the higher than the real work condition. Discussion: This study secured the reliability of the PTO gear design through the severity analysis, and it also proved the feasibility of implementation of the optimal design by using gear analysis software. Conclusion: Thus, it is necessary to design the tractor PTO gear in consideration of the field data...|$|E

The study has indicated possibility of using carbon composites for typical aerospace component like a torque transmission tube with weight and cost benefits without compromising on the shaft dynamics. Experiments were also conducted to study the effect of ballistic damage on the composite shaft and also the damage tolerance related to misalignment. This effort has provided enough confidence level in attempting the replacement of existing metallic shaft by composite shaft for PTO shaft application...|$|R

40|$|This Alert {{described}} five {{cases in}} which persons were scalped when their hair became entangled around inadequately guarded rotating drivelines or shafts of farm equipment driven by <b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>offs.</b> Four cases involved women who were baling hay. In the fifth case, a 12 year old girl was asked by her father to check the bale counter. All five of the incidents involved inadequately guarded drivelines and victims who were standing or walking near rotating drivelines. The drivelines involved were guarded by inverted U-shaped tunnel guards that did not completely enclose the drivelines. The drivelines were located about 4 feet above the ground, limiting visibility of the hazard. The drivelines concerned were associated with Models 54 A, 54 B, 58, and 62 of a bale thrower manufactured by New Holland prior to 1976. A retrofit safety shield kit has been available since 1976 for these older models.

40|$|The robotic {{control of}} {{tethered}} parafoils enables {{a number of}} exciting applications, primarily a novel approach to wind energy generation. The airborne wind energy (AWE) paradigm aims to reduce greatly the mass and cost of materials required to generate electrical power from the wind. With innovative, distributed control systems and advanced materials, free flying tethered wings can replace the tower and blades of a conventional wind turbine, with the <b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> system relocated to ground level. The critical enabling challenge faced by such systems, {{is the development of}} suitable control system hardware and software architectures with robust controllers maintaining the safe and optimal operation of the system. Suitable <b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> methods form an integral part of AWE systems, as the mechanical power is produced on a periodic cycle. A holistic approach to the design, development and testing of a distributed control system for the flight of tethered kites has been undertaken.
