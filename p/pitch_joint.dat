As shown in Fig.  9, the wire pass length errors of the yaw and gripper axes increase rapidly when the pitch angle exceeds 70 °. Therefore, torque is generated around the pitch axis in order to extend the wire of the yaw and gripper axes. As shown in Fig.  17 b, because there are two wires (the yaw and gripper wires) through the <b>pitch</b> <b>joint,</b> the <b>pitch</b> <b>joint</b> angle {{is different from the}} wire pitch angle.

The {{composition of the}} Sn/Pb solder studied {{was found to be}} hypereutectic with a tin content of 65 [...] 70 wt%. This was determined by Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis and confirmed with quantitative stereology. The quantitative stereological value of the surface-to-volume ratio was used to characterize and compare the coarsening during thermal cycling from 0 [...] 160 C to the coarsening during annealing at 160 C. The initial coarsening of the annealed samples was more rapid than the cycled samples, but tapered off as time to the one-half as expected. Because the substrates to which the solder was bonded have different thermal expansion coefficients, the cycled samples experienced a mechanical strain with thermal cycling. The low-strain cycled samples had a 2. 8 % strain imposed on the solder and failed by 1, 000 cycles, despite undergoing less coarsening than the annealed samples. The high-strain cycled samples experienced a 28 % strain and failed between 25 and 250 cycles. No failures were observed in the annealed samples.

Although the {{equations of motion}} for the system were derived, the SimMechanics model {{proved to be more}} efficient to implement certain control and optimization techniques and is emphasized throughout the thesis. This thesis documents different attempts to control and optimize the various motions of the system using passive and active methods. The passive methods include extremum seeking tuning of two parameters namely the ramp length and wave heading angle to reduce the pitch angle amplitude at the joint connecting the ramp and T-Craft. The second method employed mimics automotive shock absorbers to reduce relative motion between each vessel and ramp to reduce overall ramp motions. In both methods the results concur with the goal of the problem statement of stabilizing ramp/vessel motions. Applying the ES algorithm to tune the ramp length and wave heading angle reduced the pitch amplitude by 67 % (from approx. 15 to 5 degrees) and applying the shock absorbers in the <b>pitch</b> <b>joint</b> case of the system reduced the pitch angle amplitude by two orders of magnitude (from approx. 10 to 0. 1 degrees).

NGLC demonstrates {{a reduction in the}} launch package of a large manipulator system while maintaining reach capability through deployment and retraction. NGLC is comprised of two telescoping segments, connected by three <b>pitch</b> <b>joints.</b> The segments consist of an inner and outer boom with a lock mechanism for either position. A rail network allows relative translation of the booms. NGLC bending and torsional stiffness requirements were met through the use of composite materials and adhesive bonding. Each boom features a centre composite section bonded to two aluminum sections using a stepped-lap joint. The elimination of mechanical fasteners maximized NGLC stiffness through a reduction of the clearance required between the telescoping assemblies and an increase of the inner segment diameter. Progressive damage finite element (FE) models optimized the lay-up and predicted positive margins of safety for combined bending and torsion load cases. Continuum mechanics analysis of the bonded joint was used to predict adhesive and adherend stresses due to the applied loads. A modular bonding apparatus with constrained relative adherend translation accommodated customized bonding processes for each operation. Steel rail segments were simultaneously bonded to the composite section inner surfaces, while the composite and aluminum sections were sequentially bonded. The joint and the bonding processes were optimized for bondline thickness control and minimum void entrapment.

40|$|Locomotion {{in uneven}} terrain is {{important}} {{for a wide range}} of robotic applications, including Search&Rescue operations. Our robot Momaro, which was developed for participation in the DARPA Robotics Challenge [1], features a unique locomotion design consisting of four legs ending in pairs of steerable wheels (see Figs. 1 and 2). This allows the robot to omnidirectionally drive on suitable terrain, while also stepping over obstacles too high to drive over. The legs have three <b>pitch</b> <b>joints</b> in hip, knee and ankle. Furthermore, the ankle can rotate around the yaw axis and the two wheels can be driven independently. All joints are Robotis Dynamixel Pro actuators. The leg segments are carbon fiber springs, thus providing passive adaptation to terrain. Due to the typically limited communication bandwidth, a suitable balance between autonomous actions conducted by the robot and teleoperation commands has to be found to allow robot operations to finish within acceptable time. Our system addresses this concern by autonomously executing weight shifting and stepping actions. The main environmen-tal representation used is a 2 D heightmap (see Fig. 2) created by aggregating the measurements of a 3 D laser scanner, maintaining an egocentric multiresolutional surfel map [2] and extracting the height information. In this representation, the system detects obstacles close to the robot wheels and automatically constrains foot motions to avoid contact. While the operator always retains control of the velocity of the robot base using a joystick, steps can be triggered either automatically or manually. The automatic mode always de-cides on the wheel pair which most urgently needs stepping for continued base movement with the requested velocity.

Specifically, we studied the problems of estimating the pitch frequency of a voiced speech signal and extracting the frequency components in a music signal. ^ Our pitch estimation research clarified some relationships among the existing pitch determination algorithms (PDAs). It also resulted in a few new PDAs: Firstly, a multi-channel PDA was proposed for use with speech data recorded using a microphone array. This algorithm jointly estimates the pitch and signal 2 ̆ 7 s time delay at each microphone. Secondly, a class of variable frame PDAs was proposed. In addition, we presented a new ML formulation of the pitch estimation problem. This formulation removes the singularity in the previous formulation caused {{by the number of}} unknown model parameters increasing with the unknown <b>pitch</b> period. Two <b>joint</b> <b>pitch</b> and spectrum estimators were derived, respectively, for the white and autoregressive spectrum models. Finally, we generalized these two estimators such that they can use multi-channel data to jointly estimate pitch, spectrum and time delay of the signal. ^ As for {{the problem of}} estimating the frequency components in a music tone signal, we proposed a phase interpolation algorithm for use in an existing music synthesis algorithm and a new analysis-based music analysis and synthesis algorithm. The proposed phase interpolation algorithm uses quadratic spline functions to model the phase track. With respect to the perceived sound quality, it is much better than the existing algorithm using the quadratic phase and is comparable to the one that uses a cubic phase. However, the latter requires more computation and storage space. ^ The proposed analysis-based music analysis-and-synthesis algorithm aims to improve analysis accuracy and increase synthesis efficiency of the similar algorithms in the literature. The analysis accuracy is improved by using a global waveform fitting approach to estimating the model parameters, in contrast to the frame-based Fourier transform approach used in the existing algorithms. The synthesis efficiency in both computation time and storage space is increased by using a quadratic phase model rather than the cubic phase model used in the previous algorithms. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{general idea}} of thermal {{reliability}} of the tin-lead (SnPb) solder and the tin-silver-copper (SAC) solder family is that the SAC solders give a better performance under thermal cycling conditions due to its higher creep resistance. Some researchers argue that the priority will be reversed in a more constraint situation. This statement is derived by the material properties of SnPb and SAC solders. Various creep constitutive models proposed by different researchers show that although the SAC solders have a smaller steady state creep strain rate than the SnPb solders when the stress is low, but their creep strain rate increases more sharply when the stress level increases. This results in a higher creep rate for SAC solders after the stress reaches to a certain level. This reversed result implies that if the condition at the solder joint {{becomes more and more}} constrained, the Accelerated Temperature Cycling (ATC) test performances of SAC and SnPb solders should get closer and closer, and finally intersect each other after a certain point. Meanwhile, some results show that in some package configurations in which the solder joint have a severe condition, such as CSP, chip resistor, and Flip Chip, ATC test do exhibit a better results for SnPb solders. But in these cases, the outperformance of SnPb solders mostly happened after they changed the temperature profile, for example, by enlarging the temperature excursion range. However, the temperature factor which will also influence the creep property was involved. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to connect the stress level and the ATC reliability performance of SAC and SnPb solders. And this is where the objective of our research work presented in this paper lies. In the present study, Sn 4. 0 wt. %Ag 0. 5 wt. %Cu (SAC 405) and eutectic Sn 37 wt. %Pb (SnPb) solders were used. A specific ATC test vehicle was introduced. The structure of the proposed package was one-dimensional in nature. Different Distances-from-the-Neutral-Point (DNPs) of the solder joint could be created by simply changing the solder joint spacing, thus different stress conditions can be produced at the solder joint. Based on this concept, two kinds of packages, plastic dummy packages and ceramic dummy packages, with various solder joint spacings were designed and manufactured. In addition, the plastic dummy package included two batches of samples with different solder <b>joint</b> <b>pitches.</b> After the assembly, the initial condition inspection was carried out. The selected temperature cycling profile was from - 40 ℃ to 125 ℃ with one hour cycle time. From the ATC results, it is found that, for the ceramic dummy package, the reliability performance of solder joint decreases with the increasing of solder joint spacing. For the 4 x <b>pitch</b> solder <b>joint</b> spacing samples, the SAC samples survived longer than the SnPb samples, while for the 12 x <b>pitch</b> solder <b>joint</b> spacing samples, the SnPb solder scores higher. However, for the plastic dummy packages, no obvious DNP effect is found, as the failure life does not always decrease when the solder joint spacing increases. This is due to the warpage induced by the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the silicon layer and the BT substrate. The warpage changed with the temperature during the ATC test, thus impose an addition mechanical loading on the solder joints. For the ceramic dummy package, no warpage issue was involved. Therefore, the DNP effect was clearly observed. The finite element analysis of thermal fatigue reliability of both plastic dummy package and ceramic dummy package was conducted. The one-dimensional nature of ATC sample was first investigated by comparing the four-ball model with the two-ball model and six-ball model. It can found that the solder joint equivalent creep strains of the three models are similar to each other. Therefore, the deformation in the transverse direction of four-ball model can be neglected. The equivalent creep strains of both the plastic dummy package models and ceramic dummy package models with different solder joint spacings were also compared by using finite element simulation. Similar results that the cyclic equivalent creep strain increases with the increasing of the solder joint spacings, but with different rates, can be observed. However, after converting the cyclic creep strain into thermal fatigue life using empirical life prediction equations, discrepancies between the accumulated creep strain and ATC reliability performance are found. These discrepancies are due to the uncertainties in the curve fitting parameters used in the life prediction equations...|$|R
40|$|We build robots {{that are}} meant to look and work like humans, with humans, {{inspired}} by humans. But many are the human characteristics {{that we have not}} yet understood, as humans are highly complex systems. One fundamental characteristic is compliance, which characterizes human movements. If our body was completely rigid, we {{would not be able to}} climb up trees or walk on mountainous paths as easily as we do. But despite being inspired to be a copy of human beings, humanoid robots had rigid links connected with rigid joints since their first appearance. It is only recently that they started to be more “human-like”, with the development of compliant actuators. In this thesis the objective is to analyze of the role of compliance in human walking and in humanoid robots motions. We model both the human body and humanoid robots as rigid multi-body systems. Both systems are highly redundant, reason for which optimization represents an essential tool to achieve our goals. In particular, we adopt optimal control approaches. In many state of the art compliant walking mechanisms, compliance is introduced at joint level by means of elastic components with constant stiffness, due to the difficulty of varying stiffness and the considerable dimensions of currently available variable stiffness actuators. This is the reason for which many studies focused on finding constant joint stiffness during human walking. However, biomechanics studies have shown that stiffness changes in human joints during movements. The questions we want to address are therefore: how does stiffness modulate during human walking and what is the influence of such modulations on the gait? To answer these questions, we used walking motions from motion capture data and a 2 D dynamic model of the human body, where the actuation of the leg joints are modeled with torsional springs and bi-articular coupling springs with variable stiffness. We computed the stiffness profiles of these springs, which showed how stiffness changes over the walking cycle and can also assume big values, contrasting with many state of the art walking mechanisms. We proceeded by analyzing how walking gaits are modified if the stiffness modulation is reduced. This further step showed that the original walking gait could be approximated in unconstrained walking scenarios such as level ground and slopes but not in constraint ones as stairs. This result demonstrated the importance of stiffness modulation during walking and can serve for future compliant actuators design. There are several existing humanoid robots with compliant actuators. Among these, the iCub is a widely spreaded advanced research humanoid that has recently acquired legs with Series Elastic Actuators (SEA). The reduced version of it, HeiCub, was delivered to Heidelberg University by the end of 2014 and is the robot used in this thesis. We first analyzed the motion of squatting. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem where only the three <b>pitch</b> <b>joints</b> of the legs are considered active and the whole-body dynamics of the robot is used. Squat motions for different objective functions are generated for the robot with and without the use of SEA. A step further is taken in using all the actuated degrees of freedom of the robot to generate push recovery motions with the same approach, also considering the SEA. As there is a lack of literature and experiments of iCub walking, for this complex task we aimed at exploiting the capabilities of HeiCub by measuring its walking performances. We used the table cart model to generate walking trajectories on level ground, slope and stairs, which have never been achieved before by other iCub robots. In this way we could gain details of the platform that were unknown beforehand that are fundamental to be used in future optimal control formulations. Thanks to this study, future developments of walking control frameworks for the iCub family robots have now a point of reference...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is a {{need for}} the {{prevention}} of upper extremity injuries that affect a large number of competitive baseball players. Currently available evidence alludes to three possible ways to prevent these injuries: 1) regulation of unsafe participation factors, 2) implementation of exercise intervention to modify suboptimal physical characteristics, and 3) instructional intervention to correct improper pitching techniques. Of these three strategies, instruction of proper pitching technique is under-explored as a method of injury prevention. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to explore the utility of pitching technique instruction in prevention of pitching-related upper extremity injuries by presenting evidence linking pitching technique and pitching-related upper extremity injuries, as well as identifying considerations and potential barriers in pursuing this approach to prevent injuries. Various kinematic parameters measured using laboratory-based motion capture system have been linked to excessive joint loading, and thus pitching-related upper extremity injuries. As we gain more knowledge about the influence of <b>pitching</b> kinematics on <b>joint</b> loading and injury risk, it is important to start exploring ways to modify pitching technique through instruction and feedback while considering the specific skill components to address, mode of instruction, target population, duration of program, and ways to effectively collaborate with coaches and parents...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design of}} a prefabricated sustainable roof system for LionForce Systems. While being economical, environmentally sustainable, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to assemble on site, the design includes a sturdy and durable roof-to-wall joint that minimizes waste, insulates the interior, and locks out moisture. In addition, the design facilitates a 20 -foot unsupported roof span and a 4 -foot overhang beyond the exterior wall, with allowances for variation in roof <b>pitch.</b> The roof-to-wall <b>joint</b> was successfully designed and prototyped with less than half the $ 1200 allowable budget using galvanized steel with Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) insulation. Executive Summary LionForce Systems, a panelized pre-fabricated home construction company, requested {{the design of a}} system to create a structural and environmental seal between roof and wall panels of homes, increase unsupported roof span from 14 to 20 ft, and support an overhang of 4 instead of 2 ft. A successful design is structurally sound, impenetrable by moisture, critters, and air, and allows roof pitches from 2 / 12 to 8 / 12. Roof pitch is the ratio of vertical height to horizontal span. To improve LionForce’s product, a steel roof-to-wall joint in an L-shape was designed and prototyped. The L sits on the wall panel, and both extremes are in contact with the roof, providing structural support and an environmental seal. The L joint is filled with pre-cu...|$|R
