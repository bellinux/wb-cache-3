40|$|Thea Astley aptly {{summed up}} {{a sense of}} Central Queensland's {{regional}} distinctiveness when she remarked that the 'real Australia doesn't begin until you are north of Rockhampton'. This chapter examines Central Queensland writing since the nineteenth century, and argues {{that it has been}} shaped primarily by the enduring influence of the bush ethos. While much of this legacy appears conventional and imitative, deriving in part from the city bushmen of the Sydney Bulletin, it has also provided writers with a starting point for a more original exploration of local and regional identities, especially in recent decades. Indeed, the regional preoccupation with the land and mateship both precedes and extends beyond the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bulletin</b> influence from the 1890 s to the Second World War. Rather than assuming that the 'bush ethos' constitutes a monolithic set of literary conventions, this chapter seeks to identify different strands, pastoral and proletarian, that enjoyed influence at different periods. Finally, this analysis constitutes a reassessment and revision ofthe national legend through the lens of contemporary regional writing from Central Queensland...|$|E
30|$|Using Eq. 1, {{the impact}} of the {{accuracy}} of the polar motion on the UT 1 -UTC estimation was studied with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations were carried out by adding offsets to the a priori polar motion from C 04. These offsets were determined by drawing random values from a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation that is equal to the uncertainty stated in Eq. 1. The prediction <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bulletin</b> A was divided into 24 time steps of each 0.25 day between 0.25 and 6 days. Additionally, the 1 -day prediction period for the daily solution was further divided into 0.0625 day steps. In the Monte Carlo simulations, for each of the 1669 sessions, a random offset value for the polar motion was determined 20 times for each time step, and successively UT 1 -UTC was estimated from analysis of the session. This resulted in that more than 1, 200, 000 analyses were performed. A WRMS of the UT 1 -UTC residuals w.r.t. C 04 was computed for each of the 20 runs per time step. These 20 WRMS values were then averaged, thus yielding a total of 36 averaged WRMS values, and their standard deviations were computed to represent a measure of uncertainty.|$|E

5000|$|An {{investigation}} {{was set on}} foot in September 1808, and a succession of four hours' watches, undertaken by the chief inhabitants of the district, was arranged to cover a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> sixteen days. <b>Bulletins</b> were posted {{from time to time}} in Tutbury, to record progress, and a list of the watchers was published.
