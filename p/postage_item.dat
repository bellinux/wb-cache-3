2500|$|The U.S. Parcel Post stamps of 191213 {{were the}} first such stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office Department and {{consisted}} of twelve denominations to pay the postage on parcels weighing 16 ounces and more, with each denomination printed in the same color of [...] "carmine-rose". Their border design was similar while each denomination of stamp bore its own distinctive image in the vignette. Unlike regular <b>postage</b> <b>items,</b> whose rates were determined by weight in ounces, Parcel Post rates were determined and measured by increments in pounds. The new stamps were soon widely used by industry, farmers and others who lived in rural areas. Partly owing to some confusion involving their usage, their exclusive use as Parcel Post stamps proved short lived, as regular postage stamps were soon allowed {{to be used to}} pay parcel postage rates.|$|R

They were semi-official - the Post Office tolerated them, but insisted that mail carry regular stamps as well. The stamps were large, inscribed [...] "RODGERS AERIAL POST" [...] and [...] "VIN FIZ FLYER", {{with a picture of}} the airplane in the center. It is believed that they were ordered by Cal's brother, Robert S. Rodgers, from a printer in Kansas City, Missouri, and they were probably first available around October 14.|$|R

Philatelic bureaus were established in head post offices located at circle headquarters and at district-capital head post offices (as necessary). There are 68 philately bureaus and 1111 philatelic counters, including all head post offices (Mukhya Dak Ghars) in the country as of 31 March 2011. A domestic philatelic deposit-account system was introduced on 1 August 1965 at all philatelic bureaus. Customers are given priority in purchasing commemorative or special-issue stamps, first-day covers and information sheets soon after their issue by opening a deposit account at any philatelic bureau. The number of philately deposit-accountholders grew from 23,905 in 1999-2000 to 168,282 in 2006-2007 and 183,202 in 2008-2009. Four philatelic Bureaus—the Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Parliament Street, New Delhi GPOs are authorized to sell United Nations stamps. A quarterly philatelic magazine, Philapost, was launched in 2008.|$|R
