40|$|Renewable {{resources}} {{related to}} biomass, waste materials and recycled materials {{are an important}} concept in the principles of green chemistry, development of biorefineries and sustainability development. This thesis reports the repurposing of renewable resources which included wheat straw, biomass ash, waste cardboard (paper) and paper de-inking residues (DIR) to extract, synthesize and produce potentially high value chemicals, materials and composites. Biosilicate solutions were successfully extracted from biomass ash including wheat straw ash and miscanthus ash with aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions. Systematic analyses had been applied on the extraction of biosilicate solutions to obtain different types of silicate solutions for further applications of binder and mesoporous materials. Biosilicate solutions extracted from miscanthus ash were utilized as binders to make bioboards, whilst biosilicate solutions extracted from wheat straw ash were utilized as a silica resource to synthesize biobased mesoporous materials, namely bio-MCM- 41 and bio-SBA- 15. N 2 porosimetry analysis revealed that mesoporous silica made from biosilicate solutions gave a surface area of bio-MCM- 41 of > 1000 m 2 g- 1 and a surface area of > 800 m 2 g- 1 for bio-SBA- 15. XRD, SEM and TEM analyses for both bio-MCM- 41 and bio-SBA- 15 revealed significant ordering pores, structure and the hexagonal arrays. Different kinds of renewable resources including wheat straw, pea <b>pod</b> <b>waste</b> and paper de-inking residue with the binder of biosilicate solutions and other chemical additives such as protein and starch were processed to bioboards. Also, wheat straw powder was added into cardboard/paper sheets to decrease the cost of paper manufacture and to improve mechanical properties. De-waxed wheat straw cardboard/paper sheets was successfully incorporated in to paper pulp to give a tensile index of 30 - 34 Nm/g similar with respect to conventional cardboard paper (tensile index of 30 - 32 Nm/g). A brief study to elicit sugars {{to the surface of}} cardboard/paper thus producing an in-situ sticky surface using low temperature microwave irradiation was conducted. Although it’s not conclusive, an aqueous fraction was expelled that contains organic matter (based on C-H stretch absorption bands noted in FT-IR), which may be due to sugars. ...|$|E

30|$|Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) {{is one of}} the key {{economic}} crops {{cultivated in}} Nigeria. As the third largest producer of cocoa in Africa and one of the highest cocoa producer in the world, the production capacity of Nigeria was reported to have reached about 385, 000 tonnes per annum on the cultivable area of 966, 000  ha with an appreciable increase of about 215, 000 from year 2000 production level [25, 26]. The implication of this is that as the cocoa production industry is expanding, so also the cocoa pod husk (CPH) which is the by-product of cocoa processing that account for 52 to 76  % of the cocoa pod wet weight [27]. Cocoa is the principal ingredient of chocolate and other derived products such as cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, cocoa cake and cocoa powder, whereas the abundantly produced cocoa <b>pod</b> husks as <b>waste</b> in cocoa plantations during the extraction of cocoa beans are often discarded as of no market value.

To minimize the negative impact of the husks and to obtain added value an effort to develop the husk into granule fertilizer has been carried out. Fresh cocoa pod husk was hulled to obtain organic paste, then mixed with 5 % zeolite and 5 % rock phosphate powder (w/w). The mixture was kept for 2 weeks prior to granulation. The granules were characterized for their physical and chemical properties. Agronomic tests of the granules were conducted on coffee and cocoa seedlings as indicator plants. The tests were set according to completely randomized design and the treatments were arranged factorially. The evaluated treatments consisted of rates of granules and rates of inorganic fertilizer applications. The granules were applied at 7 levels: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 g/seedling. The granule treatments were combined with application of inorganic compound fertilizer at rates of 0 and 2 g fertilizer/application of N-P-K compound fertilizer of 15 - 15 - 15. The inorganic fertilizers were applied four times during experiment. The results indicated that the granule has high water holding capacity; cations exchange capacity, and high content of organic carbon and phosphorus. The growth of coffee and cocoa seedlings increased due to application of granules derived from cocoa pod husk. Responses of coffee and cocoa seedlings to granule application conformed to quadratic equations. The optimum application rate of granules was 14. 5 g/seedling for Robusta coffee seedlings and 14. 6 g/seedling for cocoa seedlings. Granule application may replaced role of inorganic fertilizer to increase growth of cocoa and coffee seedling.
