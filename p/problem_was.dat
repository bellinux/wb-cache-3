5|$|There {{were some}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{compounded by the fact}} that they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E

5|$|A major <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that {{of loss of}} feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the {{feed material}} became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{outbreak of}} colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight {{to the rest}} of the UK in 1906. These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, but at the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> similarly mysterious and unknown.|$|E
5|$|After five {{successful}} seasons, Chris Carter {{wanted to}} tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film.

5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds {{were brought to the}} site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music to cover this gap. In subsequent years this <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.|$|E

40|$|A Eulerian {{approach}} {{is applied to}} the finite element modelling of neo-Hookean rubber material. Two major <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> encountered. The first <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the construction of a n algorithm to calculate stresses in the rubber material from velocities instead of displacements. This <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> solved with a n algorithm based on the definition of the velocity gradient. The second <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the convection of stresses through the finite element mesh. This <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> solved by adapting the so-called Taylor-Galerkin technique. Solutions for both <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> implemented in a finite element program and their validity is shown by test problems.

5|$|By 2000, {{deliveries}} were delayed, and in June all trams {{were taken}} out of service for three weeks to modify the gearboxes. In October, ten of thirteen trams {{were taken out}} of service due to radial run-out. The <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> large enough that some trams got a new radial run-out the day after they were fixed. From 6 January 2001, SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, and from 6 February, on the Ekeberg Line. However, the latter still had too short platforms.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The cause of the <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E

5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E
