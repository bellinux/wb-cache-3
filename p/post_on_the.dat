5|$|By 1300, the Levant {{was entirely}} in Mamluk hands and divided into several {{province}}s. Lajjun {{became the center}} of a nahiya (subdistrict) in the province of Safad, encompassing the villages of al-Ashir, Kawkab al-Hawa, and Jenin. The Mamluks fortified it in the 15th century and the town became a major staging <b>post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> postal route (braid) between Egypt and Damascus.|$|E

Comeford, an Irish immigrant who {{had served in the}} Civil War, and his wife Maria as a trading <b>post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tulalip Indian Reservation. The reservation, located to the west of modern-day Marysville, {{was established}} by the Point Elliot Treaty of 1855, signed by local Native American tribes and territorial governor Isaac Stevens at modern-day Mukilteo. The treaty's signing opened most of Snohomish County to American settlement and commercial activities, including logging, fishing and trapping.|$|E

5|$|Michael Armstrong {{was born}} into an Irish {{traveller}} family in Longford, Ireland.

5|$|Abir re-established their {{headquarters}} at Basankusu in 1893 and its {{position at the}} confluence of the Maringa and Lopori allowed Abir to expand along the rivers and their tributaries, establishing new posts along the way. Progress was slow as the Free State's activities had made the population in the west hostile to colonisation and the east remained in the control of the Manyema and the Zanzibari slavers. The company's first <b>post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lopori River had to be relocated because of threats from locals and rubber collection at Befori began only after a series of bloody conflicts between the villagers and Abir's men.|$|E
5|$|After a Ministry of Supply {{security}} officer {{working at the}} project is shot dead, M assigns Bond to replace him and also to investigate what {{has been going on}} at the missile-building base, located between Dover and Deal on the south coast of England. All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his <b>post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer working undercover as Drax's personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, concluding that the man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast.|$|E

When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 18th Century, French traders first began {{trade with the}} Akokisa and the nearby Bidai tribes for furs. In 1754 several traders {{including}} Joseph Blancpain established a trading <b>post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Trinity River a {{just north of the}} bay, near modern Wallisville. Spanish authorities quickly seized the post and transformed it into the San Augustín de Ahumada fort. They named the site El Orcoquisac and established a Catholic mission. The Spanish were not successful in maintaining trade with the natives and the post was abandoned within a few years. Encroachment by Spanish as well as U.S. settlers continued such {{that by the end of}} the century native populations had declined dramatically due to disease and territorial pressures from the Europeans.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, trader Ebenezer Barnette sailed up Alaska's Tanana River {{in hopes}} of {{establishing}} a trading <b>post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trail connecting the coastal town of Valdez with the gold-mining community of Eagle. Due to low water, however, the steamboat Barnette chartered was unable to continue up the river. Discouraged, Barnette deposited his cache of goods on a riverbank of the Chena River and sailed downstream {{with the intent of}} making another attempt to sail up the river during the following year. In 1902, miner Felix Pedro struck gold at a spot about 15 miles north of the spot where Barnette left his supplies. Seeing an opportunity, Barnette decided to establish a trading post at the spot. Other miners and suppliers arrived, attracted by the gold, and Barnette named the settlement Fairbanks, after Indiana Senator and later Vice President of the United States Charles W. Fairbanks.|$|E

5|$|On 27 July 1915, {{after two}} weeks in reserve, the {{battalion}} relieved the 12th Battalion at Tasmanian <b>Post,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right on the Australian front line. On 31 July, a party of around 200 men led by Leane were ordered to capture a section of Turkish trenches {{in front of the}} battalion's position. After engineers detonated three mines prepared near Turkish communications trenches, the storming party captured the Turkish trench following a bayonet charge, with the loss of one officer and 36 other ranks killed. Seventy-three other members of the battalion were wounded during the attack, including Leane, who was mentioned in despatches. Turkish casualties were estimated by the battalion to be 60 killed.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October 1914, the {{hospital}} ship Rohilla was sunk, hitting the rocks {{within sight of}} shore just off Whitby at Saltwick Bay. Of the 229 people on board, 85 {{lost their lives in}} the disaster; most are buried in the churchyard at Whitby. In a raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914, the town was shelled by the German battlecruisers Von der Tann and Derfflinger. In the final assault on the Yorkshire coast the ships aimed their guns at the signal <b>post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> end of the headland. Whitby Abbey sustained considerable damage in the attack which lasted ten minutes. The German squadron responsible for the strike escaped despite attempts made by the Royal Navy.|$|E

5|$|Seventy years later, the French {{explorer}} Samuel de Champlain {{reported that}} the StLawrence Iroquoians and their settlements had disappeared altogether from the StLawrence valley. This {{is believed to be}} due to outmigration, epidemics of European diseases, or intertribal wars. In 1611 Champlain established a fur trading <b>post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Island of Montreal, on a site initially named La Place Royale. At the confluence of Petite Riviere and St. Lawrence River, it is where present-day Pointe-à-Callière stands. On his 1616 map, Samuel de Champlain named the island Lille de Villemenon, in honour of the sieur de Villemenon, a French dignitary who was seeking the viceroyship of New France. In 1639 Jérôme Le Royer de La Dauversière obtained the Seigneurial title to the Island of Montreal {{in the name of the}} Notre Dame Society of Montreal to establish a Roman Catholic mission to evangelize natives.|$|E
5|$|Sieur de La Vérendrye {{built the}} first fur trading <b>post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site in 1738, called Fort Rouge. French trading {{continued}} at this site for several decades {{before the arrival of}} the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years' War. Many French and later British men who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the Métis because of sharing a traditional culture.|$|E
5|$|The 1/4th Battalion, Royal Scots (156th Brigade) {{assault on}} El Arish Redoubt {{was carried out}} in waves through the Ottoman trenches, during which six Ottoman mines exploded, causing EEF casualties. The Ottoman artillery, which had become active {{as a result of the}} first attack, had stopped shortly before the second attack began at 06:00 with an intense, ten-minute bombardment. At 06:30, a heavy Ottoman counterattack drove back the leading company of Royal Scots, causing a number of casualties. A platoon from another company helped rally the {{remnants}} of the leading company, which was reinforced by the 1/4th Battalion Royal Scots and 1/8th Battalion Scottish Rifles when the position was consolidated. Two tanks passed through El Arish Redoubt, but shortly afterwards one was abandoned and the other hit, while a third tank moved along the front line rolling out wire from Sea <b>Post</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast to Beach Post.|$|E
