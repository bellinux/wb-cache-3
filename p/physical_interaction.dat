25|$|The DNA helicases and polymerases {{must remain}} {{in close contact}} at the {{replication}} fork. If unwinding occurs too far in advance of synthesis, large tracts of single-stranded DNA are exposed. This can activate DNA damage signaling or induce DNA repair processes. To thwart these problems, the eukaryotic replisome contains specialized proteins {{that are designed to}} regulate the helicase activity ahead of the replication fork. These proteins also provide docking sites for <b>physical</b> <b>interaction</b> between helicases and polymerases, thereby ensuring that duplex unwinding is coupled with DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Crick {{addressed}} {{the origin of}} protein synthesis in a paper with Sydney Brenner, Aaron Klug, and George Pieczenik. In this paper, they speculate that code constraints on nucleotide sequences allow protein synthesis {{without the need for}} a ribosome. It, however, requires a five base binding between the mRNA and tRNA with a flip of the anti-codon creating a triplet coding, even though it is a five-base <b>physical</b> <b>interaction.</b> Thomas H. Jukes pointed out that the code constraints on the mRNA sequence required for this translation mechanism is still preserved.|$|E

At the 1993 Pay-Per-View event Survivor Series, Stu had a planned <b>physical</b> <b>interaction</b> outside of the ring with Shawn Michaels.

25|$|The Coulomb {{approximation}} mathematically {{follows from}} the assumptions that surfaces are in atomically close contact only over {{a small fraction of}} their overall area, that this contact area is proportional to the normal force (until saturation, which takes place when all area is in atomic contact), and that the frictional force is proportional to the applied normal force, independently of the contact area (you can see the experiments on friction from Leonardo da Vinci). Such reasoning aside, however, the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated <b>physical</b> <b>interaction.</b> The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though in general the relationship between normal force and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the various American states' rural health offices found that telepharmacy in rural medical {{facilities}} varied in prevalence across the United States but was still not widespread, and that many states had not yet clearly defined regulations for telepharmacy in hospitals. Adoption and implementation of telepharmacy methods has been slow compared {{to the spread of}} the basic technologies involved (internet access, audio/video compression algorithms, microphones and video cameras), despite periodic predictions of a forthcoming boom in the industry. Aside from more intangible factors (such as physicians' and pharmacists' personal uneasiness with the lack of <b>physical</b> <b>interaction</b> with patients), the major obstacles to telepharmacy implementation appear to have been the lack of clear legal regulations for telepharmacy, and the lack of network and software systems to manage (and secure) all of the data used in a professional pharmacy. As of 2010, many of the telepharmacy facilities in active operation were operating as pilot programs or under temporary waivers issued by state regulators because many states still had no clear legal framework for the regulation of remote pharmaceutical sites without pharmacists. Even in states that had regulated retail telepharmacy practices, regulations were often not in place to permit the implementation of telepharmacy in hospital settings. For some pharmacy facilities that might otherwise consider telepharmacy, the cost and complexity of the infrastructure needed to manage patient data across multiple sites can be prohibitive. In addition to the computer hardware required for patient data storage, distribution and teleconferencing, telepharmacy programs must deploy network security tools and procedures adequate to protect patient medical information in compliance with HIPAA and other patient privacy regulations. In 2010 the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project estimated that the computer hardware needed for a typical retail installation costs US$17,300 per site, with an additional cost of US$5,000 to buy a mobile cart for a hospital installation.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{control is}} a central issue in {{developmental}} psychology. Traditional theories of psychology solve this problem by positing a top-down central executive, which coordinates cognitive resources in pursuit of goals. We propose an alternative explanation: cognitive control arises from <b>physical</b> <b>interactions</b> across many different timescales within the system. College and preschool aged {{participants were asked to}} complete a simple executive function task, card sorting. We found that multi-scale <b>physical</b> <b>interactions</b> differed depending on experimental constraints, and that executive function in these cases was driven primarily by flexibility in multi-scale interactions, rather than the dominance of one scale. This suggests that, rather than being the workings of a higher order central executive, cognitive control may be driven by <b>physical</b> <b>interactions</b> within the system...|$|R

500|$|While {{the term}} [...] "shark attack" [...] is in common use for {{instances}} of humans being wounded by sharks, {{it has been}} suggested that this is based largely on the misconception that white sharks and other large predatory sharks (such as bull and tiger sharks) seek out humans as prey. A recent review recommends that only in the very rare instances where a shark clearly predated on a human should the bite incident be termed an [...] "attack," [...] which implies predation, and that otherwise it is more accurate to class bite incidents as [...] "sighting", [...] "encounter", [...] "bite incident", or [...] "fatal bite incident". Sightings do not include <b>physical</b> <b>interaction,</b> encounters include <b>physical</b> <b>interaction</b> without harm, shark bites include minor and major shark bite incidents, including those that do and do not require medical attention, and fatal shark bite incidents are those that result in death. The study suggests that only in a case where an expert validates the predatory intent of a shark would it be appropriate to term a bite incident an attack.|$|E
