5|$|By the mid-15th century, Magna Carta {{ceased to}} occupy {{a central role in}} English {{political}} life, as monarchs reasserted authority and powers which had been challenged in the 100 years after Edward I's reign.

5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E

5|$|In 1797 the Escheat Movement was born. Under {{the scheme}} {{proposed}} by the movement, land would be forfeited to the Crown should proprietors default on their quitrents, and tenants would be given the option of either purchasing part of the forfeited land or leasing it from the Crown. Members of the movement won a large majority in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island in 1802, and in 1803 a law to implement escheat {{was passed by the}} legislature. However, the government of the United Kingdom would not abandon its principle of supporting <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> refused to grant the bill Royal Assent.|$|E

5|$|The {{transformation}} of Hungary into a Christian state {{was one of}} Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects {{to give up their}} pagan rituals. His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death. His other laws protected <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.|$|E

5|$|A country's {{decision}} to operate an open economy and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications {{captured by the}} balance of payments. It also renders exposure to risks in international finance, such as political deterioration, regulatory changes, foreign exchange controls, and legal uncertainties for <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> investments. Both individuals and groups may participate in the global financial system. Consumers and international businesses undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on global financial affairs.|$|E
5|$|According to e-mails {{released}} in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, Millionaire narrowly avoided cancellation after the 2014–15 season. The show's declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The series was nonetheless renewed for the 2015–16 season, with various cuts to the show's production budget {{and a return to}} the original format (but with only 14 questions). Had the show not been renewed, SPE would have placed the show on extended hiatus for three years, reclaimed full rights to the show (without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run, to which DADT owns intellectual <b>property</b> <b>rights),</b> <b>and</b> shopped the revived show to another network or syndicator. In January 2017, it was announced that Millionaire has been renewed through 2018.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: In Australia, {{changes in}} social {{attitude}} to conservation {{and the environment}} over the past sixty years has demanded changes to <b>property</b> <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities. In Queensland, as in most jurisdictions in Australia, {{there has been an}} increase in controls and a gradual and progressive unbundling of traditionally held <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> as a response by governments to this social change. This project investigated the <b>property</b> <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities of land owners in Queensland with property which adjoins the littoral zone. This gave an insight into the number <b>and</b> type of <b>property</b> <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities which are unique to property with a littoral boundary. The study also examined how these <b>property</b> <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities were spatially defined and how they were recorded for land administration. Field surveys were carried out at three sites to examine the spatial extent of <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities in a real world environment. Results showed that while private <b>property</b> <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities were recorded under the current titling system, most publicly created <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities were not. The study also revealed problems with how <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities are defined spatially in legislation which lead to ambiguity in defining these <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities in the real world. Finally it was found that where information was available in relation to the spatial extent of <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> responsibilities it was often inaccurate...|$|R

25|$|In the {{southern}} provinces (modern-day Belgium) heerlijkheden {{and the associated}} rights were abolished after the French invasion of 1795.

This was formalised in the 1798 Batavian Constitution (Bataafsche Staatsregeling). A distinction was made between the feudal rights of appointment and patronage, which were completely abolished, and the income-related rights, which were more complicated. Some of these were feudal in nature and abolished. Others were similar to contractual or <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> therefore their loss was compensable.
