5|$|Production and {{broadcast}} of the fourth season were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and following its resolution, the writers were unable to compress the remainder of season four into the five allotted episodes and the season finale was extended by one hour.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{production}} of process industry, the ant colony system(ACS) {{was applied to the}} <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem. Based on the analysis of the <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem for process industry, a <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> model was established, whose goal was to obtain the shortest total process time.

Using a practical <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem as an example, the established model and designed algorithm were applied to implement the scheduling simulation.

5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, {{during the}} time of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended the <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E

The film began {{production in}} a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, {{as most of the}} main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for today's manufacturing organizations {{is how to}} respond agilely and cost-effectively to dynamic fluctuations of demand patterns across product mix and increasing rates of new products introduction. As traditional process planning and <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> operate independently for process plans and <b>production</b> <b>schedules</b> generation respectively, <b>production</b> <b>schedules</b> generation processes become inflexible and is restricted by the pregenerated process plan. In response to this issue, a multi-agent Monte Carlo configuration and optimization method is proposed to integrate process planning, <b>production</b> <b>scheduling,</b> and resource optimization for concurrent evaluation of planning and scheduling options. The principle of this methodology is to integrate agent bidding mechanism and Monte Carlo optimization, in which agents perform iterative interactions to evaluate production decisions dynamically for an optimum solution determination...|$|R
40|$|<b>Production</b> <b>scheduling</b> is {{a complex}} {{decision-making}} process that is becoming {{more important than ever}} in competitive markets today. However, effective <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> remains a very challenging task, and the current <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> systems tend to be inflexible and expensive. Although domain knowledge and information are very important to scheduling decisions, scheduling systems usually cannot effectively make use of them. In this paper, A Multi-Scenario Analysis (MSA) model is proposed for distributed collaborative decision-making, based on which a Multi-Scenario Analysis-based <b>Production</b> <b>Scheduling</b> Platform (MSAPSP) is developed.

Although Cook had been a strong proponent of adapting Disney's rides into films, the box office failure of The Country Bears (2002) made Michael Eisner attempt to shut down production of Pirates of the Caribbean.

5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E

5|$|In July 2006, as Casino Royale entered post-production, Eon Productions {{announced}} that the next film {{would be based on}} an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. It was decided beforehand the film would be a direct sequel, to exploit Bond's emotions following Vesper's death in the previous film. Just as Casino Royale theme was terrorism, the sequel focuses on environmentalism. The film was confirmed for a 2 May 2008 release date, with Craig reprising the lead role. Roger Michell, who directed Craig in Enduring Love and The Mother, was in negotiations to direct, but opted out because there was no script. Sony Entertainment vice-chairman Jeff Blake admitted a <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> of 18 months was a very short window, and the release date was pushed back to late 2008.

30|$|<b>Production</b> <b>scheduling</b> {{has been}} one of the most popular {{research}} topics in operations research, management science, and artificial intelligence. Because of limited production resources, jobs or customer orders usually have to wait in the shop floor significantly longer than their actual processing times. <b>Production</b> <b>scheduling</b> is required to determine when a job needs to be processed, which machine to process, or which priority assigned to the job. The goal of <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> is to effectively utilise the available resources to achieve some organisational objectives such as minimising average time that jobs have to spend in the system and minimise penalties caused by late deliveries. Over the years, new production technologies have been adopted but <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> is still an essential task to help businesses coordinate production activities and become more competitive.|$|R

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the previous episode. Mike Bullen visited Sydney in March 2001 to scout for locations. He was followed in May by producer Spencer Campbell and production designer Chris Truelove, who made preliminary casting decisions and scouted more locations. They finalised the arrangements in July. Unusually, the <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> was drawn up without a final script in place. This caused complications as Campbell allocated too much time for filming in Sydney and not enough in Manchester. As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the University of Manchester. Campbell rationalised that viewers {{who had never been}} to Sydney {{would not be able to}} tell the difference.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{themselves}} T2 Productions, James and co-producers Stephanie Austin and B.J. Rack rented {{an office}} in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, before starting to assemble the crew for Terminator 2. Adam Greenberg, who worked on The Terminator and Ghost (1990), became director of photography, while Joseph Nemec III, {{who had worked with}} Cameron on The Abyss, was tasked with production design. The team conducted a national search for a steel mill suitable for the film's climax, eventually selecting a dormant mill in Fontana, California, after weeks of negotiations. Locating a potential Cyberdyne building was more difficult, as the site was to host numerous stunts, shootouts, and explosions. An industrial park in Fremont, California, was eventually rented {{for the duration of the}} film's production. Cameron and William Wisher completed the 140-page screenplay draft on May 10, 1990, and by July 15, the first shooting draft had been distributed to the cast and crew; particulars of the technically detailed scripts were shrouded in secrecy. Both the six-week turnaround for the script and the film's accelerated <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> were to enable a 1991 Fourth of July release.|$|E
