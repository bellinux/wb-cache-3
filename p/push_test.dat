40|$|The {{standard}} <b>push</b> <b>test</b> specimen in {{the current}} version of Eurocode 4 does not provide any information on what modifications should be made when profiled steel sheeting is introduced. Whilst the lack of information was intended to encourage innovation, this has sometimes lead to test results implying that stud connectors possess a lower resistance and ductility than assumed in current Standards. From full-scale beam and companion push tests in Europe, {{it has been shown that}} modifying the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> through the introduction of a normal force to the face of the test slabs provides comparable load-slip performance to that encountered within a beam. Within the work programme for developing the second generation of Eurocodes, this paper presents part of the background to Sub-task 1 of SC 4.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{behaviour}} of headed shear stud in a <b>push</b> <b>test</b> using composite slabs with profiled sheeting. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed using general purpose finite element program ABAQUS to model the <b>push</b> <b>test.</b> Shear studs were welded through the deck to the beam and transverse ribs were perpendicular to the axis of the beam. Both, material and geometric nonlinearities were taken into account. The separation that occurs between the profiled sheeting and the concrete during experiments was implemented in the finite element model by assuming a suitable contact between them. The capacity of shear connector, load-slip behaviour and failure modes were predicted and were {{in close agreement with}} experimental results. At failure, the vertical separation between the steel deck and the concrete slab was clearly observed in the finite element analysis which undoubtedly represented the true behaviour of an experimental <b>push</b> <b>test.</b> It is concluded that the finite element analysis, if validated properly against test results, {{could be used as a}} cost effective alternative to the expensive experimental studies...|$|E

40|$|Short {{encapsulated}} pullout {{tests are}} frequently {{used in the}} laboratory and {{in the field to}} examine the bond performance of rock bolting. Because of the restriction of sample conditions and of <b>testing</b> apparatus, <b>push</b> <b>testing</b> is usually used instead in the laboratory. Rock bolts have a better performance in <b>push</b> <b>testing</b> and this is a thought to be attributed to Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio effect of the steel rebar. In this paper Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio effect in short encapsulated push/pull tests is evaluated analytically. The percentage difference of axial load in <b>push</b> and pull <b>tests</b> is calculated based on the failure mode analysis and the corresponding mechanical models of rock bolting mechanisms.

40|$|Muscular {{explosive}} {{power of}} the lower extremities is a critical performance factor in many types of sports. The most widely used test to measure explosive power is the jump test, which is considered the gold standard owing to its validity and reproducibility. However, the jump test involves complex movement that creates problems of repeatability and spinal overload. In contrast, the leg press test appears easier to perform and less problematic as regards repeatability and overloading. Use of the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> has been reported elsewhere, but to our knowledge no published data are available that correlate the jump and the push tests. To fill this gap, the aim of our study was to verify correlations between the two tests in order to validate the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> as a method for measuring explosive power of human leg extensor muscles and to identify the optimal load to be applied with this method for obtaining maximum mechanical power. The study population comprised a group of 16 physically active males randomly assigned to two different testing sessions: one with the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> {{and the other with}} the jump test. In both tests muscular power without countermovement was measured. The <b>push</b> <b>test</b> was performed on a horizontal press (Technogym Italia) with the subject in a sitting position and the knees and hips bent to 90 °. The subject was asked to push as hard as possible against the carriage using both legs while the carriage was free to move backward along two tracks. A series of tests were performed using progressively heavier loads (100 - 120 - 140 - 160 - 180 - 200 % of body weight). The test was repeated 3 times with each load. The jump test was performed with the subject starting in a semisquat position with the knees bent to 90 °. Tests were carried out using natural weight (body weight) and progressively increased loads (10 - 20 - 30 - 40 - 50 % of body weight) on a force platform. The test was performed in triplicate for each load. For both the jump and push tests, parameters were measured using an encoder (ErgoPace Italia) fixed to the floor (jump test) or to the press stand (<b>push</b> <b>test).</b> Measurement of translational load shifting was processed using dedicated software in order to obtain data on strength, speed and power. For each test method and subject, the power output values for each load were then interpolated to determine peak power output and amount of load expressed as per cent of body weight to which they corresponded. Data on strength, speed and power obtained for the load corresponding to the power peak were analyzed to compare the two tests. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between the two test methods as regarded strength and power (r= 0. 723; P< 0. 001 and r= 0. 486; P< 0. 05, respectively), while speed emerged as an r coefficient of positive correlation but not statistically significant (r= 0. 297; P= 0. 264). The measurements obtained with the two test methods and compared using t-tests differed significantly for all parameters: strength resulted higher on the <b>push</b> <b>test,</b> while power and speed were higher on the jump test. Peak power was obtained with an overload of 78 % more than body weight on the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> and an overload of 7 % more than body weight on the jump test. The study results demonstrate the validity of the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> for measuring explosive muscular power of leg extensors. Therefore, this test can be used for comparing performance between subjects and long-term monitoring of training. The method also offers several advantages: ease of use, less involvement of coordination ability, better standardization of the method and less spinal overload. Furthermore, the different power outputs of the subject and the different loads with which peak power is achieved indicate that the two apparently similar methods used for the same purposes differ in motor action. While on the one hand the greater loads used in the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> are partly related to the presence of cams that facilitate application of strength in the initial phase of movement, the higher output values obtained in the jump test (greater power), related to the interaction of accessory muscle groups, especially the erector muscles of the spine and the buttocks, suggest greater specificity of the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> for estimating only the capability of muscular explosive {{power of the}} leg extensors, specifically of the extensors of the knee (quadriceps). Hence, the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> appears better indicted for evaluating this performance factor for longitudinal and/or transversal control. Moreover, these difference suggest the need for future studies to compare biomechanical characteristics of the two exercises, with evaluation of gesture cinematics, joint dynamics, electromyographic activity, and different muscle lengths. This would help to better define which muscular mechanics are specifically involved in the two different movements...|$|E

This paper was {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport and the definitive published version is available at [URL] binding {{has been shown to}} improve resting cardiorespiratory function in individuals with cervical SCI, but it is not yet clear whether this approach improves the exercise response. Objectives: To determine the effects of abdominal binding on parameters relating to wheelchair sports performance in highly-trained athletes with cervical SCI. Design: Repeated-measures field-based study. Methods: Ten Paralympic wheelchair rugby players with motor-complete SCI (C 5 -C 7) completed a series of exercise tests in two conditions (bound and unbound). The following parameters were assessed: agility and acceleration/deceleration performance; cardiorespiratory function and gross efficiency during submaximal wheelchair propulsion; anaerobic performance and propulsion kinematics during a 30. s Wingate test; repeated sprint performance during a 10 × 20. m test; and aerobic performance during a repeated 4. min <b>push</b> <b>test.</b> Results: Compared to unbound, 6 of 17 field-based performance measures changed significantly with binding. Time to complete the acceleration/deceleration test decreased (p= 0. 005), whereas distances covered during the repeated 4. min <b>push</b> <b>test</b> increased (p < 0. 043). Binding elicited significant reductions in minute ventilation during submaximal wheelchair propulsion (p= 0. 040) as well as blood lactate accumulation and limb discomfort during the second set of the repeated 4. min <b>push</b> <b>test</b> (p= 0. 012 and 0. 022). There were no statistically significant effects of binding on any other variable. Conclusions: Abdominal binding improves some important measures of field-based performance in highly-trained athletes with cervical SCI. The changes may be attributable, at least in part, to improvements in trunk stability, ventilatory efficiency and/or haemodynamics...|$|E

30|$|After {{establishing}} a trend between the expected and real {{strength of the}} assembled components in Fig. 8, and by also reporting higher differences on the 1  mm size cube results, the authors decided to perform a statistical analysis to understand these discrepancies. We performed a <b>push</b> <b>test</b> for forty samples of soldered FS cubes of 1  mm side. We divided the forty samples into two soldering parameter groups. The first, by soldering the cubes with four bumps of 400  μm solder alloy, and the second group by soldering them with two bumps of 760  μm SAC 305 alloy. For the 1  mm FS cubes soldered with four bumps of 400  μm, the average force obtained from the <b>push</b> <b>test</b> was 5.40  N, {{with a standard deviation}} of 3.65  N. The average force for the 1  mm FS cubes soldered with two bumps of 760  μm was 9.10  N, {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.10  N. Although these results are closer to the theoretical expected results, they still diverge from the calculated strength. The authors believe that the encountered differences for 1  mm cubes are a consequence of the manufactured 1  mm cubes’ quality, which results in lower Ti/Pt/Au layers adhesion, ultimately compromising the component joint strength. The detailed results are submitted to the Smart System Integration 2018 Conference [12].|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of surface profile on load transfer mechanisms of bolts {{has been studied}} under both the constant normal stiffness (CNS) and constant normal load (CNL) conditions. Testing under CNS condition was conducted in a specially constructed constant normal stiffness shearing apparatus, whereby the flattened surface of a bolt section was pulled against the image of cast resin sample under constant stiffness conditions. Testing under CNL conditions included the conventional pull testing of an encapsulated section of bolt anchored in a borehole, and the short encapsulation <b>push</b> <b>test.</b> The conventional pull testing involved pull testing of three different profiled bolts in three different diameter holes. The pull tests were carried out both insitu and in the laboratory. Parameters examined, in addition to bolt surface profile, were the resin annulus thickness {{and the effectiveness of}} resin mixing in the hole. The credibility of push testing, in short steel cylinder sleeves, was examined by pulling the bolt out of the cylindrical sleeve instead of pushing. Also tested in short sleeve, was the possibility of changing the load transfer capability of a bolt by changing its surface profile. A numerical simulation study has recently been incorporated to enhance the current programme of research carried out at the School of Civil, Mining and Environmental Engineering, The University of Wollongong. The numerical study included the modeling of both the short encapsulation push/ pull test as well as shear stress simulation across joints. The conclusions drawn were that the bolt surface profile is an important parameter affecting the load transfer capacity of the bolt/rock interface, that the anchorage strength of resin encapsulation is influenced by the effectiveness of resin mixing, and the annulus thickness, and the short encapsulation <b>push</b> <b>test</b> underestimates the peak shear load and peak load displacement...|$|E

It this was is observed that, these specifications over estimate this value (capacities of shear connections) in many cases. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Resin bolt parameters, such as back {{pressure}} and gloving, and {{their effect on}} ground support system performance, {{remains one of the}} fundamental areas of rockbolt research. The majority of previous studies into resin bolting parameters have utilised various methodologies to investigate the effect of a singular parameter. Unfortunately, due to the variability in methodologies and the relatively narrow field of study of each research project, a holistic conclusion into the exact science behind various results is unable to be drawn. It is the focus of this research project to conduct a detailed and consistent testing program, which attempts to simulate real world conditions as closely as possible, in order to provide the industry with engineered roof bolting solutions to specific underground roof properties. Recently published studies have implemented steel piping as a simulated borehole and have reported relatively high back-pressure measurements. As part of this project, testing conducted both underground and in a cement block, have recorded back-pressures in the range of 4 - 10 MPa, which are substantially lower than previous tests conducted in steel piping. Rockbolts installed in an underground coal mine using a continuous miner have been over-cored, the core has been cut into 100 mm lengths and each sample has been <b>push</b> <b>tested.</b> After <b>push</b> <b>testing,</b> the samples from the top 300 mm of each bolt were inspected for gloving. Almost all of the recovered rockbolts experienced some degree of gloving within the top 300 mm of its length. The average severity of gloving within these specimens was found to be relatively minor. It was found that gloving can reduce load transfer by 4 - 6 kN per 10 % of gloved surface area...|$|R
