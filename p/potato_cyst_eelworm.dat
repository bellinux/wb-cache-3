5000|$|Ramsay {{was widely}} {{known for his}} {{research}} on a <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm</b> [...] - [...] the parasitic golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis). The worm was discovered in 1941 in potato fields on Long Island, New York, the only state where it has established a foothold. Around 1946, the worm was found on a {{lily of the valley}} plants imported from the Netherlands. Ramsay helped trace the worm to infested flower fields in Germany that had been converted for potato cultivation during World War II. Inspectors from the Department of Agriculture began testing cargoes of lilies in Hamburg, which initially slowed the golden nematode's spread from across the Atlantic. The Golden Nematode Act was enacted on June 15, 1948, to combat the worm. http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps3025/history.html As of 2003, the golden nematode is one of 22 federally regulated organisms in the United States. http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/Mangmnt/Exclusion.htm According to Society of Nematologists, [...] "he played an instrumental role in reducing the spread of Globodera rostochiensis in the United States."

40|$|The potato {{breeding}} programme at Oak Park {{was started in}} the 1960 's and has consisted {{of a number of}} distinct phases. In the first phase the focus was on the testing of the main domestic and foreign varieties in field trials in the main potato growing areas of the country. This was followed by a {{breeding programme}} for the domestic market, with particular emphasis on the production of a blight resistant replacement for Kerrâ€™s Pink. The emphasis then switched to breeding for the export market, with the focus on the UK and Mediterranean markets. Since then the breeding programme has been focused on the domestic, processing and export markets. The process of breeding, testing and multiplying a new potato variety from the making of the initial cross until the new variety can be commercially grown takes about 15 years (see Appendix 2). The objectives of the present Potato Breeding Programme are: 1. Breeding improved varieties for the seed export trade. 2. Developing high yielding early maincrop and maincrop types with resistance to <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm</b> Globodera rostochiensis and or Globodera pallidae with quality suitable for the UK market. 3. Developing a high dry-matter red skinned early maincrop or maincrop variety suitable for the home ware trade {{with a high level of}} disease resistance especially to late blight. 4. To select early maincrop or maincrop types suitable for processing into crisps and chips. 5. Breeding 1 st and 2 nd early varieties suitable for Irish and UK conditions with improved quality and disease resistance. End of Project Repor...|$|E

50|$|The {{speed of}} {{spread of the}} {{nematodes}} from field to field can be reduced by cleaning equipment of possibly infested soil before changing location and by using only certified PCN-free seed tubers. If possible, ask for seed potatoes grown on fields which were declared free of the <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode using an AMI-intensive soil sampling scheme (currently only available in The Netherlands). Pesticides can be used, {{but they will not}} get a field free of nematodes. They will increase yields and are only profitable at high population densities, when the financial profit of the extra yield will surpass the cost of the pesticide application. Crop rotation with at least 6 years between planting of a susceptible crop is an effective means to reduce nematode population densities to below damage threshold. However, the best way to manage <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> nematodes is the use of (partial) resistant potato varieties. During the last 10 years a number of varieties have been developed which can keep both <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode species below damage and detection threshold, without the use of pesticides. The official recommendations and requirements for crop rotation vary between countries.|$|R

40|$|For the {{proliferation}} of their feeding sites (syncytia), the <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode Globodera rostochiensis is thought to recruit plant endo-ÃŸ- 1, 4 -glucanases (EGases, EC. 3. 2. 1. 4). Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) indicated that the expression of two out of the at least eight EGases, namely Sl-cel 7 and Sl-cel 9 C 1, is specifically upregulated during syncytium formation. In situ hybridization and immunodetection studies demonstrated that both EGases are specifically expressed inside and adjacent to proliferating syncytia. To assess the importance of Sl-cel 7 and Sl-cel 9 C 1 for nematode development, we decided to knock them out individually. Sl-cel 9 C 1 probably is the only class C EGase in tomato, and {{we were unable to}} regenerate Sl-cel 9 C 1 Â¿silenced plants. Potato (S. tuberosum), a close relative of tomato, harbors at least two class C EGases, and St-cel 7 -or St-cel 9 C 1 Â¿silenced potato plants showed no obvious aberrant phenotype. Infection with <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> nematodes resulted in a severe reduction of the number of adult females (up to 60 %) and a sharp increase in the fraction of females without eggs (up to 89 %). Hence, the recruitment of CEL 7, an enzyme that uses xyloglucan and noncrystalline cellulose as natural substrates, and CEL 9 C 1, an enzyme that uses crystalline cellulose, is essential for growth and development of <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> nematodes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the genomic localisation and organisation of loci that harbour {{resistance to the}} <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode species Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis. Resistance to the <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> nematodes G. pallida and G. rostochiensis is an important aspect in potato breeding. To gain insight {{in the structure of}} the genes underlying nematode resistance, it is necessary to first map nematode resistance loci, as described for the resistance loci Gpa 5 and Gpa 6. Subsequently, both for map-based cloning and for marker-assisted selection, a high-resolution map of the resistance locus is required. A high-resolution map is produced for the H 1 locus. To gain more insight in the genomic organisation of a complex disease resistance locus, Gpa 2 /Rx 1 homologues derived from different haplotypes have been characterised. Finally, the Gpa 2 /Rx 1 homologues derived from five haplotypes have been subjected to extensive sequence analysis to elucidate their structural diversity and evolutionary relationships...|$|R

At the same time there is also pressure to increase world trade in potatoes. Such pressure has to be balanced by the risks involved in the associated spread of these pests and subsequent problems in management. Populations of the <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> nematodes from outside Europe, in particular South America, which is considered the origin of G. pallida and G. rostochiensis, pose a risk to those European countries where limited genetic variability of these nematode species has been recorded. The development and usage of resistant cultivars under such conditions has formed a pivotal role in integrated management programmes in Europe. Molecular studies have shown that populations of G. pallida and G. rostochiensis from South America have a different genetic composition from those in Europe. The introduction of such populations would pose a threat to the use of resistant cultivars as a major tool in reducing the potential spread and damage caused by these species. At present, an inability to link precisely genetic variability to the virulence characteristics of a specific nematode population, and quickly identify the virulence status of intercepted populations for inspection purposes, strengthens the case for using plant health legislation to prevent their introduction...|$|R

40|$|The <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> {{nematode}} Globodera rostochiensis is {{an important}} pest of potato (Solanum tuberosum). Pseudomonas fluorescens F 113, which produces 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), was investigated as a potential biocontrol agent against G. rostochiensis. Exposure of nematode cysts to the pseudomonad, under in vitro conditions or in soil microcosms, almost doubled {{the ability of the}} eggs to hatch. The percentage of mobile juveniles was reduced threefold following their incubation {{in the presence of the}} pseudomonad, both in vitro and in soil. Results obtained with a transposon-induced DAPG-negative biosynthetic mutant of F 113 and its complemented derivative with restored DAPG synthesis showed that the ability of strain F 113 to produce DAPG was responsible for the increase in hatch ability and the reduction in juvenile mobility. Similar effects on egg hatch ability and juvenile mobility of G. rostochiensis were obtained in vitro by incubating nematode cysts and juveniles, respectively, in the presence of synthetic DAPG.
