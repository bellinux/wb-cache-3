40|$|Triamterene and {{amiloride}} {{belong to}} the <b>potassium</b> <b>retaining</b> <b>diuretics</b> of the cycloamidine type. These agents exert natriuretic as well as antikaliuretic effects. After administration of high doses an additional magnesium-sparing property also becomes evident. Whereas amiloride is only metabolized to a minor extent, triamterene is rapidly bio-transformed to the phase- 1 metab-olite, hydroxytriamterene, and the phase-II metabolite, hydroxytriamterene sulphuric acid ester. This acidic phase-II metabolite is stilldiuretically active, but its electrolyte excretion profile {{is different from the}} parent compound: although the natriuretic properties are not altered, the potassium retention is very weak. Further studies in rats with cycloamidine derivatives of the triamterene type containing neutral, acidic or basic side chains at the phenyl moiety as well as with basic pteridine derivatives, revealed further evidence that the natriuretic, antikaliuretic and antimagnesiuretic effects can be influenced almost independently by structural variations of the parent drug. Thus, it was possible to obtain compounds predominantly increasing sodium excretion without affecting potassium or magnesium excretion. On the other hand, substances could be developed with mainly antikaliuretic effects, or compounds, which enhanced sodium and reduced magnesium excretion and did not interfere with the potassium elimination. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that distal tubular transport of sodium, potassium and magnesium may be influenced independently from each other. These renal effects of triamterene and its derivatives seem to be independent of their antiarrhythmic actions, as suggested by recent studies...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{amounts of}} <b>potassium</b> <b>retained,</b> after {{exchange}} with normal ammonium acetate solution at pH 7, were measured with six montmorillonite-beidellite minerals, whose interlayer charge ranged 0 - 72 - 1. 00 M+/SisO ~ and where tetrahedral substitution of A 1 for Si ranged 0. 14 [...] 0. 93 M+/SisO ~. The amount of <b>potassium</b> <b>retained</b> increased with increasing interlayer charge, {{but there was}} no correlation between the amount of <b>potassium</b> <b>retained</b> and the tetrahedral charge. The retention of potassium by expanding minerals is important o agriculture in connection with the fixation of potassium by soil clays. There have been several attempts to find how fixation is related to the composition and charge distribution of expanding 2 : 1 lay silicates. Wear & White (1951) suggested that the amount of <b>potassium</b> <b>retained</b> in these minerals after exchange varied directly with the proportion of negative charge caused by tetrahedral substitution of A 1 for Si. Barshad (1954) considered that the total charge controls expansion and hence the removal of potassium, and is thus more important han the type of substitution. However, Weaver (1958) and Mackenzie (1963) considered that potassium fixation is related to the amount of tetrahedral charge. Because of the difficulty of obtaining pure mineral samples of suitable composition, the relative importance of total charge and type of substitution has been tested only for a small range of composition. This paper gives the results obtained with six montmorillonites of different charge and isomorphous substitution...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{truncated}} and Ala-replacement analogs of the peptide Manse-CAP 2 b (pELYAFPRV-NH 2) were assayed for diuretic activity on Malpighian tubules of the housefly Musca domestica (M. domestica). The C-terminal hexapeptide {{proved to be}} the active core, the minimum sequence required to <b>retain</b> significant <b>diuretic</b> activity. However, full activity required the C-terminal heptapeptide, which was equipotent with the most active of the native housefly CAP 2 b peptides. Replacement of Arg 7 and Val 8 with Ala led to inactivity and a large 70 -fold drop in potency, respectively, indicating that these were critical residues. The Leu 2 was semicritical, where a six-fold loss in potency was observed. Conversely, the replacement of all other residues with Ala led to much smaller effects on potency and these positions were considered to be noncritical. This structure-activity relationship data can aid in the design of mimetic agonist/antagonist analogs of this diuretic peptide family with enhanced biostability and bioavailability, as tools for arthropod endocrinologists and as potential pest management agents capable of disrupting the water balance in pest flies...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{synthetic}} aedeskinin III on transepithelial electrolyte and fluid secretion were studied in isolated Malpighian tubules {{of the yellow}} fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Isolated Malpighian tubules were prepared for measurements of fluid secretion rates by the method of Ramsay. After measuring a control rate of fluid secretion, aedeskinin III {{was added to the}} peritubular Ringer solution. Rates of transepithelial fluid secretion significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner at aedeskinin concentrations ranging from 10 - 5 to 10 - 9 M. Maximal stimulatory effects were observed at 1 ?M aedeskinin III, which increased the fluid secretion rate from 0. 667 to 1. 451 nl/min. EC 50 for aedeskinin III was calculated as 1. 028 x 10 - 7 M. In the presence of 1 ?M aedeskinin III, the Na+ concentration in secreted fluid significantly decreased from 130. 5 to 88. 2 mM and the Cl- concentration in secreted fluid significantly decreased from 208. 6 to 173. 5 mM. The increase in the K+ concentration from 82. 1 mM to 90. 3 mM was not significant. The product of the fluid secretion rate and electrolyte secretion yields the electrolyte secretion rate. Accordingly, the transepithelial secretion rate for Na+ increased from 96. 3 pmols/min to 127. 6 pmols/min, the K+ secretion rate increased from 61. 6 pmols/min to 141. 2 pmols/min, and the Cl- secretion rate increased from 153. 9 to 257. 5 pmols/min. However, only the effects on K+ and Cl- secretion were statistically significant. Synthetic aedeskinin-receptor agonists 1577 and 1460 II also stimulated fluid secretion at 1 ?M concentrations, increasing fluid secretion rate from 0. 716 to 1. 224 nl/min and from 0. 889 to 1. 615 nl/min, respectively. The in vitro longevity of isolated Malpighian tubules was also assessed. Isolated tubules cultured in Ringer solution and Grace?s insect medium (pH 6. 1) did not survive the process and did not secrete fluid one day after isolation. However, when kept in Grace?s insect medium at pH 7. 1, the tubules still secreted one day later. These studies confirm that aedeskinin III has diuretic effects in Aedes Malpighian tubules. Rates of transepithelial secretion of NaCl and KCl increased, suggesting that the mechanism of action of aedeskinin III {{is similar to that of}} leucokinin.

Genetic evidence suggests that RPD 2 mutations are alleles of TRK 2, the putative low affinity transporter gene, whereas rpd 1 and rpd 3 mutations increase TRK 2 activity: (1) RPD 2 mutations are closely linked to trk 2, and (2) trk 2 mutations are epistatic to both rpd 1 and rpd 3. rpd 1 maps near pho 80 on chromosome XV and rpd 3 maps on the left arm of chromosome XIV, closely linked to kre 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{multifunctional}} ‘insect kinins’ of arthropods {{share the}} evolutionarily conserved C-terminal pentapeptide core sequence Phe-X 1 -X 2 -Trp-Gly-NH 2, where X 1 = His, Asn, Ser, or Tyr and X 2 = Ser, Pro, or Ala. Insect kinins regulate diuresis in {{many species of}} insects, including the house cricket, Acheta domesticus. Insect kinins, however, are susceptible to fast enzymatic degradation by endogenous peptidases that severely limit their potential use as tools for pest control or for endocrinological studies. To enhance resistance to peptidases, the core insect kinin sequence was structurally modified in this study to replace native peptide bonds susceptible to proteolytic degradation. These modifications include incorporation of two stereochemical variants of the β-turn mimetic motif 4 -aminogutamate {{in place of the}} X 1 -X 2 residues, insertion of a reduced peptide bond between residues Trp-Gly, and replacement of the Phe residue with a hydrocinnamyl group.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effects of an {{aluminosilicate}} additive on the fate of potassium during biomass combustion. Such additives have shown some success in mitigating slagging and fouling problems in boilers and furnaces, and the mobility of potassium in combustion systems {{is one of the key}} factors dictating ash behaviour. To investigate this, a flame emission spectroscopy technique was used to evaluate the differences in the gas-phase potassium release profiles during the combustion of 5 mm diameter pellets of different biomass suspended in a methane-air flame. The biomass pellets were evaluated with various mixes of an aluminosilicate based additive (5, 15 and 25 wt%). Potassium emission detection, coupled with high speed video of the combustion process, indicated that potassium evolves over the three stages of volatile combustion (a sharp peak in the emission profile), char combustion (a broader peak) and “ash cooking” (a very broad peak over an extended period, long after the end of combustion). In the absence of additive, the three biomass studied (softwood, wheat straw, olive residue) behaved quite differently in terms of potassium release profiles. When the results are normalized for the amount of potassium in the fuel, it is clear that a large fraction of potassium enters the gas phase during the volatile and char combustion of the softwood. Olive residue, releases a lower fraction of potassium during the volatile and char combustion stages, indicating that more potassium is fixed in the ash. In contrast, wheat straw shows a release of potassium during combustion, and then, after a period of “ash cooking”, a substantial gradual release with continued exposure to hot combustion gases. The difference in the emission profiles can be interpreted in terms of the K:Cl ratios and the K:(Si+Al) ratios: high chlorine and/or low (Si+Al) facilitates the release of KCl or KOH to the gas phase, while high (Si+Al) helps to fix K in the solid phase. The addition of the aluminosilicate additive shows a clear reduction in the potassium released from all the biomass pellets, particularly during the char-oxidation and “ash cooking” stages, and the level of additive required is related to the amount of K in the biomass. The potassium emission experiments were complemented by laboratory-scale preparation of ash at different temperatures, and detection of residual potassium in the ash using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). These results validated the findings and quantified the higher fractions of <b>potassium</b> <b>retained</b> within the ash when additives are used. For the wood ash 70 - 100 % of K is retained in the ash in the presence of additive; for the wheat straw, this figure is 60 - 80 % and for the olive pellets it is 70 - 100 %...|$|R

Cortisol for example stimulates the mobilization of free fatty acids and proteins and the breakdown of amino acids, and increases serum glucose level and blood pressure, among other effects.

Conformational and dynamic properties of the molecules are compared {{with each other and}} with respect to the X-ray structure to test the validity of the force field. The agreement between simulated and experimental structure using the GROMOS force field is better than that obtained in the literature using other force fields for protein crystals. The overall shape of the molecule is well preserved, as is the conformation of alpha-helices and beta-strands. Structural differences are mainly found in loop regions. Solvent networks found in the X-ray structure were reproduced by the simulation, which was unbiased with respect to the crystalline hydration structure. These 'networks seem to play an important role in the stability of the protein; evidence of this is found in the structure of the active site. The weak ion binding site in the X-ray structure of subtilisin BPN' is occupied by a monovalent ion. When a calcium ion is placed in the initial structure, three peptide ligands are replaced by 5 water ligands, whereas a <b>potassium</b> ion <b>retains</b> (in part) its original ligands.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 201 Thermogravimetry, {{coupled with}} a mass {{spectrometer}} (TG-MS) was used to investigate the catalytic effect potassium carbonate (K 2 CO 3) and potassium chloride (KCl), on the char conversion and the product gas composition of chars derived from a South African inertinite-rich bituminous coal. Sequential leaching of the coal with HCl-HF-HCl was performed to reduce the mineral matter present in the coal. This was done {{in order to reduce}} possible undesirable interactions between the minerals and inorganic compounds in the coal during heat treatments. The leaching process substantially reduced the ash content from 21. 5 % to less than 3 %. K 2 CO 3 and KCl [0. 5, 1, 3, 5 K-wt %] were loaded to the demineralized coal, raw coal and demineralized coal with added mineral mixture prior to charring. The mineral mixture was made up of kaolinite, quartz, pyrite, siderite, calcite, anastase and hydromagnesite. The ‘doped’ coal samples were then subjected to heat treatments in a CO 2 atmosphere up to 1200 °C. The results obtained showed that both K 2 CO 3 and KCl exhibit a catalytic effect on the char conversion during heat treatments in CO 2 atmosphere and the char conversion was increased with increasing loadings up to 5 K-wt% of K 2 CO 3 and KCl. The temperature ranges at which conversion occurred were found to be lower for K 2 CO 3 than for KCl. Subsequently, char conversion occurred over a relatively narrower temperature range for K 2 CO 3 than observed for KCl. The catalytic behaviour of K 2 CO 3 and KCl was confirmed by the results obtained. The results also indicated that the catalytic influence of K 2 CO 3 is greater than that of KCl and that KCl is more susceptible to deactivation by minerals and inorganic compounds present in the coal than K 2 CO 3. Different analytical techniques (XRF and XRD) were used {{to determine the extent of}} interaction of the catalysts used with the char material in the 5 K-wt% ‘doped’ coal samples. From the XRF results, it was observed that the K 2 O content was reduced after heat treatments in CO 2, however, no potassium crystalline phases were observed in the XRD results after heat treatments in CO 2. The reduced K 2 O content may be attributed to the potassium been taken up in other mineral matter during char reaction with CO 2, forming new amorphous inorganic complex compounds. Thus the <b>potassium</b> <b>retained</b> in the sample after heat treatment, indicated by the XRF results, may be in an amorphous phase. Mass spectrometry (MS) indicated that temperatures at which the maximum rate of evolution of gaseous species occurred were relatively lower for K 2 CO 3 loaded char samples iv than observed for KCl loaded samples. In addition, no mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) peak at 39 atomic mass unit (amu) from the MS results was observed, indicating that no potassium was detected in the gaseous phases for all the char samples. The undetected potassium in the gaseous phase may be due to the detection limit of the MS equipment. The MS results also indicated that addition of the catalyst facilitates the evolution of H 2 from the coal char samples. Addition of the catalysts to the samples lowered the temperature at which maximum H 2 was given off. The shift to lower temperatures was observed with increased catalyst loadings for both K 2 CO 3 and KCl loaded samples. Master...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to demonstrate the possibilities to reduce the emission of fine particle forming alkali during co-combustion of wood with peat in a full scale (150 kW) grate fired boiler. For this purpose the particle emissions from a 150 kW district heating grate fired boiler situated in northern part of Kramfors, Sweden, were studied. During the experiment the district heating boiler was fired with sawdust fuel with a 0, 10 and 20 wt-% (zero, low, high) peat content respectively. Mass concentrations and particle size distribution were measured by using a DLPI (13 -step low-pressure cascade impactor) with a precyclone. The particle matter was analyzed for morphology and elemental composition using SEM/EDS (Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy). In addition, chemical equilibrium model calculations were used to interpret the experimental findings. The present study clearly shows that reduction of fine particles (< 1 um) is possible when co-combusting wood pellets with peat pellets in grate fired boilers. When 10 wt % peat {{was added to the}} wood/peat fuel mixture the fraction of fine particles was significantly decreased (about half of that emitted during pure softwood pellet combustion). The fine particles were for all fuel types/mixtures dominated by potassium, chlorine, sulfur, sodium and zinc. The result from this work therefore shows that a significant reduction of fine particle alkali is possible when co-combusting wood pellets with peat.

In this study, we examined whether long-term variations in the intake of sodium and potassium induce lasting changes in the plasma concentration of circulating steroids by developing a mathematical model of steroidogenesis in mice. One finding of this model was that mice increase their plasma progesterone levels specifically in response to potassium depletion. This prediction was confirmed by measurements in both male mice and men. Further investigation showed that progesterone regulates renal potassium handling both in males and females under potassium restriction, independent of its role in reproduction. The increase in progesterone production by male mice was time dependent and correlated with decreased urinary potassium content. The progesterone-dependent ability to efficiently <b>retain</b> <b>potassium</b> was because of an RU 486 (a progesterone receptor antagonist) -sensitive stimulation of the colonic hydrogen, potassium–ATPase (known as the non-gastric or hydrogen, potassium–ATPase type 2) in the kidney.

This results from the plasma volume contraction secondary to the electrolyte and fluid loss during the diuresis [1 - 4].

In vivo studies of membrane/channel and channel/channel interactions are challenging as membrane properties are actively regulated in living cells, and are difficult to control in experimental settings. We developed a method to reconstitute functional voltage-gated ion channels into cell-sized Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) in which membrane composition, tension and geometry can be controlled. First, a voltage-gated potassium channel, KvAP, was purified, fluorescently labeled and reconstituted into small proteoliposomes. Small proteoliposomes were then converted into GUVs via electroformation. GUVs could be formed using different lipid compositions and buffers containing low (5 mM) or near-physiological (100 mM) salt concentrations. Protein incorporation into GUVs was characterized with quantitative confocal microscopy, and the protein density of GUVs was comparable to the small proteoliposomes from which they were formed. Furthermore, patch-clamp measurements confirmed that the reconstituted channels <b>retained</b> <b>potassium</b> selectivity and voltage-gated activation.

The investigations allow comparison of these responses with those found after x-ray exposure. Exposure to 2 to 8 atmospheres of oxygen for 9, 20, and 40 hours showed decreased potassium leakage {{as measured by}} an elution technique. Further experiments using 0. 5 to 22 hour exposures to 10 to 143 atmospheres of oxygen showed decreased potassium leakage when glucose was present in the test media, but increased leakage (as did x-ray effects) {{in the absence of}} substrate. There was increased potassium leakage into the suspending media (distilled water) during oxygen exposure hut this usually did not affect the leakage rates measured subsequently. Marked inability to form colonies was observed after 20 hour exposures to 100 atmospheres of oxygen, with a much smaller response at lower pressures. Increased oxygen concentrations, not pressure, evidently caused these effects, since comparable pressures of nitrogen produced almost no change. The ratio of potassium leakage to survival sensitivity was found to be approximately unity when comparing exposures causing 50 per cent damage.

Moreover, L-ascorbic acid contents decreased significantly, just during 2 nd frying. k(0) was identified as well as E-a observed for L-ascorbic acid, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene as 68. 4 to 71. 5, 79. 6 to 84. 9, and 85. 9 to 88. 6 kJ/mol, respectively. beta-carotene appeared to be more heat-resistant than alpha-carotene and L-ascorbic acid. The behavior of the nutritional markers appears to be the consequence of the thermal and hydric histories of the crust and of the heart of the plantain disk related to heat transfer during preparation of the "tostones. ...|$|R
40|$|Erythrocyte {{membranes}} incorporated labeled phosphate from γ-adenosine triphosphate (AT 32 P) into {{phosphatidic acid}} and the polyphosphoinositides. Inositol- 3 H and palmitate- 14 C were also {{incorporated into the}} phospholipids but α-glycerophosphate- 32 P was not. The incorporation of γ-AT 32 P into phospholipids was increased when the erythrocyte ghosts were incubated in hypotonic media which lysed the cells. Lysis {{had little or no}} effect on the incorporation of inositol- 3 H and palmitate- 14 C into the phospholipids. If erythrocyte membranes were prepared in 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), instead of 1 mM MgCl 2, then the tonicity of the incubating medium did not influence the incorporation of γ-AT 32 P into the phospholipids. Erythrocyte ghosts, prepared by lysis in water, EDTA, or 1 mM calcium, lead, mercury, zinc, or cadmium, failed to reconstitute when placed in isotonic medium, inasmuch as they did not <b>retain</b> <b>potassium</b> against a chemical gradient. Ghosts prepared by lysis in 1 mM magnesium, barium, or strontium could be reconstituted. Ghosts which failed to reconstitute incorporated more labeled phosphate from γ-AT 32 P into the phospholipids than did intact or reconstituted ghosts. The larger incorporation of labeled phosphate by leaky ghosts was not due to a greater entrance of γ-AT 32 P into those cells. Primaquine phosphate and digitonin, at concentrations which are known to cause cells to form smaller vesicles or to lyse cells by removing cholesterol, did not increase the incorporation of labeled phosphate into the phospholipids. It is suggested that the increased metabolism of phospholipids may be involved in a membrane repair mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} Streptococcus bovis JB 1 was {{initially}} inhibited by nisin (1 μM), and nisin caused {{a more than}} 3 -log decrease in viability. However, some of the cells survived, and these nisin-resistant cells grew as rapidly as untreated ones. To see if the nisin resistance was merely a selection, nisin-sensitive cells were obtained from agar plates lacking nisin. Results indicated that virtually any nisin-sensitive cell could become nisin-resistant if the ratio of nisin to cells was not too high and the incubation period was long enough. Isolates obtained from the rumen were initially nisin sensitive, but they also developed nisin resistance. Nisin-resistant cultures remained nisin resistant even if nisin was not present, but competition studies indicated that nisin-sensitive cells could eventually displace the resistant ones if nisin was not present. Nisin-sensitive, glucose-energized cells lost virtually all of their intracellular potassium if 1 μM nisin was added, but resistant cells <b>retained</b> <b>potassium</b> even after addition of 10 μM nisin. Nisin-resistant cells were less hydrophobic and more lysozyme-resistant than nisin-sensitive cells. Because the nisin-resistant cells bound less cytochrome c, it appeared that nisin was being excluded by a net positive (i. e., less negative) charge. Nisin-resistant cells had more lipoteichoic acid than nisin-sensitive cells, and deesterified lipoteichoic acids from nisin-resistant cells migrated more slowly through a polyacrylamide gel than those from nisin-sensitive cells. These results indicated that lipoteichoic acids could be modified to increase the resistance of S. bovis to nisin. S. bovis JB 1 cultures were still sensitive to monensin, tetracycline, vancomycin, and bacitracin, but ampicillin resistance was 1, 000 -fold greater...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted to investigate the potential influence of pre- and post adding of catalysts to a demineralized coal char. The catalysts were chosen according to yield better catalytic activity and be inexpensive. CO 2 gasification {{was conducted on the}} samples in a temperature range of 500 °C to 900 °C. The coal chosen was a high-inertinite, high-ash, Highveld bituminous coal. The catalysts chosen were sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and a mixture of the two catalysts. Different methods were used to investigate the factors influencing the reactivity of the demineralized coal char, and the extent of the influence from the catalysts. Proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and ash yields were conducted on the starting material to determine the change the demineralization had on the coal. Ash fusion temperatures of the samples were also obtained. The results indicated that demineralization lowered the ash content, as well as the ash fusion temperatures, but the ultimate analysis showed consistency in both sets of samples. Mass losses obtained during the thermal treatment experiments under CO 2 atmosphere showed an increase in mass loss in the order of samples without addition of catalysts to the smallest amount of addition. Potassium carbonate showed the largest increase in mass loss during CO 2 thermal treatment, together with the mixture of the two catalysts. Samples with pre-added catalysts also had a larger mass loss than samples with post-added catalysts. According to the XRD and QEMSCAN results, some <b>potassium</b> species are <b>retained</b> in the ash, which is confirmed by XRF results. The XRF results also showed that the amount of alkali species retained is quite large. Master...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Whole body {{potassium}} {{measurements were}} performed on 55 cirrhotic patients in different stages of the disease. They included 34 with alcoholic cirrhosis, 10 with cryptogenic cirrhosis, eight with chronic active hepatitis, and three with haemochromatosis. Serial measurements were carried out in 21 patients. The {{findings of this study}} indicate that: (1) the aetiology of the cirrhosis is important in determining the potassium status of cirrhotics, most alcoholics being depleted; (2) ascites and decompensation are usually associated with potassium depletion but com-pensated cirrhotics may also be depleted even when not receiving diuretics; (3) the initial potassium status, whether a cirrhotic be decompensated or not, is difficult to alter in the short term (six months). Marked changes in potassium status can occur in alcoholic patients studied over longer periods. Potassium status is important because it influences general well being through its physiological effects on muscle contractibility and cardiac function, on hydrogen ion exchange in the tubules and acid base balance, and on insulin secretion. Several factors including diet, gastrointestinal losses, and diuretic treatment may affect adversely the potassium status of cirrhotic patients. Studies using exchangeable potassium (42 K) have shown that cirrhotics, even without oedema or ascites, may be depleted of total body potassium {{in the presence of a}} normal serum potassium (Aikawa et al., 1953; Burrows et al., 1953). Other workers have also concluded that serum potassium determinations are poor indicators of body potassium stores in patients with cirrhosis (Heinemann and Emirgil, 1960; Case et al., 1965). While exchageable potassium is often decreased in cirrhotics (Aikawa et al., 1953; Kukral et al., 1969), this is not an invariable finding (Casey et al., 1965) and it is not clear whether patients with different types of cirrhosis are affected to the same extent. Casey et al. (1961) reported that the more severe the liver disease the lower the body potassium stores, and it has been suggested that patients with severely impaired liver function may be unable to <b>retain</b> <b>potassium</b> supplements (Aikawa et al., 1953...|$|R
40|$|Ninety-five {{percent of}} body {{potassium}} is intracellular where it fulfills a role {{with respect to}} intracellular water, which is analogous in many ways to that of sodium in the extracellular water. For example, each is the principal determinant of the osmolality of its compartment, and the absolute quantities of each in the organism are clearly related to {{the volume of the}} intracellular and extracellular spaces. The ease with which the sodium concentration of the extracellular fluid (ECF) may be measured contrasts markedly with the difficulties of measuring directly the intracellular potassium concentration. This difficulty is central to many of the problems associated with the assessment of potassium stores. Nevertheless, in the assessment of potassium stores, it is not only necessary to know the amount of potassium in the body but to be able to express this figure in a physiological and meaningful way. This should ideally include a measurement of the concentration of potassium in intracellular water as well as the technically easier expression in terms of dry solids or body weight. Furthermore, since potassium is maintained within the cell by an active transport system which transports sodium outwards and potassium inwards, thus balancing “passive” leaks down the electrochemical gradients [1, 2], a proper appraisal of potassium physiology should include an assessment of this mechanism, both active transport and so-called passive permeability. In theory there ought to be at least two distinct types of potassium deficit leading to a low intracellular potassium concentration, one which follows negative balance from, for example, severe diarrhea, and a second which is consequent upon altered membrane permeability or disordered function of the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism and results from the consequent inability to <b>retain</b> <b>potassium</b> within the cell. A third mechanism for a reduction in total body potassium without a necessary reduction in intracellular potassium concentration is loss of lean body mass (LBM), as in muscle wasting. These different types of potassium deficiency and the different modes of expression of potassium measurements which are required to distinguish between them cannot be obtained from a single methodology. Thus, a clear formulation of the aspect of potassium stores under study and an understanding of which methodology will provide the answer are needed before data can be acquired and presented in an appropriate manner. Many of the problems and apparent contradictions in the literature on body potassium stores are the result of failures in formulation and interpretation rather than errors of measurement. For this reason this paper will detail the methods available for the assessment of potassium stores with particular reference to the limitations associated with each method. A tentative approach to the assessment of potassium stores will then be presented and its application in clinical settings briefly demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|We review new and {{published}} analyses of river waters, bedloads and their constituent minerals from the Dhauli Ganga and Alaknanda, {{headwaters of the}} Ganges in Garhwal, and the Marsyandi in Nepal and their tributaries. These data are used to discriminate between the inputs of major cations and Sr from silicate and carbonate sources. Methods of estimating {{the proportion of the}} carbonate and silicate inputs to river waters using mixing arrays in Sr-Ca-Mg-Na-K 87 Sr/ 86 Sr space are shown to suffer from systematic correlations between the magnitude of the precipitation of secondary calcite and the fraction of the silicate component. This results in factor-of two overestimates of the fractions of silicate-derived Ca, Mg and Sr. To correct for this the magnitude of secondary calcite precipitated and relative fractions of silicate and carbonate-derived cations are instead calculated by modeling the displacement of water compositions from the compositions of the carbonate and silicate components of the bedload in subsets of Sr-Ca-Mg-Na-K 87 Sr/ 86 Sr space. The compositions of the carbonate and silicate end-members in the bedload are determined by sequential leaching. The results of this modeling are compared with modeling of the modal mineral inputs to waters where mineral compositions are derived from electronmicroprobe analyses of the minerals in the bedload. In the upper Marsyandi catchment, which drains low-grade Tethyan Sedimentary Series formations, a set of mainstem samples collected over a two-year period define tight correlations in Sr-Ca-Mg-Na-K- 87 Sr/ 86 Sr space. Modeling of the magnitude of secondary carbonate precipitation and fractions of silicate-derived Ca, Mg and Sr in Sr-Ca-Mg 87 Sr/ 86 Sr space gives selfconsistent results that are compatible with both the calculations of mineral modes {{and published}} Mg-isotopic compositions, if the ratio of chlorite to biotite weathering is high or if there is another silicate source of Mg. These calculations imply that between 12 and 31 percent of the Sr and 44 and 72 percent of the Mg is derived from silicate minerals where the range reflects the seasonal change in the ratio of silicate-derived to carbonate-derived cations. Modeling in Sr-Ca-Na and/or K space is inconsistent with the Sr-isotopic and Mg-isotopic constraints and we conclude that in this catchment dissolution of Na and K are incongruent relative to Sr-Ca-Mg. <b>Potassium</b> is preferentially <b>retained</b> in micas whereas the controls on Na are unclear. Modeling of the catchments underlain by High Himalayan Crystalline and Lesser Himalayan Series in Garhwal is complicated by the presence of dolomite as well as calcite in the carbonate and the results imply that dolomite dissolves faster in the acetic acid leaches than in nature. Up to 60 percent of the Sr in the catchment on High Himalayan Crystalline Series and 20 to 30 percent of Sr in the catchments on Lesser Himalayan Series are estimated to be derived from silicates. However {{it should be noted that}} the element budgets are not all self-consistent and the use of bedrock-element ratios to model the sources of chemical inputs to river waters remains subject to uncertainties...|$|R
