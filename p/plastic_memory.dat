The word organic electronics deals with the flow of electrons in non semiconductor namely organic materials.

40|$|The use of {{rotary shaft}} seals made of PTFE {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence of}} their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable {{rotary shaft seals}}, there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by PTFE rotary shaft seals. The relieved rotary shaft lip seal represents a special design among PTFE rotary shaft seals. Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved rotary shaft seal as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the permissible pressure range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the sealing edge, thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved rotary shaft seal. Earlier designs of the relieved rotary shaft seal, similar to other commercially available rotary shaft seals, sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material. This was remedied by a functional analysis of the sealing system, experimental investigations, and by the use of FE simulations. In this way, the <b>plastic</b> <b>memory</b> effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

30|$|The idea {{of using}} a {{floating}} gate (FG) device to obtain a nonvolatile memory device was suggested {{for the first time}} in 1967 by Kahng D and Sze SM at Bell Labs [1]. This was also the first time that the possibility of nonvolatile MOS memory device was recognized. From that day, semiconductor memory has made tremendous contributions to the revolutionary growth of digital electronics since a 64 -bit bipolar RAM chip to be used in the cache memory of an IBM computer was reported in 1969 [2]. Semiconductor memory has always been an indispensable component and backbone of modern electronic systems. All familiar computing platforms ranging from handheld devices to large supercomputers use storage systems for storing data temporarily or permanently [3]. Beginning with punch card which stores a few bytes of data, storage systems have reached to multiterabytes of capacities in comparatively less space and power consumption. Regarding application aspects, the speed of storage systems needs to be as fast as possible [4]. Since Flash memory has become a common component of solid-state disks (SSDs), the falling prices and increased densities have made it more cost-effective for many other applications [5]. Memory devices and most SSDs that use Flash memory are likely to serve very different markets and purposes. Each has a number of different attributes which are optimized and adjusted to best meet the needs of particular users. Because of natural inherent limitations, the long-established memory devices have been shorted out according to their inventions to match with portable electronic data storage systems. Today, the most prominent one is the limited capacity for continued scaling of the electronic device structure. Research is moving along the following paths for embedded Flash devices: (i) scaling down the cell size of device memory, (ii) lowering voltage operation, and (iii) increasing the density of state per memory cell by using a multilevel cell. To sustain the continuous scaling, conventional Flash devices may have to undergo revolutionary changes. Basically, it is expected that an entire DVD collection be in the palm of a hand. Novel device concepts with new physical operationing principles are needed. It is worthwhile to take a look at semiconductor memories against the background of digital systems. The way semiconductor devices are used in a systems environment determines what is required of them in terms of density, speed/power, and functions. It is also worthwhile to look into the economic significance of semiconductor memories and the relative importance of their various types. For the past three and a half decades in existence, the family of semiconductor memories has expanded greatly and achieved higher densities, higher speeds, lower power, more functionality, and lower costs [3, 6, 7]. At the same time, some of the limitations within each type of memory are also becoming more realized. As such, there are several emerging technologies aiming to go beyond those limitations and potentially replace all or most of the existing semiconductor memory technologies to become a universal semiconductor memory (USM). In addition, the rewards for achieving such a device would be to gain control of an enormous market, which has expanded from computer applications to all of consumer electronic products. Looking forward to the future, there are wide ranges of emerging memory applications for automation and information technology to health care. The specification of nonvolatile memory (NVM) is based on the floating gate configuration, which is the feature of an erased gate put into many cells to facilitate block erasure. Among them, designed Flash memories such as NOR and NAND Flash have been developed and then proposed as commercial products into bulk market. They have been considered as the most important products. NOR has high operation speed for both code and data storage applications; on the other hand, NAND has high density for large data storage applications [8]. Since the inception of Flash memory, there has been an exponential growth in its market driven primarily by cell phones and other types of consumer electronic equipment. While, today, integration of a silicon chip is not economical, toys, cards, labels, badges, value paper, and medical disposables could be imagined to be equipped with flexible electronics and memory. With growing demands for high-density digital information storage, memory density with arriving technology has been increased dramatically from the past couple of years. The main drive to develop organic nonvolatile memory is currently for applications of thin-film, flexible, or even printed electronics. One needs a technology to tag everything to electronic functionality which can be foreseen in a very large quantity and at a very low cost on substrates such as plastic and paper. Accessible popularization of roll-to-roll memory commercialization is a way to make an encounter interesting and challenging to have charge storage devices of choice for applications with enormous flexibility and strength. Recently, polymer (<b>plastic</b> <b>memory)</b> and organic memory devices have significant consideration because of their simple processes, fast operating speed, and excellent switching ability [9, 10]. One significant advantage polymer memory has over conventional memory designs is that it can be stacked vertically, yielding a three-dimensional (3 -D) use of space [11]. This means that in terabyte solid-state devices with extremely low transistor counts such as drives about the size of a matchbook, the data persists even after power is removed. The NAND Flash market is continually growing by the successive introduction of innovative devices and applications. To meet the market trend, 3 -D NVMs are expected to replace the planar ones, especially for 10 -nm nodes and beyond. Moreover, simple-structure organic bistable memory exhibiting superior memory features has been realized by employing various nanoparticles (NPs) blended into a single-layered organic material sandwiched between two metal electrodes [12, 13]. The NPs act as traps that can be charged and discharged by suitable voltage pulses. NP blends show promising data retention times, switching speed, and cycling endurance, but the on-state current is too low to permit scaling to nanometer dimensions [10, 14]. A lot of these great ideas tend to die before reaching this point of development, but that is not to say that we will be seeing <b>plastic</b> <b>memory</b> on store shelves next year. There are still many hurdles to get over; software alone is a big task, as is the manufacturing process, but it does bring this technology one step closer to reality [15]. It is not an exaggeration to say that the equivalent of 400, 000 CDs, 60, 000 DVDs, or 126  years of MPG music may be stored on a polymer memory chip the size of a credit card.|$|E

The switching mechanism is thought to be caused through an interaction between the polyaniline nanofibers and the gold nanoparticles, where charge is transferred to the gold nanoparticles from the polyaniline nanofibers due to an induced electric field. Switching between the ON-OFF states has shown to be rapid, with times of less than 25ns. The retention time of these simple devices are on the order of days after programming, and write-read-erase cycles have been demonstrated.|$|R
