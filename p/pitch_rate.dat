However, {{the impact of the}} <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> on crucial fermentation and beer quality parameters has never been assessed systematically. In this study, five <b>pitching</b> <b>rates</b> were applied to lab-scale fermentations to investigate its impact on the yeast physiology and beer quality. The fermentation rate increased significantly and the net yeast growth was lowered with increasing <b>pitching</b> <b>rate,</b> without affecting significantly the viability and the vitality of the yeast population. The build-up of unsaturated fatty acids in the initial phase of the fermentation was repressed when higher yeast concentrations were pitched. The expression levels of the genes HSP 104 and HSP 12 and the concentration of trehalose were higher with increased <b>pitching</b> <b>rates,</b> suggesting a moderate exposure to stress in case of higher cell concentrations. The influence of <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> on aroma compound production was rather limited, with the exception of total diacetyl levels, which strongly increased with the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate.</b> These results demonstrate that most aspects of the yeast physiology and flavour balance are not significantly or negatively affected when the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> is changed.

40|$|Mead is a {{traditional}} drink that contains 8 % and 18 % (v/v) of ethanol, resulting from the alcoholic fermentation of diluted honey by yeasts. Mead fermentation is a time-consuming process {{and the quality of}} the final product is highly variable. Therefore, the present investigation had two main objectives: first, to determine the adequate inoculum size of two commercial wine-making strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the optimisation of mead fermentation; and second, to determine if an increase in yeast <b>pitching</b> <b>rates</b> in batch fermentations altered the resulting aroma profiles. Minor differences were detected in the growth kinetics between the two strains at the lowest <b>pitching</b> <b>rate.</b> With increasing <b>pitching</b> <b>rates</b> net growth of the strain ICV D 47 progressively decreased, whereas for the QA 23 the increasing inoculum size had no influence on its net growth. The time required to reach the same stage of fermentation ranged from 24 to 96 h depending on the inoculum size. The final aroma composition was dependent on the yeast strain and inoculum size. Fourteen of the twenty-seven volatile compounds quantified could contribute to mead aroma and flavour because their concentrations rose above their respective thresholds. The formation of these compounds was particularly pronounced at low <b>pitching</b> <b>rates,</b> except in mead fermented by strain ICV D 47, at 106 CFUs/mL. The esters isoamyl acetate, ethyl octanoate and ethyl hexanoate were the major powerful odourants found in the meads. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that yeast strain and inoculum size can favourably impact mead’s flavour and aroma profiles.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate cavitating flows around a pitching hydrofoil via combined physical and numerical studies. The aims are to (1) improve the understanding of the interplay between unsteady cavitating flow, hydrofoil motion, and hydrodynamic performance, (2) quantify the influence of <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> on subcavitating and cavitating responses, and (3) quantify the influence of cavitation on the hydrodynamic load coefficients and surrounding flow structures. Results are presented for a NACA 66 hydrofoil undergoing controlled, slow (α̇ = 6 ∘/s) and fast (α̇ = 63 ∘/s) pitching motions from α = 0 ° to α = 15 ° and back to α = 0 ° for both subcavitating and cavitating conditions at a moderate Reynolds number of Re = 750 [*] 000. The experimental studies were conducted in a cavitation tunnel at the French Naval Academy, France. The numerical simulations are performed by solving the incompressible, multiphase Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations via the commercial code CFX using a transport equation-based cavitation model; a modified k-ω SST turbulence model is used to account for the effect of local compressibility on the turbulent eddy viscosity. The results showed that increases in the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> suppressed laminar to turbulent transition, delayed stall, and significantly modified post-stall behavior. Cavitation inception at the leading edge modified the pressure distribution, which in turn significantly changed the interaction between leading edge and trailing edge vortices, and hence the magnitude as well as the frequency of the load fluctuations. For a fixed cavitation number, increases in <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> lead to increase in cavitation volume, which in turn changed the cavity shedding frequencies and significantly modified the hydrodynamic loads. Inversely, the leading edge cavitation observed for the low pitching velocity case tends to stabilize the stall because of the decrease of the pressure gradient due to the formation of the cavity. The results showed strong correlation between the cavity and vorticity structures, which suggest that the inception, growth, collapse and shedding of sheet/cloud cavities are important mechanisms for vorticity production and modification...|$|R
40|$|In {{the beer}} production, the {{fermentation}} of worts whose gravity {{is higher than}} 18 ºP has been presented as {{an efficient way to}} improve the capacity of brewery facility without changes in the brewhouse. In this work, a brewer yeast strain was submitted to high gravity fermentations to evaluate the influence and the limits of the environmental parameters on the fermentation performance and final product profile. The variables included in this study were the primary fermentation temperature, wort concentration (extract) and yeast <b>pitching</b> <b>rate.</b> Static fermentations were carried out anaerobically in 2 L tall tubes (EBC recommendation for small scale brewing fermentations) with 15, 18 and 22 ºP wort, at constant temperature of 12, 15 and 18 ºC. The yeast was grown aerobically at 27 ºC in 15 ºP wort (saturated with air) and collect by filtration to inoculate by mass at different <b>pitching</b> <b>rates</b> of 12, 18 and 22 million cells/ml. Fermentations were monitored daily measuring the ethanol, extract, pH, temperature, biomass in suspension and viability. At the end of the primary fermentation, the green beer was analysed concerning diacetil, esters and high alcohols by gas chromatography. Fermentation data were statistically treated in order to obtain an optimum approach for the studied parameters. For statistical proposes, the fermentation performance was measured by ethanol produced, apparent extract and the fermentation time. Although the temperature has a positive effect on the indicators of the fermentation performance, the wort concentration has not a positive effect for all indicators. When the wort has higher concentration {{at the beginning of the}} fermentation, as expected, the fermentation takes longer to be finished with more ethanol produced. Considering that the produced ethanol, the fermentation time and the residual extract have the same level of interest for the brewing process, the statistical analysis showed that the optimal point for the wort concentration, fermentation temperature and <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> is 20 ºP, 18 ºC and 20 x 106 cell/ml, respectively.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{productivity}} of the beer fermentation process, several strategies can be adopted. One of these promising strategies could be the increase of suspended yeast cells in the reactor.
