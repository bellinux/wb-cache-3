In addition, the effect of education, income and carreer on the women voters for their references to their husbands and relatives for the choices about political parties or candidates are also tried to be estimated. In the survey the out-puts of two different researches are used to undestand the effect of education, income and career of the ways of <b>political</b> <b>interferences.</b> First group consists of women having lower level of education and income and the ones working at ordinary jobs. Second group consists of women having higher level of education and income and the ones working at qualifying jobs. In the theoretical part of the survey, descriptrons of <b>political</b> <b>interferences,</b> ways and levels of <b>political</b> <b>interferences</b> and social and psychological factors affecting the <b>political</b> <b>interferences</b> are observed. As well, types of voters, social and psychological factors affecting doring the period of political decisions are examined. According to the out-puts of the area research; income, education and career are effective on the ways of <b>political</b> <b>interferences</b> of women. Nearly all of women voters joining our research represent a passive category of voting. The reason for it is that women limit their sexual roles by the family roles. As an extension of this, they don't represent the types of <b>political</b> <b>interferences</b> such as {{a higher level of}} political party membership, joining the propaganda activites of the political parties they suportland membership of civilian instituons. Income, education and carreer affect women on references to their husbands for their choices about political parties or candidates.

On the other hand, women having a higher level of education and income and the ones working at qualifying jobs don't refer to their husbands for their choices about political parties or candidates, they themselves act according to their beliefs and ideologies...|$|R

When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue <b>political</b> <b>interference</b> in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{national}} accreditation groups {{attempted to}} disaccredit many of Kentucky's public colleges during Clements administration {{in order to}} end longstanding <b>political</b> <b>interference</b> in the higher education system.

In 1948, he weakened Kentucky's Day Law—which enforced segregation of the state's education system—by providing an exception for black medical personnel to take post-graduate courses in white public hospitals. He also supported a 1948 bill that allowed blacks to pursue medical training at the University of Louisville. His efforts to secure a similar arrangement at the University of Kentucky were not successful, despite the governor's status as ex-officio chairman of the Board of Trustees.

5|$|The Maze Prison escape (known to Irish {{republicans}} as the Great Escape) {{took place on}} 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered {{to be one of}} the most escape-proof prisons in Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during the Troubles. In the biggest prison escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a heart attack as a result of the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into the escape placed most of the blame onto prison staff, who in turn blamed the escape on <b>political</b> <b>interference</b> in the running of the prison.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyse}} {{the impact that}} clientelistic {{political}} pressures produces {{on the performance of}} Amia S. p. A., namely the public utility responsible of managing the solid waste management system of the municipality of Palermo, by making particular reference to the phenomenon of overstaffing. Synthetically, clientelism consists in a series of reciprocal convenience-based relationships between politicians and citizens, commanding unequal resources and involving mutually beneficial transactions in terms of economic, social and political consequences. The motivation of this research arise from the conviction that a deep analysis of this phenomenon, on one hand, could offer a greater contribution {{to improve the quality of}} electoral strategies and the consequential public policies and, on the other hand, to facilitate public managers in managing the performance of public organizations according to a perspective of sustainability. Therefore, the major issues of this research can be synthesized into three key questions: which are the main causes that led to the failure of the company Amia SpA? Which are the most remarkable managerial and organizational consequences that clientelistic <b>political</b> <b>interferences</b> have produced in respect of the performance of Amia S. p. A? Which policies could be implemented in order to mitigate the negative effects of clientelism thus maintaining a satisfying standard in the provision of the public service considered herein? Is clientelism a sustainable mechanism to expand significantly the electoral base of a given political party? Due to the high level of dynamic complexity that characterizes the system under observation the author believe that the combination between a dynamic performance management approach based on the so-called instrumental view and the system dynamic methodology may represent a powerful instrument in the hand of policy makers to frame a complex system and understand its development over time. Therefore in order to answer the above questions, firstly, a qualitative model showing which are the key variables of the system and the dynamic produced from their interactions will be elaborated and, secondly, will be identified the performance drivers on which public managers can leverage in order to drive the performance of Amia S. p. A. according to a perspective of sustainability. To conclude, the innovative aspect of this work is the attempt to apply the dynamic performance management approach, combined with the System Dynamics methodology, to assess the impact that clientelistic <b>political</b> <b>interferences</b> produces on the performance of a public utility. Therefore, the usefulness of this study is precisely to provide decision makers with a conceptual map that can enable them to promptly perceive and evaluate the causes and consequences of this phenomenon and, in addition, which policies can be implemented to mitigate the distortive effects that clientelistic <b>political</b> <b>interferences</b> may produces on the performance of a given public utility...|$|R
