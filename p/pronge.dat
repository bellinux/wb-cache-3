5000|$|Kuklinski {{earned the}} {{nickname}} [...] "The Iceman" [...] {{because of his}} experiments in disguising {{the time of death}} of his victims by freezing their corpses in an industrial freezer. Later, he told Carlo that he got the idea from fellow hitman Robert <b>Pronge,</b> nicknamed [...] "Mister Softee", who drove a Mister Softee truck to appear inconspicuous. <b>Pronge</b> taught Kuklinski the different methods of using cyanide to kill his victims. Kuklinski also claimed to have purchased remotely detonated hand grenades from <b>Pronge.</b> <b>Pronge</b> allegedly asked him to carry out a hit on Pronge's own wife and child, which would have been against Kuklinski's stated code against killing women and children. In 1984, <b>Pronge</b> was found shot to death in his truck.|$|E
50|$|Kuklinski's {{daughter}} is later seriously injured by a hit-and-run car accident. Kuklinski suspects <b>Pronge</b> and shoots {{him in a}} public park.|$|E
50|$|During {{the killing}} of Marty Freeman (James Franco) for using DeMeo's name too freely in his {{business}} dealings, Kuklinski meets Robert <b>Pronge</b> (Chris Evans), another hitman for the mob. After DeMeo puts Kuklinski on suspension for allowing a teenage girl to live after witnessing a hit (Kuklinski reveals that he never kills children), he teams up with <b>Pronge,</b> who is a freelancer, and splits the contract payments with him in return for helping him on contract assassinations for DeMeo's boss Leo Marks (Robert Davi).|$|E
5000|$|Michael Shannon plays Kuklinski in the 2012 film The Iceman {{based on}} Anthony Bruno's book The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer. The film also stars Winona Ryder as Kuklinski's wife (renamed Deborah), Ray Liotta as Roy DeMeo, Stephen Dorff as Richard's younger brother Joey, and Chris Evans as Robert [...] "Mr. Softee" [...] (renamed [...] "Mr. Freezy") <b>Pronge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During his suspension, Kuklinski {{begins to}} show more of his anger and rage, {{to the extent of}} {{destroying}} his own kitchen while having an argument with Deborah. Kuklinski also shows paranoia when he looks at a moving ice cream truck and instantly thinks of <b>Pronge.</b> While distracted, Kuklinski bumps his car into another vehicle. The man he hit gets out of his car and insults Kuklinski and his family, which causes Kuklinski to enter such a raging fit that he then initiates a high speed chase after the man through three neighborhoods, again putting his family in danger.|$|E
