40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze consumer behaviour in relation to functional foods by a direct survey. To this end, the proposal is an analysis of the reasons for choosing to consume this type of food or not, accompanied by a supplementary investigation, mostly to assess the relationship between consumption patterns and willingness to pay (WTP) for the most common categories of functional foods, such as milk fortified with CLA (conjugated linoleic acid). Our research shows that a proportion of the population is unaware of the existence of functional foods and their properties. Moreover, it shows that when the concept of functional foods is explained to consumers, this creates a greater willingness to pay for such food, which is strongly linked to type of <b>product</b> <b>carrier</b> but not greatly to income.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the (1) role of gender, age, and education in the evaluation of multidimensional criteria of the purchase of functional products, which were (a) quality and organoleptic attributes, (b) attributes of packaging and labeling, (c) healthful properties, (d) functional components, (e) base <b>product</b> (<b>carrier)</b> and (2) most important motives for the purchase and consumption of functional food among consumers of different sociodemographic profiles. Design: The data were collected in direct interviews. The sample (n = 200) consisted of 137 women and 63 men age 18 – 60  years. The research tool was a questionnaire divided into 4 sections. The first one included quality attributes. The second one included healthful properties, functional components, and carriers. The third one concerned the motives for purchasing functional food and included the consequences and values. In the fourth section the participants were asked about gender, age, and education. Results: Gender, age, and education differentiated the criteria influencing the decision to purchase functional food. Women, older people (35 – 60 years), and those with university education attach the greatest importance to naturalness, nutritional value, freshness, food safety, and quality guarantee. Clear differences between men and women appear in the field of functional components, which are significantly more important for women than for men. Gender, age, and education essentially differentiate the preferences for base <b>product</b> (<b>carrier).</b> Young men prefer meat products in the role of functional carriers. In turn, women and older men prefer cereal products as basic functional carriers. Young consumers are more open to high-technology food processing. Motivations are differentiated by age and gender. Young men, as opposed to women and older men, attach less importance to functional and psychological consequences: improvement of health, healthy eating, conscious choice, and health promotion. Women and older men are more interested in health safety and are more responsible for their health. Among young men, lower self-esteem can be found. Conclusion: The analysis conducted revealed that groups of consumers are significantly different from each other in the evaluation of the significance of each of the variables in the selection of functional food.

Next, an optimization of pre-swirl stators is conducted by CFD. Aside from the prototype stator, three modified stators are designed and the self-propulsion characteristics with these stators are also numerically simulated. The increase order of the evaluated energy-saving effects of these modified stators is seen to be the same as in the design idea.

5000|$|Inert gas is {{produced}} on board crude oil carriers (above 8,000 tonnes)(from Jan 1, 2016) by using either a flue gas system or by burning kerosene in a dedicated inert gas generator. The inert gas system {{is used to}} prevent the atmosphere in cargo tanks or bunkers from coming into the explosive range. IG keeps the oxygen content of the tank atmosphere below 5% (on crude <b>carriers,</b> less for <b>product</b> <b>carriers</b> and gas tankers), thus making any air/hydrocarbon gas mixture in the tank too rich (too high a fuel to oxygen ratio) to ignite.

40|$|In this paper, a {{combined}} mean value–zero dimensional model is developed using a modular {{approach in the}} computational environment of Matlab/Simulink. According to that, only the closed cycle of one engine cylinder is modelled by following the zero-dimensional approach, whereas the cylinder open cycle {{as well as the}} other engine components are modelled according to the mean value concept. The proposed model combines the advantages of the mean value and zero-dimensional models allowing for the calculation of engine performance parameters including the in-cylinder ones in relatively short execution time and therefore, it can be used in cases where the mean value model exceeds its limitations. A large marine four-stroke Diesel engine steady state operation at constant speed was simulated and the results were validated against the engine shop trials data. The model provided results comparable to the respective ones obtained by using a mean value model. Then, a number of simulation runs were performed, so that the mapping of the brake specific fuel consumption for the whole operating envelope was derived. In addition, runs with varying turbocharger turbine geometric area were carried out and the influence of variable turbine geometry on the engine performance was evaluated. Finally, the developed model was used to investigated the propulsion system behaviour of a handymax size <b>product</b> <b>carrier</b> for constant and variable engine speed operation.

30|$|The {{asymmetric}} {{reduction of}} OPBE to (R)-HPBE with resting cells of R. mucilaginosa CCZU-G 5 {{in an aqueous}} medium has been optimized in our previous work (20  mM OPBE, yield 76.3 %, ee 99.2 %, productivity 6.8  g/L/day). The aqueous systems supported a desirable ee value, but the highest substrate concentration that could be transformed with 0.1  g/mL cell was merely 50  mM. To enhance the substrate concentration and overcome the substrate-tolerance obstacle [14, 19], the reaction was explored in the aqueous/organic biphasic system. With the addition of organic solvents, the solubility of the substrate could be enhanced. Besides, the hydrophilic microbial cells (in aqueous phase) could {{be separated from the}} hydrophobic substrate and the product in the organic phase. The selection of the organic solvent as substrate and <b>product</b> <b>carrier</b> in an aqueous/organic solvent biphasic system is based mainly on its biocompatibility towards the biocatalyst and adequate solubility of both substrate and product [20]. Therefore, the influence of organic solvents on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity was studied in 11 different biphasic systems with different log P values ranging from 0.68 to 5.6. In general, there was a positive correlation between the product yield and the log P value of organic solvent (Table  1), with the exceptions of n-hydride and n-decane, which have log P values of over 5 but gave a relatively low product yield. The maximal yield of 98.1 % was achieved in the aqueous/isooctane biphasic system. The yield decreased significantly in the organic solvents with lower log P values such as butyl acetate and EtOAC, which gave a poor yield of 11.3 %. The ee values of (R)-HPBE were higher than 99.0 % when the log P values of the organic solvents were more than 3.2. Considering the yield and the ee value, the aqueous/isooctane biphasic system was selected for further study.|$|E
