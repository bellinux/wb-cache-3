40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} intercluster and intracluster phenotypic and geneticdiversity of autochthonous strains of Leuconostoc spp., considering the fact that very little isknown about <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of genetically closely related Leuconostoc strains. PFGE (SmaI, ApaI) and RAPD-PCR (M 13) were used to evaluate molecular diversity of the 28 isolates. Representatives of clusters were selected for 16 S rDNA sequencing. Interclusterand intracluster carbohydrate metabolism of all the isolates was evaluated using API 50 CHtest. Twenty different genomic fingerprints distributed in two main clusters were obtained byPFGE. RAPD-PCR (M 13) was less discriminant than PFGE. The study demonstrated thatgenetically closely related isolates (100 % clustering of PFGE profiles), will not necessarilydemonstrate the same <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristics,</b> indicating that <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristics</b> ofautochthonous Leuconostoc isolates are exclusively isolate specific. Therefore, geneticselection of isolates by clustering for further phenotypic characterisation of somerepresentatives, might lead to loss of important <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Furthermore, PFGE demonstrated to be efficient molecular tool for differentiation of Ln. mesenteroidessusbp. cremoris and Ln. pseudomesenteroides, that has not been reportedpreviously.

40|$|Chantier qualité GAThis study {{analyzed}} {{the abundance of}} 24 different proteins, tenderness biomarkers, and 11 <b>phenotypic</b> carcass <b>characteristics</b> and muscle properties. This was done on 111 samples of two muscles, Longissimus thoracis (LT) and Semitendinosus (ST) from the Charolais bovine breed. The strategy was to constitute three classes of tenderness on the two muscles separately on the shear-force data (Warner-Bratzler). Then we tested which proteins or <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristics</b> explained this classification. Results showed that tenderness classes of ST muscle were well-explained by 12 proteins and 6 <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> However, for LT muscle the classification could only be explained by 7 <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This demonstrates that in ST and LT the variability of beef tenderness is explained by different factors. In ST muscle, the main {{results of this study}} demonstrated the importance of Heat Shock Proteins such as Hsp 27 (P = 0. 002) and the oxidative stress protein: PRDX 6 (P = 0. 003). We also confirmed the role of Enolase 3, involved in glycolytic metabolism (P = 0. 003), and contractile protein such as MyHC IIx (P = 0. 028) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic problem}} in {{morphological}} phylogenetics is {{the assembly of}} a matrix representing a mapping {{from each of the}} taxa being compared to representative measurements for each of the phenotypic characteristics being used as a classifier. The types of phenotypic data used to construct this matrix depend on the taxa being compared; for individual species, they may involve measurements of average body size, lengths or sizes of particular bones or other physical features, or even behavioral manifestations. Of course, since not every possible <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristic</b> could be measured and encoded for analysis, the selection of which features to measure is a major inherent obstacle to the method. The decision of which traits to use as a basis for the matrix necessarily represents a hypothesis about which traits of a species or higher taxon are evolutionarily relevant. Morphological studies can be confounded by examples of convergent evolution of phenotypes. A major challenge in constructing useful classes is the high likelihood of inter-taxon overlap in the distribution of the phenotype's variation. The inclusion of extinct taxa in morphological analysis is often difficult due to absence of or incomplete fossil records, but has been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the trees produced; in one study only the inclusion of extinct species of apes produced a morphologically derived tree that was consistent with that produced from molecular data.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Chi-square {{analysis}} {{is a popular}} means of analyzing data from inheritance studies. Such an analysis, though, can be inappropriate when the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristic</b> under study is a continuous variable. We argue that arbitrary categorization of continuous variables can either seriously invalidate or make powerless a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. We propose an alternative test based on kernel density estimates. The test makes no assumption about the underlying distribution of the phenotypic variables. Furthermore, kernel density estimates provide an appealing means of describing the distribution of continuous variables...|$|E

40|$|Plants possess {{biological}} and operational attributes that have encouraged geneticists {{to use them}} extensively {{in the development of}} fundamental genetic concepts. Attributes such as regenerative plasticity, high fecundity, cultural adaptability, range of ploidy, economics of culture and maintenance of specific populations, and versatility make plant genetic systems prime candidates with which to monitor the environment for mutagens. A specific locus (equivalent to a classical Mendelian gene) controls the development of a <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristic.</b> It can also mutate to a new allelic form with a consequentially altered <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristic</b> and can be separated by crossing over from adjacent loci that govern other specific phenotypic characteristics. Since various plant species have numerous specific loci, one has a rich array of potential systems from which to select. Specific locus systems in higher plants could be used to assess the mutagenicity of single chemical compounds or combinations of chemical compounds. Depending on the circumstances, seeds and/or seedlings could be used; plants could be grown in situ in either containers or plots to assess the immediate environment for one or more mutagens over an extended period. Since plants are eucaryotes, data from such experiments could serve as one more source of information along with that obtained from a battery of other tests used in the tier system...|$|E

The experiment was set up as a completely randomized design with three replications in a factorial arrangement.

The results showed that most of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>characteristics</b> significantly altered as a result of endophyte infection in both tall fescue and meadow fescue plants. Results of analysis of variance showed that the influence of endophyte fungus was positive and significant on tiller number, herbage yield, dry crown weight, dry root weight per plant, and crown depth. Also between plant accessions, there were significant differences for dry herbage yield, crown weight, dry root weight per plant, crown depth, and dry matter percentage. Plant by endophyte interaction was highly significant for crown depth and dry root weight per plant.
