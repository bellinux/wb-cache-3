The purpose of this research is to model and analyze the dynamics of a hot gas <b>vane</b> <b>motor</b> for design optimization work. The pneumatic motor is a portable direct drive actuator that is intended as an alternative to battery-powered electromagnetic motors. It is believed that the <b>vane</b> <b>motor</b> could replace other solutions for portable power generation. An optimal design of the motor is desirable to maximize portability and efficiency. Modeling the device will make it possible to optimize the mechanical efficiency by altering the geometry of the <b>motor's</b> <b>vanes</b> and respective chambers. The modeling of the device focuses on determining the net amount of torque that is produced by the high pressures that drive the device. While the efficiency of the motor is affected to a great extent by its geometry, losses from friction will also be considered. A model of Stribeck friction was developed to account for losses from friction. For the device to remain portable, there are limitations {{on the size of the}} final design which will restrict the optimal efficiency of the <b>vane</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|R

40|$|Tremor, {{characterized}} by involuntary and rhythmical movements, {{is the most}} common movement disorder. Tremors can have peripheral and central oscillatory components which properly assessed and separated may improve diagnostics. An MR-safe haptic wrist manipulator enables simultaneous measurement of proprioceptive reflexes (peripheral components) and brain activations (central components) through fMRI. For such a MR-safe manipulator, this study determined the design criteria, created the design and presented its prototype. The prototype is divided into an MR-safe and MR-unsafe part. The hydraulic MR-safe <b>vane</b> <b>motor</b> (end effector) and optical sensors in the MR-environment are connected to the MR-unsafe part in the control room via hydraulic tubes and optical fibers. As a result, the fMRI quality is ensured and the manipulator is suited for safe use in any MR-environment. During a test in an MR-scanner (AMC, Amsterdam) no distortions in the MR-image or sensor signal were observed. The <b>vane</b> <b>motor</b> has a range of motion of 134 ° with a designed torque delivery of 8 Nm at a 3 bar pressure difference. The achieved accuracy for the torque sensor is ± 2 % full scale (F. S. = 14. 3 Nm) and for the absolute position sensor ± 1 % full scale (F. S. = 70 = 1. 22 rad). The prototype <b>vane</b> <b>motor</b> had some leakage along the axis, this prevented the use of pre-pressure and consequently reduced the bandwidth and maximum torque. However the maximum achieved torque of 1. 5 Nm was still enough to met the requirement of 1. 2 Nm. A PI controller was used to control the system, however this controller could not cope with the inherent non-linearities of hydraulics over the intended bandwidth (20 Hz). Despite the fact that the controller was not optimal, typical responses were obtained with impedance FRFs of two inertial loads. For future research it is recommended to remedy the axis leakage and implement a model-based controller. The open-loop FRF of the commanded velocity to the measured vane velocity was determined to characterize the system. Even with leakage and without pre-pressure, the measured bandwidth (- 3 dB) was approximately 5 Hz and the - 180 ° phase is passed at 7 Hz. Although the bandwidth does not fulfill the requirement for proprioceptive reflex identification it does allow for various motor control experiments. With the recommendations carried out, it is expected that the next prototype will be suited for proprioceptive reflex identification during fMRI.

5000|$|Compressed air is {{the most}} common power source for impact wrenches, {{providing}} a low-cost design with the best power-to-weight ratio. A simple <b>vane</b> <b>motor</b> is almost always used, usually with four to seven vanes, and various lubrication systems, the most common of which uses oiled air, while others may include special oil passages routed to the parts that need it and a separate, sealed oil system for the hammer assembly. Most impact wrenches drive the hammer directly from the motor, giving it fast action when the fastener requires only low torque. Other designs use a gear reduction system before the hammer mechanism, most often a single-stage planetary gearset usually with a heavier hammer, delivering a more constant speed and higher [...] "spin" [...] torque. Electric impact wrenches are available, either mains powered, or for automotive use, 12-volt, 18-volt or 24-volt DC-powered. Recently, cordless electric impact wrenches have become common, although typically their power outputs are significantly lower than corded electric or air-powered equivalents. Some industrial tools are hydraulically powered, using high-speed hydraulic motors, and are used in some heavy equipment repair shops, large construction sites, and other areas where a suitable hydraulic supply is available. Hydraulic impact wrenches have the advantage of high power-to-weight ratio.|$|R
50|$|A type of {{pneumatic}} motor, {{known as}} a rotary <b>vane</b> <b>motor,</b> uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft. The rotating element is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely sliding rectangular vane. The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft. Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and {{the diameter of the}} housing. One application for vane-type air motors is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines. Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor. This causes the rotor to turn at high speed. Because the engine flywheel requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used. Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input. These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the engine flywheel while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or air starter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — It {{is now a}} banal {{truth that}} the {{environment}} is being subjected to plenty of environmental hazards. These are attributable to pollution that has completely overwhelmed the environment {{which in turn is}} also responsible for bringing about atrocious changes to the environment. The principle reason behind this change is increased carbon emission. Every day, a huge amount of carbon is released in the air because of burning fuel which results in Global Warming. People are gradually realizing this concern and have gradually started to use alternative sources of energy. This paper is about a design of an application which will help facilitate a revolution in Bangladesh. In this design Four <b>Vane</b> Air <b>Motors</b> act as the prime mover. <b>Vane</b> Air <b>Motors</b> contain <b>vanes</b> within an air tight body onto which air at high pressure is passed.

40|$|Tremor, {{characterized}} by involuntary and rhythmical movements, {{is the most}} common movement disorder. Tremor can have peripheral and central oscillatory components which properly assessed may improve diagnostics. A magnetic resonance (MR) -safe haptic wrist manipulator enables simultaneous measurement of proprioceptive reflexes (peripheral components) and brain activations (central components) through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The presented design for an MR-safe haptic wrist manipulator has electrohydraulic closed-circuit actuation, optical position and force sensing, and consists of exclusively non-conductive and magnetically compatible materials inside the MR-environment (Zone IV). The MR-safe hydraulic actuator, a custom-made plastic <b>vane</b> <b>motor,</b> is connected to the magnetic parts and electronics located in the shielded control room (Zone III) via hydraulic hoses and optical fibers. Deliberate internal leakage provides backdriveability, damping, and circumvents friction. The manipulator is completely MR-safe and therefore operates safely in any MR-environment while ensuring fMRI imaging quality. Undesired external leakage in the actuator prevented the use of prepressure, limiting the control bandwidth. The compact end effector design fits in the MR-scanner, is easily setup, and can be clamped to the MR-scanner bed. This enables use of the manipulator with the subject at the optimal fMRI location and allows it to be setup quickly, saving costly MR-scanner time. The actuation and sensor solutions performed well inside the MR-environment and did not deteriorate image quality, which allows for various motor control experiments. Enabling prepressure by carrying out the recommendations on fabrication and sealing should improve the bandwidth and fulfill the requirements for proprioceptive reflex identificatio...|$|R

In view of these issues extensive researches are being carried out to explore the alternative energy source and or to find out appropriate energy conversion system. The atmospheric air once compressed, it is found as potential working fluid to produce shaft work for an air turbine and releases almost zero pollution in the environment. This paper details the mathematical modeling of a small capacity compressed air driven novel multi-vanes type air turbine. Effect of expansion of high pressure air collected between two consecutive vanes at different vane angles and varying inlet pressure have been analyzed here. The study shows that the total shaft power is found optimum at injection angle 60 o when vane angle θ= 36 o (10 vanes) and it reduces at injection angle 45 o when vane angle θ= 51. 4 o (7 vanes) and further goes down at injection angle 30 o when vane angle θ= 60 o- 72 o (6 - 5 vanes), for injection pressure 6 bar and speed of rotation 2500 rpm.

40|$|Vane {{pumps are}} simple in {{principle}} {{and can be}} mass produced inexpensively, making them well suited to the automotive industry. They also have many other applications, {{such as in the}} chemical industry and food industry. A common type of damage to a vane pump is cavitation erosion on the side plates. If this damage is not detected in time, it could cause failure of the pump, which {{depending on the type of}} system may have safety implications, and in some cases a high cost from lost production whilst the system is shut down. This kind of damage is common on other types of pumps such as gear pumps and piston pumps. So a practical method for fault diagnosis of hydraulic pumps is required which does not necessitate removal of a pump from the working system. This paper presents a method of detecting and identifying cavitation damage on pump side plates via pump flow ripple. <b>Power</b> steering <b>vane</b> pumps are used for this study, although the principles may also be applicable to other types of vane pump, and indeed to piston and gear pumps. The investigation has been done through measurement and simulation. A numerical model of a vane pump is described, and simulated cavitation damage is introduced into the model. This damage is shown to have a clear effect on the simulated flow ripple. The pump flow ripple has also been measured experimentally using the Secondary Source Method, and artificial damage has been introduced into the pump. The damage is shown to have a clear effect on the measured flow ripple, consistent with the simulation results. Whilst the secondary source enables the measurement of flow ripple in laboratory conditions, it is generally impracticable for in-situ measurement for condition monitoring. A simplified method for calculation of pump flow ripple from in-situ pump pressure ripple measurements and system impedance is discussed...|$|R

In the case of press-in piles a correlation between driving force and in-situ soil strength could help to confirm or modify design assumptions. In order to gain an insight to the problem, a new Rowe Cell-Vane Shear apparatus has been developed to rotate shear vanes inserted in reconstituted beds of sandy clay consolidated at 200 kN/m 2 over a wide range of shearing velocities. The apparatus consists of a modified triaxial test frame, double Rowe cell consolidometer, associated pressure unit, laboratory <b>vanes</b> with servo <b>motor</b> and gear head connected to a motion controller, torque transducer and data logging device. Three vanes 20 mm in diameter and length 20 mm, 40 mm and 80 mm were used.

The results of the investigation highlight that the peak shear resistance recorded increases with increasing peripheral velocity and conform to power and semi logarithmic correlations. It was found that the magnitude of vane displacement required to achieve full mobilisation of soil shear strength was dependant on the applied rate of shear. The failure of the material at low velocities was ductile and became more brittle with increasing velocity of shearing. Furthermore, secondary shear resistance is proposed as a possible technique to provide a better estimate of shear resistance as the impact of rate effects are reduced...|$|R

Moreover, new and adapted NDE-methods have been investigated to assure the quality of the composite during the three-step LSI-process. For example, using novel air-coupled ultrasonics, it is possible to examine the CMC product at every manufacture step, including the highly porous carbon-carbon phase. This permits an almost complete analysis of the whole LSI process and enables an early detection of faults. Another novel approach for quality assurance are thermographic methods, which allow a fast global damage assessment by analyzing the heat transfer into the component. Both, the thermographic analysis and air-coupled ultrasonics, are non-contact methods for damage assessment and can be used in any stage of production. Additionally, a current technology project of DLRs space research will be described. An experimental TPS structure which is planned to be launched with a Russian FOTON capsule, has been designed and manufactured to evaluate different coating materials under reentry conditions. Chemical vapor deposited SiC, low pressure plasma sprayed yttrium silicate and titanium dioxide coatings were applied on the surface of a C/C-SiC panel of 300 mm diameter. The paper deals with different aspects of the design, manufacture and quality assurance of C/C-SiC composites with respect to their use in jet <b>vanes</b> of rocket <b>motors</b> and for thermal protection systems...|$|R
