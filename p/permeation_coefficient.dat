Partitioning coefficients range from 0. 3 to 205 respectively for phenol and pentachlorophenol. Diffusion coefficients lie in the range 1. 1 × 10 - 13 to 4. 3 × 10 - 13 m 2 /s respectively for 2 -methylphenol and bisphenol A.

In order to learn more about this, we examined the influence of high hydrostatic pressure on the permeation of raspberry ketone (dissolved in ethanol/water) through polyamide- 6 films at temperatures between 20 and 60 ºC. Permeation was lowered by increasing pressure at all temperatures. At 23 °C, the increasing pressure sequence 0. 1, 50, 100, 150, and 200 MPa correlated with the decreasing <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficients</b> P/(10 (9) cm² s- 1) of 6. 2, 3. 8, 3. 0, 2. 2, and 1. 6. Analysis of the permeation kinetics indicated that this effect was due to a reduced diffusion coefficient. Pressure and temperature acted antagonistically to each other. The decrease in permeation at 200 MPa was compensated for by a temperature increase of 20 ºC. After release of pressure, the former <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficients</b> were recovered, which suggests that this `pressure effect' is reversible. Taken together, our data revealed no detrimental effects of high hydrostatic pressure on the barrier properties of polymer films...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aims of {{the study}} are to develop and {{evaluate}} an in vitro rat intestine segmental perfusion model for the prediction of the oral fraction absorbed of compounds and to assess {{the ability of the}} model to study intestinal metabolism. METHODS: The system consisted of a perfusion cell with a rat intestinal segment and three perfusion circulations (donor, receiver, and rinsing circulation). Lucifer yellow (LY) was applied as internal standard together with test compounds in the donor circulation. To validate the model, the permeability of eight noncongeneric passively absorbed drugs was determined. Intestinal N-demethylation of verapamil into norverapamil was followed in the donor and receiver circulations by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. RESULTS: The in vitro model allowed ranking of the tested compounds according to their in vivo absorption potential. The Spearman's correlation coefficient between the oral fraction absorbed in humans and the ratio of <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of test compound to the <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of LY within the same experiment was 0. 98 (P < 0. 01). Moreover, intestinal N-demethylation of verapamil, its permeation, and the permeation of its metabolite norverapamil could be assessed in parallel.

Vertical Franz-type cells with a diffusional surface area of 9. 62 cm 2 were used to study the permeation of these diclofenac salts from their saturated solutions through an internal pig ear membrane. The receptor compartments of the cells contained 100 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4); a saturated solution (5 mL) of each salt was placed in the donor compartment, thermostated at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals over 8 h and then immediately analyzed by HPLC.

40|$|Für die definierte und konstante Wirkstofffreigabe aus therapeutischen Systemen sind Kenntnisse der Mikrostruktur vonKontrollmembranen von großer Bedeutung. Durch eine Additionsreaktion können Polydimethylsiloxan-Membranen ausvinylendgestoppten linearen Polydimethylsiloxanen und niedermolekularen Si-H-funktionalisierten Polydimethylsiloxanen unterEinfluss eines Platin- Katalysators hergestellt werden. Hierbei ist es durch den Einsatz genau charakterisierterAusgangspolymere möglich, Membranen mit einer statistisch definierten Mikrostruktur zu erhalten. Die Mikrostruktur kanndurch die Netzbogenlänge charakterisiert werden. Der Abschnitt zwischen zwei Verknüpfungspunkten in einem Netzwerk wirdals Netzbogenlänge (NBL) bezeichnet. Diese beschreibt die Anzahl der Dimethyl-siloxan-Einheiten zwischen zweiVerknüpfungen. Die Permeationseigenschaften wurden mit Hilfe des standardisierten Permeationskoeffizienten untersucht. Derstandardisierte Permeationskoeffizient ist von der mittleren Netzbogenlänge der Polydimethylsiloxan-Membranen abhängig. Dieser Zusammenhang wurde an elf Benzoesäure- und Naphthalinderivaten als Modellsubstanzen untersucht und bestätigt. Hierbei wurden Membranen mit den mittleren Netzbogenlängen 65, 99 und 122 Siloxan-Einheiten für die Untersuchungeneingesetzt. Bei allen untersuchten Substanzen stieg der Permeationskoeffizient mit größer werdender Netzbogenlänge derMembranen geringfügig an. Die Permeationskoeffizienten von Membranen mit der Netzbogenlänge 122 waren dabei - mitlediglich vier Ausnahmen - stets statistisch signifikant größer als von Membranen mit der Netzbogenlänge 65. Als mögliche weitere Einflussfaktoren auf die Permeationsgeschwindigkeit wurden der Membran/Wasser-Verteilungskoeffizient, dasDipolmoment und das van der Waals-Volumen der elf Modellsubstanzen untersucht. Es konnte ein Zusammenhang zwischendem Membran/Wasser-Verteilungskoeffizienten und dem Permeationskoeffizienten aufgezeigt werden. Das Volumen deruntersuchten permeierenden Moleküle hat jedoch nur bei Netzbogenlängen kleiner als 122 einen Einfluss auf diePermeationsgeschwindigkeit. Als neue Möglichkeit zur Untersuchung der Diffusionskinetik vor Erreichen des stationärenZustands in Polydimethylsiloxan-Membranen wurde die konfokale Raman-Spektroskopie eingesetzt. Bei derRaman-Spektroskopie wird das Probensystem während der Messung weder zerstört noch verändert. Weiterhin ist es möglich,durch das gekoppelte konfokale Mikroskop gezielt an einem bestimmten Punkt innerhalb der Membran zu messen. Damitkönnen nun dynamische Vorgänge wie der Aufbau eines Konzentrationsgradienten vor Erreichen des stationären Zustandes aneinem bestimmten Punkt in einer Membran über einen längeren Zeitraum gemessen werden. Anhand von Intensitätsänderungencharakteristischer Peaks oder der Verschiebung von Banden werden Konzentrations- und Strukturänderungen der Membranund der permeierenden Moleküle sichtbar. Die Untersuchungen mit der konfokalen Raman-Spektroskopie zeigten, dass dieseMethode geeignet ist, Diffusionskinetiken im nicht stationären Zustand innerhalb der Membranen zu beobachten. The {{knowledge}} of the microstructure of controlling membranes {{is very important in}} order to achieve a defined and constantdrug release from therapeutic systems. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes can be prepared by an addition reaction of linearpoly(dimethylsiloxanes) with terminal vinyl groups and low molecular poly(dimethylsiloxanes) with Si-H functional groups. Forthis reaction a Platinum catalyst is used. By using well characterized starting polymers it is possible to get membranes with astatistically defined microstructure. The network chain length can characterize the microstructure. The distance between twopoints of cross-linking within the network is called network chain length (NCL). The network chain length describes the numberof the dimethyl- siloxane-units between two cross-linking points. The properties of permeation were investigated by using the stadardized <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient</b> is dependent on the average network chain length of thepoly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes. This relationship was confirmed for 11 benzoic acid and hydroxynaphthalene derivates. Membranes with network chain lengths of 65, 99 and 122 were used for these investigations. The <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient</b> P*increases slightly with rising network chain length for all 11 model substances. The <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the membraneswith network chain length of 122 was found to be higher by a statistically significant amount than those of membranes with anetwork chain length of 65 - having only 4 exceptions. In order to find other factors which influence the permeation rate, the membrane/water-partition coefficient, the dipole moment and the van der Waals volume were investigated. There was amathematically relationship between the membrane/water-partition coefficient and the <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The volume of themoleculeshad only with membranes with a network chain length of 122 an influence on the permeation. ConfocalRaman-spectroscopy was taken as a pioneering method to investigate the kinetics of diffusion before reaching the steady statein poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes. Up to now it was only possible to investigate the diffusion process in the steady state. The membrane was always taken as a whole. Raman-spectroscopic measurements do not destroy or change the probe system. Because of the coupled confocal microscope it is possible to measure selectively at a defined point in the membrane.

We report here the permeation behavior of major ions (Na, Ca, Mg, F, Cl, and SO 4) in natural waters during ultrafiltration using an Amicon 1 kDa ultrafiltration membrane (S 10 N 1). Water samples across a salinity gradient of 0 – 20 % were collected from the Trinity River and Galveston Bay. The permeation behavior of major ions was well predicted by a permeation model, resulting in a constant <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient</b> for each ion. The value of the model-derived <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Pc) was 0. 99 for Na, 0. 97 for Cl, and 0. 95 for F, respectively, in Trinity River waters. Values of Pc close to 1 indicate that retention of Na, Cl, and F by the 1 kDa membrane during ultrafiltration was indeed minimal (51 – 5 %). In contrast, significant (14 – 36 %) retention was observed for SO 4, Ca, and Mg in Trinity River waters, with a Pc value of 0. 64, 0. 82, and 0. 86 for SO 4, Ca and Mg, respectively.

They do not depend directly on the water:ether partition coefficient which increases regularly with chain length. Instead there is a minimum at acetamide.

This factor is of the same magnitude, though opposite in sign to the effect of lipid solubility, thus accounting for the minimum.

As the solute chain length increases the interface resistance becomes more important, until for valeramide it comprises about 90 % of the total resistance.

Among the derivatives synthesized, tocopherol succinate glycol chitosan (GC-TOS) conjugates spontaneously formed micelles in aqueous solution with a critical micelle concentration of 2 μg mL− 1. AFM and TEM analysis showed that spherical micelles were formed. The GC-TOS increased water solubility of 2 model class II drugs. GC-TOS loading efficiency was 2. 4 % (w/w) for ketoconazole and 0. 14 % (w/w) for itraconazole, respectively. GC-TOS was non-cytotoxic at concentrations up to 10 mg mL− 1.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} aims at developing microemulsion-based formulations for topical delivery of acyclovir. Various microemulsions were developed using isopropyl myristate/Captex 355 /Labrafac as an oil phase, Tween 20 as surfactant, Span 20 as cosurfactant, and water/dimethylsulfoxide (1 : 3) as an aqueous phase. Transcutol, eucalyptus oil, and peppermint oil {{were used as}} permeation enhancers. In vitro permeation studies through laca mice skin were performed using Franz diffusion cells. The optimum formulation containing 2. 5 % Transcutol as the penetration enhancer showed 1. 7 -fold enhancement in flux and <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficient</b> as compared to marketed cream and ointment formulation. In vivo antiviral studies were performed in female Balb/c mice against induced herpes simplex virus I infection. A single application of microemulsion formulation containing 2. 5 % Transcutol given 24  h post-injection resulted in complete suppression of development of herpetic skin lesions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring processing, {{storage and}} consumption, mass {{transfer}} of various molecules (water, gases, flavour compounds or other solutes) occur {{between the different}} phases in complex food products, and/or also between the complex food and its surroundings. These mass transfers can lead to physical and/or chemical changes and thus induce food quality modifications. The objective of this presentation is {{to better understand the}} behaviour of small molecules at the interfaces, especially in model heterogeneous food systems. Different techniques have been developed to characterize their properties and their impact on the mass transfers. Particularly, techniques such as rotative diffusion cell or Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopic analyses with modelling have been set up. Five examples of results are displayed to demonstrate the influence of the physical-chemical parameters (thermodynamic such as partition coefficient, hydrophobicity… or kinetic parameters like sorption, diffusion and <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficients)</b> on mass transfers. These examples focus on water (liquid or vapour) through polysaccharidic edible films, on flavour compounds in dairy emulsions or in pectic gels. Not only the composition of the matrix but both the structure and the process also influence the mass transfer. Observed results can be explained by similar phenomena, even if applications seem very different...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a continuous single-step route that permits preparation of a thermostable polymer/metal nanocomposite film and to combine different functional properties {{in a unique}} material. More precisely, palladium nanoparticles are in situ generated in a polyimide matrix thanks to a designed curing cycle which is applied to a polyamic acid/metal precursor solution cast on a glass plate. A metal-rich surface layer which is strongly bonded to the bulk film is formed in addition to homogeneously dispersed metal nanoparticles.

The most desirable properties of a hemodialysis membrane are high mass transfer of toxic solutes to reduce the dialysis time, blood compatibility and limited protein adsorption capacity. Protein adsorption or deposition on the surface or in its pores results in a progressive decline in flux, change of selectivity of the membrane and the activation of different defense systems in blood. To prepare hemodialysis membranes with improved transport properties and protein adsorption resistant surfaces, an enzyme immobilization technique was used. Asymmetric cellulose acetate membranes were prepared through dry phase inversion method and they were modified by blending urease enzyme directly into the casting solution. The effect of enzyme immobilization on the protein adsorption, solute transport rates and mechanical properties was investigated through static adsorption and permeation experiments, mechanical tests and structural characterization by scanning electron microscope. It {{was found that the}} solute permeation rates decreased exponentially while the maximum tensile strength of the membranes increased significantly by increasing the cellulose acetate (CA) to acetone weight fraction ratio in the membrane forming solution due to a change in the structure from porous to dense one. Modification of the CA membrane with urease immobilization increased the <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of creatinine and uric acid by a factor of 1. 2 and 1. 7, respectively. Similarly, the % removal of urea from the donor compartment in 1 hour increased from 45. 8 % to 53. 2 % by using urease immobilized CA membrane. The protein adsorption capacity of the urease immobilized CA membrane was found to be 2 times lower than that of the regular CA membrane. Protein fouling on the membranes caused a decrease in the transport rates of all solutes. Due to protein fouling, the decrease in the <b>permeation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of creatinine and uric acid are 59. 0 % and 76. 5 %, respectively, through regular CA membranes. On the other hand, urease immobilization limited the decrease in the permeation rates by 39. 2 % and 33. 4 % for creatinine and uric acid, respectively. In a similar way, the rate of removal of urea through CA membrane and urease immobilized CA membrane decreased by 31. 2 % and 11. 7 %, respectively. While urease immobilization decreased the protein adsorption capacity, it did not cause any loss in mechanical strength of the membrane. These results indicate that urease immobilization can be used to improve transport properties and reduce protein adsorption capacity of the CA membranes. Urease immobilized CA membranes prepared in this study can be used as an alternative membrane in hemodialysis units...|$|R
