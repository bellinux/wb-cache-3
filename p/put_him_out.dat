5|$|In February, Clarke {{suffered}} from {{an attack of}} jaundice that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action for about six weeks. He was visited regularly by Maunsell who was, by that time, a firm friend.|$|E
5|$|In the May tournament he lost to Kisenosato on {{the opening}} day. He injured his back in this match and {{subsequent}} losses to Kotoōshū (the eventual winner of the tournament) and Chiyotaikai <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of contention.|$|E
5|$|After strong podiums in Monaco and Canada, Hill {{took his}} first career pole in France, {{finishing}} second to Prost after team orders prevented him from seriously challenging for the win. He looked set to win his home race in Britain before another engine failure <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> and led the German Grand Prix comfortably only to suffer a puncture with two laps left, handing the win to Prost.|$|E
50|$|On July 6, it was {{revealed}} that Ward underwent foot surgery, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action until mid-August.|$|R

5|$|At {{the first}} night race in Formula One, the , Webber {{qualified}} in 13th position. Red Bull pulled in both Webber and David Coulthard for their pit stops {{as soon as they}} could when the safety car came on track, due to Nelson Piquet, Jr. crashing, giving them both great track position. This led to Webber running in 2nd place before a gearbox issue <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the race on lap 29.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} that Hogeboom had murdered Fontaine and kidnapped Elsa, Phelps and Kelso pursue {{him into the}} Los Angeles River Tunnels as a heavy rain begins, fighting their way through corrupt policemen and thugs. The pair rescue Elsa, with Kelso killing Hogeboom to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of his mental anguish. With the water level rising, the group use an open manhole to escape, but Phelps is swept away in the current. Whilst the SRF scam is exposed, several members escape justice by making {{a deal with the}} Assistant D.A. to testify. They attend Phelps's funeral, each delivering eulogies to his memory, much to the disgust of Elsa. Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed. The lights that can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.|$|E

5|$|He {{was still}} {{suffering}} from the shoulder injury in June 2004, and under new manager Russell Slade, Young endured a frustrating spell. A cold {{he was suffering from}} in August 2004 required treatment from physio Dave Moore as it <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action. Young joined Conference National club Northwich Victoria on 7 October 2004 on a one-month loan, having made five appearances for Grimsby up to that point in 2004–05. He made his debut two days later in a 0–0 away draw with Crawley Town. On 23 October 2014, he scored his first goal for Northwich in a 3–1 away victory over Forest Green Rovers with a close-range shot. He was recalled by Grimsby later that month due to injuries after making three appearances for Northwich. He rejoined Northwich on 3 December 2004 on another one-month loan, with injury restricting him to three appearances before returning to Grimsby on 6 January 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts {{to put out a}}n unforced preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails to put out a forced preceding runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails to put out an unforced preceding runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required to determine whether the batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt to put out a preceding runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder's choice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'His history here!' exclaimed the Manager. 'Why, {{there it}} is. The {{very fact that}} makes him an extreme case, <b>puts</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the whole chapter! Well?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, there's not. Courbertin doesn't {{know the}} first thing. St. Vincent evidently cannot cross the slough. Mr. Welse's arm <b>puts</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of it. So it's only you and I, Tommy." ...|$|R
5|$|Gibbs was {{appointed}} club captain {{at the start}} of the 1992–93 season. The team started the season with three First Division defeats in their opening six games, keeping just one clean sheet. However, on an individual level the season was to get even worse for Gibbs. He sustained a knee injury against Notts County on 7 September 1992, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of first team contention for six weeks. During his comeback, at home to Tranmere Rovers, Gibbs aggravated the previous injury, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action for more than two years. Concern over the injury, coupled with the good form of Gerard Lavin, restricted Gibbs' opportunities under Glenn Roeder in 1994–95.|$|R
25|$|When {{the ball}} {{has been in}} the bowler’s or wicket-keeper’s hands, the strikers need not keep within their ground till the Umpire has called Play; but if the player goes out of his ground with an intent to run before the ball is delivered, the bowler may <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|The car {{made its}} debut in the 1967 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, showing promise with fourth and sixth places in the heats before a missed gear by McLaren in the final race <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> with engine failure. In the Spring Trophy at Oulton Park McLaren managed fifth place in both heats and the race, and came fifth again in the International Trophy at Silverstone.|$|E
25|$|In the PBL Unity Cup of that year, the Toyota-Otis team, {{now known}} as the Sparks, beat {{defending}} champions Rain or Shine Elasto Painters in a best-of-five series, setting up a best-of-five final game against the Harbour Centre Portmasters. Aaron Aban received a wrist injury which <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of Games 4 and 5 and the Portmasters defeated the Sparks. Devance was named MVP of the tournament.|$|E
50|$|Villalobos {{started his}} college career at Cal State Northridge in 2010, having sat out 2009 as a red-shirted year. However, he {{suffered}} the fourth leg break {{of his career}} in 2011, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> injured for over 15-months.|$|R
50|$|Late in Spring training, {{third baseman}} Chone Figgins {{fractured}} his finger, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> {{of action for}} {{the first month of}} the season. This unexpected injury led Maicer Izturis to claim the start at third base entering the season.|$|R
25|$|In the Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} {{match against}} Switzerland on 7 September 2010, Walcott was stretchered off {{after he was}} clipped in the build-up to Wayne Rooney's opener for England after 10 minutes <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action for several weeks.|$|R
25|$|At {{the age of}} 24, Alboreto {{made his}} Formula One debut at the 1981 San Marino Grand Prix for the Cosworth-powered Tyrrell Racing team, {{replacing}} Ricardo Zunino after the Argentine failed to impress team boss Ken Tyrrell. Unfortunately for the Italian, a collision with fellow countryman Beppe Gabbiani <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the race after completing 31 of the 60 laps. Alboreto failed to score a single point during his debut year, his highest position being ninth at the Dutch Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|Tsonga then {{participated in}} the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam, Netherlands. He {{defeated}} Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, Michaël Llodra, and Ivan Ljubičić to reach his first final since winning the Japan Open in 2009, but lost there to Robin Söderling. At the Open 13 tennis tournament, Tsonga lost to Russian Mikhail Youzhny in the quarterfinals. A day later, he declared that he had sustained another ankle injury, which again <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of Davis Cup action against Austria. Tsonga fell in the opening round at the 2011 BNP Paribas Open.|$|E
25|$|The Raptors {{underwent}} a significant roster overhaul in the preseason, such as bringing Jarrett Jack from Indiana {{to play as}} Calderón's back-up and point forward Hedo Türkoğlu to share in ball-handling duties. With {{a third of the}} season gone, the Spaniard picked up an injury that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> for 12 games, resulting in Jack holding on to the starting spot even upon the former's return, paralleling the Ford-Calderón scenario in 2007–08. Still, the pair combined well and helped bring the Raptors to a 21–20 record at the mid-season mark.|$|E
50|$|Already without Keenan Allen for {{the entire}} season, running back Danny Woodhead {{suffered}} a torn ACL, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> for the season. Nevertheless, the Chargers {{would go on to}} burn the Jaguars, winning 38-14 and with that, they went to 1-1.|$|R
50|$|In the Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} {{match against}} Switzerland on 7 September 2010, Walcott was stretchered off {{after he was}} clipped in the build-up to Wayne Rooney's opener for England after 10 minutes <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action for several weeks.|$|R
50|$|Inness had {{a series}} of injury {{setbacks}} throughout his career, keeping him on the fringe of his state teams. During the 2003/04 season Inness contracted a bout of glandular fever, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|R
25|$|His second spell in London {{was not as}} {{successful}} as his previous one. Now playing in the Second Division, things got worse for both McAvennie and West Ham when the striker suffered a broken leg on the opening {{game of the season}} on 19 August 1989, following a challenge by Stoke City's Chris Kamara, which <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> until March 1990. He made his return on 31 March 1990 against Port Vale. By this time West Ham were 10th in the league and ultimately finished in 7th place missing out on the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day, the match changed. Bradford/Leeds UCCE, thanks to Adam Patel (54), James Duffy (64) and a defiant last wicket {{partnership}} of 86 between Tom Glover (42*) and Simon Crampton (42), took their score to 333, {{a deficit of}} 100. Even worse news for Surrey was a tear to Ian Salisbury's intercostal muscle which <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> {{of the rest of}} the game, and a re-aggravated hamstring injury to Martin Bicknell that stopped him bowling further in the match. Surrey then faltered with the bat, finishing the game on 132 for 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, partnering Bentley in the ruck, Dyer played {{successfully in}} the first half of the season before suffering a serious knee injury that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> for the rest of the year. In ten matches, Dyer received four best afield Brownlow medal votes, collected enough votes to win the Tigers' best and fairest, although this is in dispute as there is no actual evidence that Dyer actually won the award, or even that there was one presented in 1932, and was chosen for Victoria after fewer than a dozen league matches. On Grand Final day, Dyer was back in reserve as his teammates won Richmond's third premiership after several finals failures.|$|E
50|$|In the Game Boy Advance version, Mr. Krabs {{thinks the}} robot {{invasion}} is <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of business, so his assignment for SpongeBob is {{to fight the}} robots {{to get into the}} Chum Bucket to shut down Plankton's Duplicatron with the help of Mystery the Seahorse.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Vuillemin raced {{a limited}} AMA 250cc Supercross season. He earned five podium {{finishes}} before breaking {{his back in}} the Daytona round <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> {{for the remainder of}} the series. He contested the AMA 250cc U.S. Motocross Championship, earning five overall top five finishes.|$|R
50|$|After making eight {{appearance}} and scoring three, Borriello then suffered a trauma {{injury in the}} right ankle, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action for 45 days. Despite the injury, Borriello ended the season as the club's top scorer, and they avoided relegation by one place in the league table.|$|R
