40|$|Introduction: Hydration is {{necessary}} for surgery, and {{it is recommended that}} <b>pre-operative</b> <b>hydration</b> may accompany with better outcome and shorter post-operative hospitalization. This study aims at evaluating effects of <b>pre-operative</b> <b>hydration</b> on clinical outcome of patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Methods: In this case-control study, 100 patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery were randomly classified as intervention group (<b>pre-operative</b> <b>hydration,</b> n = 50) and control group (no <b>pre-operative</b> <b>hydration,</b> n = 50). The intervention group received crystalloid fluids (ringer) 1. 5 ml/kg during fasting, and the control group received no intravenous fluid before surgery. Both groups were evaluated for intraoperative and post-operative findings. Results: Comparing with the control group, the intervention group had significantly lower hypotension during surgery (10 vs. 38 %, P = 0. 001), less hemodynamic disorder (8 vs. 30 %, P = 0. 005), less need for pack cell transfusion (12 vs. 60 %, P < 0. 001), higher urine output (1047. 68 ± 586. 78 vs. 750. 36 ± 437. 25 cc, P = 0. 005), less intensive care unit (ICU) admission (12 vs. 30 %, P = 0. 020), and shorter mean hospitalization (6. 96 ± 1. 78 vs. 8. 96 ± 3. 10 days, P < 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups considering mortality rate (4 vs. 6 %, P = 0. 100). Conclusion: <b>Pre-operative</b> <b>hydration</b> improves patient’s status during surgery, reduces hypotension, and duration of hospitalizatio...|$|E
40|$|Non pharmacologic {{approaches}} to overcome post operative nausea and vomiting include giving <b>pre-operative</b> <b>hydration.</b> The {{objective of this}} study was to learn the efficacy of pre-operative lactated Ringer’s solution (2 mL/kgBW/hour) in fasting patients to overcome the post-operative nausea and vomiting in mastectomy surgery. This study was a randomized clinical trial that conducted in March to April 2013 in Dharmais Hospital-National Cancer Center, Persahabatan Hospital, Fatmawati Hospital, and Rumah Sakit Cipto Mangunkusumo Jakarta to patients with American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status 1 – 2. A total of 102 patients were randomized into the hydration group and control group. Data analysis was performed using chi-square test or appropriate test using SPSS ver. 15. There were statistically significant differences in the incidence of nausea at 0 – 1 hour post-operative (19. 6 % in hydration group vs. 39. 2 % in control group) and at 0 – 24 hours post-operative (21. 6 % in hydration group vs. 41. 2 % control group). The incidence of 1 – 24 hours PONV, although not statistically significant, was higher in the control group (11. 8 % in hydration group vs. 23. 5 % in control group). There was no difference in vomiting incidence between the two groups. Pre-operative lactated Ringer’s solution 2 mL/kgBW/hour in fasting patients effectively reduces the incidence of post-operative nausea one hour after operation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess whether}} {{diagnostic}} imaging of pyloric stenosis {{has made a}} difference in rapidity of diagnosis, duration of <b>pre-operative</b> <b>hydration,</b> and length of stay in hospital. DESIGN [...] Chart review of infants with confirmed diagnosis of pyloric stenosis. SETTING [...] Paediatric teaching hospital. SUBJECTS [...] 215 infants with a confirmed diagnosis of pyloric stenosis seen during 1974 - 7 and 187 infants with pyloric stenosis seen during 1988 - 91. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] State of hydration on admission, time between presentation to hospital and a definite diagnosis, techniques used to make the diagnosis, whether a pyloric mass was felt before or after an imaging procedure, time between presentation and surgery, and length of stay in hospital. RESULTS [...] The average age at presentation was 40 days in both groups. A pyloric mass was palpated either without or before an imaging study in 87 % (187 / 215) of cases during 1974 - 7 but in only 49 % (91 / 187) during 1988 - 91. The use of barium meal examination and ultrasonography increased from 20 % (42 / 215) of cases during 1974 - 7 to 61 % (114 / 187) during 1988 - 91. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups in the time taken to establish a diagnosis, the mean duration of preoperative treatment, or the length of stay in hospital (after allowance for the decline in average length of stay of all hospital patients between the two periods). CONCLUSIONS [...] An increased use of diagnostic imaging for pyloric stenosis did not lead to earlier diagnosis or better management. While imaging is important in identifying pyloric stenosis in difficult cases, increasing reliance on imaging has reduced doctors' skills in diagnosing pyloric stenosis clinically...|$|E
