5|$|Anticipating that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to {{the area}} to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant {{that by the time}} Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
5|$|The {{forest at}} Ambohimanga benefited from {{customary}} protection and today represents {{the largest of}} the last remaining fragments of primary forest that formerly covered the highlands. It contains a representative assortment of native tree and plant species, in particular the endemic tree zahana (phyllarthron madagascariensis) and a variety of indigenous medicinal plants, many possessing traditional or spiritual importance. Examples include the native bush Anthocleista, traditionally believed to attract lightning and often planted in clusters beside villages; the Dracaena plant, traditionally used for hedges and planted at sacred sites in valleys or other natural features where <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to communicate with ancestral spirits; and the Phyllarthron vine, which was planted in sacred thickets and harvested for its wood, which was traditionally used to fashion handles for diverse tools. The recent and growing presence of two foreign species (golden bamboo and lantana) threaten the integrity of the site's ecosystem. The local management authority is currently engaged in activities to eradicate the encroaching vegetation.|$|E
25|$|With a new name, {{exactly the}} same sound they had before and several new songs written, Creed began playing locally. They {{initially}} struggled to get gigs in their hometown because {{no one wanted to}} hear post-grunge bands, so they set up their own shows at family restaurants and got all their friends to hand out fliers so <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to these restaurants to watch them play.|$|E

50|$|Conry {{has been}} {{critical}} of going to confession regularly, saying that, in his experience, <b>people</b> <b>would</b> always <b>come</b> back saying the same things week after week, suggesting that no interior conversion or repentance was actually taking place.|$|R
5000|$|The title gonagas (or konagas), bird man, was {{a shaman}} ranking level in Northern Scandinavia amongst noayddes, which possessed special level of spiritual {{knowledge}} and visualized themselves to have possession to transform oneself into a bird figure to [...] "fly" [...] over mountains. Because of this spiritual ability, Lundius states {{they were treated}} more respectfully or had a higher position than other peoples. According to the myth they could [...] "spiritual communicate," [...] i.e. travel to trading ports in forehand and see what <b>peoples</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to trade. And in the witchcrafting period, the figure could not be burned on the stake because the fire would be smothered {{in the same way}} water cannot be ignited.|$|R
25|$|The sangha {{traveled}} through the subcontinent, expounding the dharma. This continued throughout the year, except {{during the four}} months of the Vassa rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason {{was that it was}} more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to them.|$|E
25|$|Bent edge {{began as}} a counter-movement to {{straight}} edge {{by members of the}} Washington, D.C. hardcore scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the scene. This idea spread, and on Minor Threat's first tour in 1982, <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> up to the band to identify themselves as bent, crooked, or curved edge. The counter-movement was short lived and faded away {{by the end of the}} 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The single fact of John Paul II's {{election}} in 1978 changed everything. In Poland, everything began. Not in East Germany or Czechoslovakia. Then {{the whole thing}} spread. Why in 1980 did they lead the way in Gdansk? Why did they decide, now or never? Only {{because there was a}} Polish pope. He was in Chile and Pinochet was out. He was in Haiti and Duvalier was out. He was in the Philippines and Marcos was out. On many of those occasions, <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> here to the Vatican thanking the Holy Father for changing things.|$|E

5000|$|Created by then-student Maria Pulzetti, {{the first}} event was {{organized}} by students at University of Virginia in 1996. Pulzetti explained: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} for BGLAD week that <b>would</b> impact many <b>people</b> at the school and that would be very visible...I knew that if we held panel discussions and events like that, the only <b>people</b> who <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>would</b> be the <b>people</b> who already were fairly aware." ...|$|R

25|$|Nettl Arapaho music {{includes}} ceremonial {{and secular}} songs, {{such as the}} ritualistic Sun Dance, performed in the summer when the various bands of the Arapaho <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> together. Arapaho traditional songs consist of two sections exhibiting terraced descent, with a range greater than an octave and scales between four and six tones. Other ceremonial songs were received in visions, or taught {{as part of a}} man's initiations into a society for his age group. Secular songs include a number of social dances, such as the triple meter round dances and songs to inspire warriors or recent exploits. There are also songs said to be taught by a guardian spirit, which should be sung only when the recipient is near death.|$|E
25|$|The cordon force {{remained}} in position throughout the night, and on 3 June the festival continued. Selected areas were again searched. The western {{portion of the}} village yielded forty-eight more Viet Cong suspects. They were hiding in haystacks, tunnels, woodpiles, and watchtowers. By {{the end of the}} second day, the festival had succeeded in softening and changing the attitudes of many individuals who had been hostile to the government. The operation was deemed such a success that it was extended for a third day. By the end of the festivities, the anti-communists felt that they had achieved much political success and that the civilian population wanted to assist in reporting communists so that they could be expelled from their village. One woman was given 200 piasters for volunteering information leading to the apprehension of a Viet Cong suspect hiding in a coffin, while one Viet Cong defected and led an intelligence platoon to a weapons cache that also contained communist tax collection statistics. He said that he had decided to rally to the government of Vietnam as a result of the hamlet festival. Many individuals spoke out about Viet Cong harassment and intimidation and stated that if they had sufficient security many more <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> there to live under government rule.|$|E
500|$|In an {{era when}} {{whistling}} was commonly featured on popular recordings, Tanner was often confused with Fred Lowery, who was blind and worked with Horace Heidt and his Musical Knights. [...] <b>People</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> up to Tanner and ask {{if it was true}} that he was blind. [...] “Only on Saturday night,” he would reply.|$|E
50|$|Noack's sculptures are {{inspired}} by contemporary French art. Expressing an intense relationship between life and art, they focus on the human figure, often simply standing, sitting or kneeling. At a time when mankind was frequently treated with contempt, Noack strove to demonstrate her faith and trust in the human community. Her works are sincere, emanating an almost pious hope that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> again <b>come</b> together.|$|R
50|$|During the two World Wars, {{hundreds}} of villagers gave {{their lives and}} the local resistance movements were very active. The village was severely destroyed during the 1953 Ionian earthquake. For decades, the village used to operate as the hub of agricultural production and animal farming for the entire peninsula providing employment opportunities to thousands of <b>people</b> that <b>would</b> <b>come</b> {{to work in the}} local farms from very far away.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{a popular}} etymology, hick derives from the {{nickname}} [...] "Old Hickory" [...] for Andrew Jackson, {{one of the first}} Presidents of the United States to come from rural hard-scrabble roots. This nickname suggested that Jackson was tough and enduring like an old Hickory tree. Jackson was particularly admired by the residents of remote and mountainous areas of the United States, <b>people</b> who <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to be known as [...] "hicks." ...|$|R
500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} much talk about our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E
500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on {{the rock}} album {{tried to focus on}} [...] "general themes that {{everyone}} can get their hands on", while the acoustic had introspective lyrics that are [...] "vulnerable and revealing", with things Grohl [...] "wouldn't say out loud, wouldn't even admit to myself." [...] Grohl declared that [...] "when you're writing songs that have a sort of anthemic quality, you can't really go lighthearted and sing about bullshit. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words", and that [...] "I don't know what it is about, this album, that makes it sound more heartfelt or deeper or more emotional, but when I listen to it, it really is." [...] These include [...] "Friend of a Friend", a song which Grohl wrote in the 1990s about himself and his former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain during the time they shared an apartment together in 1990, and [...] "Still", talking about a suicide Grohl saw when he was ten in Virginia, by a boy who jumped on the train tracks. Much of the album's theme and content, including the title, came after Grohl spent time on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. [...] "We'd pull in to small towns, and thousands of <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to be rescued by this man", said Grohl. [...] "It's not a political record, but what I saw inspired me." ...|$|E

2500|$|She also {{reported}} how <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to her {{looking for a}} cure for impotence. For these people she would carry out a ritual based on the Pyramid Texts.

50|$|Family {{was highly}} valued by the Blackfoot Indians. For traveling, they also split into bands of 20-30 <b>people,</b> but <b>would</b> <b>come</b> {{together}} for times of celebration. They valued leadership skills and chose the chiefs who would run their settlements wisely. During times of peace, the <b>people</b> <b>would</b> elect a peace chief, meaning {{someone who could}} lead the people and improve relations with other tribes. The title of war chief could not be gained through election {{and needed to be}} earned by successfully performing various acts of bravery including touching a living enemy. Blackfoot bands often had minor chiefs in addition to an appointed head chief.|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{his career}} Van Doorn was not very popular.

Many <b>people</b> <b>would</b> later <b>come</b> to admire the dedication that characterises Van Doorn's performances and writing.|$|R
50|$|Historically, Aghribs {{was well}} known for its Monday market. For over a hundred years, the market {{was a place where}} {{thousands}} of economic transactions were carried out every Monday by <b>people</b> who <b>would</b> <b>come</b> from all over Kabylie. The main activities included buying and selling animals (cows, oxen, sheep, donkeys,...), food stuffs (cereals, olive oil, spices, meat,...), agricultural tools, and so forth. However, in recent years, the market has shrunk markedly and is no longer the strong economic driver it once was.|$|R

2500|$|Often, {{when one}} of the members was {{scheduled}} to give a performance, the rest of the Pack would show up for an impromptu show, causing much excitement among audiences, resulting in return visits. They sold out almost all of their appearances, and <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> pouring into Las Vegas, sometimes sleeping in cars and hotel lobbies when they could not find rooms, just {{to be part of the}} Rat Pack entertainment experience. The Rat Pack's appearances were of unprecedented value because the city would always become flooded with high rollers, wealthy gamblers who would routinely leave substantial fortunes in the casinos' coffers. The marquees of the hotels at which they were performing as individuals would read, for example, [...] "DEAN MARTIN - MAYBE FRANK - MAYBE SAMMY" [...] as seen on a Sands Hotel sign.|$|E
