50|$|Paratylenchus hamatus, the fig <b>pin</b> <b>nematode,</b> is a migratory plant endoparasite, {{that causes}} lesions on plant roots {{resulting}} in symptoms of chlorosis, wilting and ultimtely yield losses (6,12). They move and feed on {{different parts of}} host tissue throughout their life cycle {{in order to find}} enough susceptible host tissue to survive and reproduce (7). A wide range of host plant species are susceptible to the fig <b>pin</b> <b>nematode,</b> including many valuable fruit and vegetable crops such as figs, carrots and celery (5,13). They are also commonly found associated with woody perennials in California (10). P. hamatus inhabits soils in both Europe and North America, and was originally isolated from fig in central California in 1950 (1).|$|E
50|$|P. hamatus {{has been}} shown to have {{different}} levels of effect on different crops. In California, P. hamatus is the most common <b>pin</b> <b>nematode</b> (6) and has been seen to reduce crop yield of grapes in vineyards and fig farms by stunting plant growth and reducing fruit size(6). This ultimately results in loss of profits for local farmers. However, data from stone fruit farms in California show no damage to crops with populations of pin nematodes reaching 3000 nematodes/ 1 kg of soil (15). There is also evidence that populations of pin nematodes around 500 nematodes/ 1 kg of soil work as antagonists for other more damaging nematodes producing healthier trees (15). So in that case they are not really detrimental to the plant, but possible indirectly beneficial. This not always the case however. For example, P. hamatus in mint caused losses of 25% - 36% when planted in soil with 8000 nematodes/ quart, which shows it does not play an antagonistic role (4). Overall, the disease severity of P. hamatus is variable and is specific to the species of plant that it is parasitizing on and the concentration at which it is found.|$|E

50|$|Paratylenchus hamatus is a migratory {{endoparasite}} {{which means}} it retains its vermiform shape during its adult life (4). Because of their close association with host root systems, <b>pin</b> <b>nematodes</b> are easily spread from field to field through the transportation of already infected soil and plant parts (4). Paratylenchus spp. females generally lay eggs {{one at a time}} and can lay up to 4 eggs per day when feeding on host tissue (4). When eggs hatch 7 or 8 days after laying, the juvenile nematodes seek out plant roots to feed upon (2, 7). Young, easily penetrated root tips appear to be the main food source for juveniles, which have smaller stylets compared to their adult counterparts (7). All <b>pin</b> <b>nematodes</b> feed on root epidermal cells and will migrate to a new feeding site once the nutrients have been depleted (2). As they feed and grow, juvenile <b>pin</b> <b>nematodes</b> will go through a series of four molts, growing a new stylet and outer cuticle each time (7). When the fourth juvenile stage (J4 or preadult) is reached, the nematodes may enter a survival stage in which they are resistant to unfavorable conditions such as low soil moisture, extreme temperatures, and lack of food (2, 4, 11). The preadults can survive over 4 years when in this state despite not feeding, as their stylets are diminished and do not function properly (11). The survival stage is not produced in conditions that favor functions such as feeding and reproduction (2). After the final molt from the fourth juvenile stage, adult <b>pin</b> <b>nematodes</b> emerge. Paratylenchus hamatus is a dioecious species, having both males and females (11). When the adult stage is reached, males mate with females to produce fertilized eggs. However, males are not always necessary for egg fertilization in <b>pin</b> <b>nematodes.</b> In a few species of Paratylenchus, males are not common and it is possible for females to lay fertilized eggs without mating (4). Females tend to lay more eggs when feeding than when they are not feeding (7).|$|R
40|$|In {{a survey}} of phytonematodes {{associated}} with floricultural and ornamental plants in Riyadh region, central Saudi Arabia, 13 genera {{were found in the}} roots and rhizosphere soil samples of 23 plants. Root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne sp. (mainly M. javanica) was found attacking 9 plants : Bougainvillea sp., Catharanthus roseus, Chinus molle, Cotoneaster sp., Dianthus caryphyllus, Dodonia viscosa, Gomphrena globosa, Rosa sp., and Verbana hybrida. Rotylenchulus sp. was found with high density in the rhizosphere soil samples of Chinus molle, followed by Ticoma stans, Caesalbinia albinosa and Dodonia viscosa. <b>Pin</b> <b>nematodes,</b> Paratylenchus sp. recorded the highest population density on Codiaeum sp., and caused severe damage to the infected plants. Some host records are being included {{for the first time in}} this extensive survey of phytonematodes associated with floricultural and ornamental plants in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
40|$|During {{a survey}} on <b>pin</b> <b>nematodes</b> in western Iran, two populations of Paratylenchus audriellus and Paratylenchus tenuicaudatus were {{collected}} and subsequently analysed morphologically and molecularly. Paratylenchus audriellus is characterised {{by the long}} stylet (48 - 61 μm) and the typical female tail with a characteristic claw-like process with sharply pointed terminus. To our knowledge, the Iranian population of P. tenuicaudatus is the first record from Iran. The molecular characterisation of P. audriellus nematodes using the D 2 -D 3 of 28 S rRNA and the partial 18 S rRNA gene sequences revealed that this species is clearly separated from P. straeleni and {{should be considered as}} a valid taxon.

40|$|Nematode {{occurrence}} {{at specific}} locations throughout a water catchment-irrigation system was determined. Soil {{samples were collected}} from five water source locations {{on the slopes of}} Olomana Mountain and Maunawili Valley and from about 40 plant species on 18 farms (56 ha of 480 ha irrigated by the reservoir). Water was sampled from the catchment reservoir at 0. 3 m, 9 m, and 18 m (bottom). A farm irrigated with potable water was sampled and compared to areas of the same farm irrigated from the reservoir. Nematodes present in soil from the mountain and farms were root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.), lesion (Pratylenchus spp.), reniform (Rotylenchulus reniformis), stunt (Tylenchorhynchus sp.), ring (Criconema spp.), dagger (Xiphinema sp.), spiral (Helicotylenchus sp.), Tylenchus sp., Aphelenchus sp., and <b>pin</b> (Paratylenchus sp.) <b>nematodes.</b> The economically important genera Rotylenchulus, Meloidogyne, and Pratylenchus occurred in very low numbers (10, 41, and 10 / 250 cm³ soil, respectively) and in low frequency (10 %, 25 %, and 8 % of the samples, respectively) in the mountain samples compared with high numbers (170 - 895 / 250 cm³ soil) from farms. Frequency of occurrence over all farms was near 40 % for Meloidogyne and 80 % for Rotylenchulus. No nematodes were detected in water from the reservoir. One sample from the outlets contained two specimens of plant-parasitic nematodes. The population densities of nematodes were not different between the soil samples collected from crops irrigated by potable or reservoir water...|$|R
