After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the <b>plane</b> based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the <b>plane</b> to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the <b>plane.</b> Flynn and Troy take the controls of the <b>plane</b> and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the <b>plane</b> makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the <b>plane</b> and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the <b>plane,</b> a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclination}} of {{a planet}} tells how far above or below an established reference <b>plane</b> its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference <b>plane</b> is the <b>plane</b> of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. For extrasolar planets, the <b>plane,</b> known as the sky <b>plane</b> or <b>plane</b> of the sky, is the <b>plane</b> perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth. The eight planets of the Solar System all lie {{very close to the}} ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it. The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference <b>plane</b> are called its ascending and descending nodes. The longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. The argument of periapsis (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.|$|E

Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below the equatorial <b>plane</b> whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes when the Sun is located on the equatorial <b>plane.</b>|$|E
