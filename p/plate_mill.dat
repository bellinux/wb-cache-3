25|$|In the 1870s, {{the city}} {{became a major}} hub of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. New Castle's {{population}} swelled from 11,600 in 1890 to 28,339 in 1900, and to 38,280 in 1910, as immigrants, particularly from Italy, flocked {{to the city to}} work in the mills and nearby limestone quarries. Italian laborers of the era were frequent victims of the Black Hand society, which employed blackmail and extortion to rob the workers of their pay. In 1907 the headquarters of the Black Hand for the entire region was discovered in the village of Hillsville a few miles west of New Castle. By this time New Castle was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, and with the construction of the largest tin <b>plate</b> <b>mill</b> in America, the city became the tin plate capital of the world. The tin plate industry marked a new increase in the city's prosperity.|$|E

In 1951, the rest of the Consett Iron Company was nationalised by Clement Attlee's Labour {{government}} into the short-lived Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain, along with all of Britain's steelworks. The Consett steelworks was privatised in 1955, and a new steel <b>plate</b> <b>mill</b> was opened in 1961 to supply the shipbuilding industry. About 6000 workers were employed at the works at that time.|$|E

[...] When no collective bargaining agreement was reached on June 29, Frick locked the union out {{of the rest of the}} plant. A high fence topped with barbed wire, begun in January, was completed and the plant sealed to the workers. Sniper towers with searchlights were constructed near each mill building, and high-pressure water cannons (some capable of spraying boiling-hot liquid) were placed at each entrance. Various aspects of the plant were protected, reinforced, or shielded.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Plate</b> <b>mills</b> {{hydraulic}} system {{is made up}} of several hydraulic stations, lubrication stations and grease stations, these hydraulic stations and lubrication stations are distributed around the mills. Each hydraulic station possesses qualities of successive long working time, high reliability and signal complexity, and it can satisfy diverse demands of high grade pressure or temperature control, etc. This paper is based on these demands, assembling control missions of hydraulic and lubricating stations. Several PLC S 7 - 300 were chosen to match the need of controlling mills hydraulic and lubricating system for a certain plate factory, and the HMI monitoring system for mill hydraulic and lubricating stations was developed by WINCC, which achieved central control and monitoring the hydraulic and lubricating system of <b>plate</b> <b>mills...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Cleveland Rolling Mill {{expanded}} {{its presence in}} 1868 {{with the construction of}} the Newburgh Steel Works next to its existing plant. The new works included an open hearth Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous open hearth Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. A [...] stationary blast furnace and four [...] rolling open hearth furnaces were also built. A boiler <b>plate</b> <b>mill,</b> sheet metal mill, and wire mill were in operation by 1870. Another [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace was erected in 1872. By the end of 1872, the combined Newburgh plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state. A second open hearth furnace was constructed in 1876, and the company leased the works and the Proton Furnace of the Cleveland Iron Co. in 1878. Cleveland Rolling Mill built a [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace at the leased site a year later, by which time Cleveland Rolling Mill occupied [...] of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{deformation}} and recrystallization behaviour of a {{range of}} Nb microalloyed steels has been studied using hot torsion. This work focuses on the change from strain dependent to strain independent recrystallization behaviour {{as a function of the}} alloy content, initial microstructure and deformation conditions. It is found that there is a complex interaction between deformation, recrystallization and strain induced precipitation, which has significant implications for controlled rolling in hot strip and <b>plate</b> <b>mills.</b> The data also revealed that the pre-existing precipitates did not influence the behaviour of post deformation softening...|$|R
50|$|Slabs are {{the feed}} {{material}} for hot strip <b>mills</b> or <b>plate</b> <b>mills</b> and blooms are rolled to billets in a billet mill or large sections in a structural mill. The output from a strip mill is coiled and, subsequently, used as the feed for a cold rolling mill or used directly by fabricators. Billets, for re-rolling, are subsequently rolled in either a merchant, bar or rod mill. Merchant or bar mills produce a variety of shaped products such as angles, channels, beams, rounds (long or coiled) and hexagons.|$|R

50|$|Thomas Edison State University {{moved into}} {{downtown}} Trenton in September 1979, {{at a time}} when other institutions were leaving cities. The 7-year-old university, which had spent three years at the Forrestal Center outside of Princeton, needed room for growth. At the same time, the state was looking for an appropriate tenant for the landmark Kelsey Building located adjacent to New Jersey's State House complex and the State House historic district, while the city sought to preserve the building's historic use as a school. Behind the Kelsey Building and the adjoining five restored mid-19th-century brick Townhouses is Petty's Run, which flows to the Delaware River.

40|$|The {{selection}} of machining parameters in <b>milling</b> thin-walled <b>plates</b> affects deformation, quality, and {{productivity of the}} machined parts. This paper presents an optimization procedure to determine and validate the optimum machining parameters in <b>milling</b> thin-walled <b>plates.</b> The regression models for cutting force and surface roughness are developed as objective functions according to experimental results. Besides, the influences of machining parameters on cutting force and surface roughness are also investigated. The objectives under investigation {{in this study are}} cutting force, surface roughness, and material removal rate subjected to constraints conditions. As the effects of milling parameters on optimization objectives are conflicting in nature, the multi-objective optimization problem in thin-walled <b>plates</b> <b>milling</b> is proposed. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is then adopted to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. The optimized combinations of machining parameters are achieved by the Pareto optimal solutions, and these solutions are verified by the chatter stability...|$|R
