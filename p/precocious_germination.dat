In standard medium containing minerals, 146 millimolar sucrose and 62. 5 millimolar glutamine (osmolality 0. 24), <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> seldom occurred with a starting seed size {{of less than}} 300 milligrams fresh weight. Frequency of <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> increased with increased starting seed size. Sucrose concentration strongly affected <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> while glutamine concentration had no effect. Starting with 300 to 350 milligrams fresh weight seeds, treatments which reduced the sucrose concentration or lowered the osmolality of the culture medium stimulated <b>precocious</b> <b>germination,</b> and increased the fresh weight growth but not the dry weight growth of seeds. Increasing the osmolality to 0. 38 with sucrose or mannitol prevented <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> without reducing dry weight accumulation in seeds.

40|$|Abstract Pollination is {{essential}} for seed reproduction and for exchanges of genetic information between individ-ual plants. In angiosperms, mature pollen grains released from dehisced anthers are transferred to the stigma where they become hydrated and begin to germinate. Pollen grains of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana do not germinate inside the anther under normal growth conditions. We report two Arabidopsis lines that produced pollen grains able to in situ precociously germinate inside the anther. One {{of them was a}} callose synthase 9 (cs 9) knockout mutant with a T-DNA insertion in the Callose Synthase 9 gene (CalS 9). Male gametophytes carrying a cs 9 mutant allele were defective and no homozygous progeny could be produced. Heterozy-gous mutant plants (cs 9 /+) produced approximately 50 % defective pollen grains with an altered male germ unit (MGU) and aberrant callose deposition in bicellular pollen. Bicellular pollen grains germinated precociously inside the anther. Another line, a transgenic plant expressing callose synthase 5 (CalS 5) under the CaMV 35 S promoter, also contained abnormal callose deposition during microsporo-genesis and displaced MGUs in pollen grains. We also observed that <b>precocious</b> pollen <b>germination</b> could be induced in wild-type plants by incubation with medium containing sucrose and calcium ion and by wounding in the anther. These results demonstrate that <b>precocious</b> pollen <b>germination</b> in Arabidopsis could be triggered by a genetic alteration and a physiological condition...|$|R
40|$|We propose herein a novel single seed descent {{protocol}} {{that has}} application {{across a broad}} phenotypic range of pea genotypes. Manipulation of key in vivo growing conditions, including light, photoperiod and temperature, combined with <b>precocious</b> in vitro <b>germination</b> of the embryo at full physiological maturity substantially shortened the pea lifecycle. We define full embryo physiological maturity as the earliest point in seed development when <b>precocious</b> in vitro <b>germination</b> and robust seedling growth can be reliably achieved without supply of exogenous hormones. Under our optimised conditions for accelerated plant growth, embryo physiological maturity was attained at c. 18 days after pollination, when seed moisture content was below 60 % and sucrose level under 100 mg g(- 1) DW. No delay penalty {{in terms of time}} to flowering and plant development was caused by the culture of immature seeds 18 days after pollination compared to the used of mature ones. Determining the role embryo maturity plays in the fitness of the germinated plant has facilitated the truncation of the lifecycle across pea genotypes.

40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) is a {{plant hormone}} which plays an {{important}} role in seed development and dormancy and in plant response to environmental stresses. An ABA-deficient mutant of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, aba 2, was isolated by transposon tagging using the maize Activator transposon. The aba 2 mutant exhibits <b>precocious</b> seed <b>germination</b> and a severe wilty phenotype. The mutant is impaired in the first step of the ABA biosynthesis pathway, the zeaxanthin epoxidation reaction. ABA 2 cDNA is able to complement N. plumbaginifolia aba 2 and Arabidopsis thaliana aba mutations indicating that these mutants are homologous. ABA 2 cDNA encodes a chloroplast-imported protein of 72. 5 kDa, sharing similarities with different mono-oxigenases and oxidases of bacterial origin and having an ADP-binding fold and an FAD-binding domain.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of abscisic acid (ABA) inhibition of <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> and ABA-induced storage protein accumulation was examined {{over the course}} of embryogenesis in wild-type and viviparous mutants of maize (Zea mays L.). We show that a high level of embryo ABA and the product of the Viviparous- 1 gene are both required in early maturation phase for germination suppression and the accumulation of storage globulins encoded by the gene Glb 1. Suppressing <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> with a high osmoticum is not sufficient to initiate Glb 1 protein synthesis, although continued accumulation is contingent upon this inhibition; germination of immature or mature embryos leads to a decline in synthesis and the degradation of stored globulins. Late in embryogenesis, fragments of Glb 1 protein accumulate, coinciding with the loss of ABA sensitivity. These results suggest that ABA influences storage globulin accumulation by initiating synthesis, suppressing degradation, and inhibiting <b>precocious</b> <b>germination...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ethylene induces <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> in late {{maturation}} embryos (32 - 40 {{days after}} anthesis) of Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Seminole, thus overriding the endogenous controls which normally maintain quiescence. The possibility that ethylene exerts its effects at the gene expression level was investigated by {{in vitro translation}} of RNA extracted from embryo axis tissue of seeds induced to germinate precociously by incubation with ethylene. 35 S-labelled products so produced were analyzed by electrophoresis, fluorography, and scanning densitometry. Results were compared with normally germinating seeds and with embryos incubated {{in the absence of}} ethylene. Ethylene was found to induce a qualitative and quantitative change in gene expression in late maturation embryos detectable within 6 hours of ethylene exposure. Two products (37 - 38 kD and 27 kD) were up-regulated within 24 hours in both ethylene-induced <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> and normal germination. Four products (71 kD, 67 - 68 kD, 65 - 66 kD, and 41 - 42 kD) which appeared in normal germination were evidently not required for ethylene-induced <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> In contrast with the findings of Misra & Bewley (1985; 1986) for maize(Zea mays L.) no products could be identified as being unique to the developmental phase, however two products (38 - 39 kD and 28 kD) were strongly present in development but disappeared shortly after germination. A product of 22 - 23 kD was apparently unique to the ethylene-induced <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> treatment and may represent a gene regulated by ethylene. This product was not seen until 24 hours after ethylene introduction.

5000|$|Fossilized spores {{suggest that}} higher plants (embryophytes) have lived on land {{for at least}} 475 million years. Early land plants {{reproduced}} sexually with flagellated, swimming sperm, like the green algae from which they evolved. An adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats. This feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives, the Charophycean green algae. A later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate, avascular sexual stage, the gametophyte, within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte. This occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release, as in non-seed plants. A current example of how this might have happened {{can be seen in}} the <b>precocious</b> spore <b>germination</b> in Selaginella, the spike-moss. The result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case, the seed. The first seed bearing plants, like the ginkgo, and conifers (such as pines and firs), did not produce flowers. The pollen grains (male gametophytes) of Ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated, mobile sperm cells that [...] "swim" [...] down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs.The apparently sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record initially posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that Charles Darwin called it an [...] "abominable mystery". However, the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of Darwin, and recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as Archaefructus, along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, in particular seed ferns, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants, but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. Some older fossils, such as the upper Triassic Sanmiguelia, have been suggested. Based on current evidence, some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms in the Triassic period (245-202 million years ago). Fossil angiosperm-like pollen from the Middle Triassic (247.2-242.0 Ma) suggests an older date for their origin. [...] A close relationship between angiosperms and gnetophytes, proposed on the basis of morphological evidence, has more recently been disputed on the basis of molecular evidence that suggest gnetophytes are instead more closely related to other gymnosperms.|$|R
40|$|Seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv Seminole in late {{maturation}} phase germinated precociously in vitro.

There was no effect of ethylene on the rate of axis germination. Ethylene was equally effective within the range 0. 5 to 1000 parts per million and 1 hour exposure was fully effective. Induction of <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> in vivo was observed by manipulating water content inside pods or by ethylene injection, whether pods were attached to the parent plant or not.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} developing triticale var. Grado caryopses. Treatment of freshly gathered, unripe triticale caryopses with abscisic acid (ABA) decreased their <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> throughout the entire period of development and ripening. The more mature the embryos that were germinated, the lower the inhibition by ABA. This indicates that {{the sensitivity of the}} embryo to ABA decreases during the course of caryopsis development and that the role that this hormone can play in the prevention of spouting in ears during the final stages of maturation, is limited. A known inhibitor of gibberellin synthesis, the retardant AMO- 1618, was also tested in these experiments. This compound caused the reduction of germination capability only in the initial stages of development of triticale caryopses. Its most visible effect was noted during the germination of caryopses collected 30 days after flowering. The effect of this compound on the <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> of isolated embryos also decreased as the degree of maturity of these embryos increased. In the opinion of this author, this is connected with the fact that intense gibberellin synthesis and accumulation occurs only {{in the early stages of}} caryopsis development...|$|E
40|$|Muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) {{seeds are}} germinable 15 to 20 days before fruit {{maturity}} and are held at relatively {{high water content}} within the fruit, yet little <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> is observed. To investigate two possible factors preventing <b>precocious</b> <b>germination,</b> the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid and osmoticum on muskmelon seed germination were determined throughout development. Seeds were harvested at 5 -day intervals from 30 to 65 days after anthesis (DAA) and incubated either fresh or after drying on factorial combinations of 0, 1, 3. 3, 10, or 33 micromolar abscisic acid (ABA) and 0, â 0. 2, â 0. 4, â 0. 6, or â 0. 8 megapascals polyethylene glycol 8000 solutions at 30 Â°C. Radicle emergence was scored at 12 -hour intervals for 10 days. In the absence of ABA, the water potential (Î¨) required to inhibit fresh seed germination by 50 % decreased from â 0. 3 to â 0. 8 megapascals between 30 and 60 DAA. The Î¨ inside developing fruits was from 0. 4 to 1. 4 megapascals lower than that required for germination at all stages of development, indicating that the fruit Î¨ is sufficiently low to prevent <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> At 0 megapascal, the ABA concentration required to inhibit germination by 50 % was approximately 10 micromolar up to 50 DAA and increased to > 33 micromolar thereafter. Dehydration improved subsequent germination of immature seeds in ABA or low Î¨. There was a linear additive interaction between ABA and Î¨ such that 10 micromolar ABA or â 0. 5 megapascal osmotic potential resulted in equivalent, and additive, reductions in germination rate and percentage of mature seeds. Abscisic acid {{had no effect on}} embryo solute potential or water content, but increased the apparent minimum turgor required for germination. ABA and osmoticum appear to influence germination rates and percentages by reducing the embryo growth potential (turgor in excess of a minimum threshold turgor) but via different mechanisms.

40|$|Using GA- and ABA-deficient mutants, {{exogenous}} gibberellins (GAs), {{abscisic acid}} (ABA) and osmoticum, we studied {{the roles of}} GAs and ABA in the induction of cell cycle activities, internal free space formation and changes in water relations during seed development and imbibition in tomato. First of all, it was demonstrated that endogenous ABA {{plays an important role}} in induction of primary dormancy, prevention of viviparous germination and arresting cell cycle activities of the radicle-tip cells in G 1 phase upon maturation. Secondly, the flow cytometric analysis of seeds of the three genotypes upon imbibition in water, GA 4 + 7 or ABA solutions, revealed that GAs influence germination of intact seeds by acting upon the processes that precede cell cycle activation, or in other words, the weakening of the endosperm opposite radicle tip, induced by GAs, promotes cell growth and subsequently induces nuclear replication activity upon imbibition, while ABA affects growth by acting upon the processes that follow cell cycle activation. Studies with the controlled deterioration test (CD) show that, after osmotic priming, the advancement of germination of seeds, expressed as the ratio of 4 C nuclei of radicle-tip calls, is positively related with the germination rate, and negatively related with the storability of the treated seeds. In addition, the determination of water relations illustrates that the absence of GAs and ABA during development and imbibition may alter water relations of both fruit and seed tissues, which certainly contributes to the mechanism preventing <b>precocious</b> and viviparous <b>germination.</b> Finally, it is concluded that exogenous GAs and ABA can relieve or strengthen the mechanical restraint imposed by the tissues surrounding the embryo, upon embryo water uptake, resulting in promoting or inhibiting germination by GAs and ABA respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} this {{research}} project were to investigate aspects of pollination biology of two native boreal species: Vaccinium myrtilloides (Canadian blueberry) and Vaccinium vitis-idaea (lingonberry) in central Saskatchewan. Accordingly, surveys of insect taxa visiting the flowers were performed, and determination {{of the effectiveness of}} these insect taxa to serve as pollinators was measured through pollen deposition and pollen tube growth in the style. Accompanying fieldwork, and morphological and anatomical studies were done for the two food rewards offered by flowers of both Vaccinium species: pollen released through poricidal anthers and nectar secreted from the nectary atop the inferior ovary. Pollen-ovule (P/O) ratios were determined for the two study species in Saskatchewan (V. myrtilloides, V. vitis-idaea) as well as for five other Vaccinium species from eastern Canada (Nova Scotia â V. angustifolium, V. boreale, V. caespitosum, V. corymbosum, and V. uliginosum). Pollen, released at maturity as tetrads, were converted to total pollen grains per flower to yield P/O ratios ranging from 238 (V. caespitosum) to 2, 008 (V. vitis-idaea), but 736 for the latter in Saskatchewan. These P/O ratios are indicative of a breeding system ranging from facultative autogamy to facultative xenogamy. Additionally, the structure of mature stamens and pollen tetrads was studied in V. myrtilloides and V. vitis-idaea. Each anther was functionally bilocular; had a single-cell thickness (i. e., epidermis) with regularly occurring papillae; lacked an endothecium; and possessed two distal, hollow tubules each terminating in a pore. Overall pollen grain viability was 76 - 97 % (V. myrtilloides) and 51 - 93 % (V. vitis-idaea), with about 20 % of tetrads having only 1 - 3 grains viable, and 12 % and 27 % of tetrads entirely non-viable in V. myrtilloides and V. vitis-idaea, respectively. Pollen tetrads occasionally were connected by a sticky substance resembling pollenkitt, but viscin threads were absent. One instance of <b>precocious</b> (in situ) <b>germination</b> of tetrads was recorded within anthers of V. myrtilloides. The floral nectary was a disk of secretory tissue situated between the stamens and the style. The epidermis possessed solitary stomata that were variable in number, but not different between V. myrtilloides and V. vitis-idaea. The nectary was vascularized by phloem alone; many traces were found for V. myrtilloides throughout the nectary, whereas V. vitis-idaea had few traces at the nectary base, concentrated at the inner side of the disk closest to the style base. Young sclerenchyma cells were found throughout the nectary parenchyma. Nectar production started on the day of anthesis for both species, although many flowers of V. vitis-idaea appeared to have no measureable nectar at that time. V. myrtilloides produced a larger range of nectar solutes per flower (0 - 3684. 1 Î¼g), than V. vitis-idaea iii (1. 29 to 1147. 62 Î¼g) over both years; nectar volumes per flower never exceeded 5 Î¼L. Nectar was measured daily in flowers aged 1 â 4 days in 2010 and 1 â 6 days in 2011, however, over the two years at the same study site there was no clear pattern of secretion and reabsorption throughout flower life for V. myrtilloides, and only a gradual increase for V. vitis-idaea as flowers aged. Insect visitors to flowers surveyed in 2010 included a large proportion of honeybees (Apis mellifera) as visitors to both species, whereas in 2011 there were no honeybees present at the field site. There was a larger proportion of hoverflies (Syrphidae) found on the flowers of V. vitis-idaea than on V. myrtilloides. Other visitors to V. myrtilloides were bees (Bombus, Andrena, Osmia, Colletes) and wasps (Vespidae), whereas flowers of V. vitis-idaea were visited by bees (Bombus, Andrena, Osmia, Lasioglossum, Colletes, Hylaeus), an ant (Formicidae) and a butterfly (Lycaenidae). Bombus spp. were shown to be pollinators of V. myrtilloides. Andrena spp. were probable pollinators, whereas honeybees appeared to be poor pollinators. Bombus spp. seemed probable pollinators of V. vitis-idaea and hoverflies to be barely more than visitors, though small sample sizes did not allow for conclusive evidence. The time that an insect spent on a virgin flower had no relationship to the pollination result. Among individuals of various Bombus spp. that did or did not sonicate flowers of V. myrtilloides, the action of âbuzz pollinationâ was shown to result in {{an increase in the number}} of pollen tetrads deposited and in pollen tube growth...|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} described a homeotic leafy cotyledon (lec) mutant of Arabidopsis that exhibits striking defects in embryonic maturation and produces viviparous embryos with cotyledons that are partially transformed into leaves. In this study, we present further {{details on the}} developmental anatomy of mutant embryos, characterize their response to abscisic acid (ABA) in culture, describe other mutants with related phenotypes, and summarize studies with double mutants. Our results indicate that immature embryos precociously enter a germination pathway after the torpedo stage of development and then acquire characteristics normally restricted to vegetative parts of the plant. In contrast to other viviparous mutants of maize (vp 1) and Arabidopsis (abi 3) that produce ABA-insensitive embryos, immature lec embryos are sensitive to ABA in culture. ABA is therefore necessary but not sufficient for embryonic maturation in Arabidopsis. Three other mutants that produce trichomes on cotyledons following <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> in culture are described. One mutant is allelic to lec 1, another is a fusca mutant (fus 3), and the third defines a new locus (lec 2). Mutant embryos differ in morphology, desiccation tolerance, pattern of anthocyanin accumulation, presence of storage materials, size and frequency of trichomes on cotyledons, and timing of <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> in culture. The leafy cotyledon phenotype has therefore allowed the identification of an important network of regulatory genes with overlapping functions during embryonic maturation in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|Triticale var. Lasko embryos, {{isolated}} from grain gathered at milk ripeness, {{the beginning of}} wax ripeness and at full ripeness, were allowed to germinate for 48 h on agar with glucose.

Different tendencies were observed in respect to the synthesis of ribosomal proteins. The highest incorporation of 14 C-amino acids into ribosomal proteins was found in preparations of ribosome fractions from embryos of milk ripe grain, lower in preparations of embryos from fully ripe grain, the lowest in preparations of embryos from wax ripe grain. ABA (10 - 4 M) completely inhibited the external symptoms of germination of immature embryos, while its inhibition of the synthesis of polyribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins was greater the more mature the embryos that were germinated.

Deletion of constitutively inactive ganB mutants showed conidiation and derepressed brlA expression in a submerged culture. Constitutive activation of GanB caused {{a reduction in}} hyphal growth and a severe defect in asexual sporulation. We therefore propose that GanB may negatively regulate asexual sporulation through the BrlA pathway. In addition, deletion or constitutive inactivation of GanB reduced germination rate while constitutive activation led to <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> Furthermore, conidia of a constitutively active mutant could germinate even without carbon source. Taken together, these results indicated that GanB plays a positive role during germination, possibly through carbon source sensing, and negatively regulates asexual conidiation in A. nidulans...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} the compound leaf in pea (Pisum sativum L.), focusing on regional identities within the leaf. Novel interactions between the pea leaf mutants insecatus(ins), cachleata(cach), unifaliata(uni), stipules reduced(st), tendril-less(tl) and afila(aj) are utilised to investigate the role of regional identity in the determination of leaf form. Secondly, a new viviparous pea mutant, viviparaus(vip), is characterised and used to investigate the processes controlling normal seed maturation and the prevention of <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> Leaf development. Plants which are homozygous for both the each and st mutations show that the each mutation transforms the stipules into organs which act as leaf tissue. The stipules of each mutants respond to other mutant genes as a leaf would, and do not respond to the mutant gene st, which alters only stipule tissue. Plants of the genotype each each Tl tl show reduced Tl expression {{at the base of the}} leaf. This provides evidence for gradients of gene expression within the pea leaf, which have been proposed in other studies. Examination of the apical meristems of each and uni mutants has revealed that the phenotypes of these mutants are visible earlier in {{the development of the}} leaf primordia than other previously characterised pea leaf mutants. Plants homozygous for the each mutation show greatly retarded development of the stipule primordia. Also, the apical domes of uni mutants are smaller than those of wild-type plants. A difference in apical dome size has not been previously reported for any pea leaf mutant. A new allele of a poorly characterised mutant, ins, has been found and ins has been shown to be a dominant mutation with poor penetrance rather than a recessive mutation. Plants homozygous for the ins mutation have a range of tendril and notched structures at the tip of some leaflets. This has been found to be due to additional growth at the tip of the leaflet, which occurs late in development. The double mutant ins tl has leaflet-like structures, rather than tendril structures, present at the affected leaflet tips. This indicates that the ins mutation alters the identity of the leaf tip. The double mutant ins uni shows that the simple leaf of the uni mutant has a region at its tip which corresponds to the tip of the leaflet in a compound pea leaf. Previous studies of pea leaf development have focused on the af and tl mutants, which affect the leaflets and tendrils. This thesis provides information about the development of the stipules at the leaf-base which has not been addressed in detail in previous models of pea leaf development. The vip mutant is the first viviparous mutant to be reported in a legume species. The seeds of the vip mutant germinate in the pod near contact point (when the liquid endosperm disappears). They stay green and will die through desiccation if they remain in the pod. The phenotype of the seed is determined by the embryo. Seeds of the vip mutant will survive if they are removed from the pod and planted before they dehydrate. However, growth of seedlings homozygous for the vip mutation is slow for the first few weeks, and there is increased seedling death, compared with wild-type seedlings. Mature vip mutant plants produce one pod per inflorescence rather than two. Two vip alleles have been isolated (vip- 1 and vip- 2). The mutation is inherited as a monogenic recessive, with the gene located at the bottom of linkage-group five. A paucity of vip seeds from crosses suggests that vip gametes have reduced viability, as there is no increased abortion of vip seeds. Compared with wild-type seeds, seeds of vip- 1 and vip- 2 mutants show some alteration in free-abscisic acid (ABA) levels during development. However, comparison with seeds of the pea ABA-deficient mutant wilty, which have very low ABA levels and are not viviparous, suggests that the altered ABA levels in vip seeds are not responsible for their <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> Free-ABA levels in the shoots of the vip mutants, and their ABA synthesis in response to droughting, are the same as wild-type shoots. Seeds of the vip mutants are somewhat insensitive to ABA during their early growth. There is no evidence of overproduction of bioactive gibberellins in vip seeds. Messenger RNAs for proteins found during seed maturation, which are reduced in wild-type germinating seeds, continue to accumulate in vip seeds even though they are germinating precociously. Thus, vip mutant seeds are deficient in a single factor, which is necessary to prevent <b>precocious</b> <b>germination,</b> but does not reduce expression of maturation genes. This factor does not appear to be homologous to the Arabidopsis gene ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABJ 3). The vip gene may relate to ABA sensitivity early in seed development, which would indicate that this is the critical time when ABA prevents <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> Alternatively, the ABA insensitivity found may be a secondary effect, and vip seeds may be altered in a novel factor that normally prevents <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> Such factors have been proposed to exist by other studies examining the control of germination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wheat embryogenic callus was {{induced by}} {{treating}} immature wheat embryos with 2, 4 -D. Digoxigenin-labeled germin sense and anti-sense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription. By using these probes {{it was revealed}} that there was a striking induction of germin gene expression prior to visible callus formation. Although no germin gene expression was localized on the sections of immature embryos which were not incubated in callus induction medium, following 4 hours incubation in callus induction medium, germin mRNA was localized on the sections of immature embryos. Germin gene expression more conspicuous and widespread on the sections which were incubated for 6 hours in callus induction medium. It was suggested that germin genes induced during callus formation were related to the remodeling of the cell wall to accomplish the transition from <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> to callus formation...|$|E
40|$|The <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> of excised embryos from {{immature}} {{and mature}} seeds at different developmental stages was studied {{taking into consideration}} the expression of Î±-amylase. Effect of growth hormones on enzyme activity was also analyzed {{in an attempt to}} outline their contribution to the process of embryo maturity and germination. Immature embryos excised from developing seeds of ages 7, 10 and 12 Days After Flowering (DAF) were cultured in vitro in presence of different plant growth regulators viz, GA 3, ABA, IAA and 2, 4 -D, administered singly along with one combination i. e., of GA 3 and ABA. Amylase activity showed a strong, negative impact of ABA, GA 3 and their combination in the premature embryos of age 7 and 10 DAF. This inhibition pattern was consistent up to the near mature embryos of age 12 DAF, thereby preventing <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> and keeping embryos in the embryogenetic mode. The response to GA gradually changed from inhibition to induction as embryonic age advanced. Amongst the two auxins applied, IAA was less inhibitory than 2, 4 -D at younger ages, while in the near mature set the two auxins induced amylase significantly. Embryonic axes removed from dormant seeds and treated similarly showed response to ABA and GA comparable to that in the premature and near mature sets. Maximum activity was recorded in the GA 3 treated set while minimum amylase was observed in ABA. The auxin IAA at lower concentration induced amylase in the mature set while IAA 100 Î¼M and 2, 4 -D caused strong inhibition. These results were significant at p< 0. 05. It is suggested that the release of amylase from the embryonic axes of developing seeds is inhibited by ABA and GA 3 until the embryos reach the near mature stage, the enzyme being induced in pre-mature and mature embryos by gibberellic acid, which may be the growth regulator released from the seed...|$|E

A. fumigatus ÎstuA mutants were impaired {{in their ability to}} undergo asexual reproduction. Conidiophore morphology was markedly abnormal, and only small numbers of dysmorphic conidia were produced, which exhibited <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> Whole genome transcriptional analysis during the onset of developmental competence was performed and identified a subset of developmentally regulated genes that were stuA dependent, including a cluster of putative secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes, genes encoding proteins implicated in the regulation of morphogenesis, and genes encoding allergens and other antigenic proteins.

40|$|An {{endogenous}} Î±-amylase inhibitor {{was found}} to be synthesized in embryos of developing barley grain (Hordeum vulgare cv Bonanza). Accumulation of this protein occurred late in development (stage IV), {{at the same time that}} endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) showed a large increase. The inhibitor could be induced up to 23 -fold in isolated immature embryos (stage III) by culture in ABA. <b>Precocious</b> <b>germination</b> was also blocked in stage III embryos by ABA. Dehydration stress on the isolated immature embryos also induced higher levels of the inhibitor and ABA. An even greater response to dehydration stress was observed in young seedlings, where inhibitor content increased 20 -fold and ABA increased 80 -fold during water stress. The high degree of correlation between ABA and inhibitor contents in in situ embryos, dehydrated embryos and young seedlings, as well as the increase in inhibitor caused by exogenously applied ABA to isolated embryos, suggests that increased Î±-amylase inhibitor synthesis in response to dehydration stress is mediated by ABA...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Experiments were {{performed}} to assess regulatory factors governing maize embryo maturation and vivipary. Both visual and molecular markers of embryo development were {{used to examine the}} roles of the hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs), as well as water stress in governing transit from early embryogeny to maturation-phase development. A differential screen identified cDNAs whose expression is impaired in maize viviparous mutants which fail to undergo maturation and instead precociously germinate. The cDNAs isolated in this screen absolutely required both ABA and the Viviparousl (Vpl) gene product for expression both in vivo and in vitro. Two novel clones were isolated: a maize homologue of the wheat metallothionein gene E[subscript]c and a second clone which may encode a novel seed storage protein of maize. In a separate screen, a maize cDNA encoding a Lea group 3 protein was isolated. Like many maturation-associated genes, maize Lea 3 was shown to ABA-inducible but is also expressed in response to water stress in the absence of ABA or the Vp 1 gene. We examined whether gibberellins might also be a factor modulating <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> Gibberellin inhibitors applied to cultured wildtype embryos suppressed <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> and enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in a developmentally specific manner. These behaviors mimicked the effect of ABA and they were reversed by the addition of exogenous GAâ. Vivipary in vivo resulting from diminished ABA levels could be suppressed by either chemical or genetic reduction of GA levels in immature kernels and resulted in desiccation-tolerant seed. In contrast, reduction of endogenous gibberellins did not suppress vivipary of the ABA-insensitive mutant vp 1. Temporal analysis of gibberellin accumulation in developing kernels revealed the accumulation of two bioactive species (GAâ and GAâ) during a developmental window just prior to peak ABA levels. It is suggested that these species stimulate a developmental program leading to vivipary in the absence of sufficient levels of ABA and that reduction of GA levels reestablishes a hormone balance appropriate for suppression of germination and induction of maturation in ABA-deficient kernels. The failure to suppress vivipary via reduction of GA levels in the ABA-insensitive mutant vp 1 suggests that the wildtype gene product functions downstream of the sites of GA and ABA action in regulation of maturation versus germination...|$|E
40|$|Oilseed {{plants like}} Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) develop green photosynthetically active embryos. Upon seed maturation, the {{embryonic}} chloroplasts degenerate into a highly reduced plastid type called the eoplast. Upon germination, eoplasts redifferentiate into chloroplasts and other plastid types. Here, we describe seedling plastid development 1 (spd 1), an Arabidopsis seedling albino mutant {{capable of producing}} normal green vegetative tissues. Mutant seedlings also display defects in etioplast and amyloplast development. <b>Precocious</b> <b>germination</b> of spd 1 embryos showed that the albino seedling phenotype of spd 1 was dependent on the passage of developing embryos through the degreening and dehydration stages of seed maturation, suggesting that SPD 1 is critical during eoplast development or early stages of eoplast redifferentiation. The SPD 1 gene was found to encode a protein containing a putative chloroplast-targeting sequence in its amino terminus and also domains common to P-loop ATPases. Chloroplast localization of the SPD 1 protein was confirmed by targeting assays in vivo and in vitro. Although the exact function of SPD 1 remains to be defined, our findings reveal aspects of plastid development unique to embryo-derived cells...|$|E
40|$|The viviparous- 1 (vpl) gene in maize {{controls}} multiple developmental responses {{associated with}} the maturation phase of seed formation. Most notably, mutant embryos have reduced sensitivity to the hormone abscisic acid, resulting in <b>precocious</b> <b>germination,</b> and blocked anthocyanin synthesis in aleurone and embryo tissues. The Vp 7 locus was cloned by transposon tagging, using the Roberfson's Mutator element present in the vpl-muml mutant allele. Detection of DNA rearrangements in severa 1 spontaneous and transposable element-induced mutant vpl alleles, including a partia 1 deletion of the locus, confirmed {{the identity of the}} clone. The Vpl gene encodes a 2500 nucleotide mRNA that is expressed specifically in embryo and endosperm tissues of the developing seed. This transcript is absent in seed tissues of vpl mutant stocks. Expression of C 7, a regulatory gene for the anthocyanin pathway, is selectively blocked at the mRNA leve 1 in vpl mutant seed tissues, indicating the Vpl may control the anthocyanin pathway by regulating C 7. We suggest that the Vpl gene product functions to potentiate multiple signal transduction pathways in specific seed tissues...|$|E
40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) is {{required}} for seed maturation in maize (Zea mays L.) and other plants. Gibberellins (GAs) are also present in developing maize embryos, and mutual antagonism of GAs and ABA appears to govern the choice between <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> or quiescence and maturation. Exogenous ABA can also induce quiescence and maturation in immature maize embryos in culture. To examine the role of GAs versus ABA in regulating maize embryo maturation, the effects of modulating GA levels were {{compared with those of}} ABA in embryos cultured at successive stages of development. The effects of GA synthesis inhibition or exogenous GA application differed markedly in embryos at different stages of development, indicating changes in both endogenous GA levels and in the capacity for GA synthesis as embryogenesis and maturation progress. In immature embryos, the inhibition of GA synthesis mimicked the effects of exogenous ABA, as shown by the suppression of germination, the acquisition of anthocyanin pigments, and the accumulation of a variety of maturation-phase mRNAs. We suggest that GA antagonizes ABA signaling in developing maize embryos, and that the changing hormone balance provides temporal control over the maturation phase...|$|E
40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) plays {{important}} roles in many aspects of seed development, including accumulation of storage compounds, acquisition of desiccation tolerance, induction of seed dormancy, and suppression of <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> Quantification of ABA in the F 1 and F 2 populations originated from crosses between wild type and an ABA-deficient mutant aba 2 - 2 demonstrated that ABA was synthesized in both maternal and zygotic tissues during seed development. In the absence of zygotic ABA, ABA synthesized in maternal tissues was translocated into the embryos and partially induced seed dormancy. We also analyzed the levels of ABA metabolites, gibberellins, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), cytokinins, jasmonates and salicylic acid (SA) in the developing seeds of wild type and aba 2 - 2. ABA metabolites accumulated differentially in the silique and seed tissues during development. Endogenous levels of SA were elevated in aba 2 - 2 in the later developmental stages, whereas that of IAA was reduced compared to wild type. These data suggest that ABA metabolism depends on developmental stages and tissues, and that ABA interacts with other hormones to regulate seed developmental processes.

40|$|Full {{understanding}} of mechanisms that control seed dormancy and germination remains elusive. Whereas {{it has been}} proposed that translational control plays a predominant role in germination, other studies suggest the importance of specific gene expression patterns in imbibed seeds. Transgenic plants were developed to permit conditional expression of a gene encoding 9 -cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 6 (NCED 6), a rate-limiting enzyme in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, using the ecdysone receptor-based plant gene switch system and the ligand methoxyfenozide. Induction of NCED 6 during imbibition increased ABA levels more than 20 -fold and was sufficient to prevent seed germination. Germination suppression was prevented by fluridone, an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis. In another study, induction of the NCED 6 gene in transgenic seeds of nondormant mutants tt 3 and tt 4 reestablished seed dormancy. Furthermore, inducing expression of NCED 6 during seed development suppressed vivipary, <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> of developing seeds. These results indicate that expression of a hormone metabolism gene in seeds can be a sole determinant of dormancy. This study opens the possibility of developing a robust technology to suppress or promote seed germination through engineering pathways of hormone metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Development of Brassica napus L. cv Tower embryos of {{different}} ages cultured in vitro with and without abscisic acid (ABA) was compared with normal development in situ to investigate the role of ABA in embryo maturation. Endogenous ABA levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, and sensitivity to ABA was assayed {{in terms of its}} ability to suppress <b>precocious</b> <b>germination</b> and stimulate accumulation of storage protein and storage protein mRNA. During development in situ, the levels of endogenous ABA and 12 S storage protein mRNA both reach their peaks just before the embryos begin to desiccate. The ABA levels during this phase of development also correlate with the time required in culture before germination is evident. Following these peaks, increasing concentrations of exogenous ABA are required to both suppress germination and continue storage protein accumulation in vitro. Thus, both endogenous ABA and ABA sensitivity decline during maturation. The concentrations of exogenous ABA required to suppress germination at these later stages result in abnormally high levels of endogenous ABA and appear to be toxic. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that in maturing rapeseeds, low water content rather than ABA prevents germination during the later stages of development...|$|E

Culture of immature embryos leads to their germination into weak seedlings, skipping the later stages of embryogenesis, by a process known as <b>precocious</b> <b>germination.</b> Progressively smaller embryos have been cultured by supplementation of the medium with coconut milk or hormonal additives or by osmotic adjustment of the medium by high concentrations of sucrose or mannitol.
