40|$|The decade-long {{process of}} {{negotiation}} {{leading to a}} new regime of Oceans Law is drawing to a close. One of its major achievements to date is the elaboration of an entirely new concept in ocean space, the exclusive economic zone. Canada has {{played a leading role}} in bringing about consensus on the main elements of this zonal approach, a bridge linking certain features of the territorial sea regime with a number of safeguards derived from the exercise of high seas rights. Canada 's contribution was based generally on a novel application of the functional approach which has been prevalent in Canada 's treatment of Law of the Sea issues over the past few years. The idea was to apply the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> powers to those of functionalism, in order to foster a zonal approach whereby certain functional rights and obligations (pertaining, for instance, to fisheries or to the marine environment) would be carried out by the coastal state on behalf of the international community. In recognition of its exercise of this mandate, and in regard to its geographical proximity to the ocean space it managed, the coastal state would be granted a preferential (and for most purposes an exclusive) access to the resources of the zone. One of the best examples of this approach can be found in Canada 's earliest efforts to deal with the fundamental issue of fishing rights at the Conference. Bringing a multi-disciplinary focus to bear on the need to distinguish between different species of fish in the coastal areas, the Canadian delegation, with the co-sponsorship of a number of like-minded countries, brought forward proposals tailored to the management and exploitation of these species...|$|R

Whether the director of the kindergarten can select the appropriate taand delegate to observe the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> a successful <b>delegation,</b> showed the results of empirical research. Method for empirical research was a survey. The questionnaire was designed for stand-alone nursery school director with legal personality. It addressed a total of 100 managers from kindergarten in Usti region, the return of questionnaires was 57 %. The results of the survey were analyzed and processed into graphs. The outcome of this work is a set of views, recommendations and methods that managers use to manage specific activities (so- called management functions) and their delegation in kindergarten.

We argue that the Maastricht Treaty provides a unique international commitment that enables governments to follow restrictive fiscal policies by attributing their negative side-effects to Europe, and to implement austerity measures despite rising unemployment or a decline in growth. Hence, the popularity of the European idea is instrumented to enforce fiscal discipline. The paper outlines the political economy framework and presents new econometric evidence.

In a common OAUTH scenario, the CSC first accesses a service/application that redirects him to the IdP, where he performs authentication and after successful authentication, IdP redirects the service consumer back to the Cloud service along with the identity token. From then on, service consumers access that particular service via that token.|$|R

In particular, the interdisciplinary debate has led to three alternative forms of participation, potentially capable of subtracting the democratic political process from the negative effects produced both by generalised apathy and by the progressive success of the NIMBY syndrome. We are referring to direct participation within the sphere of deliberative democracy mechanisms; to mediated participation by groups in the processes of contractual democracy; to the selective participation of groups and institutions at decision-making tables regulated by pactional and contractual instruments (Calaresu 2012, 2016).|$|E

30|$|Fundamental diverse {{features}} {{stem from}} these different justification principles {{between the two}} models: if the representative model envisages that the citizen elect his representatives and exercise his control {{by means of the}} threat of non re-election at subsequent elections, participatory democracy opposes the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation,</b> which is seen as an instrument of oligarchic power. In the participatory model representatives must, in effect, always be revocable; not being in possession of a generalised delegation, each time a decision is faced (and not just at the moment of voting), the citizen must be given the chance to actively take part in that decision (Macpherson 1966, 1973, 1977). For there to be “participation”, citizens must, then, be involved in the regulation of the institutions and in the key decisions of society. For this reason, participatory democracy legitimises all those non-institutional forms of pressure on decisions that may be defined as “protest repertories”.|$|E

40|$|Razmejitev pristojnosti med EU in državami članicami je določena v PUE in ponazarja razmerje med skupnostjo in njenimi deli. Zanjo velja načelo prenosa pristojnosti, ki določa, da ima EU pristojnosti, ki so jih države članice prenesle nanjo. Za nadzor izvajanja pristojnosti je s PEU veljalo načelo subsidiarnosti, pri katerem EU deluje na področjih, ki niso v njeni izključni pristojnosti samo, če države članice ne morejo doseči ciljev predlaganih ukrepov in se le-ti lažje dosežejo na ravni EU. V načelu sorazmernosti oblast ukrepa samo toliko in tako, da je ukrep nujen, torej je sorazmeren cilju. Vrste pristojnosti so določene v pogodbi, in sicer se delijo na izključne pristojnosti EU, deljene pristojnosti med EU in državami članicami ter na dodatne pristojnosti. Kjer ima EU izključno pristojnost sama, izdaja in sprejema akte, države članice posežejo le v primeru, če jih EU pooblasti za njihovo izvajanje. Pri deljeni pristojnosti tako EU kot države članice izdajajo in sprejemajo akte, torej tam, kjer EU ne izvaja, izvajajo države članice. Pri dodatnih pristojnosti EU sprejme ukrepe za podporo in uskladitev ukrepov držav članic. V magistrskem delu me je zanimalo, koliko sodb je bilo vloženih proti državam članicam zaradi neupoštevanja nadoblasti EU, kar se šteje za kršitev pogodb. Evropska komisija je predlagala Sodišču EU, naj ugotovi, ali posamezna država članica izpolnjuje naložene obveznosti EU. O tem, ali je tožba obsodilna oziroma oprostilna, je odločalo Sodišče EU. Osredotočila sem se na tožbe zaradi neizpolnitve obveznosti držav članic v letih 2013 – 2016 glede na področja izključnih, deljenih in dodatnih pristojnosti. The {{delimitation}} of competences {{between the}} EU and member states is {{laid down in}} the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and it illustrates {{the relationship between the}} community and its parts. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> is valid for the delimitation of competences which provides that the EU has competences reordered to it by member state. The principle of subsidiarity is in TEU. It surveillance implementations competences in which the EU operates in areas where they cannot fall under its exclusive competence only if the objectives of the proposed action cannot be achieved by the member state and can be better achieved at EU level. In the principle of proportionality, the authority takes action but only so much is necessary so it can proportionate to the goal. Types of competences are laid down in the Treaty which are divided into the exclusive competence of the EU, shared competences between the EU and member states and additional competences. Where the EU has exclusive competence itself issuing and adopting acts. Member states intervene only if the EU authorizes them to implement acts. In the case of shared competence both the EU and member states issue and accept some acts, in case where the EU does not implement it, they are implemented by the member states. For additional competences the EU takes measures to support and coordinate actions of member states. In the master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis I was interested in how many judgments were brought against member states because of disregard of the authority EU which is considered breach of contracts. The European commission has asked the EU court to determine whether each member state fulfils imposed EU obligations. The court of justice has ruled whether action was convict or released. I have focused on actions for failure to fulfil obligations of member states in the years 2013 - 2016 in terms of areas of exclusive, shared and additional competences...|$|E

6000|$|The next plea {{urged by}} Mr. Hastings is conveniency. [...] "It was convenient," [...] he says, [...] "for {{me to do}} this."

Much less has he a right to supersede the law, and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> his own <b>delegation</b> and appointment, upon any idea of convenience. But what was the conveniency? There was no one professed object connected with Mr. Hastings's going up to Benares which might not {{as well have been}} attained in Calcutta. The only difference would have been, that in the latter case he must have entered some part of his proceedings upon the Consultations, whether he wished it or not. If he had a mind to negotiate with the Vizier, he had a resident at his court, and the Vizier had a resident in Calcutta. The most solemn treaties had often been made without any Governor-General carrying up a <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> civil and military power. If it had been his object to break treaties, he might have broken them at Calcutta, as he broke the treaty of Chunar. Is there an article in that treaty that he might not as well have made at Calcutta? Is there an article that he broke (for he broke them all) that he could not have broken at Calcutta? So that, whether pledging or breaking the faith of the Company, he might have done both or either without ever stirring from the Presidency.|$|R

This paper employs a principal-agent approach to analyse patterns <b>of</b> policy-making <b>delegation</b> in the EU to explore this question. It finds a U-shaped relationship between the extent <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> and the 'European presence' in global financial governance: when member states either remain in control of policy or delegate extensive competencies, European stakeholders are well represented. In contrast, intermediate levels <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> can undermine the European presence by tying member states' hands without sufficiently empowering supranational agents to fill the gap. Patterns <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> are traced to the heterogeneity of member state interests and the pre-existence of international governance arrangements.
