40|$|Background: The {{detection}} of timing of ovulation {{is an important}} step in the evaluation and management of subfertility. Ultrasonography plays a vital role in monitoring follicular growth. Aims: To assess the value of ultrasound scanning of the ovaries in the periovulatory period to detect ovulation and to correlate the results with basal body temperature (BBT) chart and other <b>presumptive</b> <b>evidences</b> of ovulation. Methods: In this prospective study, a total of 60 subfertile patients were selected from the outpatient department of obstetrics and gynaecology, BPKIHS, Dharan. BBT charting, midcycle abdominal pain record & premenstrual endometrial biopsy were performed in all patients i. e. in spontaneous ovulating and anovulating (induced later). Ultrasonographic periovulatory follicular tracking was usually started around 10 th day of the cycle. The results were then correlated with BBT mainly and also with mittelschmerz and endometrial biopsy.

40|$|ABSTRACT-A {{case-control study}} of {{patients}} discharged from hospitals revealed fourfold differences in geographic variation in stomach cancer risk within the Department of Narii'lo (Colombia). Data from gastroscopic surveys of population groups, samples of water supplies, and urine and saliva in Narii'lo also indicated a generally positive correlation among the following parameters: 1) gastric cancer risk, 2) prevalence of chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, 3) nitrate content of well waters, and 4) nitrate excretion by the population. Urinary excretion reflected the ingestion of nitrates, and this implied a higher average intake of nitrates in the populations {{at high risk}} for stomach cancer. The Narii'lo data could be construed as <b>presumptive</b> epidemiologic <b>evidence</b> for the role of nitrate availability in the etiology of stomach cancer. [...] J Nat!

The court was of opinion that the evidence led up to a reasonable inference that the deceased was actually Sir Blount, and probate was granted on the strength of it.

Twenty-eight <b>presumptive</b> loci were <b>evidenced,</b> 10 of which were monomorphic. Gene diversity was found to be high for salamandrids (mean percentage of polymorphic loci = 46. 4, mean expected heterozygosity = 0. 048, mean = 0. 358) with about two-thirds due to within-population diversity. Both multidimensional scaling and neighbor-joining analyses on genetic distances (mean Nei's D = 0. 131) between populations showed that these can be divided into two units, distributed north and south of the Central Apennines, respectively. Within-population gene diversity was found to be lower in the north-cluster, following a pattern of isolation-by-distance; this pattern was not observed in the south. We conclude that historical events (possibly glaciations) divided the populations into the two cited units. The genetic structure of T. carnifex in central and southern Italy somewhat parallels that of T. italicus from the same areas, thus suggesting a common evolutionary pattern of variation...|$|R

The sloping fillet is indeed found down to late periods; and the vertical fillet, as in No. 12, in Byzantine ones; but still, when a base has such a sloping fillet and peculiarly graceful sweeping cavetto, as those of No. 10, looking as if they would run into one line with each other, it is strong <b>presumptive</b> <b>evidence</b> of its belonging to an early, rather than a late period.|$|E

In this he stated that he was passing over the cliff on the remoter side of the cove just as the sun was setting. At that time he saw a bather carried along in the current outside the mouth of the cove, and guessed in an instant that there was but a poor chance for him unless he should be possessed of unusual muscular powers. He drifted behind a projection of the coast, and Mr. Barker followed along the shore in the same direction. But by the time that he could reach an elevation sufficiently great to command a view of the sea beyond, dusk had set in, and nothing further was to be seen.|$|E

There was evidence of animus, it was true; but that evidence was weak; there was partial identification; but that identification lay open to the serious objection that all the persons who now swore to Guy Waring's personality had sworn just as surely and confidently before to his brother Cyril's. On the whole, the judge summed up strongly in Guy's favour. He wiped his clammy brow and looked appealingly at the bar. As the jury would hope for justice themselves, let them remember to mete out nothing but strict justice to the accused person who now stood trembling in the dock before them.|$|E
60|$|I am firmly {{persuaded that}} no {{doctrine}} was ever widely diffused among various nations through successive ages and under different religions, (such {{as is the}} doctrine of original sin, and redemption, those fundamental articles of every known religion professing to be revealed,) which is not founded either {{in the nature of}} things or in the necessities of our nature. In the language of the schools, it carries with it <b>presumptive</b> <b>evidence</b> that it is either objectively or subjectively true. And the more strange and contradictory such a doctrine may appear to the understanding, or discursive faculty, the stronger is the presumption in its favour. For whatever satirists may say, and sciolists imagine, the human mind has no predilection for absurdity. I do not, however, mean that such a doctrine shall be always the best possible representation of the truth on which it is founded; for the same body casts strangely different shadows in different places, and different degrees of light, but that it always does shadow out some such truth, and derive its influence over our faith from our obscure perception of that truth. Yea, even where the person himself attributes his belief of it to the miracles, with which it was announced by the founder of his religion.|$|E
60|$|Every fossil {{which takes}} an {{intermediate}} place between {{forms of life}} already known, may be said, {{so far as it}} is intermediate, to be evidence in favour of evolution, inasmuch as it shows a possible road by which evolution may have taken place. But the mere discovery of such a form does not, in itself, prove that evolution took place by and through it, nor does it constitute more than <b>presumptive</b> <b>evidence</b> in favour of evolution in general. Suppose A, B, C to be three forms, while B is intermediate in structure between A and C. Then the doctrine of evolution offers four possible alternatives. A may have become C by way of B; or C may have become A by way of B; or A and C may be independent modifications of B; or A, B, and C may be independent modifications of some unknown D. Take the case of the Pigs, the Anoplothcridoe, and the Ruminants. The Anoplothcridoe are intermediate between the first and the last; but this does not tell us whether the Ruminants have come from the Pigs, or the Pigs from Ruminants, or both from Anoplothcridoe, or whether Pigs, Ruminants, and Anoplotlicridoe alike may not have diverged from some common stock.|$|E

It is a notorious fact that the widely-spread taste for register-stoves has materially increased the demand for small boys; whereas the men, who, under a fictitious character, dance about the streets on the first of May nowadays, would be a tight fit in a kitchen flue, to say nothing of the parlour.

6000|$|The Abstract of the History of England here reprinted {{calls for}} {{little or no}} comment. It is but a dry {{relation}} of events with no touch in the recital of any of those qualities which characterize Swift's writings. The facts were evidently obtained from the old chroniclers. What object Swift had in writing this Abstract is not known. If the dedication to the Count de Gyllenborg truly states his intention, it must be confessed that the [...] "foreigners, and gentlemen of our own country" [...] had not much upon which to congratulate themselves. Why Swift should have chosen the Count de Gyllenborg to whom to address the dedication must also remain a matter for conjecture. The Count had been sent out of the British Isles for instigating a conspiracy for a Jacobite insurrection in Great Britain. Swift wrote his dedication {{three years after the}} Count's expulsion. Knowing that the Count's master, Charles XII. of Sweden, had been a party to the plot, he yet writes in a most amiable tone of friendliness towards both, with a parenthetical sneer at [...] "his present Britannic Majesty." [...] Undoubtedly this dedication might easily and fairly be taken as strong <b>presumptive</b> <b>evidence</b> of a leaning on Swift's part towards the Pretender. It will, however, be more truly interpreted, if it be considered as an expression of contempt for the King of England and the ministry in power.|$|E
60|$|Faith {{was given}} to man that his affections, {{detached}} from the treasures of time, might be inclined to settle upon those of eternity:--the elevation of his nature, which this habit produces on earth, being to him a <b>presumptive</b> <b>evidence</b> of a future state of existence; and giving him a title to partake of its holiness. The religious man values what he sees chiefly as an 'imperfect shadowing forth' of what he is incapable of seeing. The concerns of religion refer to indefinite objects, and are too weighty for the mind to support them without relieving itself by resting {{a great part of}} the burthen upon words and symbols. The commerce between Man and his Maker cannot be carried on but by a process where much is represented in little, and the Infinite Being accommodates himself to a finite capacity. In all this may be perceived the affinity between religion and poetry; between religion--making up the deficiencies of reason by faith; and poetry--passionate for the instruction of reason; between religion--whose element is infinitude, and whose ultimate trust is the supreme of things, submitting herself to circumscription, and reconciled to substitutions; and poetry--ethereal and transcendent, yet incapable to sustain her existence without sensuous incarnation. In this community of nature may be perceived also the lurking incitements of kindred error;--so that we shall find that no poetry has been more subject to distortion, than that species, the argument and scope of which is religious; and no lovers of the art have gone farther astray than the pious and the devout.|$|E
60|$|There {{is nothing}} more {{difficult}} to ascertain than the true state of the case--with reference to culpability, accidental circumstance, inherent or incidental weakness, negligence, unavoidable risks, etcetera--in such a disaster as that which happened to the great ship in September of 1861. And {{nothing could be more}} unfair than to pass judgment on her without a full knowledge of the minute particulars, and, moreover, a pretty fair capacity to understand such details and their various relations. Before proceeding with the narrative of the event referred to, we may remark that while, on the one hand, it may be argued, with great plausibility, that her numerous disasters and misfortunes prove that she is unfitted for the navigation of the sea, it may, on the other hand, be argued, with equal plausibility, that the very fact of her having come through such appalling trials unconquered, though buffeted, is strong <b>presumptive</b> <b>evidence</b> that she is eminently fitted for her work, and that, under ordinary circumstances and proper management, she would do it well. It is believed that any other vessel afloat would have been sunk had she been exposed to the same storm under similar circumstances. It must be borne in mind that, although other vessels weathered the same storm successfully, they did not do so with their rudder and rudder-posts gone, their captains and part of their crews new to them, and their chain cables, cabin furniture, and other material left as totally unsecured {{as if she had been}} a river steamer about to start on a few hours' trip.|$|E
60|$|It is {{probable}} that few persons who proclaim their belief in miracles have considered what {{would be necessary to}} justify that belief {{in the case of a}} professed modern miracle-worker. Suppose, for example, it is affirmed that A.B. died and that C.D. brought him to life again. Let it be granted that A.B. and C.D. are persons of unimpeachable honour and veracity; that C.D. is the next heir to A.B.'s estate, and therefore had a strong motive for not bringing him to life again; and that all A.B.'s relations, respectable persons who bore him a strong affection, or had otherwise an interest in his being alive, declared that they saw him die. Furthermore, let A.B. be seen after his recovery by all his friends and neighbours, and let his and their depositions, that he is now alive, be taken down before a magistrate of known integrity and acuteness: would all this constitute even <b>presumptive</b> <b>evidence</b> that C.D. had worked a miracle? Unquestionably not. For the most important link in the whole chain of evidence is wanting, and that is the proof that A.B. was really dead. The evidence of ordinary observers on such a point as this is absolutely worthless. And, even medical evidence, unless the physician is a person of unusual knowledge and skill, may have little more value. Unless careful thermometric observation proves that the temperature has sunk below a certain point; unless the cadaveric stiffening of the muscles has become well established; all the ordinary signs of death may be fallacious, and the intervention of C.D. may have had no more to do with A.B.'s restoration to life than any other fortuitously coincident event.|$|E
