(The reaction used to make the latter became known as the Perkin reaction.) Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby Grand Union Canal changed from week to week depending on the activity at Perkin's Greenford dyeworks. In 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from anthracene of the brilliant red dye alizarin, which had been isolated and identified from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, simultaneously with <b>purpurin,</b> another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company BASF patented the same process one day before he did. During the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe's chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-monopoly on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.|$|E
50|$|In 1827, the French chemists Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Colin began {{producing}} garancine, the concentrated {{version of}} natural madder. They then found that madder lake contained two colorants, the red alizarin {{and the more}} rapidly fading <b>purpurin.</b> <b>Purpurin</b> is only present in the natural form of madder and gives a distinctive orange/red generally warmer tone that pure synthetic alizarin does not. <b>Purpurin</b> fluoresces yellow to red under ultraviolet light, while synthetic alizarin slightly shows violet. Alizarin was discovered before <b>purpurin,</b> by heating the ground madder with acid and potash. A yellow vapor crystallized into bright red needles: alizarin. This alizarin concentrate comprises only 1% of the madder root.|$|E

50|$|Analysis of {{the fibers}} and dyes {{revealed}} {{the use of}} alizarin, <b>purpurin,</b> rubiadin, quinizarin, indigo and indirubin.

40|$|Unlike mammals, {{the fish}} optic nerve can {{regenerate}} after injury. So far, many growth or trophic {{factors have been}} shown as an axon-regenerating molecule. However, it is totally unknown what substance regulates or triggers the activity of these factors on axonal elongation. Therefore, we constructed a goldfish retina cDNA library prepared from the retina treated with optic nerve transection 5 d previously, when it was just before regrowing optic axons after injury. A cDNA clone for goldfish <b>purpurin</b> for which expression was upregulated during the early stage of optic nerve regeneration was isolated from the retina cDNA library. <b>Purpurin</b> was discovered as a secretory retinol-binding protein in developing chicken retinas. Levels of <b>purpurin</b> mRNA and protein transiently increased and rapidly decreased 2 – 5 d and 10 d after axotomy, respectively. <b>Purpurin</b> mRNA was localized to the photoreceptor cells, whereas the protein was diffusely found {{in all of the}} retinal layers. A recombinant <b>purpurin</b> alone did not affect any change of neurite outgrowth in explant culture of the control retina, whereas a concomitant addition of the recombinant <b>purpurin</b> and retinol first induced a drastic enhancement of neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, the action of retinol-bound <b>purpurin</b> was effective only in the control (untreated) retinas but not in those primed (treated) with a previous optic nerve transection.
