The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> means that Parliament must squarely confront {{what it is}} doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to offer a {{reconstruction}} of Lon Fuller’s critique of Hart’s legal positivism. I show that contrary to the claims of Fuller’s many critics, one can reconstruct from his work a clear and powerful argument against legal positivism, {{at least in the}} guise found in the work of H. L. A. Hart. The essence of the argument is that Fuller’s <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> posit that the same considerations that count for law’s excellence are relevant also for the determining what counts as law. I contrast this view with Hart’s legal positivism, which acknowledged that the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> are relevant for law’s excellence, but considered them irrelevant for determining the question what counts as law. In contrast to Fuller’s view, this view looks arbitrary, and - a point on which I focus - completely undefended. And yet, despite the many years since Fuller presented his arguments against legal positivism, this argument has not been adequately answered. I conclude that even if Fuller’s arguments are answerable, they are yet to be answered...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{cooperation}} with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is characterized by two seemingly very different aspects namely the legal, and the diplomatic (or 'political'). It is often argued that the diplomatic aspect is justifiably subject to deviation from the traditional legal criteria in international relations, such as are the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality,</b> reciprocity, etc. The author argues here that any 'pragmatism' that infringes the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> in international relations, and in the internal political system, short lived, {{and that in the}} mid-term it emerges as counter-productive. The author is of the opinion that the Tribunal has resorted to such pragmatist steps, and has consequently been turned into a lobby, whose goal has been to influence the internal political scene of Serbia. By such action, the Tribunal, and primarily its Chief Prosecutor, have stepped out of the domain of legitimate action of a criminal court, and the destructive consequences of such 'relativisation' of the standards of legitimacy are yet to become clear in the further development of international criminal courts...|$|R

This transformative principle penetrates {{to the heart of the}} law and has guided the development of Cuban Law since the mid-1970s.

5000|$|The primary {{provisions}} of the interim Constitution regulating local government are contained in Chapter 10. To the extent, therefore, that a local government acts in breach {{of one of the}} direct and mandatory {{provisions of}} Chapter 10, it is clear that that infringement will be in breach of the Constitution and subject to constitutional challenge. Local government is also subject to Chapter 3 of the interim Constitution. It is also clear from Chapter 10 that the powers, functions and structures of local government provided for in the Constitution will be supplemented by powers, functions and structures provided for in other laws made by a competent authority. There is no doubt, the court held, that the common-law principles of ultra vires remain under the new constitutional order. However, they are underpinned (and supplemented where necessary) by a constitutional <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality.</b> In relation to [...] "administrative action," [...] the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is enshrined in section 24(a) of the Constitution.

50|$|In {{a review}} of The Morality of Law, Hart criticises Fuller's work, saying that these {{principles}} are merely ones of means-ends efficiency; it is inappropriate, he says, to call them a morality.
