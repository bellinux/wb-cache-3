50|$|The {{bridge and}} {{adjacent}} re-landscaped Cathedral Green opened in March 2009 {{at a cost}} of Â£4.2m and is located in an area of World Heritage status. It links the Cathedral Green to Stuart Street and has been designed to swing to one side when water levels are high. It weighs 95 tonnes, with a box steel section deck, supported by three cables, keeping the overall structural slender. The bridge swings on a <b>pintle</b> <b>bearing,</b> with a central wheel to support its weight.|$|E
40|$|The new 34 -m high {{efficiency}} Azimuth - Elevation antenna configuration, including its features, dynamic characteristics and performance at 8. 4 -GHz frequencies is described. The current-technology {{features of this}} antenna produce a highly reliable configuration by incorporation of a main wheel and track azimuth support, central <b>pintle</b> pivot <b>bearing,</b> close tolerance surface panels and all-welded construction. Also described are basic drive controls that, as slaved to three automatic microprocessors, provide accurate and safe control of the antenna's steering tasks. At this time antenna installations are completed at Goldstone and Canberra and have operationally supported the Voyager - Uranus encounter. A third installation is being constructed currently in Madrid and is scheduled for completion in late 1986...|$|R
50|$|The {{triangular}} {{base frame}} of the antenna is made from structural steel. It rotates on wheels about a center <b>pintle</b> ball <b>bearing</b> on a turntable track 30 feet (10 m) in diameter. The track consists of stress-relieved, planed steel plates which are individually adjusted to produce a track which is flat to about 1/64 inch (0.4 mm). The faces of the wheels are cone-shaped to minimize contact friction. A tangential force of 100 pounds (400 N) is sufficient to start the antenna rotating on the turntable. The antenna beam can be directed to {{any part of the}} sky using the turntable for azimuth adjustments and the elevation wheel to change the elevation angle or altitude above the horizon.|$|R
