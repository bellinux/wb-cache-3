30|$|Common {{water-based}} {{fracturing fluid}} with chemical additives is pumped at high rate and pressure into the formation during hydraulic fracturing process. When the pumping pressure exceeds {{the strength of}} the formation rock, fractures are induced and propagated into the formation, and then the <b>propping</b> <b>agent</b> is pumped into the fractures to keep them from closing after pumping pressure is released. Therefore, a man-made passage with high conductivity is constructed and hydrocarbon can flow into the well from the low-permeability formation (Economides and Nolte 2000).|$|E

40|$|Every {{tight gas}} well {{needs to be}} stimulated with a {{hydraulic}} fracture treatment to produce natural gas at economic flow rates and recover a volume of gas that provides an acceptable return on investment. Over the past few decades, {{many different types of}} fracture fluids, <b>propping</b> <b>agents</b> and treatment sizes have been tried in the Cotton Valley formation. The treatment design engineer has to choose the optimum fluid, optimum proppant, optimum treatment size and make sure the optimum treatment is mixed and pumped in the field. These optimum values also depend on drilling costs, fracturing costs and other economic parameters; such as gas prices, operating costs and taxes. Using information from the petroleum literature, numerical and analytical simulators, and statistical analysis of production data, this research provides a detailed economic evaluation of the Cotton Valley wells drilled in the Elm Grove field operated by Matador Resources to determine not only the optimum treatment type, but also the optimum treatment volume as a function of drilling costs, completion costs, operating costs and gas prices.

40|$|Indonesia {{has been}} {{producing}} oil since 19 th century and started producing 2 types of Unconventional Resources (UR) which are heavy oil since 1958 and Coal Bed Methane (CBM) since this year (2012). The concept of resource triangle {{was introduced by}} Masters and Gray in 1979 to describe the huge reserves of UR and its difficulty to be produced. A modified version had been done with a scale to exactly describe the amount of oil or gas reserve of UR. It is then linked with the stimulation techniques needed to produce them. To recover the heavy oil, thermal stimulation or recovery technique is needed to reduce its very high viscosity. Similarly, Coal Bed Methane (CBM) is also categorized as unconventional reservoirs (UR) because of its low permeability and can only be produced economically at commercial flow rates with special recovery processes or well-stimulation treatment. This paper will give a comparison study of producing CBM with and without hydraulic fracturing, a type of well-stimulation technology.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, hydraulic stimulation is {{the most}} commonly used technique for improving the permeability of a geothermal reservoir. Some of the world's EGS projects can extract geothermal energy from naturally fractured reservoirs, such as Northwest Geysers, Landau, Insheim, Urach, Bruchsal, Soultz-sous-Fôrets, Fjällbacka, Hijiori, Rosemanowes, Falkenberg and Newberry. The pre-existing naturally fractured networks can be stimulated by low pressure that is just above the critical pressure of shear failure (hydraulic shearing). However, the process of hydraulic fracturing, which uses injected water at high pressure to crack the rocks, is also frequently used especially in granite. Compared with hydraulic fracturing with high injection pressure, hydraulic shearing can easily crack rocks with low pressure and keep the fractures open without requiring a <b>propping</b> <b>agent.</b> Chemical stimulation, which is most applicable in carbonate rocks or used to dissolve carbonate cement in sandstone formations, along with thermal stimulation has also proved to be effective in some cases. However, there is relatively little literature concerning the application of chemical and thermal stimulation technologies in EGS projects.|$|E

Agro-waste resources, specifically shells of tropical plants such as coconut shell and palm kernel shell are two environmentally friendly and potential renewable resources that can be utilized as <b>propping</b> <b>agents</b> in HF. Nevertheless, they are not yet widely studied as such. Given this lack of particular technical and reliable data, their conversion into proppant cannot be designed with confidence as it happens with other studied biomass feedstock such as walnut-hull. This paper includes {{a study on the}} experimental characteristics of two agro-wastes or biomasses, coconut shell and palm kernel shell, as possible resources as proppants in HF.

The results obtained from the analyses are compared to the commonly known walnut-hull particles. These biomasses show promising results and meet some of established API/ISO standards. This paper is intended to provide technical information on the characteristics of new agro-wastes resources and to emphasize their major strengths; that have not been highlighted in the literature.

40|$|AbstractCeramic proppants are {{classified}} as <b>propping</b> <b>agents</b> commonly used for the shale gas industry. Fractures created in shale deposits due to high fluid pressure (hydraulic fracturing) have to be propped allowing unconventional gas migration to a borehole. Ceramic granules located in the newly created fissures act as a prop so that the shale gas can flow up the well. It occurs if the proppants can resist the huge forces of the closing fractures at high temperature. Due to these strict geological conditions and processing requirements the proppants have to be characterized by proper physico- mechanical properties. The aim {{of this research was}} to study, compare and select the ceramic proppants characterized by the most appropriate parameters. The investigation relates to the industrial granules obtained by the mechanical granulation method and afterwards sintered which were confronted and analyzed. Utility of the proppants was estimated basing on bulk density and roundness coefficient. Structure, morphology and chemical composition of the samples were determined by the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The sintered proppants were also characterized with X-Ray Tomography, turbidity and solubility in acid additionally. The crucial parameter as mechanical strength was established during the propping samples subjection to the crush tests.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is a {{very important}} technique to increase the productivity and recovery of oil reservoirs with low pressure or high depth. The hydraulic fracturing technique is a method of well stimulation in which liquid under high pressure is pumped down a well to fracture the reservoir rock adjacent to the wellbore. <b>Propping</b> <b>agents</b> are used to keep the fractures/cracks open. They can be made from the reject of mineral extraction processes when they present specifics characteristic. The aim of this paper is the evaluation of the use of industrial rejects to the development of ceramic synthetic proppants that are resistant to chemical corrosion and high mechanical strength in aqueous acid and salt water environment. In this study, industrial rejects from nickel sulfide ore flotation (grey mud - GM), red mud (RM) from Bayer process and black mud (BM) from Caron processing of nickel was used as raw material for the production of ceramic synthetic proppants. The material processing was performed through drying, milling, pressing, sintering and characterizing raw material. Several characterization techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), high temperature dilatometry and compression strength test were performed after sintering to evaluate the technological potential of recycling these metallurgical and mineral rejects.

40|$|AbstractHydraulic {{fracturing}} {{and horizontal}} drilling {{has led to}} a shale gas energy boom in the United States. In addition to decreasing domestic energy costs, shale gas production has substantially reduced domestic CO 2 emissions, largely due to natural gas displacing coal-fired electricity generation. Water is the principal component of working fluids used for commercial hydraulic fracturing, along with other constituent chemicals and substances to enhance fracture propagation/longevity and <b>propping</b> <b>agent</b> (e. g., sand) transport. Industry, policy makers, and other stakeholders are aware of potential disadvantages of aqueous fracturing fluids, including water scarcity, environmental impact from constituent chemicals, and poor fracture performance. To address these problems we are undertaking a study using supercritical CO 2 as a replacement working fluid. Supercritical CO 2 has many potential benefits and drawbacks compared with water as a fracturing fluid; it may increase gas production through several coupled processes including enhanced fracturing, reduced flow blocking, and miscibility with in-place hydrocarbons, as well as challenges such as economics, resource availability, and assurances that the CO 2 is safely sequestered in the target formation. Through a combination of basic experiments, modelling, and historical research, we formally address these issues...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} {{for evaluating the}} performance of hydraulic fractures that are partially packed with proppant (<b>propping</b> <b>agent)</b> particles is presented. The residual opening of the partially propped fracture is determined {{as a function of}} the initial fracture geometry, the propped length of the fracture, the compressive rock stresses, the elastic properties of the rock, and the compressibility of the proppant pack. A mathematical model for fluid flow towards the fracture is developed, which incorporates the effects of the residual opening profile of the fracture and the high conductivity of the unpropped fracture length. The residual opening profile of the fracture is calculated for a particular case where the propp ant pack is nearly rigid and there is no closure ofthe fracture faces due to the confining (compressive) stresses. A sensitivity study is performed to demonstrate the dependence of the well productivity index on the propped length of the fracture, the propp ant pack permeability, and the dimensionless fracture conductivity. The sensitivity study suggests that the residual opening of a fracture has a significant impact on production, and that partially propped fractures can be more productive than fully propped fractures. Application ofthis {{new approach}} can lead to economic benefits. L. Bortolan Neto, A. Khanna and A. Kotousov[URL]...|$|E

The filter cake was built up in the lab and the thickness was measured with different methods. The profilometer has been tested as an effective tool to measure the filter cake thickness.

40|$|Today, {{optimizing}} well stimulation {{techniques to}} obtain maximum return of investment {{is still a}} challenge. Hydraulic fracturing is a typical application to improve ultimate recovery from oil and gas reservoirs. Proppant fracturing {{has become one of}} the most widely considered alternatives for application in carbonate reservoirs. Especially in areas that have high closure stress, the non-smoothly etched surface created by acid fracturing may not remain open upon closing, resulting in decrease in fracture conductivity and unsuccessful stimulation treatment. In early years, because of the increase in the success of proppant fracturing, proppant partial monolayer has been put forward as a method that helps generate the maximum fracture conductivity from proppant fracturing treatment. However, this method was not widely successful because of proppant crushing and proppant embedment problems that result in losing conductivity. The ability to transport <b>propping</b> <b>agents</b> in available fracturing fluid was also poor and resulted in difficulties and failures to obtain proppant partial monolayer placement. For carbonate formations, acid fracturing is another effective stimulation method. Simpler operation and lower cost made the technique attractive in the field with plenty of successful experiences. The heterogeneity feature of carbonate formation brings a challenge to create sufficient conductivity. In cases of high closure formation, fracture conductivity is hard to sustain. This factor limited the applications of acid fracturing sometimes. In this study, laboratory tests were carried out using low concentrations of ultralightweight proppant to obtain partial monolayer proppant. Because of low specific gravity property of this proppant, it was claimed to help improve proppant transport inside the fracture. In this experimental study, the partial monolayer technique was examined with particular emphasis upon the impact of acid in possibly improving fracture conductivity of carbonate rocks. The technique is referred as "closed fracture acidizing". After obtaining a partial monolayer distribution on the fracture face, gelled acid was injected through the fracture face. Fracture conductivity before and after acid injection were evaluated. Experimental results showed clearly that acid injection does not enhance fracture conductivity of partial monolayer proppant fracturing. The more the volume of acid injection, the more rapidly fracture conductivity declines...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings {{published}} in APPEA Journal 2013 A technology called graded proppant (<b>propping</b> <b>agent)</b> injection {{that consists of}} the injection of proppant particles, with increasing sizes and decreasing concentrations, into a naturally fractured reservoir results in deeper percolation of the particles into the natural fracture system, and thus expansion of the stimulated reservoir area. The placement of graded proppant particles keeps the fractures open, even after pressure decline due to production. There is, therefore, an enhancement in the well productivity. This proposed technology {{could be used to}} improve the productivity of CSG wells and other unconventional resources; for example, in shales, tight gas, and geothermal reservoirs. In this peer-reviewed paper, a mathematical model for well injectivity/productivity was developed for graded particle injection in a vertical well, lying at the centre of a circular drainage area. The model is based on an analytical solution of the quasi 1 D problem of coupled axisymmetric fluid flow and geomechanics. Explicit analytical equations were derived for stress, and pressure and permeability distributions, {{as well as for the}} well index during injection and production. Results of previous computational fluid dynamic studies were used to determine the hydraulic resistance resulting from proppant plugging in the fractured system. An optimal stimulation radius was identified, which resulted in the highest increment in the productivity index due to the application of graded proppant injection technology. The model was subsequently used for a sensitivity analysis using field data. The results showed that the productivity index increased more than four times by the application of this technology. A.

Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{treatments of}} shale gas reservoirs is pumping {{process in which}} {{millions of gallons of}} fracturing fluids mixed with proppant materials and thickening agents are pumped into the target shale formation. Fluids are used to create the fractures in the formation and to carry a <b>propping</b> <b>agent</b> which is deposited in the induced fractures to keep them from closing up. Type and percentage of chemical additives that used in a typical fracture treatment varies depending on the conditions of well being fractured. A series of chemical additives are selected to impart a predictable set of properties of the fluid, including viscosity, friction, formation-compatibility, and fluid-loss control. Each component in fracturing fluids serves a specific, engineered purpose and geological structure of rock. The properties of fracturing fluid are very important in the creation and propagation of the fracture. For successful stimulation fracturing fluid must to have certain chemical and physical properties. Study of the properties fracturing fluids has a huge role in the processes of shale gas extraction. In scientific literature indicates that hydraulic fracturing fluid performance became a prevalent research topic in the late 1980 s and the 1990 s.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} as {{a method}} for recovering unconventional shale gas {{has been around for}} several decades. Significant research and improvement in field methods have been documented in literature on the subject. The heterogeneous nature of shale has made hydraulic fracturing design to be unique for particular site conditions. Actual methods of carrying out fracturing operations and design decisions are also different for various companies in the industry. Hence, there are no standards for decisions in processes such as: formation testing, fracture modeling, choice of fracturing fluid or <b>propping</b> <b>agent</b> selection. This has led to different interpretations of pressure tests and proprietary fracture designs that have not been evaluated for adequacy against any recognized scale. The goal of this thesis is to do an appraisal of hydraulic fracturing in theory and practice. A review is done of the early theoretical work upon which most of the current hydraulic fracturing literature is based. Effort is also made to thoroughly cover the core aspects of fracture modeling and practical operations with a view to shedding light on the strength and drawbacks of current methodologies. The thesis focuses on the geo-mechanics of the process thus less emphasis is laid on post fracturing operations. It is hoped that this will help establish the basis for a standard framework to guide fracturing design.

40|$|Hydraulic {{stimulation}} {{techniques have}} been employed successfully {{over the past}} 60 years to enhance the productivity {{of oil and gas}} reservoirs. These techniques work by injecting a pressurised fluid into the wellbore to initiate and propagate an artificial fracture or to open a network of existing fractures. These techniques are also commonly known as hydraulic fracturing or fracking. The main objective of hydraulic stimulation is to create highly conductive pathways, which can significantly increase the permeability of the reservoir and, subsequently, improve the well productivity. An injection of small particles (usually known as <b>propping</b> <b>agents</b> or proppants) with the fracturing fluid is the most common method to prevent the stimulated fractures from full closure during the production stage because of confining stresses. To date, research has largely focused on the assessment of conditions and characteristics of fluid-driven fractures, as well as proppant transport and settlement mechanisms. The modern theory of hydraulic fractures is based on linear elastic fracture mechanics and theories of poro-elasticity, fluid flow in narrow openings and suspension flow in porous media. Despite numerous studies being carried out, few are devoted to the residual opening of hydraulic fractures, which has a significant effect on well productivity. There are many exciting potential applications and developments of hydraulic stimulation techniques for geothermal reservoirs and coal seam gas production. These all require new and more comprehensive theories, supported by analytical and numerical solutions capable of describing the non-linear effects of proppant placement and compressibility on the fracture residual opening profile and, ultimately, on the reservoir permeability and well performance. In order to address these needs and gaps, this thesis aims to develop: • a new mechanical model for predicting the mechanical response of saturated and unsaturated low-consolidated granular particles to compressive loading; • a new mathematical method and non-linear solutions for evaluating the residual aperture of fractures partially filled with unconsolidated compressible particles (proppant) and subjected to compressive loading; • a new mathematical model for evaluating the production rate of hydraulically stimulated wells taking into account the residual closure and various regions of distinct permeability along the fracture. These new models are all based on the classical theories of solid, fluid, contact, fracture, rock and soil mechanics, which provide a framework for evaluating the residual opening profiles (aperture) of hydraulically stimulated fractures, as well as the influence of the fracture residual aperture on the well performance. A number of simplifications are used to formulate the mathematical models and develop non-linear solutions. Many of these simplifications, such as two-dimensional problem geometry, plane strain conditions and linear elastic behaviour of the medium, represent a well-established foundation for analytical and numerical modelling in reservoir engineering. Accounting for other important phenomena, such as proppant flow-back and secondary cracking, {{is beyond the scope of}} this thesis but may be included in future work. The numerical results obtained within the developed models indicate that the residual openings and distribution of proppant along the fracture have a significant effect on well productivity (up to 50 per cent in the case of a relatively low level of confining stresses in the reservoir) and must be incorporated into the evaluation of the efficiency of hydraulic stimulation techniques and assessment of well productivity.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{the primary}} stimulation method within low permeability reservoirs, in particular shale reservoirs. Hydraulic fracturing provides a means for making shale reservoirs commercially viable by inducing and propping fracture networks allowing gas flow to the wellbore. Without a <b>propping</b> <b>agent,</b> the created fracture channels would close due to the in-situ stress and defeat the purpose of creating induced fractures. The fracture network conductivity {{is directly related to}} the well productivity; therefore, the oil and gas industry is currently trying to better understand what impacts fracture conductivity. Shale is a broad term for a fine-grained, detrital rock, composed of silts and clays, which often suggest laminar, fissile structure. This work investigates the difference between two vertical zones in the Fayetteville shale, the FL 2 and FL 3, by measuring laboratory fracture conductivity along an artificially induced, rough, aligned fracture. Unpropped and low concentration 30 / 70 mesh proppant experiments were run on samples from both zones. Parameters that were controllable, such as proppant size, concentration and type, were kept consistent between the two zones. In addition to comparing experimental fracture conductivity results, mineral composition, thin sections, and surface roughness scans were evaluated to distinguish differences between the two zones rock properties. To further identify differences between the two zones, 90 -day production data was analyzed. The FL 2 consistently recorded higher conductivity values than the FL 3 at closure stress up to 3, 000 psi. The mineral composition analysis of the FL 2 and FL 3 samples concluded that although the zones had similar clay content, the FL 2 contained more quartz and the FL 3 contained more carbonate. Additionally, the FL 2 samples were less fissile and had larger surface fragments created along the fracture surface; whereas the FL 3 samples had flaky, brittle surface fragments. The FL 2 had higher conductivity values at closure stresses up to 3, 000 psi due to the rearrangement of bulky surface fragments and larger void spaces created when fragments were removed from the fracture surface. The conductivity difference between the zones decreases by 25 % when low concentration, 0. 03 lb/ft^(2), 30 / 70 mesh proppant is placed evenly on the fracture surface. The conductivity difference decrease is less drastic, changing only 7 %, when increase the proppant concentration to 0. 1 lb/ft^(2) 30 / 70 mesh proppant. In conclusion, size and brittleness of surface fracture particles significantly impacts the unpropped and low concentration fracture conductivity...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{improved}} equipment and methodology {{can result in}} considerable reductions in the drilling costs for medium- to large sized {{ground source heat pump}} system in crystalline bedrock. The main point has been to use special techniques within hydraulic fracturing to create a larger heat exchange area in the bedrock, and thus a greater energy extraction per borehole. The energy extraction is based on circulating groundwater. Stimulation with hydraulic fracturing is a well known technique in order to improve borehole yields for drinking water-, oil-, and geothermal purposes. A procedure for injection of propping agents in selected borehole sections, and custom-made equipment for hydraulic fracturing in crystalline bedrock, a double packer, have been developed in this study. The propping agents are likely to ensure a permanent improvement of the hydraulic conductivity in a long-run perspective. In addition to a pre-test, a comprehensive test programme has been performed at each of the two pilot plants at Bryn and at the former property of Energiselskapet Asker og Bærum (EAB) in Bærum municipality outside Oslo, Norway. A total of 125 stimulations with hydraulic fracturing using water-only and hydraulic fracturing with injection of sand have been performed in 9 boreholes. Test pumping and geophysical logging (temperature, electrical conductivity, gamma radiation, optical televiewer and flow measurements) have been carried out in order to document the effect of the hydraulic fracturing. The pilot plants at Bryn and EAB, where the ground source heat pump systems are based on circulating groundwater, have demonstrated the short-period energy extraction, limitations and opportunities of the concept for hydraulic fracturing and increased energy extraction in different geological and hydrogeological areas. The bedrock at Bryn and EAB is characterized as a low-metamorphic sandstone and a nodular limestone, respectively. At Bryn, the five boreholes were organised with a central borehole encircled by four satellite boreholes 13 metres away from the central borehole. The central borehole at EAB was flanked with two boreholes 16 and 20 metres away. In operation mode, groundwater was pumped from the satellite boreholes, heat exchanged, and re-injected into the groundwater magazine via the central borehole. Routine operation of the plants has not yet been initiated. The main findings from this study can be summarized as follows: •Hydraulic fracturing with water-only results in an overall increase in water yield for the hard rock borehole. •Hydraulic fracturing with injection of sand as <b>propping</b> <b>agent</b> also leads to an increased water yield. •The use of sand as <b>propping</b> <b>agent</b> seems to be more required in fractures with high counter pressure, in this study higher than approximately 40 bars, compared with fractures with lower counter pressure. The particle size of the sand should also be adjusted to the appearing counter pressure, and injection of coarser sand is recommended in fractures with lower counter pressures. •Comparing the results from the hydraulic fracturing performed at Bryn and EAB shows that the pressure levels, required to create new fractures, varied considerably. The maximum pressures present at Bryn were higher than the corresponding pressures at EAB. At Bryn 70 % (44 out of 63) of the pressure-time curves from the hydraulic fracturing with water-only were interpreted as initiation or reopening of fractures, while the number for EAB was 97 % (36 out of 37). The lower degree of fracturing at Bryn {{is likely to be a}} result of high rock stresses and high tensile strength of the bedrock, also confirmed by the results from the rock stress measurements performed at Bryn. Considering the bedrock at EAB, characterized as nodular limestone, the tensile strength is assumed to be less than the values for the low-metamorphic sandstone present at Bryn. •The infiltration rate in the central boreholes is a critical factor for the energy extraction and a successful operation of ground source heat pump systems based on circulating groundwater. Results from the short-period circulation tests accomplished at Bryn and EAB show that the infiltration rate in the central borehole at Bryn (approximately 2500 litres/hour) was too low to obtain a satisfactory operation of the plant, while the infiltration rate at EAB (14000 litres/hour) was sufficient to achieve profitability. Under the actual conditions, a reduction in the construction costs, i. e. the drilling costs, for a conventional ground source heat pump system with single U-collectors in vertical boreholes, of more than 50 % were achieved for the pilot plant at EAB when the energy extraction from water is more than 105 MWh. The large difference in the infiltration rate between Bryn and EAB was probably related to: (1) Large initial differences in the borehole yield prior to hydraulic fracturing ( 6300 litres/hour at EAB). Nodular limestone generally has high permeability, while compact sandstone rocks are expected to have low permeability. (2) Hydraulic fracturing was most successful at EAB. (3) The higher rock stress level present at Bryn compared to EAB will increase the tendency to tighten the opened fractures, even the fractures with injected sand •The FEFLOW-modelling of the pilot plant at Bryn and EAB emphasized the important relation between the available heat exchange area in the bedrock, the thermal conductivity of the bedrock, and the energy potential. •The increased borehole yields achieved by hydraulic fracturing in this study, and the improved, reliable and cost-effective hydraulic fracturing techniques in crystalline bedrock, will probably increase the interest for groundwater as a domestic water supply for small- to medium sized water works. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
