5|$|As deaf {{education}} and sign language research continued to evolve, {{so did the}} perception of ASL. With {{the publication of the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language, ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization {{and the development of a}} <b>prestige</b> dialect, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to <b>prestige</b> dialects of ASL. This difference in <b>prestige</b> has led BASL speakers to code switch to a <b>prestige</b> dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL.|$|E

5|$|Status (or in German Stand) {{which is}} based on non-economic qualities like honour, <b>prestige</b> and religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{enthusiasm for}} relics continued, and foundations' <b>prestige</b> was greatly {{increased}} by success in obtaining {{the remains of}} important saints. The period between the Benedictine Reform and the Norman Conquest saw the most lavish donations of land to monasteries of any period in medieval England, and the leading reformed foundations became immensely wealthy, retaining their status after the Conquest. Monasteries founded in the Anglo-Saxon period enjoyed greater prosperity and <b>prestige</b> than post-Conquest establishments.|$|E
5|$|After {{eighteen}} months in Europe, Kenyatta {{had run out}} of money. The Anti-Slavery Society advanced him funds to pay off his debts and return to Kenya. Although Kenyatta enjoyed life in London and feared arrest if he returned home, he arrived in Mombasa in September 1930. On his return, his <b>prestige</b> among the Kikuyu was high because of his time spent in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Although still young, Henry was {{increasingly}} gaining {{a reputation as}} an energetic and capable leader. His <b>prestige</b> and power increased further when he unexpectedly married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152; Eleanor was the attractive Duchess of Aquitaine and the recently divorced wife of Louis VII of France, and the marriage made Henry the future ruler of a huge swathe of territory across France.|$|E
5|$|Although {{used before}} his presidency, Roosevelt used {{military}} muscle several times throughout his two terms {{with a more}} subtle touch to complement his diplomatic policies and enforcing the Monroe Doctrine throughout multiple interventions in Latin America. This included the Great White Fleet, 16 battleships which peacefully circumnavigated the globe as an illustration of United States' rising yet neutral <b>prestige</b> under Roosevelt's direction.|$|E
5|$|Before Piešťany, {{the junior}} tournament {{had a small}} {{following}} in Canada. Only one Canadian reporter flew overseas to cover the 1987 tournament. That changed in 1988, as the major Canadian media outlets all sent reporters to Moscow. The tournament's <b>prestige</b> in Canada continued to grow. By the 2005 tournament, over 100 Canadian reporters covered the tournament in Grand Forks, North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Being a political, {{religious}} and cultural centre of unique <b>prestige</b> and influence, Winchester, through the conscious efforts of its monastic school to standardize language, must also have become a factor of prime importance {{in the evolution of}} the literary standard in use throughout England in the late Old English period.|$|E
5|$|By 1882, Castle {{contained}} some 79 undergraduates out of 205 at {{the university}} as a whole. Despite the university largely failing to gain recognition and <b>prestige,</b> {{a number of other}} colleges had opened {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century. Of these, Cosin's Hall failed to become financially viable and was absorbed into University College in 1864. Enrolment numbers continued to fluctuate.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople was {{the nerve}} {{centre of the}} Byzantine state. Had it fallen, the Empire's {{remaining}} provinces would have been unlikely to hold together, and would have become easy prey for the Arabs. At the same time, {{the failure of the}} Arab attack on Constantinople was a momentous event in itself. It marked the culmination of Mu'awiya's campaign of attrition, pursued steadily since 661. Immense resources were poured into the undertaking, including the creation of a huge fleet. Its failure had similarly important repercussions, and represented a major blow to the Caliph's <b>prestige.</b> Conversely, Byzantine <b>prestige</b> reached new heights, especially in the West: Constantine IV received envoys from the Avars and the Balkan Slavs, bearing gifts and congratulations and acknowledging Byzantine supremacy. The subsequent peace also gave a much-needed respite from constant raiding to Asia Minor, and allowed the Byzantine state to recover its balance and consolidate itself following the cataclysmic changes of the previous decades.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{itself has}} also been {{undergoing}} significant transformations in recent years with the encouragement of various projects along the waterfront. Based on initial planning work in the 1980s, the area has already seen the appearance of several <b>prestige</b> buildings including the Black Diamond national library extension (1999), the Opera House (2000) and the Royal Danish Playhouse (2004).|$|E
5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the Ark {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the ark, since it violates numerous building codes in <b>Prestige</b> Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the ark within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already {{told him about the}} original form of <b>Prestige</b> Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the ark, and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. <b>Prestige</b> Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The ark reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E
5|$|Feeling that a {{complete}} {{destruction of the}} GUNT would be an intolerable blow for his <b>prestige,</b> and fearing that Habré would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure a definitive victory without Libyan armor and airpower.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{referred}} to the Marshall Plan as an important application of moral law to public policy. He said that the plan’s true purpose was to fend off Communism through the economic restoration of Europe—not to provide relief to Europe (something beyond {{the powers of the}} U.S.), nor to enhance gratitude towards the U.S., its <b>prestige</b> or power.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have <b>prestige,</b> it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the <b>prestige</b> of the former.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel very}} {{strongly}} that it will be impossible to find a solution to the political problems of Europe and remove the present nightmare conditions unless something is done to improve the economic position... it is vital for the <b>prestige</b> and future wellbeing of the League that it should afford active leadership towards bringing about economic appeasement.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Bure {{sued the}} Russian {{newspaper}} the eXile for publishing an article stating he {{broke up with}} Kournikova because she had two vaginas. Although the newspapers' editorial staff claimed the story was a mere joke, the court ruled in favour of Bure {{in the amount of}} 500,000 rubles (US$17,770), and ordered a retraction to be printed. Two years later, on December 27, 2004, the Russian cosmetics chain Arbat <b>Prestige</b> published a story in their free promotional paper that Bure had bragged about Kournikova losing her virginity to him. Shortly thereafter, on January 31, 2005, Bure sued Arbat <b>Prestige</b> for 300million rubles (US$10.65million) in a court in Moscow. He also demanded the company print a retraction and apology in a future paper. The court ruled in favour of Bure in November 2005. However, the amount was reduced from 300million to approximately 320,000 rubles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the secular politics that impacted them, papal elections during this period were marked by a strategy among elite families to acquire <b>prestige</b> and power. These strategies often played out over several generations through patronage and the accumulation of wealth, and bestowing favours on family members once an individual {{was elected to the}} papacy was expected.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 500 {{years of}} intense contact between {{speakers}} of Nahuatl and speakers of Spanish, {{combined with the}} minority status of Nahuatl and the higher <b>prestige</b> associated with Spanish has caused many changes in modern Nahuatl varieties, {{with large numbers of}} words borrowed from Spanish into Nahuatl, and the introduction of new syntactic constructions and grammatical categories.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Comhaltas {{movement}} however, Donegal fiddling stood strong with Paddy Glackin of Ceoltorí Laighean and the Bothy Band {{and later}} Tommy Peoples {{also with the}} Bothy Band and Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh with Altan, who all drew attention and <b>prestige</b> to the Donegal tradition within folk music circles throughout Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, {{attracting}} the social elite. The square gradually lost its <b>prestige</b> status after World War I as hotels {{started to move}} in, and by the mid-20th century, most of the houses had become hotels. During World War II air-raid shelters were built on the square, and an underground car park was built beneath it in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The British Empire had {{received}} the Christmas present the Prime Minister had wanted to give them, along with the moral <b>prestige</b> of effecting a Christian occupation of Jerusalem. It was a huge blow to the Ottoman Empire, which had suffered the loss of yet another Muslim Holy Place (having already lost Mecca and Baghdad).|$|E
5|$|The King's <b>prestige,</b> {{which was}} based {{in large part on}} his support by the {{combined}} Great Powers, but mostly the support of the British, suffered in the Pacifico incident of 1850, when British Foreign Secretary Palmerston sent the British fleet to blockade the port of Piraeus with warships, to exact reparation for injustice done to a British subject.|$|E
5|$|The Shogunate {{also was}} {{preparing}} for further conflict by modernizing its forces. In line with Parkes' designs, the British, previously the Shogunate's primary partner, proved reluctant to provide assistance. The Tokugawa thus came to rely mainly on French expertise, comforted by the military <b>prestige</b> of Napoleon III at that time, acquired through his successes in the Crimean War and the War of Italy.|$|E
5|$|The film {{score was}} written by English {{musician}} and composer David Julyan. Julyan had previously collaborated with director Christopher Nolan on Following, Memento and Insomnia. Following the film's narrative, the soundtrack had three sections: the Pledge, the Turn, and the <b>Prestige.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on October 20, 2006, receiving positive reviews and strong box office results, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Along with The Illusionist and Scoop, The <b>Prestige</b> {{was one of three}} films released in 2006 to explore the world of stage magicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{garrison}} constituted {{roughly a}} tenth of the total French Union manpower in Indochina. The defeat seriously weakened the position and <b>prestige</b> of the French as previously planned negotiations over the future of Indochina began.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} <b>prestige</b> of Wallachia increased considerably after Basarab's {{victory over}} King Charles I. Only {{a few months}} after his great victory, in February 1331, Basarab contributed to the establishment of his son-in-law, Ivan Alexander (1331–1371) on the throne of the tzars of Bulgaria in Tirnovo.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers and}} <b>prestige</b> {{of the prime}} {{minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often lamented that in practice he had little power. Since the death of Pham Hung in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked 3rd in the order of precedence of the Communist Party's Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The square was a prestigious, high-class development, {{attracting}} the social elite. The square gradually lost its <b>prestige</b> status after the First World War as hotels {{started to move}} in. The square's central garden, originally private, has been council-owned since 1884 and is publicly accessible, and an underground car park was built beneath it in 1969.|$|E
5|$|When Gümüshtekin, {{governor}} of Aleppo, {{one of the}} last independent Muslim rulers in Syria after Saladin, had conquered almost all neighboring states, he released Raynald, along with Joscelin of Courtenay and all other Christians prisoners in 1176. Raynald's ransom, fixed at 120,000 gold dinars, reflected his <b>prestige.</b> It was most probably paid by ManuelI Komnenos, according to Barber and Bernard Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Without career {{prospects}} {{outside of}} sport, Wills joined the MCC {{as a professional}} {{at the start of}} the 1867–68 season; however, he was not openly referred to as such. Instead, the club devised the title of 'tutor' in order that he maintain the <b>prestige</b> of his amateur background.|$|E
