40|$|Introduction: Self-drilling mini-implants are {{commonly}} used in orthodontics, {{but there is little}} information regarding their fracture resistance in areas of high density bone without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Purpose: To determine the peak fracture torques of six commonly used self-drilling mini-implants, and to examine how each performs in extreme conditions without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Materials and Methods: Fifteen mini-implants from six different manufacturers were drilled into acrylic blocks using a custom-made insertion device incorporating a 6 -DOF load cell for torque measurements. Peak fracture torques were recorded and compared for each of the six manufacturers. Additionally, ten mini-implants from each manufacturer were inserted into high density mandibular bone substitutes (Sawbones®) without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Measures of peak insertion torque for each manufacturer were recorded. Groups that experienced fracture upon insertion into the bone substitutes underwent further testing specifically following their manufacturer <b>pre-drilling</b> recommendations. Results: Resistance to fracture varied significantly among implants from different manufacturers. Tomas-pin and Aarhus experienced fractures during insertion into the non-pre-drilled bone substitutes. When manufacturer’s <b>pre-drilling</b> recommendations were followed, Aarhus continued to experience fractures during insertion. Conclusions: Unitek, Vector TAS, Dual Top, and Ortho Easy can be inserted into areas of thick and dense cortical bone without <b>pre-drilling.</b> Tomas-Pin can be inserted provided manufacturer <b>pre-drilling</b> recommendations are followed.

50|$|Gulf Keystone's initial {{operations}} in Algeria were rather less successful {{than had been}} hoped, and the share price weakened as a consequence. RAK Petroleum PCL announced an agreement in April 2007 to acquire Gulf Keystone Petroleum, but the transaction was not completed.

40|$|The {{requirements}} of production engineering for a precision hole are {{to ensure the}} required quality as well as minimal production costs. The interactions between machine, tool and the <b>pre-drilled</b> hole result in uncertainties during the final reaming process. For this purpose the reaming process itself {{and the appearance of}} process faults were focused in a large number of publications. Due {{to the fact that the}} reaming process is an inherent part of a process chain and thus directly linked to a pre-machining process (drilling process), the influence of a <b>pre-drilled</b> hole is neglected till date. For that reason the present paper deals with the influence of a diagonal <b>pre-drilled</b> hole on the reaming process with multi blade tools. Pretests show that the radial deviation of the <b>pre-drilled</b> hole seems to be an important input parameter for the reaming process within the process chain.

30|$|<b>Pre-drill</b> {{prediction}} of formation pore pressure from surface seismic survey {{is very important}} for drilling, production, and reservoir engineering because it affects drilling operations and well-planning processes. If it is not properly evaluated, it can lead to numerous drilling problems such as dangerous well kicks, lost circulation, blowouts, stuck pipe, excessive costs, and borehole instability. <b>Pre-drill</b> pore pressure estimation has been obtained from transform models using seismic interval velocities. However, the accuracy of this estimate of pore pressure {{is directly related to the}} reliability of these interval velocities. Bulk density was estimated from seismic interval velocity and transit time. Normal pore pressure gradient is estimated from the slope of a trendline that is generated from logarithm transit times versus depth. Overburden pressure at any depth was calculated from the integration of the average interval bulk densities and thicknesses above that depth. Pore pressure has been obtained from overburden pressure and observed interval velocities using modified Eaton’s equation. 154 CDPs were used along 28 seismic lines at Beni Suef basin, Western Desert, Egypt, to accomplish the purpose of this study. Two velocity reversal zones showing abnormally high pore pressure were detected and correlated to Abu Roash and Bahariya Formations. Moreover, pore pressure gradient maps were established for these two zones to predict the possible horizontal fluid flow (migration paths) for the proposal of prospects with lower pressures and less drilling risks. Finally, it is possible to calculate and recommend the required heavier mud weight to drill.|$|E
40|$|The recent boom in {{shale gas}} {{development}} in the Marcellus Shale has increased interest in the methods to distinguish between naturally occurring methane in groundwater and stray methane associated with drilling and production operations. This study evaluates the relationship between natural methane occurrence and three principal environmental factors (groundwater redox state, water type, and topography) using two <b>pre-drill</b> datasets of 132 samples from western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia and 1417 samples from northeastern Pennsylvania. Higher natural methane concentrations in residential wells are strongly associated with reducing conditions characterized by low nitrate and low sulfate ([NO 3 −][*]<[*] 0. 5 [*]mg/L; [SO 42 −] [*]<[*] 2. 5 [*]mg/L). However, no significant relationship exists between methane and iron [Fe(II) ], which is traditionally considered an indicator of conditions that have progressed through iron reduction. As shown in previous studies, water type is significantly correlated with natural methane concentrations, where sodium (Na) -rich waters exhibit significantly higher (p< 0. 001) natural methane concentrations than calcium (Ca) -rich waters. For water wells exhibiting Na-rich waters and/or low nitrate and low sulfate conditions, valley locations are associated with higher methane concentrations than upland topography. Consequently, we identify three factors (“Low NO 3 − & SO 42 −” redox condition, Na-rich water type, and valley location), which, in combination, offer strong predictive power regarding the natural occurrence of high methane concentrations. Samples exhibiting these three factors have a median methane concentration of 10, 000 [*]µg/L. These heuristic relationships may facilitate the design of <b>pre-drill</b> monitoring programs and the subsequent evaluation of post-drill monitoring results to help distinguish between naturally occurring methane and methane originating from anthropogenic sources or migration pathways...|$|E

40|$|<b>Pre-drill</b> pore {{pressure}} and fracture gradient predictions {{are important for}} successful drilling and well construction. There are numerous different methods for calculating the {{pore pressure}} in shales without direct measurements in the wellbore. All of the methods are based on interpretation of geophysical data, such as acoustic velocity and/or formation resistivity, which {{are sensitive to the}} effective stresses in the formation. Standard methods (like Bower’s or Eaton’s) utilize overburden effective stress for pore pressure prediction. Those methods are developed for regions with normal faulting stress regimes, where the direction of maximum compression is vertical and magnitude is equal to the weight of overburden. Due to the fluid-like behavior of salt on a geologic time scale, in situ stresses around salt structures may deviate significantly from regional tectonic directions, which in turn may significantly affect wellbore stability. The main goal {{of this study is to}} quantify the difference in pore pressure and overburden stress predictions in a salt-related basin calculated with different methods, such as: a standard density integration and finite element modeling (FEM) using Plaxis software. The input geometry for geomechanical modeling was based on EDGE 2004 synthetic velocity model. The input geomechanical parameters were calculated from seismic interval velocity using empirical correlations developed for Gulf of Mexico. In this study, it is demonstrated that a standard overburden calculation methods (based on density integration) can lead to errors in pore pressure prediction with magnitude up to 30 MPa; while 2 D FEM is able to capture stress perturbation around salt structures. In majority of cases <b>pre-drill</b> developing of 3 D FEM geomechanical model may not be feasible, because it is time consuming; while 2 D geomechanical model is relatively quick and may significantly affect drilling decision to reduce the risk of well-bore instabilities caused by influx of formation fluids, losses of drilling fluid into formation, wellbore breakouts, tight hole intervals...|$|E
