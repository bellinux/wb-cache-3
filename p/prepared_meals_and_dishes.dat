5000|$|The course {{description}} of NELP states that, [...] "Diverse kinds of learning are all valuable and pleasurable," [...] suggesting that intellectual and physical challenges are often parallel with each kind of learning reinforcing the others.

Work responsibilities rotate among the groups, which <b>prepare</b> <b>meals,</b> wash <b>dishes,</b> <b>and</b> clean common areas. NELP {{begins with a}} work day during which equipment is unpacked and camp set up, and it ends with another work day. The students and staff live together during the duration of NELP.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is going}} about here," [...] wrote Goethe in 1780, while Diderot was still alive, [...] "a {{manuscript}} of Diderot's called Jacques le Fataliste et son Maître, {{and it is}} really first-rate--a very fine <b>and</b> exquisite <b>meal,</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>and</b> <b>dished</b> up with great skill, {{as if for the}} palate of some singular idol. I set myself in the place of this Bel, and in six uninterrupted hours swallowed all the courses in the order, and according to the intentions, of this excellent cook and maître d'hôtel."[16] He {{goes on to say that}} when other people came to read it, some preferred one story, and some another. On the whole, one is strongly inclined to judge that few modern readers will equal Goethe's unsparing appetite. The reader sighs in thinking of the brilliant and unflagging wit, the verve, the wicked graces of Candide, and we long for the ease and simplicity and light stroke of the Sentimental Journey. Diderot has the German heaviness. Perhaps this is because he had too much conscience, and laboured too deeply under the burdensome problems of the world. He could not emancipate himself sufficiently from the tumult of his own sympathies. At many a page both of Jacques le Fataliste, and of others of his pieces, we involuntarily recall the writer's own contention that excess of sensibility makes a mediocre actor. The same law is emphatically true of the artist. Diderot never writes as if his spirit were quite free--and perhaps it never was free. If we are to enjoy these reckless outbursts of all that is bizarre and grotesque, these defiances of all that is sane, coherent, and rational, we must never feel conscious of a limitation, or a possibility of stint or check. The draught must seem to come from an exhaustless fountain of boisterous laughter, irony, and caprice. Perfect fooling is so rare an art, that not half a dozen men in literature have really possessed it; perhaps only Aristophanes, Rabelais, Shakespeare. Candide, wonderful as it is, has many a stroke of malice, and Tristram Shandy, wonderful as that is too, is not without tinges of self-consciousness; and neither malice nor self-consciousness belongs to the greater gods of buffoonery. Cervantes and Molière, those great geniuses of finest temper, still have none of the reckless buffoonery of such scenes as that between Prince Henry and the drawer, or the mad extravagances of the Merry Wives; still less of the wild topsy-turvy of the Birds or the Peace. They have not the note of true Pantagruelism. Most critics, again, would find in Swift a truculence, sometimes latent and sometimes flagrant, that would deprive him, too, of his place among these great masters of free and exuberant farce. Diderot, at any rate, must rank in the second class among those who have attempted to tread a measure among the whimsical zigzags of unreason. The sincere sentimentalist makes a poor reveller.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{estimate}} an integrated discrete choice model system of product choice and nutrition information for <b>prepared</b> frozen <b>meals</b> <b>and</b> salted snacks in the United States {{in the period}} from 1995 to 1999. The model links consumer observed and latent characteristics (e. g., income, knowledge about nutrition, nutrition label use) to product characteristics (e. g., prices, nutritional attributes) and allows us to obtain consumer preference parameters and demand elasticities with regard to product characteristics. We find that prices, advertising, price reductions, and consumer preferences for taste {{have a significant effect}} on the demand for <b>prepared</b> frozen <b>meals</b> <b>and</b> salted snacks, whereas nutrition information and nutrition label use do not. Using the estimated demand parameters we then evaluate the impact of the new mandatory labeling policy.
