40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{three major}} hypotheses important to new product market {{success in the}} heavy construction equipment industry which are as follows: the greater the degree of organisational integration during the <b>development</b> of new <b>products,</b> the greater will be the market success of new products; the greater the degree of organisational integration during the <b>development</b> of new <b>products,</b> the greater will be the proficiency with which new <b>product</b> <b>development</b> activities are performed; and the greater the proficiency with which new <b>product</b> <b>development</b> activities are performed, the greater {{will be the new}} product's success in the marketplace. Information was obtained concerning the most and least successful new products of U. S. firms in the heavy construction equipment industry. "Organisational integration" is defined as the degree of cooperation and communication between internal and external new <b>product</b> <b>development</b> (NPD) "support" groups and NPD teams. "NPD process proficiency" is defined as how well new <b>product</b> <b>development</b> stages and the NPD process as a whole are performed. "New product market success" is represented by four measures that encompass profit expectations, sales expectations, success entering new markets and entering existing markets with new products successfully. The survey approach was utilised to obtain data. Questionnaires were mailed to recipients such as New <b>Product</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Managers</b> who had already been designated by executives of the sample firms. A number of important findings were uncovered during this research. The integration between an organisation's customers and an NPD team is important to the success of newly developed heavy construction equipment products. However, the integration between organisations that supply material, components, assemblies and fabrications to new heavy construction equipment developers was found to hinder the market success of newly developed heavy construction equipment. These and other findings suggest several important implications for <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>managers</b> and scholars.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain <b>product</b> <b>development</b> {{performance}} through the link between knowledge management and knowledge integration. When <b>product</b> <b>development</b> teams integrate knowledge about two external entities-customers and suppliers, they acquire a better understanding of the market and of each other’s needs and capabilities, which enables them to operate and innovate better than their competitors. In this context, our theoretical framework focuses on the social enablers usually associated to knowledge management, and combine them with knowledge integration as to determine <b>product</b> <b>development</b> performance. This performance is measured through two distinct components, or types of outcomes: (1) process outcomes, which analyze the effectiveness of the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> process and it is measured in terms of teamwork- and (2) product outcomes, which concerns the characteristics associated with the value of the product to customer.

40|$|This chapter has two key themes: (1) {{a list of}} {{customer}} needs is interesting, but insufficient for many development decisions, (2) establishing a quantified, dollar value for each requirement is more helpful. To that end, we present an approach and method to establishing the quantitative monetary value for new product features and performance. This approach is targeted to <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>managers</b> and engineers engaged at the “front-end” of the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> process when the decisions about selection and trade-off of product functions and features are made. This approach examines the customer’s business operations and essentially establishing their business case for your product down to the feature and performance levels. This provides for much better trade-off decisions in new <b>product</b> <b>development.</b> This approach also helps to identify whitespace opportunities, those new product and/or service opportunities that are not being served by any current product. Moreover, because the methodology is fine grained, the whitespace opportunities are resolved into clear and actionable <b>product</b> <b>development</b> projects.
