The difference in reduction <b>in</b> helium and <b>argon</b> was reflected by different diffusion coefficients of gaseous reactants and products, which {{are much higher}} in helium than <b>in</b> <b>argon.</b> When carbothermal reduction took place in hydrogen, it {{was involved in the}} reduction process by reducing oxides to suboxides and forming methane. Manganese and titanium oxides were reduced to carbide Mn 7 C 3 and oxycarbide Ti(OxC 1 -x) correspondingly, while products of alumina reduction included carbide Al 4 C 3 and vapours of Al and Al 2 O, which were re-oxidised to Al 4 O 4 C outside the reactor and deposited in the lower temperature zone.

Compound ceramic {{coatings}} {{with the}} main crystal phase of Al 2 TiO 5 (as-coated samples) were prepared in situ {{on the surface of}} Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy by means of pulsed bi-polar micro-arc oxidation (MAO) in an NaAlO 2 solution. The coated samples were calcined <b>in</b> <b>argon</b> and air at 1000 o C, respectively. The phase composition, surface and section morphology, and element contents of the ceramic coatings were investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). The samples were treated <b>in</b> <b>argon</b> and the as-coated ones were calcined in air at 1000 o C to study the anti-oxidation properties of the samples. The results show that Al 2 TiO 5 had been decomposed in an hour and transformed into α-Al 2 O 3 and rutile TiO 2 in air. However, Al 2 TiO 5 had been decomposed in four hours <b>in</b> <b>argon</b> and the final coating surface was completely composed of α-Al 2 O 3. The content of Al 2 O 3 was decreased from outside to inside layers and Ti 2 O 3 was formed in the coating. Furthermore, the morphology of the ceramic coatings after the calcination was different. The coatings calcined <b>in</b> <b>argon</b> were finer; the grains and pores were smaller than those in air.
