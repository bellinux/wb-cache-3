Willd., under rainfed conditions, on clay soils. The experimental design was 4 x 4 split-plot factorial with three replications; four regeneration methods were tested in the main plots, namely i) regeneration with nursery stock seedlings, ii) regeneration with <b>pit</b> <b>sowing,</b> iii) regeneration with line sowing, and iv) regeneration with broadcasting. The subplots contained the four weeding treatments, i. e., i) four complete weedings, ii) three complete weedings, iii) four line weedings, and iv) three line weedings. The main growth parameters measured were shoot height (cm), diameter at shoot base (cm) and survival percentage. Significant differences were obtained for shoot height, shoot base diameter and survival percentage for the different treatments. In the final assessment, nursery stock seedlings and line sowing gave the greatest survival percentages (78. 8 and 77. 1 %, respectively), while broadcasting gave medium survival percentage (67. 0 %). <b>Pit</b> <b>sowing</b> gave the least survival percentage (37. 5 %). It is recommended that line sowing with three weedings be adopted for establishment of Acacia senegal in large -scale plantations on clay soils. Khartoum University Pres...|$|E
50|$|If at {{any time}} during <b>sowing,</b> a <b>pit</b> has exactly four seeds, all four are {{immediately}} captured and removed from play. There can be many such captures during sowing. Also, if the last <b>pit</b> <b>sown</b> into then has four seeds, these four seeds are captured and the sowing process ends.|$|R
50|$|The Prophecy of Berchán tells that Mac Alpin plunged {{them in the}} <b>pitted</b> earth, <b>sown</b> {{with deadly}} blades. Trapped and unable to defend themselves, the {{surviving}} Picts were then murdered from above and their bodies, clothes and ornaments plundered.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the initial}} race, players will take turns. At his turn, the player takes all the seeds {{from one of}} his <b>pits</b> and <b>sows</b> them counterclockwise. Depending on where the last seed of the sowing is dropped, the {{following}} rules may apply: ...|$|R
50|$|At her turn, {{the player}} takes all the seeds {{in one of}} her <b>pits</b> and <b>sows</b> them. The first player to play may choose whether sowing occurs {{clockwise}} or counterclockwise; after that, all sowing will be done accordingly throughout the game. Sowing is called ihinawa.|$|R
5000|$|... if {{the last}} seed is dropped in a {{non-empty}} <b>pit,</b> the <b>sowing</b> will generally {{go on in}} a relay-sowing style, with some exceptions related to the [...] "bulls" [...] (see below). If the initial sowing causes a relay sowing, the player {{will not be able}} to capture (see below) for the remainder of the turn.|$|R
50|$|Magdalenengrund was {{originally}} known as Im Saugraben an der Wien auf der Gstätten ("In the <b>sow</b> <b>pit</b> on the Wien on the meadow") and consisted only of vineyards. In 1698, some plots were released for construction.|$|R
5000|$|Each player [...] "owns" [...] the six pits {{closest to}} himself. The player whose turn {{it is to}} play chooses any one of his pits which {{contains}} at least one bean. He removes all the beans from this <b>pit</b> and <b>sows</b> them counterclockwise. Sowing is accomplished by selecting a pit, removing all the pieces from that pit, and dropping them one-by-one in each subsequent pit (leaving out the stores), until all have been used.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOwari {{is an old}} African {{game that}} {{consists}} of cyclically ordered pits that are filled with pebbles. In a sowing move all the pebbles are taken out of one pit and distributed one by one in subsequent <b>pits.</b> Repeated <b>sowing</b> will give rise to recurrent states of the owari. Bouchet studied such periodical states in an idealised setup, where there are infinitely many pits. We characterise periodical states in owaris with finitely many pits. Our result implies Bouchet's result...|$|R
5000|$|At {{his or her}} turn, {{the player}} takes all the seeds from a <b>pit</b> and <b>sows</b> them counterclockwise. If the last seed of a sowing falls in a {{non-empty}} pit {{that is not a}} Uur (see below), relay-sowing applies. Thus, the player's turn ends when the last seed in a sowing is dropped in an empty pit or in a Uur pit. Depending on the pit where this last seed was dropped, the following situations may occur: ...|$|R
50|$|If {{the last}} seed sown lands {{in one of}} the player's eight inner pits, which is occupied, and {{furthermore}} both the opponent's pits in this same column are occupied, then all seeds from these two pits are captured and sown starting from the player's next <b>pit</b> in the <b>sowing.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the last}} bean {{ends up in}} a <b>pit</b> which, after <b>sowing,</b> {{contains}} exactly two, four, or six beans (but no other number), all beans in this pit are captured. If any capture is made, the preceding pit is checked (and its beans possibly captured) according to the same rule, and so forth.|$|R
50|$|If {{the last}} piece ends up in a <b>pit</b> which, after <b>sowing,</b> {{contains}} exactly two or four pieces, all pieces in this pit are captured {{with those in the}} hole opposite. Also, if there is a continuous line of pits with either 2 or 4 pieces before the one where the capture has occurred, all the pieces in those and their opposite pits are captured as well.|$|R
40|$|Lameness {{has been}} {{incorrectly}} labeled as a “cow {{and not a}} sow” concern, and this has possibly arisen due {{to the majority of}} sows being far more stationary over their productive lifetime compared to dairy cows. Therefore, the objectives of this study were record hoof lesion frequency, proportion, type and severity from sows housed in gestation stalls during a one month period. A total of 30 sows were used (Yorkshire [n = 3], Duroc [n = 14] and Yorkshire x Duroc crosses [n = 13]). All sows were individually housed in stalls that had concrete flooring and manure fell into a holding <b>pit.</b> <b>Sows</b> were feed at 0600 h once a day a commercially available ground feed. Caretakers observed all sows twice daily, at 0600 h and 1600 h. Hoof lesion and severity was scored (medial and lateral toes, dew claws and the sole) and recorded once a week by a single observer using the FeetFirst lesion scoring guide produced by the FeetFirst™ Team. Lesion severity was scored as, one (mild), two (moderate) and three (severe) which occurred on any anatomical area of the hoof (toes, dew claw, heel and sole). Lesion severity scores was reported numerically (actual number of hooves involved) and presented as a proportion {{of the total number of}} hooves in the study. Lesion type was defined as toe growth, dew claw, heel overgrowth and erosion, heel sole crack, white line, cracked wall horizontal and cracked wall vertical (FeetFirst™ Team, 2009). Lesion type was reported numerically (actual number of hooves) and presented as a frequency and proportion of the total number of hooves in the study. On average, 50. 8...|$|R
5000|$|When a capture occurs, {{the player}} takes all the seed from the {{captured}} opponent's <b>pit,</b> and relay <b>sows</b> {{them in his}} or her rows. The first seed must be sown in a kichwa; if it is sown in the right kichwa, sowing will proceed counterclockwise, while if it is sown in the left kichwa, sowing will be clockwise. For this reason, the right kichwa is also called [...] "counterclockwise kichwa" [...] and the left one [...] "clockwise kichwa".|$|R
