40|$|Currently, 64 % of {{transient}} ischemic attack (TIA) patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) {{are admitted}} to the hospital in United States. 1 The issue of hospitalization for TIA is a matter of controversy. In the new 2010 guidance, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare notified hospitals that TIA admission was 1 of the 17 diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), which was at high risk of claims denial because the services were not medically necessary for the setting billed. This action was a result of a Recovery Audit Contractor report that determined the submitted documentation did not support an inpatient level of care, and the provided services could have been performed in a less intensive setting. 2 The improper <b>payment</b> <b>claims</b> for TIA admissions were estimated at $ 6 979 129 by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare. A better understanding and characterization of hospitalization for TIA patients is essential for cost-effective management of such admissions. The length of hospitalization in patients with TIA is an important surrogate marker of effectiveness of medical interventions and a critical determinant of cost of hospitalization. 3 Outside the setting of specialized clinics with patient referral and intervention biases, hospitalization for TIA and variation in length of hospitalization demonstrate considerable heterogeneity.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} number of efforts to install wide area health care networks. Some of these networks are being built to support several applications over a wide user base consisting primarily of medical practices, hospitals, pharmacies, medical laboratories, payors, and suppliers. Although on-line, multi-media telecommunication is desirable for some purposes such as cardiac monitoring, store-and-forward messaging is adequate for many common, high-volume applications. Laboratory test results and <b>payment</b> <b>claims,</b> for example, can be distributed using electronic messaging networks. Several network prototypes have been constructed to determine the technical problems and to assess the effectiveness of electronic messaging in wide area health care networks. Our project, Health Link, developed prototype software that was able to use the public switched telephone network to exchange messages automatically, reliably and securely. The network could be configured to accommodate the many different traffic patterns and cost constraints of its users. Discrete event simulations were performed on several network models. Canonical star and mesh networks, that were composed of nodes operating at steady state under equal loads, were modeled. Both topologies were found to support the throughput of a generic wide area health care network. The mean message delivery time of the mesh network was found to be less than that of the star network. Further simulations were conducted for a realistic large-scale health care network consisting of 1, 553 doctors, 26 hospitals, four medical labs, one provincial lab and one insurer. Two network topologies were investigated: one using predominantly peer-to-peer communication, the other using client-server communication. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Some {{developed}} countries have drawn lip construction-specific statutory security of payment acts/legislations typically known as Construction Contracts Act to eliminate poor payment practices and to assist continuous uninterrupted construction works. Malaysia too cannot {{pretend not to}} have these problems. This paper presents findings of a study conducted amongst Malaysian contractors with the aims to determine the seriousness of late and non- payment problems; to identify the main causes and effects of late and non-payment; and to identify ways to sustain the payment flows in the Malaysian construction industry. The study focused on contractual payments from the paymaster (government or private) to the contractors. The main factors for late and nonpayment {{in the construction industry}} identified from the study include: delay in certification, paymaster's poor financial management, local culture/attitude, pay master's failure to implement good governance in business, underpayment of certified amounts by the pay master and the use of 'pay when paid' clauses in contracts. The research findings show that late and non-payment can create cash flow problems, stress and financial hardship on the contractors. Amongst the most appropriate solutions to overcome the problem of late and non-payment faced by local contractors include: a right to regular periodic payment, a right to a defined time frame (or payment and a right to a speedy dispute resolution mechanism. Promptness of submitting, processing, issuing interim payment certificates and honouring the certificates are extremely important issues in relation to progress <b>payment</b> <b>claims.</b> Perhaps, an increased sense of professionalism in construction industry could overcome some of the problems related to late and non- payment issues...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, {{statutory}} construction adjudication is a fast payment {{dispute resolution}} process {{designed to keep}} the cash flowing down the hierarchical contractual chain in construction projects. Its rapid, highly regulatory and temporarily binding nature have led to it being often described as a ‘quick and dirty’ process that delivers ‘rough and ready’ justice. Adjudicators often have to grapple with complex legal issues related to jurisdictional facts and interpretation of contract provisions, though {{the majority of them}} are not legally trained. This has often led to a poor quality of adjudication outcome for large and complex <b>payment</b> <b>claims</b> which has, in turn, led to a mounting dissatisfaction due to the many judicial challenges to adjudicators’ determinations seen in recent years. The evolving tension between the object of the security of payment legislation and excessive involvement of the courts has often been the subject of comment by the judiciary. This paper aims to examine the legislative and judicial approaches to support the object of the security of payment legislation to ease cash flow. The paper adopts a desktop study approach whereby evidence is gathered from three primary sources – judicial decisions, academic publications and governmental reports. The paper concludes {{that there is a need}} to adopt other measures which can provide more convenient relief to aggrieved parties to an adjudication process, such that the adjudication process is kept away from the courts as far as is possible. Specifically, it is proposed that a well-designed expanded legislative review scheme of allegedly flawed adjudication, based on that provided in the Western Australian legislation, might stand as a promising remedy to eliminate the evolving tension...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} twelve years, {{building}} and construction industry security of payment legislation has progressively come into force in all the Australian States and Territories. A primary objective of the legislation {{is to ensure that}} parties in the industry receive timely and fair payment for construction work carried out and/or related goods and services supplied. In order to achieve this objective, the legislation has focused on removing unfair contractual payment provisions, establishing a default right to progress payments in the absence of such contractual provision, and providing a swift, interim method of dispute resolution for <b>payment</b> <b>claims</b> {{in the form of an}} adjudication scheme. As such, a party who claims it is owed money under a construction contract can refer its payment claim to an independent adjudicator for a rapid determination of the amount (if any) due. Such a determination has binding effect, pending any eventual outcome from a more formal dispute resolution process such as litigation or arbitration. There is a lack of uniformity between the various Australian Acts. Many commentators distinguish two broad Australian legislative models, with key differences as to the scope of disputes covered, and the payment provisions and adjudication schemes prescribed. These inconsistencies have resulted in extra costs to the construction industry due to the unfamiliarity, uncertainty and confusion with security of payment laws and procedures in the various jurisdictions. Furthermore, the cost to the public purse of administering the legislation is exacerbated by the need to educate stakeholders about eight different regimes. The time is ripe for action to be taken to harmonise the legislation. Accordingly, this thesis proposes a legislative approach which is appropriate for adoption on a nationally uniform basis. The proposed approach is informed by a review, on the available evidence, of the performance of the Australian schemes, and an evaluation of the schemes by reference to a set of criteria drawn from the dispute resolution literature.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{acknowledged that the}} nature of construction projects is largely fragmented as it is invariably carried out by diverse parties having different aims and objectives. Such a lack of integration typifies the nature of construction industry and arguably makes it prone to project disputes. This paper presents a research study that investigated the key factors that contributed to actual disputes occurred in past construct projects in Australia. The research provides a review of underpinning background knowledge on construction project disputes, as well as their origins. In particular, the research focuses on five main types of disputes: breach, failure to settle and appeal, interpretation, insurance and indemnity and security of payments. Based on this theoretical framework, a qualitative analysis was conducted on 78 court cases data obtained from the LexisNexis database to determine key factors contributing to construction project disputes. The results of this investigation determined that the main factors contributing to disputes were damages, negligence, timing, payments and variations. The 'payments' factor was the highest contribution factor (more than 50 %) across all the analysed dispute types. This suggested that most of the disputes originated from a payment disagreement. Additionally, "breach" was found to be the most frequent type of dispute occurred, with 'damages' as the main contributing factor within this type of dispute. The main implication derived from the research findings is that the identified factors contributing to disputes have some element to them that can be specified in the contract and potentially help prevent a dispute, for instance: the amount of general damages that an alleged party can claim; the specification of materials to avoid defective work and thus negligence; the procedure to follow when an extension of time is required; a description of progress and <b>payment</b> <b>claims</b> following its respective legislation; and an appropriate agreement when a contract variation is needed. If these issues are carefully described and understood in the contract, potential disputes can be avoided. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposals}} for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy within the Mid Term Review of the European Commission fueled {{the discussion about}} the future of direct payments to farmers. The EU Commission recommends a decoupling of animal and area payments from the production by granting these direct payments as a payment claim per hectare of eligible farm land. However, introducing area tied payments the intended shift of payments â€œfrom the produce to the producerâ€ will not take place, but instead an increased transfer of payments to land owners seems likely. This study therefore analyses the impacts of changing the area payments for grand cultures into person-tied payments on the cereals market of the European Union. For the assessment of impacts homogenous natural locations are clustered. The clustering is based on the regional reference yields for cereals and the share of arable land of total agricultural area in different farm types of the regions. For these production locations total production costs for cereals, oilseeds, and protein crops are calculated {{as a function of the}} farm size in order to estimate a cost reduction potential subject to structural changes within agriculture. The main results are the following: 1) Prerequisites are good for the EU to cultivate cereals since a major part of the production is located in highly competitive regions. Thus the EU would remain a net exporter of cereals even producing under world market conditions. However, maintaining the intervention price system while abolishing the set-aside obligation could lead to an uncontrolled increase of cereal stocks. 2) Even on highly competitive locations a significant structural change is required in order to reduce costs and to yield profits without area payments. Depending on the development of the world market prices for cereals the model calculations find a reduction of the work force between 20 000 and 50 000 labor units. 3) Without area payments the profits per hectare and thus the rents would decrease notably and therefore result in a corresponding income loss for land owners. An exclusive granting of <b>payment</b> <b>claims</b> to the producers would in particular affect former farmers, whose rental incomes contribute substantially to their pension plans.

40|$|Concerning {{the long}} {{duration}} {{and intensity of}} the last German recession, connected with high risks to get unemployed and stepped up by higher social risk because of new labour market reforms, {{it is not surprising}} to find behavioural changes with job seekers and employees. Using descriptive analysis and a Multinomial Logit Model, we show that from firm's perspective unemployed enrolees are willing to take more concessions in earnings and working terms than they did in the past. This is connected to a behavioural change of the employees, who fear for getting unemployed and for the financial and social risks of this status. The more newly employed persons are willing to take these concessions, the higher the pressure on employees und {{the more likely they are}} willing to take concessions too. We show this with data of business surveys taken in 2005 and 2006, 9. 800 resp. 13. 500 German enterprises participa-ted. In many firms this resulted in a further intensification of work followed by enhanced labour productivity. Nevertheless, macroeconomic data until 2007 show that affected employees were hardly able to enforce their claims concerning higher payment. They are stuck hoping to not lose their jobs, especially in professions, where workers can easily be replaced, meaning the whole scope of underqualified and spheres where a lot of unemployed jobseekers are on the market. Generally, globalization and the restructuring of the economy let expect a further increase of negotiation power of employers in these sectors / professions. So, the differences in individual earnings will grow larger and lead to a hardening of economic and social inequality not only between employed and unemployed persons, but also between employees: Some of them have to renounce a fair payment, just to stay in work. It can be assu-med, that in specific sectors and professions the negotiation power will switch further in favour of employers even in case of increasing labour productivity. For the individual employee this implies a swelling risk not to be able to enforce <b>payment</b> <b>claims.</b> The resulting decrease of promotion prospects, demoralization of individuals and the already observable weakening of labour market dynamics will continually undermine the position of employees. That way economical and social equity as being cornerstones of the german social market economy may lose their importance and therefore their strengths.

40|$|As in any {{commercial}} activity, {{cash flow}} {{is vital for}} the survival of construction businesses. Construction activities take a long time, the products are expensive and the fact that payments are usually made for work already done, makes cash flow and financial status highly dependent on timely payments from the principals. Cash flow constraints of contractors not only result in business failures but also create flow-on effects in the supply chain. In recognition of these effects, most countries including New Zealand have established payment-specific construction industry legislation to ensure a steady flow of cash to project participants. However, payment problems persist within culture and practices, suggesting that industry characteristics may make it difficult to mitigate the problems. It is in this context, that this research investigates payment problems in the New Zealand construction industry with the main focus on exploring feasible solutions to secure payments to construction parties. This research has adopted a sequential mixed-method design consisting of three approaches; preliminary document analyses of liquidators’ reports, and payment disputes heard in the High Court; analysis of a questionnaire survey; and interviews with construction industry practitioners. The data collected through preliminary investigations and an online questionnaire administered to consultants, contractors and subcontractors based in New Zealand was validated and extended using semi-structured interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs). Data analysis techniques employed include: descriptive, inferential statistics and thematic analysis. The findings of the study confirm that payment problems are still prevalent though not as widespread and significant as was the situation before the introduction of the Construction Contracts Act (CCA). The prevalence of payment problems is mainly due to failure to comply with the requirements of the CCA, lack of knowledge and understanding of the Act, and financial strength of industry players. The study found that other main causes were cash flow difficulties due to delays and non-payments experienced on other projects, disputes over <b>payment</b> <b>claims</b> and responses, inadequate fund sourcing and management, the easy exit of players from the industry with little/no liability to creditors, and the general payment culture of the industry. The research revealed that the cost consequences of construction insolvencies are significant and very often there is no security for payment losses due to insolvencies. The research finds that the most appropriate forms of securities include: escrow/trust accounts, principal payment bonds, direct payments/tripartite agreements and retention bonds. Amongst, the use of escrow accounts seems the most appropriate/feasible protection mechanism for held funds (e. g. retention monies). Subcontractors and lower tier parties in the construction supply chain are more impacted by payment difficulties and very often are unable to secure payment from the upper tiers. The cost of a financial security and constructors not being able to influence the upper tiers are found to be two major practical obstacles for obtaining security for payment in New Zealand. The research therefore recommends among others, adjustments to provisions within the CCA and other regulatory documents, changes to registration and pre-qualification of project owners and participants, changes to project administration processes, and general attitudinal changes within the New Zealand construction industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to make a comparative analysis of the operation of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW) (the NSW Act) and the Construction Contracts Act 2002 (NZ) (the NZ Act). Data were extracted from the NSW and NZ Acts, the NSW Department of Commerce and from the published books, reports and articles. Under the NSW Act, which is only concerned with <b>payment</b> <b>claim</b> disputes, adjudicators' jurisdiction is narrow and timelines for the submission of documents and for making an adjudication determination are short. Consequently, <b>payment</b> <b>claim</b> disputes are resolved rapidly and economically. The NZ Act on the other hand addresses all kinds of disputes. The jurisdiction of adjudicators is broad and the period for making an adjudication determination is about twice as long as in NSW. One of the strengths of the NSW Act is the ability to enter judgment for an adjudicated amount by simply filing an adjudication certificate in a court. One of the strengths of the NZ Act is in allowing the claimant to join the owner of a construction site in an adjudication; the adjudicator has a power to determine that the owner, who is an associate of the respondent, is jointly and severally liable with the respondent for the debt, and can approve of a charging order over the construction site owned by the owner.
