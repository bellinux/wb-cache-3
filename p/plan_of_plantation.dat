40|$|The Sloping Land Conversion Program (also {{known as}} "Grain for Green" or the Upland Conversion Program) for {{converting}} cropland to forest {{is one of}} China's most ambitious environmental initiatives, {{and is one of}} the world's largest land-conservation programs with a budget of RMB 337 billion (over US$ 40 billion). Although environmental impacts have played a vital role in the general reasoning and argumentation for forest plantations, environmental impact analyses have often received less attention than economic analyses in the <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> <b>plantation</b> forestry projects. The overall goal of this paper is to evaluate the program's environmental impact considering the farmer's interests and the potential social benefits due to carbon sequestration in different scenarios based on household and field survey data in Dunhua County. Our findings are that: (1) in many cases, the program did not give adequate consideration to land productivity and environmental heterogeneity when selecting plots; (2) more than half of the reforestation plots were on flat cropland (slopes of less than 5 degrees); (3) in five of the eight townships, net incomes on reforested land were substantially above or below previous crop incomes, raising questions about the efficiency of the allocation of compensation to farmers participating in the program; (4) the potential carbon co-benefit increased the NPV of the program by 5954 - 7009 RMB/ha. In conclusion, we recommend that more attention should be paid to the quality of reforestation programs rather than just their scale and note that consideration of potential carbon sequestration co-benefits enhances the benefits of cropland conversion programs.

40|$|In recent decades, the {{establishment}} of short rotation energy plantations is becoming ever more common in marginal sites, including tailing dumps of open pits in mining basins. During the exploitation cycle, not only do short rotation energy plantations produce woody biomass for energy production, but they also accumulate large amounts of carbon from the soil and air. In this case, the energy plantations are primarily environmentally friendly, which is accompanied by their economic importance. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) {{has a number of}} advantages that justify its use in {{the establishment}} <b>of</b> energy <b>plantations.</b> The main objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the current state <b>of</b> energy <b>plantations</b> <b>of</b> black locust established in autumn 2008 on a tailing dump of the »Kolubara« mining basin (Serbia), as well as to determine the yield of dry matter of black locust per hectare. The data on the number of trees, diameter and height increments, the mass of trees per diameter class and the amount of biomass were obtained by the method of partial survey. The survey found a high percentage of survival of black locust seedlings (95. 67 %), the average diameter in the plantation (6. 83 cm), medium tree height (7. 15 m) and the absolute yield of dry matter (2. 96 t/ha/yr). The results of this research on experimental energy plantations will be useful in the <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> future energy <b>plantations</b> in low-productivity sites, as well as in the selection of techniques and technologies for utilization <b>of</b> energy <b>plantations...</b>|$|R

[...] "Sugarcane ethanol and soybean biodiesel each contribute to nearly half of the projected indirect deforestation of 121,970 km2 by 2020, creating a carbon debt that would take about 250 years to be repaid using these biofuels instead of fossil fuels."

40|$|There {{are five}} key reasons why {{biodiversity}} conservation {{should be considered}} a part <b>of</b> <b>plantation</b> management. (1) The plantation estate is large, and balancing various land management values with wood and pulp production is important when extensive areas of land are involved. (2) The locations and management <b>of</b> new <b>plantations</b> will affect the biota that currently exist in such landscapes. (3) Maintaining some elements <b>of</b> biodiversity within <b>plantations</b> can have benefits for stand productivity and the maintenance of key ecosystem processes such as pest control. (4) The retention (or loss) <b>of</b> biota in <b>plantations</b> is relevant to the formulation of ecological standards and the certification <b>of</b> <b>plantations</b> {{in many parts of the}} world. (5) Plantation forestry has a narrow and intensive management focus on producing a forest crop for a limited array of purposes. It will not meet future societal demands for a range <b>of</b> outputs from <b>plantations</b> (in addition to wood and pulp supply), and will not be congruent with the principles of ecological sustainability. This paper briefly reviews the biodiversity conservation values <b>of</b> Australian <b>plantation</b> s. It shows that almost all work in Australian plantations, whether conifer or eucalypt, highlights the importance of landscape heterogeneity and stand structural complexity for enhancing biodiversity. Management <b>of</b> <b>plantations</b> to promote landscape heterogeneity and stand structural complexity and enhance the conservation of biodiversity will, in many cases, involve tradeoffs that will affect wood and pulp production. The extent to which this occurs will depend on the objectives <b>of</b> <b>plantation</b> management and how far they extend towards the more complex plantation forestry models that incorporate social and environmental values. We argue that the widespread adoption <b>of</b> <b>plantation</b> forestry that leads to homogenous stands of extensive monocultures will risk re-creating the array of negative environmental outcomes that have been associated with agriculture in many parts of Australia...|$|R
